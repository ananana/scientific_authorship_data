				<p>We present an empirical study on the use of semantic information for Concept Seg-mentation and Labeling (CSL), which is an important step for semantic parsing. We represent the alternative analyses output by a state-of-the-art CSL parser with tree structures, which we rerank with a classifier trained on two types of semantic tree kernels: one processing structures built with words, concepts and Brown clusters, and another one using semantic similarity among the words composing the structure. The results on a corpus from the restaurant domain show that our semantic kernels exploiting similarity measures out-perform state-of-the-art rerankers.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Spoken Language Understanding aims to inter- pret user utterances and to convert them to logical forms or, equivalently, to database queries, which can then be used to satisfy the user's information needs. This process is known as Concept Segmen- tation and Labeling (CSL), also called semantic parsing in the speech community: it maps utter- ances into meaning representations based on se- mantic constituents. The latter are basically word sequences, often referred to as concepts, attributes or semantic tags. CSL makes it easy to convert spoken questions such as "cheap lebanese restau- rants in doha with take out" into database queries.</p><p>First, a language-specific semantic parser tok- enizes, segments and labels the question: <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  Finally, a database query is formed from the list of labels and values, and is then executed against the database, e.g., MongoDB; a backoff mecha- nism may be used if the query has not succeeded.</p><p>{$and [{cuisine:"lebanese"},{city:"doha"}, {price:"low"},{amenity:"carry out"}]}</p><p>The state-of-the-art of CSL is represented by conditional models for sequence labeling such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) trained with simple morphological and lexical features. The basic CRF model was im- proved by means of reranking ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dinarelli et al., 2012</ref>) using structural ker- nels <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Moschitti, 2006</ref>). Although these meth- ods exploited sentence structure, they did not use syntax at all. More recently, we applied shal- low syntactic structures and discourse parsing with slightly better results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Saleh et al., 2014</ref>). How- ever, the most obvious models for semantic pars- ing, i.e., rerankers based on semantic structural kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b)</ref>, had not been applied to semantic structures yet.</p><p>In this paper, we study the impact of semantic information conveyed by Brown Clusters (BCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown et al., 1992)</ref> and semantic similarity, while also combining them with innovative features. We use reranking, similarly to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Saleh et al., 2014)</ref>, to select the best hypothesis annotated with con- cepts predicted by a local model. The competing hypotheses are represented as innovative trees en- riched with the semantic concepts and BC labels. The trees can capture dependencies between sen- tence constituents, concepts and BCs. However, extracting explicit features from them is rather difficult as their number is exponentially large. Thus, we rely on (i) Support Vector Machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Joachims, 1999</ref>) to train the reranking functions and on (ii) structural kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Moschitti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moschitti, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moschitti, 2013)</ref> to automatically encode tree fragments that represent syntactic and semantic dependencies from words and concepts. We further apply a semantic kernel (SK), namely the Smoothed Partial Tree <ref type="bibr">Kernel (Croce et al., 2011</ref>), which uses the lexical similarity be- tween the tree nodes, while computing the sub- structure space. This is the first time that SKs are applied to reranking hypotheses. This (i) makes the global sentence structure along with concepts available to the learning algorithm, and (ii) enables computing the similarity between lexicals in syn- tactic patterns that are enriched by concepts.</p><p>We tested our models on the Restaurant do- main. Our results show that: (i) The basic CRF parser, which uses semi-Markov CRF, or semi- CRF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004</ref>), is already very accurate; it achieves F 1 scores over 83%, mak- ing any further improvement very hard. (ii) The upper-bound performance of the reranker is very high as well, i.e., the correct annotation is gen- erated in the list of the first 100 hypotheses in 98.72% of the cases. (iii) SKs significantly im- prove over the semi-CRF baseline and our pre- vious state-of-the-art reranker exploiting shallow syntactic patterns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Saleh et al., 2014)</ref>, as shown by extensive comparisons using several systems. (iv) Making BCs effective requires a deeper study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>One of the early approaches to CSL was that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pieraccini et al. (1991)</ref>, where the word se- quences and concepts were modeled using Hid- den Markov Models (HMMs) as observations and hidden states, respectively. Generative models were exploited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Seneff (1989)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Miller et al. (1994)</ref>, who used stochastic grammars for CSL. Other discriminative models followed such preliminary work, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rubinstein and Hastie, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Santafé et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Raymond and Riccardi, 2007)</ref>. CRF-based models are considered to be the state of the art in CSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(De Mori et al., 2008</ref>).</p><p>Another relevant line of research are the seman- tic kernels, i.e., kernels that use lexical similarity between features. One of the first that applyed LSA was ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cristianini et al., 2002</ref>), whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bloehdorn et al., 2006;</ref>) used Word- Net. Semantic structural kernels of the type we use in this paper were first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b)</ref>. The most advanced model based on tree kernels, which we also use in this paper, is the Smoothed PTK (Croce et al., 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Reranking for CSL</head><p>Reranking is applied to a list of N annotation hy- potheses, which are generated and sorted by the probability to be globally correct as estimated us- ing local classifiers or global classifiers that only use local features. Then, a reranker, typically a meta-classifier, tries to select the best hypothe- sis from the list. The reranker can exploit global information, and specifically, the dependencies between the different concepts, which are made available by the local model. We use semi-CRFs for the local model as they yield the highest ac- curacy in CSL (when using a single model) and preference reranking for the global reranker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preference Reranking (PR)</head><p>PR uses a classifier C, which takes a pair of hy- potheses H i , H j and decides whether H i is bet- ter than H j . Given a training question Q, posi- tive and negative examples are built for training the classifier. Let H 1 be the hypothesis with the lowest error rate with respect to the gold standard among all hypotheses generated for question Q. We adopt the following approach for example gen- eration: the pairs H 1 , H i (i = 2, 3, . . . , N ) are positive examples, while H i , H 1 are considered negative.</p><p>At testing time, given a new question Q , C clas- sifies all pairs H i , H j generated from the anno- tation hypotheses of Q : a positive classification is a vote for H i , otherwise the vote is for H j , where the classifier score can be used as a weighted vote. H k are then ranked according to the number (sum) of the votes (weighted by score) they receive.</p><p>We build our reranker with SVMs using the following kernel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K(H 1 , H 2 , H 1 , H 2 ) = φ(H 1 , H 2 ) · φ(H 1 , H 2 ) φ(H 1 ) − φ(H 2 ) · φ(H 1 ) − φ(H 2 ) = φ(H 1 )φ(H 1 ) + φ(H 2 )φ(H 2 ) − φ(H 1 )φ(H 2 ) − φ(H 2 )φ(H 1 ) = S(H 1 , H 1 ) + S(H 2 , H 2 ) − S(H 1 , H 2 ) − S(H 2 , H 1 ).</formula><p>We consider H as a tuple T, v com- posed of a tree T and a feature vector v. Then, we define S(H, H ) = S TK (T, T ) + S v ( v, v ), where S TK computes one of the tree kernel functions defined in 3.2 and 3.3; and S v is a kernel (see 3.4), e.g., linear, polynomial, Gaussian, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tree kernels (TKs)</head><p>TKs measure the similarity between two structures in terms of the number of substructures they share. We use two types of tree kernels: (i) Partial Tree Kernel (PTK), which can be effectively applied to both constituency and dependency parse trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Moschitti, 2006</ref>). It generates all possible con- nected tree fragments, e.g., sibling nodes can be also separated and can be part of different tree fragments: a fragment is any possible tree path, and other tree paths are allowed to depart from its nodes. Thus, it can generate a very rich feature space. (ii) The smoothed PTK or semantic kernel (SK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Croce et al., 2011</ref>), which extends PTK by allowing soft matching (i.e., via similarity compu- tation) between nodes associated with different but related lexical items. The node similarity can be derived from manually annotated resources, e.g., WordNet or Wikipedia, as well as using corpus- based clustering approaches, e.g., latent semantic analysis (LSA), as we do in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Semantic structures</head><p>Tree kernels allow us to compute structural simi- larities between two trees; thus, we engineered a special structure for the CSL task. In order to cap- ture the structural dependencies between the se- mantic tags, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> we use a basic tree (see for exam- ple <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a)</ref>, where the words of a sentence are tagged with their semantic tags.</p><p>More specifically, the words in the sentence constitute the leaves of the tree, which are in turn connected to the pre-terminals containing the semantic tags in BIO notation ('B'=begin, 'I'=inside, 'O'=outside). The BIO tags are then generalized in the upper level, and joined to the Root node. Additionally, part-of-speech (POS) tags 2 are added to each word by concatenating it with the string "::L", where L is the first let- ter of the POS-tags of the words, e.g., along, my and route, receive i, p and n, which are the first letters of the POS-tags IN, PRN and NN, respec- tively. SK applied to the above structure can gen- erate powerful semantic patterns such as [Root [4-Cuisine [similar to(stake house)]][7-Loc [simi- lar to(within a mile)]]], e.g., for correctly labeling new clauses like Pizza Parlor in three kilometers. The BC labels, represented as cluster IDs, are sim- ply added as siblings of words as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Feature Vectors</head><p>For the sake of comparison, we also devoted some effort towards engineering a set of features to be used in a flat feature-vector representation. These features can be used in isolation to learn the reranking function, or in combination with the kernel-based approach (as a composite kernel us- ing a linear combination). They belong to the fol- lowing four categories: (i) CRF-based: these in- clude the basic features used to train the initial semi-CRF model; (ii) n-gram based: we collected 3-and 4-grams of the output label sequence at the level of concepts, with artificial tags inserted to identify the start ('S') and end ('E') of the se- quence. 3 (iii) Probability-based, computing the probability of the label sequence as an average of the probabilities at the word level in the N -best list; and (iv) DB-based: a single feature encoding the number of results returned from the database when constructing a query using the conjunction of all semantic segments in the hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>The experiments aim at investigating the role of feature vectors, PTK, SK and BCs in reranking. We first describe the experimental setting and then we move into the analysis of the results.</p><p>Train Devel.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental setup</head><p>Dataset. In our experiments, we used questions annotated with semantic tags, which were col- lected through crowdsourcing on Amazon Me- chanical Turk and made available 4 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">McGraw et al. (2012)</ref>. We split the dataset into training, de- velopment and test sets. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the num- ber of examples and example pairs we used for the semi-CRF and the reranker, respectively. We subsequently split the training data randomly into 10 folds. We used cross-validation, i.e., iteratively training with 9 folds and annotating the remaining fold, in order to generate the N -best lists of hy- potheses for the entire training dataset. We com- puted the 100-best hypotheses for each example.</p><p>We then used the development dataset to test and tune the hyper-parameters of our reranking model. The results on the development set, which we will present in Section 4.2 below, were obtained us- ing semi-CRF and reranking models trained on the training set. Data representation. Each hypothesis is repre- sented by a semantic tree, a feature vector (ex- plained in Section 3), and two extra features: (i) the semi-CRF probability of the hypothesis, and (ii) its reciprocal rank in the N -best list. Learning algorithm. We used the SVM-Light- TK 5 to train the reranker with a combination of tree kernels and feature vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Moschitti, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Joachims, 1999)</ref>. We used the default parameters and a linear kernel for the feature vectors. As a baseline, we picked the best-scoring hypothesis in the list, i.e., the output by the regular semi-CRF parser. The setting is exactly the same as that de- scribed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Saleh et al., 2014</ref>). Evaluation measure. In all experiments, we used the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F 1 ) (van <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rijsbergen, 1979</ref>), computed at the token level and micro-averaged across the different se- mantic types. 6 N 1 2 5 10 100 F1 83.03 87.76 92.63 95.23 98.72 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Oracle F 1 score for N -best lists.</p><p>Brown Clusters. Clustering groups of similar words together provides a way of generalizing them. In this work, we explore the use of Brown clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown et al., 1992</ref>) in both feature vec- tors and tree kernels. The Brown clustering al- gorithm uses an n-gram class model. It first as- signs each word to a distinct cluster, and then it merges different clusters in a bottom-up fashion. The merge step is done in a way that minimizes the loss in average mutual information between clus- ters. The outcome is hierarchical clustering, which we use in our reranking algorithm. To create the Brown clusters, we used the Yelp dataset of re- views. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> It contains 335,022 reviews about 15,585 businesses; 5,575 of the businesses and 233,839 of the reviews are restaurant-related.

We compute the lexi- cal similarity for SK by applying LSA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Furnas et al., 1988)</ref> to Tripadvisor data. The dataset and the exact procedure for creating the LSA matrix are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Castellucci et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Croce and Previtali, 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>Oracle accuracy. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the oracle F 1 score for N -best lists of different lengths, i.e., the F 1 that is achieved by picking the best candidate in the N -best list for various values of N . Con- sidering 5-best lists yields an increase in oracle F 1 of almost ten absolute points. Going up to 10-best lists only adds 2.5 extra F 1 points. The complete 100-best lists add 3.5 extra F 1 points, for a total of 98.72. This very high value is explained by the fact that often the total number of different anno- tations for a given question is smaller than 100. In our experiments, we will focus on 5-best lists. Baseline accuracy. We computed F 1 for the semi- CRF model on both the development and the test sets, obtaining 83.86 and 83.03, respectively. Learning Curves. The semantic information in terms of BCs or semantic similarity derived by LSA can have a major impact in case of data scarcity. Therefore, we trained our reranking mod- els with increasing sizes of training data.  The first two graphs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> show the plots on the development set whereas the last two are computed on the test set. The reranking models reported are Baseline, PTK, PTK+BC, PTK+all (features), PTK+BC+all, SK, SK+BC, SK+all and SK+BC+all. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We can see that: (i) PTK alone, i.e., without semantic information, has the lowest ac- curacy; (ii) BCs do not improve significantly any model; (iii) SK almost always achieves the high- est accuracy; (iv) PTK+all (i.e., the model also us- ing features) improves on PTK, but its accuracy is lower than for any model using SK, i.e., us- ing semantic similarity; and (v) all features pro- vide an initial boost to SK, but as soon as the data increases, their impact decreases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In summary, the learning curves clearly show the good generalization ability of SK, which improve the CRF baseline using little data (∼3,000). The semantic kernel significantly improves over the semi-CRF baseline and our previous state-of-the- art reranker exploiting shallow syntactic patterns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Saleh et al., 2014)</ref>, which corresponds to PTK+all in the above comparison.</p><p>8 Models are split between 2 plots in order to ease reading.</p><p>The improvement falls between 1-2 absolute percent points. This is remarkable as (i) it corre- sponds to ∼10% relative error reduction, and (ii) the state-of-the-art baseline system is very difficult to beat, as confirmed by the low impact of tradi- tional features and BCs. Although the latter can generalize over concepts and words, their use is not straightforward, resulting in no improvement.</p><p>In the future, we plan to investigate the use of semantic similarity from distributional and other sources ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mihalcea et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Padó and Lapata, 2007)</ref>, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007)</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: CSL structures: standard and with Brown Clusters.</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="2,42.89,135.56,503.42,62.37" type="bitmap" /></figure>
