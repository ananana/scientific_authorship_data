				<p>Dialects are one of the main drivers of language variation, a major challenge for natural language processing tools. In most languages, dialects exist along a continuum, and are commonly discretized by combining the extent of several preselected linguistic variables. However , the selection of these variables is theory-driven and itself insensitive to change. We use Doc2Vec on a corpus of 16.8M anonymous online posts in the German-speaking area to learn continuous document representations of cities. These representations capture continuous regional linguistic distinctions, and can serve as input to downstream NLP tasks sensitive to regional variation. By incorporating geographic information via retrofitting and ag-glomerative clustering with structure, we recover dialect areas at various levels of gran-ularity. Evaluating these clusters against an existing dialect map, we achieve a match of up to 0.77 V-score (harmonic mean of cluster completeness and homogeneity). Our results show that representation learning with retrofitting offers a robust general method to automatically expose dialectal differences and regional variation at a finer granularity than was previously possible.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>People actively use dialects to mark their re- gional origin <ref type="bibr">(Shoemark et al., 2017a,b)</ref>, making them one of the main drivers of language varia- tion. Accounting for this variation is a challenge for NLP systems (see for example the failed at- tempts of people with accents trying to use dia- logue systems. Accounting for variation can sig- nificantly improve performance in machine trans- lation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mirkin and Meunier, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Östling and Tiedemann, 2017)</ref>, geolocation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rahimi et al., 2017a</ref>,b) and help personalize applications and search.</p><p>However, regional variation involves a com- plex set of grammatical, lexical, and phonologi- cal features, all of them continuously changing. Consequently, dialects are not static discrete en- tities, but exist along a continuum in most lan- guages. Variational linguistics and dialectology typically discretize this continuum by using a set of preselected features <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Trudgill, 2000</ref>), often in- cluding outdated vocabulary. The resulting di- alect areas are highly accurate, but extremely time- consuming to construct and inflexible (the largest and to date most comprehensive evaluation of Ger- man dialects, the Wenker-Atlas ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rabanus et al., 2010</ref>) is almost 150 years old and took decades to complete). Work in dialectometry has shown that computational methods, such as clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Proki´cProki´c and Nerbonne, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Szmrecsanyi, 2008</ref>, inter alia) and dimen- sionality reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Nerbonne et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shackleton Jr, 2005</ref>) can instead be used to identify di- mensions of variation in manually constructed dis- crete feature vectors. However, the success of such approaches depends on precise prior knowledge of variation features <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lameli, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Distributed representations, as unsupervised methods, can complement these methods by cap- turing similarities between words and documents (here: cities) along various latent dimensions, in- cluding syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic as- pects. These representations are therefore more compact, less susceptible to data sparsity than la- tent variable models, and allow us to represent a large number of possible clusters than feature- based representations (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luong et al. (2013)</ref>). These properties also allow us to measure similar- ities on a continuous scale, which makes represen-tation learning especially useful for the study of regional language variation along several linguis- tic dimensions.</p><p>We use a corpus of 16.8 million anonymous German online posts, cast cities as document la- bels, and induce document embeddings for these cities via Doc2Vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Le and Mikolov, 2014</ref>). We first show that the resulting city embeddings cap- ture regional linguistic variation at a more fine- grained, continuous regional distinction than pre- vious approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bamman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Östling and Tiedemann, 2017)</ref>, which operated at a state or language level. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We also show that the embed- dings can serve as input to a geolocation task, out- performing a bag-of-words model, and producing competitive results.</p><p>However, such representations are susceptible to linguistic data bias, ignore geographic factors, and are hard to evaluate with respect to their fit with existing linguistic distinctions. We address these problems by including geographic informa- tion via retrofitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Faruqui et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hovy and Fornaciari, 2018)</ref>: we use administrative re- gion boundaries to modify the city embeddings, and evaluate the resulting vectors in a clustering approach to discover larger dialect regions.</p><p>In contrast to most dialectometric approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nerbonne et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Proki´cProki´c and Nerbonne, 2008)</ref>, and in line with common NLP practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Doyle, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grieve, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rahimi et al., 2017a</ref>), we also evaluate the clus- tered dialect areas quantitatively. Rather than testing the geographic extent of individual words against known dialect areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Doyle, 2014)</ref>, we compare the match of entire geographic regions to a recent German dialect map <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lameli, 2013)</ref>. We use cluster evaluation metrics to measure how well our clusters match the known dialect regions.</p><p>The results show that our method automatically captures existing (manually determined) dialect distinctions well, and even goes beyond them in that it also allows for a more fine-grained qual- itative analysis. Our research shows that repre- sentation learning is well suited to the study of language variation, and demonstrates the poten- tial of incorporating non-linguistic information via retrofitting. For an application of our methodol- ogy to a larger Twitter data set over multiple lan- guages, see <ref type="bibr">(Hovy et al., In Preparation)</ref>.</p><p>Contributions In this paper, we make the fol- lowing contributions to linguistic insights, perfor- mance improvements, and algorithmic contribu- tions. We show:</p><p>1. how Doc2Vec can be used to learn distributed representations of cities that capture contin- uous regional linguistic variation. The ap- proach is general and can be applied to other languages and data sets;</p><p>2. that the city representations capture enough distinction to produce competitive results in geolocation, even this was not the main fo- cus;</p><p>3. that retrofitting can be used to incorporate geographic information into the embeddings, extending the original algorithm's applica- tions;</p><p>4. that the clusterings match with a sociolin- guistic dialect map <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lameli, 2013)</ref>, measur- ing their homogeneity, completeness, and their harmonic mean (V-measure), and reach a V-measure of 0.77, beating an informed baseline;</p><p>We publicly release the data, code, and map files for future research at https://github.com/Bocconi- NLPLab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Source</head><p>We use data from the social media app Jodel, 2 a mobile chat application that lets people anony- mously talk to other users within a 10km-radius around them. The app was first published in 2014, and has seen substantial growth since its begin- ning. It has several million users in the German- speaking area (GSA), and is expanding to France, Italy, Scandinavia, Spain, and lately the United States. Users can post and answer to posts within the radius around their own current location. All users are anonymous. Answers to an initial post are organized in threads. The vast majority of posts in Jodel are written in standard German, but since it is conceptually spoken langauge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Koch and Oesterreicher, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Eisenstein, 2013)</ref>, re- gional and dialectal forms are common, especially in Switzerland, Austria, and rural areas in South- ern Germany. The data therefore reflects current developments in language dynamics to mark re- gionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Purschke, 2018)</ref>. We used a publicly available API to collect data between April and June 2017 from 123 ini- tial locations: 79 German cities with a popula- tion over 100k people, all 17 major cities in Aus- tria ("Mittel-und Oberzentren"), and 27 cities in Switzerland (the 26 cantonal capitals plus Lugano in the very south of the Italian-speaking area). Due to the 10km radius, posts from other nearby cities get collected as well. We include these additional cities if they have more than 200 threads, thereby growing the total number of locations. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Ulti- mately, this results in 408 cities <ref type="bibr">(333 in Germany, 27</ref> in Austria, 48 in Switzerland). The resulting lo- cations are spread relatively evenly across the en- tire GSA, albeit with some gaps in parts of Ger- many with low population density. In total, we collect 2.3 million threads, or 16.8 million posts.</p><p>We treat each thread as a document in our rep- resentation learning setup, labeled with the name of the city in which the thread took place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Preprocessing</head><p>We preprocess the data to minimize vocabulary size, while maintaining regional discriminative power. We lowercase the input and restrict our- selves to content words, based on the part-of- speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and proper names), using the spacy 4 tagger.</p><p>Prior studies showed that many regionally- distributed content words are topically driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Eisenstein et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Salehi et al., 2017)</ref>. Peo- ple talk more about their own region than about others, so the most indicative words include place names (the own city, or specific places within that city), and other local culture terms, such as sports teams. We try to minimize the effect of such re- gional topics, by excluding all named entities, as well as the names of all cities in our list, to instead focus on dialectal lexical variation.</p><p>We use NLTK 5 to remove German stop words, and to lemmatize the words. While this step re- moves the inflectional patterns found in German, which could have regional differences, we fo- cus here on lexical differences, and lemmatization greatly reduces vocabulary size, leading to bet-ter representations. While both POS-tagging and NER can introduce noise, they are more flexible and exhaustive than pre-defined word lists. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Fi- nally, we concatenate collocations based on the PMI of the adjacent words in the cleaned corpus. The average instance length is about 40 words af- ter cleaning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data Statement</head><p>The corpus was selected to represent informal, ev- eryday online speech across the German-speaking area in Europe, and to capture regional distinc- tions. The data was acquired via the publicly avail- able API. The language is mainly standard Ger- man, but with a substantial amount of dialectal en- tries, mainly from southern German varieties, as well as some French and Italian, which could not be removed without losing dialect. The platform is anonymous, but mainly used by young people, as indicated by a prevalence of college-related topics. It contains spontaneous, written, asynchronous in- teractions in a chat platform organized by threads. Anonymous reference to prior interlocutors is pos- sible. The app is mainly used to discuss everyday topics, entertainment, flirting, venting, and infor- mal surveys. To learn both word and city representations, we use the Doc2Vec implementation of para-graph2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Le and Mikolov, 2014</ref>) in gensim. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The model is conceptually similar to <ref type="bibr">word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>), but also learns document label representations (in our case city names), em- bedded in the same space as the words. We use distributed bag-of-words (DBOW) training. The model parameters are fitted by predicting ran- domly sampled context words from a city vector. The objective is to maximize the log probability of the prediction,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Visualization</head><p>In order to examine whether the city embeddings capture the continuous nature of dialects, we visu- alize them. If our assumption holds, we expect to see gradual continuous change between cities and regions.</p><p>We use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on the 300-dimensional city representation matrix to find the first three principal components, normalize them each to values 0.0-1.0 and inter- pret those as RGB values. 8 I.e., we assume the first principal component signals the amount of red, the second component the amount of green, and the third component the amount of blue. This triple can be translated into a single color value. E.g., 0.5 red, 0.5 green, and 0.5 blue translates The result is indeed a continuous color gradi- ent over the cities over 200 threads, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The circle size for every city indicates the relative number of threads per location.</p><p>In order to get reliable statistics, we restrict our- selves to cities with more than 200 observed con- versations (about 2.1M conversations: 1.82M in Germany, 173k in Austria, and 146k in Switzer- land). Including cities with fewer conversations adds more data points, but induces noise, as many of those representations are based on too little data, resulting in inaccurate vectors.</p><p>Even without in-depth linguistic analysis, we can already see differences between Switzerland (green color tones) and the rest of the GSA. Within Switzerland, we see a distinction between the Ger- man (lighter green) and the French-speaking area around Lausanne and Geneva (darker tones). On the other hand, we find a continuous transition from red over purple to bluish colors in Ger- many and Austria. These gradients largely cor- respond to the dimensions North→South(East): red→blue and West→East: intense tones →pale tones. These dimensions mirror the well-known strong linguistic connection between the southeast of Germany and Austria, and between most cities in the north of Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Clustering</head><p>The visualization in the last section already sug- gests that we capture the German dialect contin- uum, and the existence of larger dialect areas. However, in order to evaluate against existing di- alect maps, we need to discretize the continuous representation. We use hierarchical agglomerative clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ward Jr, 1963</ref>) with Ward linkage, Eu- clidean affinity, and structure to discover dialect areas. We compare the agglomerative clustering results to a k-means approach.</p><p>Agglomerative clustering starts with each city in its own cluster, and recursively merges pairs into larger clusters, until we have reached the re- quired number. Pairs are chosen to minimize the increase in linkage distance (for Ward linkage, this measure is the new cluster's variance). We use cities with 50-199 threads (66 cities) to tune the clustering parameters (linkage function and affin- ity), and report results obtained on cities with more than 200 threads.</p><p>Since the city representations are indirectly based on the words used in the respective cities, the clustering essentially captures regional simi- larity in vocabulary. If the clusters we find in our data match existing dialect distinctions, this pro- vides a compelling argument for the applicability of our methodology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Including geographic knowledge</head><p>While we capture regional variation by means of linguistic similarities here, it does include a geo- graphic component as well. The embeddings we learn do not include this component, though. This can produce undesirable clustering results. Large cities, due to their "melting-pot" function, often use similar language, so their representations are close in embedding space. This is an example of Galton's problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Naroll, 1961)</ref>: Munich and Berlin are not linguistically similar because they belong to the same dialect, but due to some out- side factor (in this case, shared vocabulary through migration).</p><p>To address geography, we experiment with two measures: clustering with structure, and retrofitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Faruqui et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hovy and Fornaciari, 2018</ref>).</p><p>Structure To introduce geographic structure into clustering, we use a connectivity matrix over the inverse distance between cities (i.e., geograph- ically close cities have a higher number), which is used as weight during the merging. This weight makes close geographic neighbors more likely to be merged before distant cities are.</p><p>Note, though, that this geographic component does not predetermine the clustering outcome: ge- ographically close cities that are linguistically dif- ferent still end up in separate clusters, as we will see. The Spearman ρ correlation between the geo- graphic distance and the cosine-similarity of cities is positive, but does not fully explain the simi- larities (Austria 0.40, Germany 0.42, Switzerland 0.72). The stronger correlation for Switzerland suggests a localized effect of regional varieties. Geographic structure in clustering does, however, provide speedups, regional stability, and more sta- ble clustering solutions than unstructured cluster- ing. We will see this in comparison to k-means.</p><p>Retrofitting Faruqui et al. <ref type="formula">(2015)</ref> introduced retrofitting of vectors based on external knowl- edge. We take the idea proposed for word vec- tors and semantic resources and extend it follow- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hovy and Fornaciari (2018)</ref> to apply it to city representations and membership in geographic re- gions. We construct a set Ω with tuples of cities (c i , c j ) such that there exists a region R where c i ∈ R and c j ∈ R. We use the NUTS2 regions (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, a EuroStats geocoding standard) to determine R. In Germany, NUTS2 has 39 regions, corresponding to government regions. To include the geographic knowledge, we retrofit the existing city embeddings C. The goal is to make the representations of cities that are in the same region more similar to each other than to cities in other regions, resulting in a retrofit em- beddings matrixˆCmatrixˆ matrixˆC. For a retrofit city vectorˆcvectorˆ vectorˆc i , the update equation isˆc isˆ isˆc i = αc i + β j:(i,j)∈Ωˆc∈Ωˆ ∈Ωˆc j N wherê c i is the original city vector, and α and β are tradeoff parameters to control the influence of the geographic vs. the linguistic information. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Faruqui et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hovy and Fornaciari (2018)</ref> for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>In order to evaluate our methodology, we measure both its ability to match German dialect distinc- tions, and the performance of the learned embed- dings in a downstream geolocation task. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> provides examples of different cluster- ing solutions after retrofitting. Note that colors are assigned randomly and do not correspond to the linguistic similarity from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Switzer- land immediately forms a separate cluster (the 2-cluster solution separates Switzerland vs. ev- erything else), and further clusters first separate out more southern German varieties before dis- tinguishing the northern varieties. This is in line with sociolinguistic findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Plewnia and Rothe, 2012</ref>) about ubiquity of dialect use (more common in the south, therefore more varied regions, re- flected in our clustering). Due to space constraints, we have to omit further clustering stages, but find linguistically plausible solutions beyond the ones shown here. For an in-depth qualitative analysis of the different clustering solutions and the socio- demographic and linguistic factors, see Purschke and Hovy (In Preparation).</p><p>Dialect match We use the map of German di- alects and their regions by Lameli (2013) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 4)</ref> and its 14 large-scale areas <ref type="bibr">9</ref> as gold stan- dard to measure how well the various clustering- solutions correspond to the dialect boundaries. This map is based on empirical quantitative analy- sis of German dialects, albeit based on data from the 19th century, and therefore naturally on differ- ent domains and media than our study.</p><p>Note that we can only assess the cities within modern-day Germany (clusters formed in Austria or Switzerland are not covered). We therefore re- run the clusterings on the subset of German cities, so results differ slightly from the clusters induced  on the entire GSA. We report homogeneity (whether a cluster con- tains only data points from a single region) and completeness (how many data points of a NUTS region are in the same cluster), as well as their har- monic mean, the V-score. This corresponds to pre- cision/recall/F1 scores used in classification. Note that we will not be able to faithfully reconstruct Lameli's distinctions, since Lameli's map contains overlapping regions, whose data points therefore already violate perfect homogeneity.</p><p>The outline of dialect regions in Lameli's map is based on the NUTS2 regions, so we compare all clustering solutions to an informed baseline that assigns each city the NUTS2 region it is located in. Except for regions in dialect overlaps, each NUTS region is completely contained in one dialect re- gion, so the baseline can achieve almost perfect homogeneity.</p><p>Downstream task geolocation For the geoloca- tion task, we randomly select 100 cities with at least 200 threads from each country (7 in Aus- tria, 82 in Germany, 11 in Switzerland). We then collect threads with at least 100 words from these cities for each country (11,240 threads from Austria, 137,081 from Germany, and 18,590 from Switzerland). Each thread is a training instance, i.e., we have 166,911 instances. We use the Doc2Vec model from before to induce a document representation for each instance and use the vector as input to a logistic regression model that predicts the city name.</p><p>For testing, we sample 5,000 threads from the same cities (maintaining the same proportional distribution and word count constraint), but from a separate data set, collected two months after the original sample. We again use the Doc2Vec model to induce representations, and evaluate the classi- fier on this data.</p><p>We measure accuracy, accuracy at 161km (100 miles), and the median distance between pre- diction and target.</p><p>We compare the model with Doc2Vec representations to a bag-of-words (BOW) model with the same parameters. Since the representation here is based on words, we can not apply retrofitting. As baseline, we report the most-frequent city prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Dialect match <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the results of clus- tering solutions up to 20 clusters for both retrofit and original embeddings. Irrespective of the clus- tering approach, retrofit representations perform markedly better.</p><p>Homogeneity increases substantially the more clusters we induce (in the limit, each data point be- comes a single cluster, resulting in perfect homo- geneity), whereas completeness decreases slightly with more clusters (they increase the likelihood that a region is split up into several clusters). We achieve the best V-score, 0.77, with 16 clusters.</p><p>Averaged k-means (over 5 runs) is much less consistent, due to random initialization, but pre- sumably also because it cannot incorporate the ge- ographic information. For few clusters, its perfor- mance is better than agglomerative clustering, but as the number of clusters increases (and the ge- ographic distribution of the cities becomes more intricate), k-means stops improving.</p><p>The baseline achieves almost perfect homo- geneity, as expected (the only outliers are NUTS regions in overlap areas). Completeness is lower than almost all clustering solutions, though. The V-score, 0.74, is therefore lower than the best clus- tering solution.</p><p>Both the cluster evaluation metrics and the vi- sual correspondence suggest that our method cap- tures regional variation at a lexical level well.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table  2</ref> shows the results of the geolocation down- stream task. Despite the fact that the representa- tion learning setup was not designed for this task and excluded all the most informative words for it ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Salehi et al., 2017)</ref>, the induced embeddings capture enough pertinent regional differences to achieve reasonable performance (albeit slightly below state of the art, which typically has a median distance around 100km, and an accuracy@161 of 0.54, see cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rahimi et al. (2017b)</ref>) and decidedly outperform the BOW model and most-frequent- city baseline on all measures.</p></div>

The closest seven words are all Austrian di- alect words</p><p>Because both words and cities are represented in the same embeddings space (at least before retrofitting), we can compare the vectors of cities to each other (asking: which cities are linguisti- cally most similar to each other, which is what we have done above) and words to cities (asking: which words are most similar to/indicative of a city). The latter allows us to get a qualitative sense of how descriptive the words are for each city. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows an example of word and city similarity for the city representation of Vienna.</p><p>We can also use the cluster centroid of several city vectors to represent entire regions. The new vector no longer represents a real location, but is akin to the theoretic linguistic center of a dialect region. We can then find the most similar words to this centroid. For the solution with 3 clusters (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3)</ref>, we get the solutions in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. As expected, the regional prototypes do not overlap, but feature dialectal expressions in the south, and general standard German expressions in the north.</p><p>Again, for an in-depth qualitative analysis and discussion of the socio-linguistic correlations, see Purschke and Hovy (In Preparation).</p></div>

Most of these papers focus on downstream perfor- mance that accounts for regional variation, rather than on explicitly modeling variation. We include a downstream performance, but also evaluate the cluster composition quantitatively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We use representation learning, structured clus- tering, and geographic retrofitting on city embed- dings to study regional linguistic variation in Ger- man. Our approach captures gradual linguistic dif- ferences, and matches an existing German dialect map, achieving a V-score of 0.77. The learned city embeddings also capture enough regional dis- tinction serve as input to a downstream geoloca- tion task, outperforming a BOW baseline and pro- ducing competitive results. Our findings indicate that city embeddings capture regional linguistic variation, which can be further enriched with ge- ographic information via retrofitting. They also suggest that traditional ideas of regionality persist online. Our methodology is general enough to be applied to other languages that lack dialect maps (e.g., Switzerland), and to other tasks studying re- gional variation. We publicly release our data and code.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Doc2vec model example for window size 4.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,318.19,473.08,196.43,131.79" type="bitmap" /></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Han et al. (2014) has used city-level representations, but have not applied them to the identification of dialect areas.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> https://jodel.com/</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> The number of threads differs widely even between cities, ranging from dozens to over 40k in cities like Munich, Vienna, or Berlin. 4 https://spacy.io/ 5 http://www.nltk.org/</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> Note that stopwords and place names are more reliably detected in their standard form than in regional variants of abbreviations, meaning the standard forms are more reliably excluded if posts are written in High German, than if posts are written in dialect. This may lead to higher coherence for regions with a higher amount of non-standard tokens (as in Switzerland), thereby actually supporting our goal of detecting regional variation.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ models/doc2vec.html 8 Note that instead learning 3-dimensional embeddings would not amount to the same, as those are likely not equivalent of the three first principal components, and thus not as useful. 300 dimensions capture other degrees of variation, increasing the chance to capture meaningful latent dimensions.</note>
