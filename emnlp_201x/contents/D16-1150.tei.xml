				<p>In this paper, we present a study on per-sonalized emphasis framing which can be used to tailor the content of a message to enhance its appeal to different individuals. With this framework, we directly model content selection decisions based on a set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal traits including personality (e.g., extraversion) and basic human values (e.g., self-transcendence). We also demonstrate how the analysis results can be used in automated personalized content selection for persuasive message generation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Persuasion is an integral part of our personal and professional lives. The topic of generating per- suasive messages has been investigated in different fields with varied focuses. Psychologists focus on the cognitive, social and emotional processes of a persuader and a persuadee to understand what makes a communication persuasive <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hovland et al., 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Petty and Cacioppo, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Smith and Petty, 1996)</ref>. Marketing researchers are interested in applying the- ories of persuasion in promoting consumer products <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Szybillo and Heslin, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Han and Shavitt, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Campbell and Kirmani, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kirmani and Campbell, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hirsh et al., 2012</ref>). Natural Language Generation (NLG) researchers are inter- ested in studying the relation between language us- age and persuasion in order to build automated sys- tems that produce persuasive messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Guerini et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Reiter et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>It is also generally believed that persuasion is more effective when it is custom-tailored to reflect the interests and concerns of the intended audience ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Noar et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dijkstra, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hirsh et al., 2012)</ref>. A proven tailoring tactic commonly used by politicians, marketing executives, as well as public health advocators is content framing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Meyerowitz and Chaiken, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Maheswaran and Meyers-Levy, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grewal et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rothman and Salovey, 1997</ref>). Previous framing research has mainly fo- cused on two types of framing strategies: empha- sis framing and equivalence framing. To emphasis frame a message is to simplify reality by focusing on a subset of the aspects of a situation or an issue and make them more prominent in a communication to promote certain definition, causal interpretation and moral evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Entman and Rojecki, 1993)</ref>. For example, in political debating, the topic of nuclear energy can be framed as an economic development issue, a safety issue or an environmental issue. In marketing, the same car can be framed as a low cost car, a performance car, or a green car. With differ- ent framing strategies, the authors try to appeal to individuals with different beliefs and concerns. In contrast, equivalence framing focuses on presenting content as either loss-framed or gain-framed mes- sages. For example, a smoking cessation message can employ a gain-frame like "You will live longer if you quit smoking", or a loss-frame such as "You will die sooner if you do not quit smoking". Even though the messages are equivalent factually, the frames can influence a receiver's behavior either to encourage a desirable behavior or to avoid an unwanted outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tversky and Kahneman, 1981)</ref>. In this study, we focus on personalized emphasis framing which se- lectively emphasize the aspects of an entity (e.g., a car) to enhance its appeal to a given receiver.</p><p>Using emphasis framing as the framework for personalized content selection, we can take ad- vantage of rich findings in prior framing re- search that link content selection decisions to a set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal characteristics.</p><p>This has made our work more generalizable than those relying on application-specific user characteristics (e.g., use an individual's smoking habit to tailor a smoke ces- sation message). Since content framing is a part of the content determination process, the model we propose is a part of the content planner in a Natu- ral Language Generation (NLG) system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Reiter and Dale, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>There are three main contributions of this work.</p><p>1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ef- fort in building an automated model of empha- sis framing for personalized persuasive mes- sage generation.</p><p>2. We made content selection decisions based on a set of psychologically-motivated application- independent user traits, such as personality and basic human values, which makes our work more generalizable than those relying on domain-specific user characteristics and prefer- ences.</p><p>3. We propose a cascade content selection model that integrates personalized content selection patterns in automated persuasive message gen- eration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In the following, we summarize the research that is most relevant to our work including prior psychol- ogy and communication studies that link emphasis framing with personal traits. Since building com- putational models of emphasis framing was not the primary goal in these studies, we also include litera- ture on personalized Natural Language Generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Emphasis framing and Personal Traits</head><p>There is a large body of social, marketing and com- munication theories on framing effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zaller, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zaller and Feldman, 1992)</ref> point out that framing essentially reorganizes information to in- crease accessibility of an issue dimension by high- lighting one cognitive path that had previously been in the dark. Others argue that the framing effect is due to a change in the rank order of the values as- sociated with different aspects through the interac- tion with the content found within a message <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nelson et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chong and Druckman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jacoby, 2000</ref>). The human decisions are controlled partly by the formulation of the problem and partly by the norms, habits, and personal characteristics of the decision-maker ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tversky and Kahneman, 1981)</ref>. Although most research agrees that the character- istics of a receiver play an important role in fram- ing effectiveness, there is a significant disagreement in what characteristics of a receiver result in fram- ing effects. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson, 2010)</ref> states that people with prior attitudes toward an issue can be influenced by frames, while Slothuus <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Slothuus, 2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Tabor et al. (Taber et al., 2009</ref>) did not find a framing effect for those with strong values as- sociated with an issue prior to exposure to the frame. The mixed results may be due to the fact that many of these studies did not take into account that people with different traits (e.g., different personality) may react to framing strategies differently.</p><p>Recently, personalized framing, especially personality-based framing research has become a hot topic. Among them, Hirsh (2012) investigates whether a persuasive appeal's effectiveness can be increased by aligning message framing with a recipient's personality profile. In this study, for a given mobile phone, they constructed five advertisements, each designed to target one of the five major personality traits. Their results indicate that advertisements were evaluated more positively when they cohered with participants' personality. In a separate study, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Conroy et al., 2012)</ref> found that certain personality traits, particularly openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness mediate framing effects when participants were presented with different frames of political and health issues such as civil liberties, medical treatments, energy, affirmative action, and gun control.</p><p>Inspired by the above research, we also employ psychologically-motivated trait models to capture individual characteristics. In addition to personality, we also incorporate basic human values since fram- ing effects were also shown to be related to personal beliefs and motivations. As a result, we have signifi- cantly increased the scope of our study over prior re- search. Moreover, unlike prior research where only messages hand-crafted by experts were used, we are interested in building computational models to auto- matically select a subset of the aspects to highlight based on personal traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Personalized NLG</head><p>There is also a large body of work on personalized Natural Language Generation (NLG). For example, STOP is a Natural Language Generation (NLG) sys- tem that generates tailored smoking cessation let- ters based on a user's responses to a four-page smoking questionnaire ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Reiter et al., 2003)</ref>; PER- SIVAL customizes the content of search summaries based on its relevance to a given patient's health record ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McKeown et al., 2003)</ref>; MATCH ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Johnston et al., 2002</ref>) is a multimodal dialogue sys- tem that tailors the content of its responses based on a user's restaurant preferences; M-PIRO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burenhult, 2002</ref>) tailors the words and the complex- ity of museum object descriptions for different au- diences (e.g. adults, children, and experts); PER- SONAGE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mairesse and Walker, 2011</ref>) and CRAG 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gill et al., 2012</ref>) vary linguistic styles to project intended personality in spoken utterances. In ad- dition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carenini and Moore (Carenini and Moore, 2006</ref>) employed a multiattribute utility theory-based user preference model for personalized evaluative argument generation. Among them, STOP, PER- SIVAL and MATCH use domain-specific user mod- els while M-PIRO, PERSONAGE and GRAG2 em- ploy domain independent user properties, such as expertise and personality. For PERSONAGE and GRAG2, personality traits are mainly used to adapt linguistic styles. So far, there has not been much work focusing on using domain-independent user traits to automatically adapt message content to im- prove its persuasive appeal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Acquiring Personal Traits</head><p>Since prior study often links framing effects to in- dividual characteristics such as personality and in- dividual motivations and beliefs, here we focus on two widely-accepted trait models in psychology: the Big5 personality model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goldberg, 1993)</ref> and Schwartz's basic human value model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schwartz, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the description of each of the Big5 personality traits along with each of the five basic human value traits.</p><p>To acquire the personality and value traits of a person, traditionally, psychometric tests, such as the IPIP test for Big 5 personality (Yarkoni, 2010a) and the PVQ survey for values <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schwartz, 2003)</ref>, were used. Recent research in the field of psycholinguis- tics has shown that it is possible to automatically infer personal traits from one's linguistic footprint, such as tweets, Facebook posts and blogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yarkoni, 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Celli and Polonio, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al., 2014</ref>). Unlike psychometric tests, automated trait analysis <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Description of Two Trait Models allows us to infer personal traits for a large number of people, which makes it possible to scale up auto- mated personal persuasion for a very large popula- tion (e,g., millions of social media users).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Acquiring Author Framing Strategy</head><p>Framing effects are often subtle and may be influ- enced by many factors, such as the credibility of the authors, the personality of the receivers and the con- text of the communication. In the first study, we investigate whether it is feasible to build a person- alized content selection model based on a writer's (a.k.a. an author's) content framing strategies.</p><p>To investigate this, we first randomly generated ten cars, each include eight aspects: safety, fuel economy, quality, style, price, luxury, performance and durability. The value of each aspect was ran- domly generated on a 5-point Likert scale: "1 (very bad)", "2 (bad)", "3 (average)", "4 (good)", and "5 (excellent)". We also conducted a large-scale per- sonality and basic human value survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). We used the 50-item IPIP survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goldberg, 1993)</ref> to obtain a Amazon Me- chanical Turk worker (a.k.a. Turker)'s personal- ity scores and the 21-item PVQ survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schwartz, 2003)</ref> to obtain his/her basic value scores. To en-sure the quality of the data from AMT, we added two qualification criteria. A qualified Turker must (1) have submitted over 5000 tasks (2) with an ac- ceptance rate over 95%. The survey also included several validation questions, which are pairs of ques- tions that are paraphrases of each other. If the an- swers to a pair of validation questions are signifi- cantly different, the user data were excluded from our analysis. After removing invalid data, we col- lected the traits of 836 Turkers. The raw personality scores, ranging from 10 to 50, and raw value scores, ranging from 1 to 6, were computed directly from the survey answers. The normalized trait scores, ranging from 0 to 1, were computed using their rank percentiles in this population.</p><p>In addition, we designed two Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) on AMT: a content customization task and a validation task. In the content customization task (a.k.a. Task 1), a Turker was asked to select one car aspect to emphasize in his message for a re- ceiver. The validation task (a.k.a. Task 2) was used to validate whether a receiver prefers the message customized for her or not.</p><p>Specifically, in Task 1, the Turkers were asked to imagine that they work for a marketing firm on a campaign to promote a new car. Each Turker was given the specification of a car ( randomly selected from the 10 randomly generated cars) and a receiver (randomly selected from the 836 Turkers whose trait scores were known to us). The Turker was asked to write a campaign message to persuade the receiver to buy the car. But the Turker can only select one of the eight car aspects to include in his message. Since customizing a message based on an interaction of all ten traits can be very challenging for a Turker, we used a simplified trait profile in our study. The sim- plified trait profile contains only two traits: the most prominent personality trait and the most prominent value trait. The prominence of a trait was defined based on the normalized trait score. The more dif- ferent a trait score is from the median (.50), the more prominent the trait is. For comparison, for the same car, we also asked the same writer to select a car as- pect for someone who has an opposite trait profile. The opposite trait profile is defined as the one that is most different from the given trait profile (with the lowest cosine similarity). After the writer selected a car aspect, he also wrote a campaign message us- ing the selected aspect. Overall, after removing in- valid data, we collected 490 pairs of messages for 131 pairs of receivers.</p><p>To validate the framing effect, in Task 2, we asked a new set of Turkers (receivers) to first complete an IPIP personality survey and a PVQ human value sur- vey. Based on the survey results, we computed the trait profile for each of them. In addition, for each receiver in Task 2, we matched his/her trait profile with the 131 pairs of trait profiles collected in Task 1. The profile with the highest matching score (com- puted based on cosine similarity) was selected and its associated message pair was retrieved.</p><p>Then we presented the receiver with a pair of messages, one created for someone with matching trait profile, the other for someone with the oppo- site trait profile. We also randomized the order these messages were presented. Finally, we asked the re- ceivers to rate which message they prefer more. If the framing strategies used by the Turkers (authors) in Task 1 were effective, then the Turkers (receivers) in Task 2 will prefer the messages tailored for them more than the ones tailored for someone with the opposite trait profile. Overall, after filtering out in- valid data, we have collected the results from 145 re- ceivers. Among them, 77 prefer the messages writ- ten for them, while 68 prefer the messages written for someone with the opposite trait profiles. We performed a sign test to determine whether the dif- ference is statistically significant and the result was negative (p &lt; 0.2).</p><p>Although moderate personalization effects were found in previous framing research, only expert- crafted messages were used <ref type="figure">(Hirsh et al., 2012)</ref>. Here, when Turkers (mostly non-experts) were asked to customize the messages based on a re- ceiver's traits, no significant effects were found. Since authors' emphasis framing strategies were not effective, we can not directly use authors' data to learn their emphasis framing strategies. Next, we present several experiments designed to automati- cally derive emphasis framing strategies based on a receiver's traits and his/her aspect selection deci- sions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Learning Emphasis Framing Strategies</head><p>To derive emphasis framing patterns based on a re- ceiver's traits and his/her aspect selection decisions, we designed another HIT (Task 3) on AMT to col- lect data. In Task 3, each Turker was asked to take the IPIP and PVQ surveys so that we can obtain his/her Big5 personality and value scores. In addi- tion, we also asked him/her to rank all eight car as- pects based on their importance to him/her. To con- trol the influence of the value of a car aspect on a user's aspect selection decision (e.g., if the value of "safety" is "poor" and the value of "fuel economy" is "good", to promote the car, people almost always describe it as "a car with good fuel economy", not "an unsafe car", regardless of a receiver's personal- ity). In this study, we kept the values of all car as- pects unspecified. After removing invalid data, our dataset has 594 responses, each contains a Turker's personality and value scores as well as his/her rank of the eight car aspects. In the following, we de- scribe how we analyze the relationship between as- pect rank and personal traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Pattern Discovery with Regression</head><p>In our first study, we employed regression analysis to identify significant correlations between personal traits and aspect ranks. Specifically, we trained eight linear regression models, one for each of the eight car aspects. The dependent variable in each model is the rank of an aspect (from 1 to 8) and the in- dependent variables are the ten user traits. In the regression analysis, we only focused on the main effects since a full interaction model with ten traits will require much more data to train. Since the raw scores of the personality and value traits use differ- ent scales, we normalized these scores so that they are all from 0 to 1. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the regression results.</p><p>Several interesting patterns were discovered in this analysis: (a) a positive correlation between the rank of "luxury" and "self-enhancement", a trait of- ten associated with people who pursue self-interests and value social status, prestige and personal suc- cess (p &lt; 0.0001). This pattern suggests that to pro- mote a car to someone who scores high on "self- enhancement", we need to highlight the "luxury" aspect of a car. (b) the rank of "safety" is posi- tively correlated with "conservation", a trait associ- ated with people who conform to tradition and pur- sue safety, harmony, and stability (p &lt; 0.005). This result suggests that for someone values "conserva- tion", it is better to emphasize "car safety" in a per- sonalized sales message. (c) "self-transcendence", a trait often associated with people who pursue the protection of the welfare of others and the nature, is positively correlated with the rank of "fuel econ- omy" (p &lt; 0.005) but negatively correlated with the rank of "style" (p &lt; 0.005). This suggests that for someone who values "self-transcendence", it is bet- ter to emphasize "fuel economy", but not so much on "style". Other significant correlations uncovered in this analysis include a negative correlation between car "price" and "conservation" (p &lt; 0.005), a nega- tive correlation between car "safety" and "conscien- tiousness" (p &lt; 0.05), and a positive correlation be- tween "openness to change" and car "performance" (p &lt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Pattern Discovery with Constrained Clustering</head><p>In the regression analysis, we only considered the main framing effects. In order to discover high-order interaction patterns with limited data, we want to use clustering to group people with similar traits to- gether. In addition, we also want that the people in a cluster share similar aspect preferences. Otherwise, we won't be able to link the trait patterns discovered in a cluster with specific aspect preferences. Thus, we employed constrained clustering in this analysis.</p><p>With constrained clustering, we can ensure the ho- mogeneity of the aspect preferences within each re- sulting cluster.</p><p>To facilitate this analysis, first we mapped the aspect ranks obtained in Task 3 into discrete cate- gories. For a complete rank of eight car aspects, we mapped the top three ranked aspects to an "Impor- tant" class, bottom three to a "Not-Important" class, and the middle two to a "Neutral" class. In addi- tion, we encoded the aspect homogeneity require- ment as constraints. Typically, constrained cluster- ing incorporates either a set of must-link constraints, a set of cannot-link constraints, or both. A must- link constraint is used to specify that the two data instances in the must-link relation should be placed in the same cluster. A cannot-link constraint is used   to specify that the two instances in the cannot-link relation should not be put in the same cluster. These constraints act as a guide for which a constrained clustering algorithm will use to find clusters that sat- isfy these requirements.</p><p>To encode the homogeneity constraint, for each car aspect (e.g. safety), we can simply add must- links between every pair of Turkers if they share the same aspect preference (e.g., both consider "safety" important) and add cannot-links for every pair of Turkers who do not share the same aspect prefer- ences (e.g., one Turker considers "safety" "Impor- tant", the other considers it "Not-Important"). But with both must-links and cannot-links, it is very likely we will get three big clusters, each is related to one of the three categories: Important, Neutral and Not-Important. Although the resulting clusters sat- isfy the aspect preference homogeneity requirement, they fail to group people with similar traits together. As a result, in this analysis, we only used cannot- links, which not only guarantees the homogeneity of aspect preferences, but also creates smaller clusters that group people with similar traits together.</p><p>We employed the Metric Pairwise Constrained KMeans algorithm (MPCK-MEANS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bilenko et al., 2004</ref>) to incorporate the aspect preference ho- mogeneity requirement. The optimal cluster number K was determined empirically by running MPCK- MEANS with different Ks, K ∈ [3, 20] (3 is the minimum number of clusters since we have 3 differ- ent aspect preference categories).</p><p>To determine whether the resulting clusters cap- ture any interesting patterns, we used two pattern selection criteria (a) a homogeneity criterion which requires that there is at least one trait whose values in the cluster is relatively homogeneous; (b) a distinc- tiveness criterion which requires that for the traits identified in (a), their cluster means need to be sig- nificantly different from the population means. For (a), we used the coefficient of variation (CV) as the homogeneity measure. CV, also known as relative standard deviation (RSD), is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability or count distribution. It is often expressed as a percentage and is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation σ to the mean |µ|. In the study, we required that all the CVs of homogeneous traits to be lower than 0.12. For (b) we required that the differences of the means need to be significant based on an independent sample t- test with p &lt; 0.001 and the difference of means is greater than 0.2. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> highlights some of the patterns discovered using this approach. In this table, we list the cluster id, cluster label (Important, Not-Important, Neutral), clustering accuracy, and significant traits in the clus- ter ("+" indicates that the cluster mean is higher than population mean, "-" means the opposite). For ex- ample, based on the Safety-1 pattern, people who are more extraverted (extrave (+)) and more neu- rotic (neurotic (+)) tend to consider "car safety" im- portant. Similarly, based on pattern Safety-3, peo- ple who are more conscientious (conscie(+)) but less open (open(-)) tend to consider "safety" impor- tant. Other interesting patterns include: people who are less open (open(-)) and do not value hedonism (hedomis (-)) don't consider performance very im- portant (performance-3), and people who are more extraverted (extrave(+)), value hedonism and self- enhancement (hedonis(+), self-en(+)) do not think durability important (durability-1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Apply Emphasis Framing in NLG</head><p>The patterns derived in the previous section can be used in personalized content selection for Natural Language Generation. In general, to promote a car, people tend to highlight the good aspects and avoid the bad aspects, regardless of a receiver's person- ality. For example, people will likely to highlight the fuel economy aspect if a car is very fuel efficient while de-highlight the same aspect if a car is not fuel efficient. Thus, during content selection, to take the value of an aspect into consideration, we employ a cascade NLG model that integrates value-based con- tent selection with trait-based personalization.</p><p>The input to the cascade content selection model includes: (1) the values of all the car aspects; (2) the trait scores of a receiver; (3) the eight linear- regression models learned in Section 5.2, one for each aspect; (4) the interaction rules learned in Sec- tion 5.3; (5) n, the number of aspects needed in the output; (6) the value difference threshold δ 1 that de- termines whether the values of two or more aspects are significantly different; (7) the rank difference threshold δ 2 that determines whether the ranks of two or more aspects predicted by the linear regres- sion models are significantly different.</p><p>To select n aspects to emphasize, our system first ranks all the aspects based on their values. If the value of the n-th aspect v n is significantly better than that of the (n+1)-th aspect v n+1 (i.e., their difference is greater than δ 1 ), we output the top n aspects di- rectly. Otherwise, for all the aspects whose values are either the same or not significantly worse than v n , their ranks will be determined by the trait-based linear regression models. Moreover, after re-ranking relevant aspects based on the predicted ranks from the regression models, if the predicted rank of the n-th aspect r n is significantly better than that of the (n+1)-th aspect r n+1 (i.e., the rank difference is greater than δ 2 ), we just output the top n aspects in this list. Otherwise, for those aspects whose ranks predicted by the linear regression models are not sig- nificantly lower than r n , we use the interaction rules discovered in Section 5.3 to further adjust their rank- ing scores (i.e., increase the rank by δ 2 if the clus- ter label is "Important", or decrease by δ 2 if "Not- Important"). For each aspect, if more than one inter- action rule applies, more accurate rules take prece- dence over less accurate rules. Finally, the system will output the top n aspects in the final list.</p><p>We use an example shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> to illus- trate the cascade aspect selection process. In this example, we assume n=3, δ 1 =1 and δ 2 =0.5. We first sorted all the aspects based on their values. Since the values of "Fuel Economy" and "Luxury" are sig- nificantly better than the 3rd-ranked aspect "Price", their ranks are not affected by personalized aspect selection. Similarly, since the values of "Perfor- mance" and "Style" are significantly lower than that of the 3rd-ranked aspect, their ranks are also not af- fected by personalization. Since the value differ- ences among the rest 4 aspects, "Price", "Durabil- ity", "Quality" and "Safety" are all equal or not sig- nificant worse than v 3 , we used trait-based person- alized ranks predicted by the regression models to re-rank them (the output ranks from the regression models are shown in the parentheses in the column "Regression-based Re-Ranking"). After re-ranking these aspects based on the predicted ranks, since the rank of the 3rd-ranked aspect "Price" (2.2) and that of "Safety" (2.5) is within δ 2 , we use the learned <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: A Cascade Content Selection Example interaction rules to adjust their ranks. Since the pre- dicted ranks of "Durability" and "Quality" are much worse than that of "Price", their ranks are not af- fected by the interaction rules. To apply the interac- tion rules, assume for a given receiver, both his ex- traversion and neuroticism scores are much higher than the population average, the Safety-1, Quality- 1 and Performance-1 rules are applicable. Since the Safety-1 rule predicts that "Safety" is "Important" to the receiver while none of the rules affects "Price", the predicted rank for "Safety" is increased by δ 2 . After this adjustment, the ranks of all the aspects are shown in the "Final Rank" column. The top 3 aspects based on the final ranks are selected as the output (those marked with a *).</p><p>To evaluate the performance of the cascade con- tent selection model, we conducted an additional AMT study. Given the specifications of the ten cars in Task1, we asked each AMT participant to se- lect the top-n aspects to emphasize. Here n=1 and 3. In this task, aspect selection not only depends on the importance of an aspect to a receiver, but also the values of the aspects of a given car. We also acquired the personality and value scores of each Turker based on the IPIP personality and PVQ value survey. Finally, we compared the output of our model with the aspects selected by the Turkers. We used top-n overlapping percentage as the eval- uation metrics. Overall, we collected the aspect se- lection results from 38 Turkers, each on ten different cars. In total, we collected 380 data instances in our ground truth dataset. We have tested different δ1 and δ2, the best results were obtained when δ1 = 0 and δ2 = 0.5. We compared our model with a baseline system which relies solely on the values of aspects to determine their ranks in the baseline system. If two or more aspects have the same value (e.g., the values of both "Price" and "Durability" are "3(Av- erage)", their ranks were determined randomly. Ta- ble 3 shows the evaluation results. If only 1 aspect is needed in the output, the Top-1 agreement is 62% for the cascade model versus the baseline's 54%. Simi- larly, if 3 aspects are needed in the output, the Top-3 agreement is 87% for the cascade model versus the baseline's 46%. All the differences are statistically significant based on paired-t test (p ≤ 0.05). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>In general, there are two main challenges in adapt- ing a personalized content selection model trained in one domain to another domain: (1) adapting the data model from one domain (e.g., restaurant data) to another (e.g., movie data); (2) adapting a domain- specific user model (e.g., a user' preferences of restaurant features such as "cuisine type") to a dif- ferent domain (e.g., a user's preferences of movie features such as "movie genre"). Although our data model is in the automobile domain, we adopted a domain-independent user model motivated by psy- chological theories(e.g., personality and basic hu- man values), instead of a domain-dependent user preference models (e.g, a user's preferences of "fuel economy"). This allows us to more easily apply typ- ical domain adaptation methods such as instance- based <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zadrozny, 2004</ref>) or feature-based transfer learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blitzer et al., 2006</ref>) to further adapt the system and generalize the current results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>In this study, we analyzed the relationship between an individual's traits and his/her aspect framing de- cisions. Our analysis has uncovered interesting pat- terns that can be used to automatically customize a message's content to enhance its appeal to its re- ceivers. We also proposed a cascade content selec- tion model to automatically incorporate the analysis results in automated persuasive message generation.</p><p>Our evaluation results have demonstrated the effec- tiveness of this approach.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Hedonis(+),Open(+),Self-en(+) Note: CV &lt; 0.12 P &lt; 0.001 Dif f &gt; 0.2</figDesc></figure>
