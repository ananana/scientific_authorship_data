				<p>Geographic information extraction from textual data sources, called geoparsing, is a key task in text processing and central to subsequent spatial analysis approaches. Several geoparsers are available that support this task, each with its own (often limited or specialized) gazetteer and its own approaches to toponym detection and resolution. In this demonstration paper, we present HeidelPlace, an extensible framework in support of geoparsing. Key features of HeidelPlace include a generic gazetteer model that supports the integration of place information from different knowledge bases, and a pipeline approach that enables an effective combination of diverse modules tailored to specific geop-arsing tasks. This makes HeidelPlace a valuable tool for testing and evaluating different gazetteer sources and geoparsing methods. In the demonstration, we show how to set up a geoparsing workflow with HeidelPlace and how it can be used to compare and consolidate the output of different geoparsing approaches.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The ever-growing amount of available text data raises the need for automated Information Extrac- tion (IE) to obtain structured information from text. A central step in such an extraction proce- dure is the semantic annotation of the contained information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Zhang and Rettinger, 2014</ref>). For tasks such as event detection or content analysis, temporal and spatial information play a crucial role. In particular, the linking of place mentions to geographic databases, so-called geoparsing, is an integral element of textual analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andogah et al., 2012)</ref>. Geoparsing describes the process of identifying place mentions in text (so called to- ponyms) and linking them to unambiguous spa- tial references. Consider the example text "Hei- delberg was founded in 1196 AD", which con- tains the place mention "Heidelberg". Typically, geoparsing involves three components: gazetteers, toponym recognition and toponym resolution. A Gazetteer is a dictionary of geographic features that serves as a knowledge repository for places of interest. Toponym recognition deals with the detection of place names in documents. For in- stance, "Heidelberg" can be detected by match- ing candidate strings to a gazetteer of city names. With the help of toponym resolution (also called toponym linking), each identified toponym is then matched to an unambiguous spatial reference (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates). In our ex- ample above, the spatial reference may be taken from the matched gazetteer entry. Due to ambigu- ous names of mentioned places, this task often requires toponym disambiguation. For instance, "Heidelberg" refers to several places world-wide. If the gazetteer contains founding dates, we can infer that the text refers to Heidelberg in Germany.</p><p>Linguistic peculiarities, as well as the relevance of different places and place features, greatly vary with the application domain. Hence, geopars- ing is a non-trivial process that requires fine tun- ing according to the respective use-case. As a result, a variety of geoparsing approaches have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Hoffart, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Leidner, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Samet, 2011, 2012</ref>), many of which are domain-specific. There exist sev- eral specialized gazetteers, such as GeoNames 1 , a large gazetteer for a broad spectrum of place types, OpenStreetMap 2 , a community-built geo-graphic knowledge-base, and Pleiades 3 , a historic gazetteer. However, reusing and comparing exist- ing geoparsers is often difficult, since they gen- erally come with their own gazetteer and pro- cessing pipeline. Configurability and extensibil- ity are rarely considered. As a result, it is of- ten problematic to adjust a geoparser to other ap- plication domains or to include other algorithms. Especially the adjustment to a different gazetteer source tends to be troublesome. Each gazetteer uses its own data model and most geoparsers use the data model of their primary gazetteer resource. If the underlying gazetteer data model is not de- signed to be flexible, or if the geoparser is too tightly coupled with a specific gazetteer source, a reuse may not be possible.</p><p>CLAVIN <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , an open-source geoparsing frame- work, strives to overcome these issues by pro- viding an extensible toolbox of geoparsing meth- ods. However, the framework strongly relies on GeoNames as gazetteer, which is often not an ideal choice. Switching to another data source would entail a significant rewrite of the code base.</p><p>Thus, a generalized gazetteer data model is re- quired that is compatible with different gazetteer sources. Only then can significant software mod- ifications due to gazetteer specific data modeling be avoided, and the adaptation work be reduced to the transformation of data sources to the generic data model. While CLAVIN's modular design al- lows to add new modules, its processing pipeline is too restrictive to enable complex geoparsing ap- proaches that rely on information exchange be- tween different modules.</p><p>Contributions. In this work, we present Hei- delPlace, a geoparsing framework that includes a generic gazetteer model and an implementation of the entire geoparsing process. The generic gazetteer model supports the integration and man- agement of heterogeneous, large-scale gazetteer sources, and is flexible enough to integrate con- cepts from different gazetteers. A variety of concepts proposed in gazetteer research are in- cluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Hill, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Keler et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Moura and Davis, 2014)</ref>, which allow the description of places in a comprehensive and yet flexible manner.</p><p>The extensibility of HeidelPlace is realized in two ways. First, modularization is a central design aspect, with different geoparsing approaches be-ing represented as modules. They can be used and combined in a plug-in like manner, allowing the integration of newly developed modules. Second, interactions between the different components are handled transparently by the framework, using an annotation-based processing pipeline. Therefore, the user can focus on obtaining appropriate con- figurations through experimentation. To further increase the efficiency of developing new geop- arsing methods, we include user-friendly GUIs that make the geoparsing process transparent. The open-source project HeidelPlace and the data used for this demonstration are available for download from the EventAE project website 5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Framework and System Overview</head><p>HeidelPlace includes a geoparsing framework for developing new geoparsers as well as GUIs to make the geoparsing process transparent to the user. The architecture of our proposed geoparsing framework is visualized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, which high- lights the three major components that we describe in the following. The GUIs are introduced towards the end of this section and in Section 3.</p><p>Annotation Pipeline: In order to execute the geoparsing process (either entirely or par- tially) on input documents, we utilize the annotation pipeline of the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Manning et al., 2014</ref>), which is built atop three key interdependent concepts, namely Annotation objects, Annotators, and AnnotationPipelines. An Annotation object stores key-value information about a document with arbitrary structure. As depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, this may be the original text of a pro- cessed document, identified tokens, or mentions of named entities. An Annotator is a config- urable module that performs some processing task on a given document. It can read and write anal- ysis information from and to the Annotation objects, allowing to pass information among different Annotators. The annotator does not implement the processing task itself, but dele- gates between different modules that implement the same functionality. For instance, Tokenizer modules scan the original text of a document with specific strategies and return a set of identified to- kens. A TokenizerAnnotator is configured by the user to utilize a particular Tokenizer module. It passes all required information to the module and adds annotations for retrieved output tokens. This additional layer of abstraction al- lows to separate pipeline maintenance tasks from the implementation of the actual data processing methods. The AnnotationPipeline consists of a set of Annotators, which are run sequen- tially over the input document.</p><p>Geoparsing Modules: The main objective of our framework is the unification of the geopars- ing process, with a focus on extensibility and us- ability. Therefore, we use a modular design and an easy-to-use processing pipeline as described above. The geoparsing process is divided into four steps, which are represented by modules:</p><p>• ToponymRecognizer: Extracts topo- nyms from a given input text document.</p><p>• ToponymLinker: Links each toponym to places in the gazetteer. Due to ambiguity, multiple matches per toponym are possible.</p><p>• ToponymDisambiguator: Resolves am- biguous matches.</p><p>• SpatialInference: Infers the location of unlinked toponyms. For each step, an Annotator feeds the correct input to the respective module and then adds its output to the Annotation object.</p><p>The processing steps need to be executed in se- quence, but may be re-run multiple times. For ex- ample, running a disambiguation process before the entity recognition step does not make sense. However, re-running a recognition module after a first complete geoparsing pass may improve the results in the second run.</p><p>Gazetteer: We developed a generic gazetteer model that allows to incorporate a wide spectrum of place related information. Its central concept is a geographic place, which may have multiple names, footprints, types, properties, and relation- ships, depending on the available data. This al- lows us to incorporate data from multiple hetero- geneous sources.</p><p>To enable multilingual and context sensitive geoparsing, we allow each place name to have a language entry and a set of flags (e.g., is historic or is official). By supporting multiple footprints per place, different spatial representations like points, lines, or polygons are possible. This enables the use of different geographic resolutions and allows us to capture irregularities such as historic changes or political border conflicts. Since a place may fulfil different functions, multiple types can be as- signed to each geographic place. In addition, each place may have an arbitrary number of properties with an assigned type and value (e.g., its popula- tion or a Wikipedia link). To link places within the gazetteer, typed place relationships can be defined (e.g., sister city or topographic neighbor) and used to implement administrative hierarchies. Option- ally, relationships may have a value assigned, e.g., a place co-occurrence score ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Overell and Rüger, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Spitz et al., 2016</ref>). With a flexible type scheme, complex ontologies for place types, prop- erty types, and relationship types can be created by using parent-child and similar-to relationships among types. This allows the integration of type systems of existing gazetteers, while maintaining expressiveness by linking related types.  shows an exemplary mapping of GeoNames and OSM administrative levels to administrative hi- erarchies in the PlaceType entity class of the HeidelPlace gazetteer model. Furthermore, prove- nance and validity times can be recorded for each place and its descriptors. This allows to docu- ment data origin and temporal validity such as the change in population, which is especially impor- tant for historic text corpora.</p><p>To support easy access to the gazetteer database, we provide an API written in Java using JPA. This includes a mapping of the database schema to Java classes as well as a flexible query inter- face. It serves as an abstraction layer for com- plex database-level access to the underlying data model. A set of predefined filters for each place descriptor can be used to narrow the place search. Users may implement more filters through the JPA Criteria API. For advanced use cases, plain SQL queries support low-level access if desired.</p><p>Gazetteer Creation and Integration: Before we can perform actual geoparsing, we first need to fill our gazetteer with data. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed gazetteer model, we implemented the model in a relational database schema using PostgreSQL 9.4 with PostGIS 2.2. We developed an importer for GeoNames to il- lustrate how the transformation and integration of data into our model works. A subset of the GeoN- ames dump from September 7th, 2016 was im- ported into the gazetteer database. It consists of 4.6 million places, with high coverage of higher- level administrative divisions and many populated places. We obtain basic POI coverage by adding hotels, airports, and castles. More than 6.3 mil- lion place names were extracted, 3.8 million of which are distinct (1.66 places per toponym, 1.38 <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: The gazetteer browsing GUI. The search filters can be specified at the top. On the left side the places are listed and shown on a map. The data for a selected place is displayed on the right side.</p><p>toponyms per place). We use this data for the demonstration scenario. Due to the complexity of merging gazetteers, we refrain from elaborating on the conflation of gazetteers in this demonstration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Demonstration Scenario</head><p>In the following, we describe the demonstration of four key usage scenarios of the framework.</p><p>Gazetteer Browsing: To make the geopars- ing process transparent to the user, visual feed- back is important. For the gazetteer component, we provide a user-friendly GUI called "Gazetteer Viewer", which was developed using JavaFX (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The GUI allows users to conveniently browse the gazetteer data and aids them in under- standing the underlying data model. The user can narrow search results by specifying a set of fil- ters in the filter mask in the top area. By clicking "Search", the gazetteer is scanned for places that match the specified criteria. A list of identified places and an overview map with their locations are displayed on the left side. If a place is selected in the list or map, its details are shown on the right side. To follow links between places, double click- ing on an entry in the relationship table opens a separate view with details of the related place.</p><p>With this tool, data exploration can be greatly improved. Neither manual database queries nor knowledge about the database layout are required. Furthermore, the data is clearly structured and vi- sualized to quickly convey relevant information. To display the geoparsing process, we developed a second GUI as described in the following. Performing Geoparsing: The usage of the geoparsing framework is demonstrated with a set of exemplary geoparsing modules. Here, the fo- cus lies on showcasing the interplay between the modules and not on methodical sophistication. For toponym recognition, we include three mod- ules. The first module applies the location name finder of OpenNLP, while the second uses Stan- ford NER to detect location entities. The third module is based on gazetteer look-ups for proper nouns as well as basic linguistic considerations. A single toponym linking module is also provided, which links toponyms to gazetteer entries via an exact name matching filter. For toponym disam- biguation, two basic modules are implemented. The first module gives precedence to places with higher population, whereas the second module gives precedence to pairs of candidate places that are geographically closer. Since spatial inference is a non-trivial task, we implement no exemplary inference module in this demonstration.</p><p>To exemplify how a geoparser can be imple- mented based on our geoparsing framework, we provide a JavaFX-based GUI called "Geoparser Viewer". The viewer is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. It supports a set of pre-configured modules and vi- sualizes the geoparsing process. In the viewer, the user first provides an input text document and se- lects a module per geoparsing step. The geopars- ing process can then be run by clicking "Geop- arse". Alternatively, geoparsing can be executed step-by-step by clicking the respective buttons. Resulting annotations are visualized in the bottom part of the window (in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, results for mul- tiple geoparsing methods are shown, as described in the last use-case). This visualization helps the user to analyze the geoparsing results, as we dis- cuss in the next scenario. The simple replacement of modules highlights the benefit of a modular de- sign and clearly structured processing pipeline.</p><p>Analyzing Geoparsing Results: If a geopars- ing method produces unexpected output or if its behavior is not clear, detailed analysis of the pro- cess is required. The result view of the "Geoparser Viewer" allows to conveniently analyze the geop- arsing results. On the left side, identified named entities are highlighted in the original text. Since geoparsers may use general NER tools like Stan- fordNER, our recognition module can also add an- notations for named entities other than locations. Knowing the type of other entities may be of use for later processing steps (e.g., disambiguation). Therefore, each color represents a named entity type (among others, yellow for persons, red for locations, blue for organizations). Additionally, a list with all identified named entities is shown. Selections in the text are reflected in the list and vice versa. If a location entity is selected, a list of linked places from the gazetteer is shown. A map displays the location for a selected linked place to quickly surmise the geographic context.</p><p>The results of the geoparsing process highly de- pend on the gazetteer data. For example, the type, administrative level, population, or mention fre- quency of a place may influence the recognition and disambiguation step. Hence, it may be of in- terest to see what information is stored for a linked place to draw conclusions about the geoparser de- cisions. By double-clicking on a linked place en- try, a separate view is shown that is similar to the "Gazetteer Viewer". With such a visual analy- sis, experimentation and debugging of geoparsing methods is greatly simplified.</p><p>Comparing Geoparsing Methods: Another valuable feature is the comparison of different geoparsing modules. In the "Geoparser Viewer", multiple geoparsing methods can be compared qualitatively. If multiple modules per geoparsing step are selected, each combination from the cross product of all module combinations is considered a geoparsing method. After clicking "Geoparse" or any of the step-by-step buttons, a result view for each method is shown (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref>.</p><p>The clearly structured and interactive visualiza- tion allows the user to quickly surmise the differ- ences between several geoparsing methods. Of course, this does not replace quantitative perfor- mance analyses that allow for a more representa- tive performance evaluation. Instead, it provides the means to easily test special cases and helps to better understand the geoparsing process and the employed modules.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The geoparsing framework architecture, including the three major components: annotation pipeline, geoparsing modules, and gazetteer.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> Conclusion and Ongoing Work In this paper, we presented HeidelPlace, a flexible and extensible geoparsing framework built on two paradigms. On the one hand, it introduces a generic gazetteer model that supports the integration of heterogeneous gazetteer sources. A comfortable query API and a user-friendly GUI aid users in maintaining and exploring the gazetteer. On the other hand, HeidelPlace utilizes a modularized pipeline for the entire geoparsing process. Since each geoparsing step is represented as a module within a flexible annotation-based processing pipeline, new approaches can easily be integrated and tested. Our ongoing work includes the implementation of an evaluation component that enables a standardized quantitative comparison of different geoparsing approaches, the development of an UIMA component to simplify integration into existing IE pipelines, a web-service that supports remote queries to the gazetteer and geoparser, and the implementation of state-of-the-art modules as a starting point for a production-ready toolbox that can be improved and expanded by the community.</note>
