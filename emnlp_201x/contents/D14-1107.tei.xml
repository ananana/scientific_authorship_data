			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce a new CCG parsing model which is factored on lexical category assignments. Parsing is then simply a de-terministic search for the most probable category sequence that supports a CCG derivation. The parser is extremely simple, with a tiny feature set, no POS tagger, and no statistical model of the derivation or dependencies. Formulating the model in this way allows a highly effective heuris-tic for A * parsing, which makes parsing extremely fast. Compared to the standard C&amp;C CCG parser, our model is more accurate out-of-domain, is four times faster, has higher coverage, and is greatly simplified. We also show that using our parser improves the performance of a state-of-the-art question answering system.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>CCG is a strongly lexicalized grammatical formal- ism, in which the vast majority of the decisions made during interpretation involve choosing the correct definitions of words. We explore the ef- fect of modelling this explicitly in a parser, by only using a probabilistic model of lexical cate- gories (based on a local context window), rather than modelling the derivation or dependencies.</p><p>Existing state-of-the-art CCG parsers use com- plex pipelines of POS-tagging, supertagging and parsing-each with its own feature sets and pa- rameters (and sources of error)-together with fur- ther parameters governing their integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Clark and Curran, 2007)</ref>. We show that much simpler models can achieve high performance. Our model predicts lexical categories based on a tiny fea- ture set of word embeddings, capitalization, and 2- character suffixes-with no parsing model beyond a small set of CCG combinators, and no POS- tagger. Simpler models are easier to implement, replicate and extend.</p><p>Another goal of our model is to parse CCG optimally and efficiently, without using excessive pruning. CCG's large set of lexical categories, and generalized notion of constituency, mean that sentences can have a huge number of potential parses. Fast existing CCG parsers rely on aggres- sive pruning-for example, the C&amp;C parser uses a supertagger to dramatically cut the search space considered by the parser. Even the loosest beam setting for their supertagger discards the correct parse for 20% of sentences. The structure of our model allows us to introduce a simple but power- ful heuristic for A * parsing, meaning it can parse almost 50 sentences per second exactly, with no beam-search or pruning. Adding very mild prun- ing increases the speed to 186 sentences per sec- ond with minimal loss of accuracy.</p><p>Our approach faces two obvious challenges. Firstly, categories are assigned based on a local window, which may not contain the necessary con- text for resolving some attachment decisions. For example, in I saw a squirrel 2 weeks ago with a nut, the model cannot make an informed decision on whether to assign with an adverbial or adnomi- nal preposition category, as the crucial words saw and squirrel fall outside the local context window. Secondly, even if the supertagger makes all lexical category decisions correctly, then the parser can still make erroneous decisions. One example is in coordination-scope ambiguities, such as clever boys and girls, where the two interpretations use the same assignment of categories.</p><p>We hypothesise that such decisions are rela- tively rare, and are challenging for any parsing model, so a weak model is unlikely to result in substantially lower accuracy. Our implementation of this model 1 , which we call EASYCCG, has high 1 Available from https://github.com/ mikelewis0/easyccg accuracy-suggesting that most parsing decisions can be made accurately based on a local context window.</p><p>Of course, there are many parsing decisions that can only be made accurately with more complex models. However, exploring the power and lim- itations of simpler models may help focus future research on the more challenging cases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Combinatory Categorial Grammar</head><p>CCG <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Steedman, 2000</ref>) is a strongly lexicalized grammatical formalism. Words have categories representing their syntactic role, which are either atomic, or functions from one category to another.</p><p>Phrase-structure grammars have a relatively small number of lexical categories types (e.g. POS-tags), and a large set of rules used to build a syntactic analysis of a complete sentence (e.g. an adjective and noun can combine into a noun). In contrast, CCG parsing has many lexical cate- gory types (we use 425), but a small set of combi- natory rule types (we use 10 binary and 13 unary rule schemata). This means that, aside from the lexicon, the grammar is small enough to be hand- coded-which allows us, in this paper, to confine the entire statistical model to the lexicon.</p><p>CCG's generalized notion of constituency means that many derivations are possible for a given a set of lexical categories. However, most of these derivations will be semantically equivalent-for example, deriving the same de- pendency structures-in which case the actual choice of derivation is unimportant. Such ambi- guity is often called spurious.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Existing CCG Parsing Models</head><p>The seminal C&amp;C parser is by far the most pop- ular choice of CCG parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Clark and Curran, 2007)</ref>. It showed that it was possible to parse to an expressive linguistic formalism with high speed and accuracy. The performance of the parser has enabled large-scale logic-based distributional re- search <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Harrington, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lewis and Steedman, 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lewis and Steedman, 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reddy et al., 2014)</ref>, and it is a key component of Boxer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bos, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The C&amp;C parser uses CKY chart parsing, with a log-linear model to rank parses. The vast number of possible parses means that computing the com- plete chart is impractical. To resolve this prob- lem, a supertagger is first run over the sentence to prune the set of lexical categories considered by the parser for each word. The initial beam out- puts an average of just 1.2 categories per word, rather than the 425 possible categories-making the standard CKY parsing algorithm very efficient. If the parser fails to find any analysis of the com- plete sentence with this set of supertags, the su- pertagger re-analyses the sentence with a more re- laxed beam (adaptive supertagging).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A * Parsing</head><p>Klein and Manning (2003a) introduce A * parsing for PCFGs. The parser maintains a chart and an agenda, which is a priority queue of items to add to the chart. The agenda is sorted based on the items' inside probability, and a heuristic upper-bound on the outside probability-to give an upper bound on the probability of the complete parse. The chart is then expanded in best-first order, until a com- plete parse for the sentence is found.</p><p>Klein and Manning calculate an upper bound on the outside probability of a span based on a sum- mary of the context. For example, the summary for the SX heuristic is the category of the span, and the number of words in the sentence before and af- ter the span. The value of the heuristic is the prob- ability of the best possible sentence meeting these restrictions. These probabilities are pre-computed for every non-terminal symbol and for every pos- sible number of preceding and succeeding words, leading to large look-up tables.</p><p>Auli and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Lopez (2011b)</ref> find that A * CCG pars- ing with this heuristic is very slow. However, they achieve a modest 15% speed improvement over CKY when A * is combined with adaptive su- pertagging. One reason is that the heuristic esti- mate is rather coarse, as it deals with the best pos- sible outside context, rather than the actual sen- tence. We introduce a new heuristic which gives a tighter upper bound on the outside probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Lexical Category Model</head><p>As input, our parser takes a distribution over all CCG lexical categories for each word in the sen- tence. These distributions are assigned using <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lewis and Steedman (2014)</ref>'s semi-supervised su- pertagging model. The supertagger is a unigram log-linear classifier that uses features of the ±3 word context window surrounding a word. The key feature is word embeddings, initialized with the 50-dimensional embeddings trained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Turian et al. (2010)</ref>, and fine-tuned during supervised training. The model also uses 2-character suffixes and capitalization features.</p><p>The use of word embeddings, which are trained on a large unlabelled corpus, allows the supertag- ger to generalize well to words not present in the labelled data. It does not use a POS-tagger, which avoids problems caused by POS-tagging errors.</p><p>Our methods could be applied to any supertag- ging model, but we find empirically that this model gives higher performance than the C&amp;C su- pertagger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Parsing Model</head><p>Let a CCG parse y of a sentence S be a list of lexical categories c 1 . . . c n and a derivation. If we assume all derivations licensed by our grammar are equally likely, and that lexical category assign- ments are conditionally independent given the sen- tence, we can compute the optimal parsê y as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ y = argmax y n i=1 p(c i |S)</formula><p>As discussed in Section 2.1, many derivations are possible given a sequence of lexical categories, some of which may be semantically distinct. How- ever, our model will assign all of these an equal score, as they use the same sequence of lexical categories. Therefore we extend our model with a simple deterministic heuristic for ranking parses that use the same lexical categories. Given a set of derivations with equal probability, we output the one maximizing the sums of the length of all arcs in the corresponding dependency tree.</p><p>The effect of this heuristic is to prefer non- local attachments in cases of ambiguity, which we found worked better on development data than favouring local attachments. In cases of spurious ambiguity, all parses will have the same value of this heuristic, so one is chosen arbitrarily. For example, one of the parses in Figures 1a and 1b would be selected over the parse in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref>.</p><p>Of course, we could use any function of the parses in place of this heuristic, for example a head-dependency model. However, one aim of this paper is to demonstrate that an extremely sim- ple parsing model can achieve high performance, so we leave more sophisticated alternatives to fu- ture work.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a house in Paris in France NP (NP \NP )/NP NP (NP \NP )/NP NP &gt; &gt; NP \NP NP \NP &lt; NP &lt; NP</formula><p>(a) A standard derivation of a house in Paris in France, with a dependency from in France to house</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">a house in Paris in France NP (NP \NP )/NP NP (NP \NP )/NP NP &gt; &gt; NP \NP NP \NP &gt;B NP \NP &lt; NP (b)</formula><p>A derivation of a house in Paris in France, which is spu- riously equivalent to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">A * Search</head><p>For parsing, we use an A * search for the most- probable complete CCG derivation of a sentence.</p><p>A key advantage of A * parsing over CKY parsing is that it does not require us to prune the search space first with a supertagger, allowing the parser to consider the complete distribution of 425 cate- gories for each word (in contrast to an average of 3.57 categories per word considered by the C&amp;C parser's most relaxed beam). This is possible be- cause A * only searches for the Viterbi parse of a sentence, rather than building a complete chart with every possible category per word (another al- ternative, used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hockenmaier (2003)</ref>, is to use a highly aggressive beam search in the parser).</p><p>In A * parsing, items on the agenda are sorted by their cost; the product of their inside probability and an upper bound on their outside probability.</p><p>For a span w i . . . w j with lexical categories c i . . . c j in a sentence S = w 1 . . . w n , the inside probability is simply:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">j k=i p(c k |S)</formula><p>The factorization of our model lets us give the following upper-bound on the outside probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h(w i . . . w j ) = k&lt;i k=1 max c k p(c k |S)× k≤n k=j+1 max c k p(c k |S)</formula><p>This heuristic assumes that all words outside the span will take their highest-probability supertag. Because the model is factored on lexical cate- gories, this estimate is clearly an upper bound. As supertagging is over 90% accurate, the upper bound will often be exact, and in Section 4.3 we show empirically that it is extremely efficient. The values of the heuristic can be computed once for each sentence and cached.</p><p>To implement the preference for non-local at- tachment described in Section 3.2, if two agenda items have the same cost, the one with the longer dependencies is preferred.</p><p>Intuitively, the parser first attempts to find a parse for the sentence using the 1-best category for each word, by building as complete a chart as pos- sible. If it fails to find a parse for the complete sentence, it adds one more supertag to the chart (choosing the most probable tag not already in the chart), and tries again. This strategy allows the parser to consider an unbounded number of cate- gories for each word, as it does not build a com- plete chart with all supertags.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Grammar</head><p>Here, we describe the set of combinators and unary rules in the EASYCCG grammar. Because we do not have any probabilistic model of the derivation, all rules can apply with equal probabil- ity. This means that some care needs to be taken in designing the grammar to ensure that all the rules are generally applicable. We also try to limit spurious ambiguity, and build derivations which are compatible with the C&amp;C parser's scripts for extracting dependencies (for evaluation). We de- scribe the grammar in detail, to ensure replicabil- ity.</p><p>Our parser uses the following binary combi- nators from Steedman (2012): forward applica- tion, backward application, forward composition, backward crossed composition, generalized for- ward composition, generalized backward crossed composition. These combinators are posited to be linguistically universal. The generalized rules Where Y ∈ {conj, comma, semicolon}. We block conjunctions where the right-hand category is type-raised, punctuation, N , or N P \N P . This rule (and the restrictions) could be removed by changing CCGBank to analyse conjunctions with (X\X)/X categories.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Initial Result Usage N N P Bare noun phrases N P S/(S\N P ) Type N P (S\N P )/((S\N P )/N P ) raising P P (S\N P )/((S\N P )/P P ) S</formula><note type="other">pss \N P N P \N P S ng \N P N P \N P Reduced S adj \N P N P \N P relative S to \N P N P \N P clauses S to \N P N \N S dcl /N P N P \N P S pss \N P S/S VP S ng \N P S/S Sentence S to \N P S/S Modifiers</note><p>We also add syntagmatic rules for removing any punctuation to the right, and for removing open- brackets and open-quotes to the left The grammar also contains 13 unary rules, listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. These rules were chosen based on their frequency in the training data, and their clear semantic interpretations.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Clark and Curran (2007)</ref>, we also add a (switchable) constraint that only category com- binations that have combined in the training data may combine in the test data. We found that this was necessary for evaluation, as the C&amp;C conver- sion tool for extracting predicate-argument depen- dencies had relatively low coverage on the CCG derivations produced by our parser. While this restriction is theoretically inelegant, we found it did increase parsing speed without lowering lexi-cal category accuracy.</p><p>We also use Eisner Normal Form Constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Eisner, 1996)</ref>, and Hockenmaier and Bisk's (2010) Constraint 5, which automatically rule out certain spuriously equivalent derivations, improv- ing parsing speed.</p><p>We</p><note type="other">add a hard constraint that the root category of the sentence must be a declarative sentence, a question, or a noun-phrase. This grammar is smaller and cleaner than that used by the C&amp;C parser, which uses 32 unary rules (some of which are semantically dubious, such as S[dcl] → N P \N P ), and non-standard bi- nary combinators such as merging two N P s into an N P . The C&amp;C parser also has a large num- ber of special case rules for handling punctua- tion. Our smaller grammar reduces the grammar constant, eases implementation, and simplifies the job of building downstream semantic parsers such as those of Bos (2008) or Lewis and Steedman (2013a) (which must implement semantic analogs of each syntactic rule).</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Extracting Dependency Structures</head><p>The parsing model defined in Section 3.2 re- quires us to compute unlabelled dependency trees from CCG derivations (to prefer non-local attach- ments). It is simple to extract an unlabelled depen- dency tree from a CCG parse, by defining one ar- gument of each binary rule instantiation to be the head. For forward application and (generalized) forward composition, we define the head to be the left argument, unless the left argument is an endo- centric head-passing modifier category X/X. We do the inverse for the corresponding 'backward' combinators. For punctuation rules, the head is the argument which is not punctuation, and the head of a Conjunction rule is the right-hand argument.</p><p>The standard CCG parsing evaluation uses a different concept of dependencies, correspond- ing to the predicate-argument structure defined by CCGBank. These dependencies capture a deeper information-for example by assigning both boy and girl as subjects of talk in a boy and a girl talked. We extract these dependencies using the generate program supplied with the C&amp;C parser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Pruning</head><p>Our parsing model is able to efficiently and op- timally search for the best parse. However, we found that over 80% of the run-time of our pipeline was spent during supertagging. Naively, the log-linear model needs to output a probability for each of the 425 categories. This is expensive both in terms of the number of dot products re- quired, and the cost of building the initial priority- queue for the A * parsing agenda. It is also largely unnecessary-for example, periods at the end of sentences always have the same category, but our supertagger calculates a distribution over all pos- sible categories.</p><p>Note that the motivation for introducing prun- ing here is fundamentally different from for the C&amp;C pipeline. The C&amp;C supertagger prunes the the categories so that the parser can build the com- plete set of derivations given those categories. In contrast, our parser can efficiently search large (or infinite) spaces of categories, but pruning is help- ful for making supertagging itself more efficient, and for building the initial agenda.</p><p>We therefore implemented the following strate- gies to improve efficiency:</p><p>• Only allowing at most 50 categories per word. The C&amp;C parser takes on average 1.27 tags per word (and an average of 3.57 at its loosest beam setting), so this restriction is a very mild one. Nevertheless, it considerably reduces the potential size of the agenda.</p><p>• Using a variable-width beam β which prunes categories less likely than β times the prob- ability of the best category. We set β = 0.00001, which is two orders-of-magnitude smaller than the equivalent C&amp;C beam. Again, this heuristic is useful for reducing the length of the agenda.</p><p>• Using a tag dictionary of possible categories for each word, so that weights are only cal- culated for a subset of the categories. Unlike the other methods, this approach does affect the probabilities which are calculated, as the normalizing constant is only computed for a subset of the categories. However, the proba- bility mass contained in the pruned categories is small, and it only slightly decreases pars- ing accuracy. To build the tag dictionary, we parsed 42 million sentences of Wikipedia us- ing our parser, and for all words occurring at least 500 times, we stored the set of observed word-category combinations. When parsing new sentences, these words are only allowed to occur with one of these categories.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Parsing F1-scores for labelled dependencies across a range of domains. F1 (cov) refers to results on sentences which the parser is able to parse, and F1 (all) gives results over all sentences. For the EASYCCG results, scores are only over parses where the C&amp;C dependency extraction script was successful, which was 99.3% on CCGBank, 99.5% on Wikipedia, and 100% on Bioinfer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>We trained our model on Sections 02-21 of CCG- Bank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007)</ref>, using Section 00 for development. For testing, we used Section 23 of CCGBank, a Wikipedia corpus an- notated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Honnibal and Curran (2009)</ref>, and the Bioinfer corpus of biomedical abstracts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pyysalo et al., 2007)</ref>. The latter two are out-of-domain, so are more challenging for the parsers.</p><p>We compare the performance of our model against both the C&amp;C parser, and the system de- scribed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lewis and Steedman (2014)</ref>. This model uses the same supertagger as used in EASY- CCG, but uses the C&amp;C parser for parsing, using adaptive supertagging with the default values.</p><p>All timing experiments used the same 1.8Ghz AMD machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Parsing Accuracy</head><p>Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Our parser per- forms competitively with a much more complex parsing model, and outperforms the C&amp;C pipeline on both out-of-domain datasets. This result con- firms our hypothesis that the majority of parsing decisions can be made accurately with a simple tagging model and a deterministic parser.</p><p>We see that the combination of the EASYCCG supertagger and the C&amp;C parser achieves the best accuracy across all domains. This result shows that, unsurprisingly, there is some value to hav- ing a statistical model of the dependencies that the parser is evaluated on. However, the difference is not large, particularly out-of-domain, considering that a sophisticated and complex statistical parser is being compared with a deterministic one. Our parser is also far faster than this baseline.</p><p>It is interesting that the performance gap is  much lower on out-of-domain datasets (2.8 points in domain, but only 0.65-0.75 out-of-domain), suggesting that much of the C&amp;C parser's depen- dency model is domain specific, and does not gen- eralize well to other domains. We also briefly experimented using the C&amp;C supertagger (with a beam of β = 10 −5 ) with the EASYCCG parser. Performance was much worse, with an F-score of 79.63% on the 97.8% of sen- tences it parsed on CCGBank Section 23. This shows that our model is reliant on the accuracy of the supertagger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Parsing Speed</head><p>CCG parsers have been used in distributional approaches to semantics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lewis and Steedman, 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lewis and Steedman, 2013b)</ref>, which bene- fit from large corpora. However, even though the C&amp;C parser is relatively fast, it will still take over 40 CPU-days to parse the Gigaword corpus on our hardware, which is slow enough to be an obstacle to scaling distributional semantics to larger cor- pora such as ClueWeb. Therefore, it is important to be able to parse sentences at a high speed.</p><p>We measured parsing times on Section 23 of CCGBank (after developing against Section 00), using the optimizations described in Section 4.3. We also experimented with the null heuristic, which always estimates the outside probability as being 1.0. Times exclude the time taken to load models.</p><p>Results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. The best EASY- CCG model is roughly four times faster than the C&amp;C parser 2 . Adding the tag dictionary caused accuracy to drop slightly from 83.46 to 83.37, and meant the parser failed to parse a single sentence in the test set ("Among its provisions :") but other changes did not affect accuracy. The pruning in the supertagger improves parsing speed, by limit- ing the length of the priority queue it builds for the agenda. Of course, we could use a backoff model to ensure full coverage (analogously to adaptive supertagging), but we leave that to future work. Using our A * heuristic doubles the speed of pars- ing (excluding supertagging).</p><p>To better understand the properties of our model, we also investigate how parsing time varies with sentence length. Unlike the cubic CKY al- gorithm typically used by chart parsers, our A * search potentially takes exponential time in the sentence length. For this experiment, we used the Sections 02-21 of CCGBank. Sentences were di- vided into bins of width 10, and we calculated the average parsing time for sentences in each bin.</p><p>Results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, and demon- 2 It is worth noting that the C&amp;C parser code is written in highly-optimized C++, compared to our simple Java imple- mentation. It seems likely that our parser could be made sub- stantially faster with a similar level of engineering effort.</p><p>strate that while parsing is highly efficient for sen- tences of up to 50 words (over 95% of CCGBank), it scales super-linearly with long sentences. In fact, Section 00 contains a sentence of 249 words, which took 37 seconds to parse (3 times longer than the other 1912 sentences put together). In practice, this scaling is unlikely to be problematic, as long sentences are typically filtered when pro- cessing large corpora.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Semantic Parsing</head><p>A major motivation for CCG parsing is to exploit its transparent interface to the semantics, allowing syntactic parsers to do much of the work of seman- tic parsers. Therefore, perhaps the most relevant measure of the performance of a CCG parser is its effect on the accuracy of downstream applications.</p><p>We experimented with a supervised version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reddy et al. (2014)</ref>'s model for question- answering on Freebase (i.e. without using Reddy et al.'s lexicon derived from unlabelled text), us- ing the WEBQUESTIONS dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berant et al., 2013)</ref> 3 . The model learns to map CCG parses to database queries. We compare the performance of the QA system using both our parser and C&amp;C, taking the 10-best parses from each parser for each sentence. Syntactic question parsing models were trained from the combination of 10 copies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rimell and Clark (2008)</ref>'s question dataset and one copy of the CCGBank The accuracy of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reddy et al. (2014)</ref>'s model varies significantly between iterations of the train- ing data. Rather than tune the number of iterations, we instead measure the accuracy after each iter- ation. We experimented with the models' 1-best answers, and the oracle accuracy of their 100 best answers. The oracle accuracy gives a better indi- cation of the performance of the parser, by miti- gating errors caused by the semantic component.</p><p>Results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, and demonstrate that using EASYCCG can lead to better down- stream performance than the C&amp;C parser. The im- provement is particularly large on oracle accuracy, increasing the upper bound on the performance of the semantic parser by around 4 points.</p></div>

A major contribution of our work over these is showing that factoring models on lexical cate- gories allows fast and exact A * parsing, without the need for beam search. Our parsing approach could be applied to any strongly lexicalized for- malism.</p><p>Our work fits into a tradition of attempting to simplify complex models without sacrificing per- formance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Klein and Manning (2003b)</ref> showed that unlexicalized parsers were only slightly less accurate than their lexicalized counterparts.  showed how a range of NLP tagging tasks could be performed at high accu- racy using a small feature set based on vector- space word embeddings. However, the extension of this work to phrase-structure parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Collobert, 2011)</ref> required a more complex model, and did not match the performance of traditional parsing tech- niques. We achieve state-of-the-art results using the same feature set and a simpler model by ex- ploiting CCG's lexicalized nature, which makes it more natural to delegate parsing decisions to a tag- ging model.</p><p>Other parsing research has focused on build- ing fast parsers for web-scale processing, typically using dependency grammars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nivre (2003)</ref>). CCG has some advantages over dependency gram- mars, such as supporting surface-compositional semantics. The fastest dependency parsers use an easy-first strategy, in which edges are added greedily in order of their score, with O(nlog(n)) complexity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tratz and Hovy, 2011)</ref>. This strategy is reminiscent of our A * search, which expands the chart in a best- first order. A * has higher asymptotic complexity, but finds a globally optimal solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Future Work</head><p>We believe that our model opens several interest- ing directions for future research.</p><p>One interesting angle would be to increase the amount of information in CCGBank's lexical en- tries, to further reduce the search space for the parser. For example, PP categories could be dis- tinguished with the relevant preposition as a fea- ture; punctuation and coordination could be given more detailed categories to avoid needing their own combinators, and slashes could be extended with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baldridge and Kruijff (2003)</ref>'s multi-modal extensions to limit over-generation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Honnibal and Curran (2009)</ref> show how unary rules can be lexi- calized in CCG. Such improvements may improve both the speed and accuracy of our model. Because our parser is factored on a unigram tag- ging model, it can be trained from isolated anno- tated words, and does not require annotated parse trees or full sentences. Reducing the requirements for training data eases the task for human annota- tors. It may also make the model more amenable to semi-supervised approaches to CCG parsing, which have typically focused on extending the lex- icon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Thomforde and Steedman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deoskar et al., 2014</ref>). Finally, it may make it easier to convert other annotated resources, such as UCCA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abend and Rappoport, 2013</ref>) or AMR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banarescu et al., 2013)</ref>, to CCG training data-as only specific words need to be converted, rather than full sen- tences.</p><p>Our model is weak at certain kinds of deci- sions, e.g. coordination-scope ambiguities or non- local attachments. Incorporating specific models for such decisions may improve accuracy, while still allowing fast and exact search-for example, we intend to try including <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Coppola et al. (2011)</ref>'s model for prepositional phrase attachment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>We have shown that a simple, principled, deter- ministic parser combined with a tagging model can parse an expressive linguistic formalism with high speed and accuracy. Although accuracy is not state-of-the-art on CCGBank, our model gives excellent performance on two out-of-domain datasets, and improves the accuracy of a question- answering system. We have shown that this model allows an efficient heuristic for A * parsing, which makes parsing extremely fast, and may enable logic-based distributional semantics to scale to larger corpora. Our methods are directly applica- ble to other lexicalized formalisms, such as LTAG, LFG and HPSG.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>derivation of a house in Paris in France, which yields different dependencies to Figures 1a and 1b: here, there is a dependency from in France to Paris, not house.</figDesc></figure>
