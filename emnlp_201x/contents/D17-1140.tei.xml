			<abstract>
				<p>We present the GrASP algorithm for automatically extracting patterns that characterize subtle linguistic phenomena. To that end, GrASP augments each term of input text with multiple layers of linguistic information. These different facets of the text terms are systematically combined to reveal rich patterns. We report highly promising experimental results in several challenging text analysis tasks within the field of Argumentation Mining. We believe that GrASP is general enough to be useful for other domains too.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many standard text analysis tasks can be ad- dressed relatively well while exploiting simple textual features, e.g., Bag-Of-Words representa- tion and Naive Bayes for document classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(McCallum and Nigam, 1998)</ref>. However, the iden- tification of more subtle linguistic phenomena, that are further reflected via relatively short texts -as opposed to whole documents -may require a wider spectrum of linguistic features.</p><p>The main contribution of this work is in out- lining a simple method to automatically extract rich linguistic features in the form of patterns, and demonstrate their utility on tasks related to Ar- gumentation Mining (Mochales <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Palau and Moens, 2009</ref>), although we believe that the proposed ap- proach is not limited to this domain.</p><p>Argumentation mining involves automatically identifying argumentative structures within a cor- pus -e.g., claims or conclusions, and evidence instances or premises -as well as their inter- relations. For instance, each of the following sen- tences includes a claim for a <ref type="bibr">[topic]</ref>. * First two authors contributed equally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Opponents often argue that the open primary is unconstitutional. [Open Primaries]</head><p>2. Prof. Smith suggested that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of the chosen. [Af- firmative Action] 3. The majority stated that the First Amend- ment does not guarantee the right to offend others. <ref type="bibr">[Freedom of Speech]</ref> These sentences share almost no words in com- mon, however, they are similar at a more abstract level. A human observer may notice the follow- ing underlying common structure, or pattern: We present GrASP, standing for GReedy Aug- mented Sequential Patterns, an algorithm that aims to automatically capture such underlying struc- tures of the given data. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the pat- tern that GrASP may find for the above examples, along with its matches in those texts. Such pat- terns can then be used to detect the existence of the phenomenon in new texts.</p><p>The algorithm starts with augmenting the terms of the input with various layers of attributes, such as hypernyms from WordNet <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>, named entity types, and domain knowledge (Sec- tion 3.1). This multi-layered representation en- ables GrASP to consider many facets of each term. Next, it finds the most indicative attributes (Sec- tion 3.2) and iteratively grows patterns by blend- ing information from different attributes (Sec- tion 3.3). A greedy step is performed at the end of each iteration, when the algorithm only keeps the top k patterns, ranked by their predictive power. This results with a set of cross-layered patterns whose match in a given text instance suggests the appearance, or the non-appearance, of the target phenomenon.</p><p>Researchers can add layers of attributes of dif- ferent kinds without being worried about which of <ref type="bibr">[noun]</ref> [express] <ref type="bibr">[that]</ref> [  them are useful for the detection of the target phe- nomenon, and how to combine them. GrASP per- forms feature selection while generating complex patterns out of these attributes that best capture as- pects of the target phenomenon. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In experiments over different argumentation mining tasks, we show that GrASP outperforms classical techniques, and boosts full argumenta- tion mining systems when added to them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>While some aspects of GrASP were considered in the past, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has presented a framework that allows users to: (i) easily add any type of attribute to the pat- tern alphabet, and (ii) consider all attributes when searching for patterns. GrASP provides a frame- work to integrate information from different lay- ers, choosing the best combination to produce highly expressive patterns.</p><p>The alphabet of Hearst (1992) patterns is mainly stop words and noun-phrase tags, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Snow et al. (2004)</ref> add syntactic relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yangarber et al. (2000)</ref> consider a larger set of attributes (e.g., named entities, numeric expressions), how- ever they commit to one generalization of each term. In contrast, we do not limit our alphabet and systematically consider all attributes of each term. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Riloff and Wiebe (2003)</ref> start with a small set of syntactic templates, composed of a single syntac- tic relation and a single POS tag, to learn a variety of lexicalized patterns that match these templates. RAPIER <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Califf and Mooney, 2003)</ref> constraints are similar to our attributes, but are basic (surface form, POS tag, and hypernyms only), and expand- ing them will exponentially increase its complex- ity. In contrast, adding attributes to GrASP only increment runtime linearly (see Section 3.2).</p><p>To summarize, prior works usually have a basic alphabet and commit to one rule to generalize each term. Commonly, they do not allow gaps between their elements, nor assigning several attributes to a 1 Get GrASP cloud service at http://ibm.biz/graspULP single element of the pattern.</p><p>Such characteristics are presented in sequential patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal and Srikant, 1995</ref>) which are mainly used for data mining and rarely for un- structured text (Jindal and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Liu, 2006</ref>). GrASP also has these characteristics, and in addition it can learn negative patterns, indicating that the exam- ined text does not contain the target phenomenon.</p><p>The phenomena we target are from the area of Argumentation Mining (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lippi and Torroni (2016)</ref> for a survey). We focus on open-domain argument extraction. In this context,  detect claims relevant to a debatable topic, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lippi and Torroni (2015)</ref> defined the context- independent claim detection task, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rinott et al. (2015)</ref> introduced the context dependent evidence detection task (which is further split into differ- ent types of evidence, e.g., a study that supports a claim or a relevant expert testimony). These tasks aim to capture a subtle and rare linguistic phe- nomenon within large corpora, hence are suitable for demonstrating the potential of GrASP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The GrASP Algorithm</head><p>The algorithm depicted in Algorithm 1. Its input is a set of positive and negative examples for the target phenomenon. The output is a ranked list of patterns, aiming to indicate the presence -or ab- sence -of this phenomenon. In the following, a pattern is considered to be matched in a text iff all its elements are found in it, in the specified order, possibly with gaps between them, within a win- dow of size w.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Multi-Layered Term Representations</head><p>Consider the verbs (argue/suggest/state) in the ex- amples in Section 1. Using the POS tag verb to generalize them will end up with an overly gen- eral representation, while their hypernym, express, offers a better level of generalization.</p><p>Aiming to formalize this intuition, we start by augmenting each term in the input with a variety of linguistic attributes such as its POS tag, its syntac-Algorithm 1: The GrASP algorithm.</p><p>Input: positive/negative text examples, k1, k2, maxLen Output: a ranked list of patterns 1 (pos, neg) ← augment(positives, negatives) 2 attributes ← extractAttributes(pos, neg) 3 alphabet ← chooseT opK(attributes, k1) 4 patterns ← alphabet 5 last ← patterns 6 for length ← 2 to maxLen do tic relation in a parse tree, and semantic attributes such as its hypernyms, WordNet superclasses, in- dications whether it is a named entity, and whether it bears a sentiment. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> This attributes set can serve as a starting point for many text analysis tasks.</p><p>In addition, GrASP allows to add task-specific attributes. Thus, for context-dependent arguments detection we add boolean attributes indicating whether the term is related to the topic, whether it appears in a lexicon characterizing argumentative texts, or in a lexicon characterizing the topic. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> After augmentation, the representation of argue, from the first example, is: [argue, VB, hypernyms={present, state, express}, in claim lexicon, root node, supeclass = communication].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Defining the Patterns Alphabet</head><p>The augmented representation, described above, is the first step (line 1 in Algorithm 1). Next, we define the alphabet of attributes that will be used to compose longer patterns (lines 2-3). To that end, we first discard non-frequent attributes that are matched in less than t 1 of all input examples.</p><p>Then, we sort all remaining attributes by their information gain (Mitchell, 1997) with the label, and select the top k 1 attributes. We discard re- dundant attributes whose correlation to some pre- viously selected attribute is above t 2 , measured by the normalized mutual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cover and Thomas, 2006</ref>). The selected k 1 attributes consti- tute the alphabet of the algorithm, or "patterns" of length 1. Note that considering additional at- tributes only affects this first iteration, and only increases it linearly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Growing Patterns</head><p>Learning longer patterns is done by iteratively growing patterns selected in previous iterations, keeping only the most indicative ones (lines 6-13). We apply two methods for growing a pattern, p (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[noun]</ref>) w.r.t. an attribute a (e.g., obj): (i) grow right -add a as another term in the pattern (i.e., <ref type="bibr">[noun]</ref>[obj]); (ii) grow inside -add a as an- other attribute to the last term of p, making it more specific (i.e., <ref type="bibr">[noun,obj]</ref>). After each iteration (line 13), the top k 2 patterns are kept (after sort- ing by information gain and discarding redundant ones). Iterations continue till reaching maxLen.</p><p>Since GrASP relies on information gain for sorting, it can identify indicative negative patterns, implying that the target phenomenon is less likely to be presented in the examined example if such patterns were matched in it.</p><p>GrASP can be seen as a simple formal interface, allowing the user to examine a wide range of infor- mation sources letting the algorithm to select and combine them all and come up with the most use- ful patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation and Results</head><p>In the following experiments we used a logistic re- gression classifier on top of the extracted patterns. Each pattern is used as a binary feature, which re- ceives value of 1 iff it is matched in the candidate.</p><p>To demonstrate the robustness of the this ap- proach, in all experiments we report the results of a single configuration of GrASP parameters, selected based on a quick analysis over a small portion of the claim-sentence detection data (task (a) below). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Specifically, we used minimal fre- quency threshold t 1 = 0.005, correlation threshold t 2 = 0.5, size of the alphabet k 1 = 100, number of patterns in the output k 2 = 100, maximal pattern length maxLen = 5, and window size w = 10.</p><p>This configuration is by no means the optimal one, and we saw that by carefully tuning the pa- rameters per task, results were improved.   </p><note type="other">) Claim sentence (b) Expert evidence (c) Study</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Direct Evaluation</head><p>We consider three context-dependent argumenta- tion mining tasks: (a) Claim sentence detection ( ), (b) Expert evidence detection, and (c) Study evidence detection. The latter two tasks are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rinott et al. (2015)</ref>, where the goal is to detect sentences that can be used as an evidence to support/contest the topic. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The benchmark data for these tasks was ex- tracted from the data released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rinott et al. (2015)</ref>, consisting of 547 Wikipedia articles in which claims and evidence instances were manu- ally annotated, in the context of 58 debatable top- ics. In all tasks the data is highly skewed towards negative examples (only 2.5% of 80.5K instances are positives in task (a), 4% of 55.6K in task (b), and 3.7% of 31.8K in task (c)), making these tasks especially challenging.</p><p>As ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rinott et al., 2015</ref>) we use a leave-one-topic-out schema; training over 57 topics, testing over the left out topic.</p><p>Our group develops debate supportive technolo- gies which can assist humans to reason, make de- cisions, or persuade others. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Since in this scenario humans mainly consider top results (similar to information retrieval), precision is more relevant than recall. Thus, we report the macro-averaged Precision@K, where K ∈ {5, 10, 20}.</p><p>We considered the following baselines: Naive Bayes: over BOW representation, dis- carding unigrams which appear less than 10 times.</p><p>Basic Patterns: a baseline that reflects com- mon practices in the literature where a pattern is a consecutive ordered list of stop words or POS tags. We add a symbol for topic match (for the context-dependent tasks). A brute force process generates all possible patterns up to size maxLen and selects top k by the same procedure as GrASP. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We did not examine the Anecdotal type due to the small size of the available benchmark data. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> for more details see IBM Debating Technologies.</p><p>For each task we report the best results obtained with k ∈ {50, 100, .., 400}.</p><p>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): fol- lowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Vinyals and Le, 2015)</ref> we used CNN whose input is a concatenation of the topic and the candidate. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The final state vec- tor is fed to a LR soft-max layer. Cross-entropy loss function was used for training. The embed- ding layer was initialized using word2vec vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. Hyper-parameters were tuned on the same portion of the dataset as used by GrASP for tuning.</p><p>For these baselines, we are not aware of avail- able methods to incorporate GrASP multi-layered representation.</p><p>GrASP alphabet: a simplified version of GrASP which uses the chosen alphabet, or "pat- terns" of length 1. This baseline does utilize all the information available for GrASP. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows that Naive Bayes performance is the lowest, demonstrating that a simple represen- tation is not sufficient for such complex tasks. Us- ing Basic patterns yields better performance, and CNN performs even better. GrASP alphabet out- performs CNN, indicating the potential of explic- itly incorporating linguistic information. Finally, using the patterns extracted by GrASP outper- forms all other methods, emphasizing the added value of constructing patterns over the initial con- tribution of the multi-layered representation.</p><p>GrASP provides an easy way to analyze the im- portance of each attribute by inspecting its score at the end of the first iteration, the one which de- termines the alphabet. For example, PERCENT score was very high in the alphabet for Study evi- dence patterns (task b), and Person and Organiza- tion were ranked high in the alphabet of the Expert evidence (task c). Still, these three named enti-system P@5 P@10 P@20 P@50 R@50 <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Levy14  - - - 18  40  Levy14-rep</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Adding GrASP to a full claim detection system.</p><p>Significant results in comparison to Levy14-rep are marked by * (paired t-test with p &lt; 0.02).</p><p>ties were not selected as part of the alphabet for Claim sentences (task a) -reflecting the impor- tance of PERCENT in sentences describing stud- ies and their numeric results, and the importance of authoritative source (either Person or Organi- zation) in evidence based on expert testimonies. For task (a) we performed two ablation tests, each of them yielded a decrease in performance: (i) not limiting the match of a pattern in a window (a decrease of 10.3 for P@5 and 2.8 for P@20), and (ii) not enforcing the order defined by the pat- tern (a decrease of 7.6 for P@5 and 2.8 for P@20).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Indirect Evaluation</head><p>In this evaluation we add GrASP patterns as ad- ditional features to the full claim detection system of  to inspect their contribution. This evaluation is performed on a second claim de- tection benchmark (on which they have reported results), released by  (1,387 annotated claims associated with 33 topics).</p><p>The system of  is comprised of a cascade of three components; (i) detecting sen- tences which contain claims, (ii) identifying the exact boundaries of the claim part within the sen- tence, and (iii) ranking the claim candidates. Each of these components applies a classifier over ded- icated features. Results were reported for the full cascade and for the first component, which is our task (a). For an idea on how to adapt GrASP for the claim boundaries detection task, see Section 5. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> presents measures reported in  (right hand side) as well as additional measures which reflect the focus of this work on the precision of the top ranked candidates (perfor- mance of all systems on P@200 and R@200 were comparable and were omitted due to space lim- itations). The system of , de- noted Levy14, and our reproduction of it, denoted Levy14-rep, obtained comparable results. 8 <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We reproduced their work to perform significant test and report the additional measures.</p><p>Evidently, utilizing GrASP patterns alone achieve similar performance as Levy14-rep. Con- sidering the fact that Levy14-rep is a full sys- tem, tailored for claim detection via a lengthy feature engineering process, these results, ob- tained using only GrASP patterns, are promising. Adding GrASP features to Levy14-rep, denoted Combined, we observe a significant improvement, demonstrating their complementary value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>GrASP extracts rich patterns that characterize sub- tle linguistic phenomena. It exploits a wide variety of information layers in a unified manner, iden- tifying the most discriminative attributes for the given task, and greedily composes them into pat- terns. We demonstrated GrASP significant impact on several argumentation mining tasks.</p><p>As this was not the focus of this work, we chose standard statistical criteria to sort the candidate patterns and to filter redundant ones. Considering other criteria, and also more sophisticated search strategies to explore the huge space of possible patterns, is left for future work.</p><p>In addition to their value in classification tasks, the patterns revealed by GrASP are easy to in- terpret, in contrast to alternative techniques, like Deep Learning. Thus, these patterns can provide researchers with additional insights regarding the target phenomenon. These insights can be inte- grated back to by considering additional attributes to be explored in subsequent runs. Thus, GrASP can significantly expedite the research process, es- pecially when addressing novel tasks.</p><p>Finally, we would like to hint on a sequel work that demonstrates how GrASP can be easily mod- ified to address another important task -detecting the claim boundaries within its surrounding sen- tence (see italic text in the examples in Section 1). To cope with this unique task, we enhance the term representation (Section 3.1), by tripling each at- tribute a to distinguish between its appearance be- fore (PRE-a), within <ref type="figure">(IN-a)</ref>, or after (POST-a) the candidate claim boundaries. With this change only, GrASP was able to identify patterns for this new task, that were used to indicate the boundaries of a claim with promising preliminary results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[someone][argue/suggest/state][that] [topic term][sentiment term]</figDesc></figure>
