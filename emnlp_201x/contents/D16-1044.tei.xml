				<p>Modeling textual or visual information with vector representations trained from large language or visual datasets has been successfully explored in recent years. However, tasks such as visual question answering require combining these vector representations with each other. Approaches to multimodal pooling include element-wise product or sum, as well as con-catenation of the visual and textual representations. We hypothesize that these methods are not as expressive as an outer product of the visual and textual vectors. As the outer product is typically infeasible due to its high dimensionality, we instead propose utilizing Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to efficiently and expressively combine multi-modal features. We extensively evaluate MCB on the visual question answering and grounding tasks. We consistently show the benefit of MCB over ablations without MCB. For visual question answering, we present an architecture which uses MCB twice, once for predicting attention over spatial features and again to combine the attended representation with the question representation. This model out-performs the state-of-the-art on the Visual7W dataset and the VQA challenge.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Representation learning for text and images has been extensively studied in recent years. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used to represent sen- tences or phrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref>   2015), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown to work best to represent images <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Donahue et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">He et al., 2015</ref>). For tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and visual ground- ing, most approaches require joining the represen- tation of both modalities. For combining the two vector representations (multimodal pooling), current approaches in VQA or grounding rely on concatenat- ing vectors or applying element-wise sum or product. While this generates a joint representation, it might not be expressive enough to fully capture the complex associations between the two different modalities.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to rely on Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to get a joint repre- sentation. Bilinear pooling computes the outer prod- uct between two vectors, which allows, in contrast to element-wise product, a multiplicative interaction between all elements of both vectors. Bilinear pool- ing models <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tenenbaum and Freeman, 2000</ref>) have recently been shown to be beneficial for fine-grained classification for vision only tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lin et al., 2015)</ref>. However, given their high dimensionality (n 2 ), bi- linear pooling has so far not been widely used. In this paper, we adopt the idea from  which shows how to efficiently compress bilinear pooling for a single modality. In this work, we dis- cuss and extensively evaluate the extension to the multimodal case for text and visual modalities. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) is approximated by randomly pro- jecting the image and text representations to a higher dimensional space (using Count Sketch ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charikar et al., 2002)</ref>) and then convolving both vectors effi- ciently by using element-wise product in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) space. We use MCB to predict an- swers for the VQA task and locations for the visual grounding task. For open-ended question answering, we present an architecture for VQA which uses MCB twice, once to predict spatial attention and the second time to predict the answer. For multiple-choice ques- tion answering we introduce a third MCB to relate the encoded answer to the question-image space. Addi- tionally, we discuss the benefit of attention maps and additional training data for the VQA task. To sum- marize, MCB is evaluated on two tasks, four datasets, and with a diverse set of ablations and comparisons to the state-of-the-art.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Multimodal pooling. Current approaches to mul- timodal pooling involve element-wise operations or vector concatenation. In the visual question answer- ing domain, a number of models have been proposed. Simpler models such as iBOWIMG baseline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhou et al., 2015</ref>) use concatenation and fully connected layers to combine the image and question modali- ties. Stacked Attention Networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Yang et al., 2015)</ref> and Spatial Memory Networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xu et al., 2015)</ref> use LSTMs or extract soft-attention on the image fea- tures, but ultimately use element-wise product or element-wise sum to merge modalities. D-NMN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreas et al., 2016a</ref>) introduced REINFORCE to dy- namically create a network and use element-wise product to join attentions and element-wise sum pre- dict answers. Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN) ( <ref type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2016)</ref> pool the image and question with element-wise product and sum, attending to part of the image and question with an Episodic Mem- ory Module ( <ref type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</ref>). DPPnet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Noh et al., 2015</ref>) creates a Parameter Prediction Network which learns to predict the parameters of the second to last visual recognition layer dynamically from the question. Similar to this work, DPPnet allows mul- tiplicative interactions between the visual and ques- tion encodings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lu et al. (2016)</ref> recently proposed a model that extracts multiple co-attentions on the image and question and combines the co-attentions in a hierarchical manner using element-wise sum, concatenation, and fully connected layers. For the visual grounding task, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rohrbach et al. (2016)</ref> propose an approach where the language phrase embedding is concatenated with the visual features in order to predict the attention weights over multiple bounding box proposals. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hu et al. (2016a)</ref> concatenate phrase embeddings with vi- sual features at different spatial locations to obtain a segmentation.</p><p>Bilinear pooling. Bilinear pooling has been ap- plied to the fine-grained visual recognition task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lin et al. (2015)</ref> use two CNNs to extract features from an image and combine the resulting vectors using an outer product, which is fully connected to an output layer.  address the space and time complexity of bilinear features by viewing the bilin- ear transformation as a polynomial kernel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pham and Pagh (2013)</ref> describe a method to approximate the polynomial kernel using Count Sketches and convo- lutions.</p><p>Joint multimodal embeddings. In order to model similarities between two modalities, many prior works have learned joint multimodal spaces, or em- beddings. Some of such embeddings are based on Canonical Correlation Analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hardoon et al., 2004</ref>) e.g. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gong et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klein et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Plummer et al., 2015</ref>), linear models with ranking loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Frome et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Weston et al., 2011</ref>) or non-linear deep learning models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kiros et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ngiam et al., 2011</ref>). Our multimodal com- pact bilinear pooling can be seen as a complementary operation that allows us to capture different interac- tions between two modalities more expressively than e.g. concatenation. Consequently, many embedding learning approaches could benefit from incorporating such interactions.</p><p>0 -x n1 ... 0 -x 1 0 0 x 2 -q 2 0 ... q 4 0 0 q n2 q 9 q 1 q 2 ... q n2</p><p>x 1 x 2 ... </p></div>

This can be formulated asâ</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">asˆasâ = argmax a∈A p(a|x, q; θ)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with parameters θ and the set of answers or loca- tions A. For an image embedding x = Ξ(x) (i.e. a CNN) and question embedding q = Ω(q) (i.e. an LSTM), we are interested in getting a good joint rep- resentation by pooling both representations. With a multimodal pooling Φ(x, q) that encodes the relation- ship between x and q well, it becomes easier to learn a classifier for Equation (1). In this section, we first discuss our multimodal pooling Φ for combining representations from differ- ent modalities into a single representation (Sec. 3.1) and then detail our architectures for VQA (Sec. 3.2) and visual grounding (Sec. 3.3), further explaining how we predictâpredictˆpredictâ with the given image representation Ξ and text representation Ω.</p></div>

However, the high dimensional representation (i.e. when n 1 and n 2 are large) leads to an infeasible number of parameters to learn in W . For example, we use n 1 = n 2 = 2048 and z ∈ R 3000 for VQA. W thus would have 12.5 billion parameters, which leads to very high memory consumption and high computation times.</p><p>We thus need a method that projects the outer prod- uct to a lower dimensional space and also avoids computing the outer product directly. As suggested by  for a single modality, we rely on the Count Sketch projection function Ψ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Charikar et al., 2002</ref>), which projects a vector v ∈ R n to y ∈ R d . We initialize two vectors s ∈ {−1, 1} n and h ∈ {1, ..., d} n : s contains either 1 or −1 for each index, and h maps each index i in the input v to an index j in the output y. Both s and h are initialized randomly from a uniform distribution and remain constant for future invocations of count sketch. y is initialized as a zero vector. This allows us to project the outer product to a lower dimensional space, which reduces the number of parameters in W . To avoid computing the outer product explicitly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pham and Pagh (2013)</ref> showed that the count sketch of the outer product of two vectors can be expressed as convolution of both count sketches:  where * is the convolution operator. Additionally, the convolution theorem states that convolution in the time domain is equivalent to element-wise product in the frequency domain. The convolution x * q can be rewritten as FFT −1 (FFT(x ) FFT(q )), where refers to element-wise product. These ideas are summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and formalized in Algorithm 1, which is based on the Tensor Sketch algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pham and Pagh (2013)</ref>. We invoke the algorithm with v 1 = x and v 2 = q. We note that this easily extends and remains efficient for more than two multi-modal inputs as the combination happens as element-wise product.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ψ(x ⊗ q, h, s) = Ψ(x, h, s) * Ψ(q, h, s), 1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Architectures for VQA</head><p>In VQA, the input to the model is an image and a question, and the goal is to answer the question. Our model extracts representations for the image and the question, pools the vectors using MCB, and arrives at the answer by treating the problem as a multi-class classification problem with 3,000 possible classes.</p><p>We extract image features using a 152-layer Resid- ual Network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">He et al., 2015</ref>) that is pretrained on ImageNet data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Deng et al., 2009</ref>). Images are re- sized to 448 × 448, and we use the output of the layer ("pool5") before the 1000-way classifier. We then perform L 2 normalization on the 2048-D vector.</p><p>Input questions are first tokenized into words, and the words are one-hot encoded and passed through a learned embedding layer. The tanh nonlinearity is used after the embedding. The embedding layer is followed by a 2-layer LSTM with 1024 units in each layer. The outputs of each LSTM layer are concatenated to form a 2048-D vector.</p><p>The two vectors are then passed through MCB. The MCB is followed by an element-wise signed square-root and L 2 normalization. After MCB pool- ing, a fully connected layer connects the resulting 16,000-D multimodal representation to the 3,000 top answers.</p><p>Attention. To incorporate spatial information, we use soft attention on our MCB pooling method. Ex- plored by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xu et al., 2015</ref>) for image captioning and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Xu and Saenko, 2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Yang et al., 2015)</ref> for VQA, the soft attention mechanism can be easily integrated in our model.</p><p>For each spatial grid location in the visual rep- resentation (i.e. last convolutional layer of ResNet [res5c], last convolutional layer of VGG [conv5]), we use MCB pooling to merge the slice of the visual feature with the language representation. As depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, after the pooling we use two convolu- tional layers to predict the attention weight for each grid location. We apply softmax to produce a nor- malized soft attention map. We then take a weighted sum of the spatial vectors using the attention map to create the attended visual representation. We also ex- periment with generating multiple attention maps to allow the model to make multiple "glimpses" which are concatenated before being merged with the lan- guage representation through another MCB pooling for prediction. Predicting attention maps with MCB pooling allows the model to effectively learn how to attend to salient locations based on both the visual and language representations.</p><p>Answer Encoding. For VQA with multiple choices, we can additionally embed the answers. We Q : "What do you see?" (Ground Truth : a3) a1 : "A courtyard with flowers" a2 : "A restaurant kitchen" a3 : "A family with a stroller, tables for dining" a4 : "People waiting on a train" a1 a2 a3 a4 In addition to using MCB with attention, we use an additional MCB pooling to merge the encoded an- swer choices with the multimodal representation of the original pipeline. The resulting embedding is projected to a classification vector with a dimension equal to the number of answers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Architecture for Visual Grounding</head><p>We base our grounding approach on the fully- supervised version of GroundeR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rohrbach et al., 2016)</ref>. The overview of our model is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 5</ref>. The input to the model is a query natural language phrase and an image along with multiple proposal bounding boxes. The goal is to predict a bounding box which corresponds to the query phrase. We replace the concatenation of the visual representa- tion and the encoded phrase in GroundeR with MCB to combine both modalities. In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rohrbach et al. (2016)</ref>, we include a linear embedding of the visual representation and L 2 normalization of both in- put modalities, instead of batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), which we found to be beneficial when using MCB for the grounding task.</p></div>

Compared to the VQA dataset, Vi- sual Genome represents a more balanced distribu- tion of the 6W question types. Moreover, the aver- age question and answer lengths for Visual Genome are larger than the VQA dataset. To leverage the Visual Genome dataset as additional training data, we remove all the unnecessary words such as "a", "the", and "it is" from the answers to decrease the length of the answers and extract QA pairs whose answers are single-worded.

For the experiments in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref> and 2, we train on the VQA train split, vali- date on the VQA validation split, and report results on the VQA test-dev split.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablation Results</head><p>We compare the performance of non-bilinear and bilinear pooling methods in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref>. We see that MCB pooling outperforms all non-bilinear pooling methods, such as eltwise sum, concatenation, and eltwise product. One could argue that the compact bilinear method simply has more parameters than the non-bilinear pooling methods, which contributes to its perfor- mance. We compensated for this by stacking fully connected layers (with 4096 units per layer, ReLU activation, and dropout) after the non-bilinear pool- ing methods to increase their number of parameters. However, even with similar parameter budgets, non- bilinear methods could not achieve the same accuracy as the MCB method. For example, the "Concatena- tion + FC + FC" pooling method has approximately 4096 2 + 4096 2 + 4096 × 3000 ≈ 46 million pa- rameters, which matches the 48 million parameters available in MCB with d = 16000. However, the per- formance of the "Concatenation + FC + FC" method is only 57.10% compared to MCB's 59.83%.</p><p>Section 2 in  linear pooling has no impact on accuracy compared to full bilinear pooling. Section 3 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref> demon- strates that the MCB brings improvements regardless of the image CNN used. We primarily use ResNet- 152 in this paper, but MCB also improves perfor- mance if VGG-19 is used. Section 4 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref> shows that our soft attention model works best with MCB pooling. In fact, attending to the Concatenation + FC layer has the same performance as not using attention at all, while attending to the MCB layer improves performance by 2.67 points. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> compares different values of d, the output dimensionality of the multimodal compact bilinear feature. Approximating the bilinear feature with a 16,000-D vector yields the highest accuracy.</p><p>We also evaluated models with multiple atten- tion maps or channels. One attenion map achieves 64.67%, two 65.08% and four 64.24% accuracy (trained on train+val). Visual inspection of the gen- erated attention maps reveals that an ensembling or smoothing effect occurs when using multiple maps. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> presents results for the Visual7W multiple- choice QA task. The MCB with attention model out- performs the previous state-of-the-art by 7.9 points overall and performs better in almost every category. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref> compares our approach with the state-of-the- art on VQA test set. Our best single model uses MCB pooling with two attention maps. Additionally, we augment our training data with images and QA pairs from the Visual Genome dataset. We also con- catenate the learned word embedding with pretrained GloVe vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experimental Setup</head><p>In all experiments we use Adam solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) with learning rate = 0.0001. The embed- ding size is 500 both for visual and language embed- dings. We use d = 2048 in the MCB pooling, which we found to work best for the visual grounding task. The accuracy is measured as percentage of query phrases which have been localized correctly. The phrase is localized correctly if the predicted bound- ing box overlaps with the ground-truth bounding box by more than 50% intersection over union (IOU). <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Tables 5 and 6</ref> summarize our results in the visual grounding task. We present multiple ablations of our proposed architecture. First, we replace the MCB with simple concatenation of the embedded visual feature and the embedded phrase, resulting in 46.5% on the Flickr30k Entities and 25.48% on the Refer- ItGame datasets. The results can be improved by replacing the concatenation with the element-wise product of both embedded features (47.41% and 27.80%). We can further slightly increase the per- formance by introducing additional 2048-D convo- lution after the element-wise product (47.86% and 27.98%). However, even with fewer parameters, our MCB pooling significantly improves over this base- line on both datasets, reaching state-of-the-art accu- racy of 48.69% on Flickr30k Entities and 28.91% on ReferItGame dataset. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6 (</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We propose the Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pool- ing (MCB) to combine visual and text representa- tions. For visual question answering, our architecture with attention and multiple MCBs gives significant improvements on two VQA datasets compared to state-of-the-art. In the visual grounding task, in- troducing MCB pooling leads to improved phrase localization accuracy, indicating better interaction between query phrase representations and visual rep- resentations of proposal bounding boxes. The code to replicate our experiments is available at https: //github.com/akirafukui/vqa-mcb.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for visual question answering.</figDesc></figure>

4.1 Datasets 

The Visual Question Answering (VQA) real-image 
dataset (Antol et al., 2015) consists of approximately 
200,000 MSCOCO images (Lin et al., 2014), with 
3 questions per image and 10 answers per question. 
There are 3 data splits: train (80K images), validation 
(40K images), and test (80K images). Additionally, 
there is a 25% subset of test named test-dev. Ac-
curacies for ablation experiments in this paper are 
reported on the test-dev data split. We use the VQA 
tool provided by Antol et al. (2015) for evaluation. 
We conducted most of our experiments on the open-
ended real-image task. In Table 4, we also report our 
multiple-choice real-image scores. 
The Visual Genome dataset (Krishna et al., 
2016) uses 108,249 images from the intersection of 
YFCC100M (Thomee et al., 2015) and MSCOCO. 
For each image, an average of 17 question-answer 
pairs are collected. There are 1.7 million QA pairs 
of the 6W question types (</table></figure>
