				<p>Natural language acquisition relies on appropriate generalization: the ability to produce novel sentences, while learning to restrict productions to acceptable forms in the language. Psycholinguists have proposed various properties that might play a role in guiding appropriate generalizations, looking at learning of verb alternations as a testbed. Several computational cognitive models have explored aspects of this phenomenon, but their results are hard to compare given the high variability in the linguistic properties represented in their input. In this paper, we directly compare two recent approaches, a Bayesian model and a connectionist model, in their ability to repli-cate human judgments of appropriate generalizations. We find that the Bayesian model more accurately mimics the judgments due to its richer learning mechanism that can exploit distributional properties of the input in a manner consistent with human behaviour.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Native speakers of a language are mostly able to generalize appropriately beyond the observed data while avoiding overgeneralizations. A testbed area for studying generalization behavior in language ac- quisition is verb alternations -i.e., learning the pat- terns of acceptability of alternative constructions for expressing similar meanings. For example, English speakers readily use a new verb like text in both the double-object (DO) construction ("text me the de- tails") and the prepositional-dative (PD) ("text the details to me") -an instance of the dative alterna- tion. However, speakers avoid overgeneralizing the DO construction to verbs such as explain that resist its use ("?explain me the details"), even though they occur with analogous arguments in the PD alterna- tive ("explain the details to me"). Psycholinguis- tic studies have focused on the possible properties of natural language that enable such generalization while constraining it to acceptable forms.</p><p>Initially, children are linguistically conservative: they generally use verbs in constructions that are very close to exemplars in the input ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lieven et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akhtar, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tomasello, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Boyd and Goldberg, 2009)</ref>. Children reach adult-like com- petence by gradually forming more general as- sociations of constructions to meaning that allow them to extend verb usages to unwitnessed forms. Much work has emphasized the role of verb classes that capture the regularities across semantically- similar verbs, enabling appropriate generalization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pinker, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fisher, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ambridge et al., 2008)</ref>. Usage-based approaches have argued that such class-based behaviour can arise in learning through the clustering of observed usages that share semantic and syntactic properties (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bybee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tomasello, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Goldberg, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>A number of studies also reveal that the statistical properties of the language play a central role in lim- iting generalization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bresnan and Ford, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ambridge et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al., , 2014</ref>). Individual verbs of- ten show statistical biases that favor their appear- ance in one construction over another ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ford et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">MacDonald et al., 1994</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Garnsey et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Trueswell et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Losiewicz, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gahl and Garnsey, 2004</ref>). For example, while both give and push can occur in either DO or PD constructions, give strongly favors the DO construction ("give me the box"), while push strongly favors the PD ("push the box to me") <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wasow, 2002</ref>). Generally, the more frequent a verb is overall, the less likely speak- ers are to extend it to an unobserved construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Braine and Brooks, 1995)</ref>. In addition, when a verb repeatedly occurs in one construction when an al- ternative construction could have been appropriate, speakers appear to learn that the verb is inappropri- ate in the alternative, regardless of its overall fre- quency <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goldberg, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Given these observations, it has been argued that both the semantic and statistical properties of a verb underlie its degree of acceptability in alternat- ing constructions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Braine and Brooks, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Theakston, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al., 2014)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref> propose a computa- tional model designed to study the role of verb se- mantics and frequency in the acquisition of the da- tive alternation. However, they only evaluate their model preferences for one of the two constructions, which does not provide a full picture of the alterna- tion behaviour; moreover, they incorporate certain assumptions about the input that may not match the properties of naturalistic data.</p><p>In this paper, we compare the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref> to the Bayesian model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barak et al. (2014)</ref> that offers a general framework of verb construction learning. We replicate the approach taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref> in order to provide appropriate comparisons, but we also extend the experimental settings and analysis to enable a more fulsome evaluation, on data with more natu- ralistic statistical properties. Our results show that the Bayesian model provides a better fit to the psy- cholinguistic data, which we suggest is due to its richer learning mechanism: its two-level clustering approach can exploit distributional properties of the input in a manner consistent with human generaliza- tion behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Acquisition of the dative alternation -use of the DO and PD constructions with analogous semantic argu- ments -has been studied in several computational cognitive models because it illustrates how people learn to appropriately generalize linguistic construc- tions in the face of complex, interacting factors. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al. (2014)</ref>, such models should capture influences of the verb such as its se- mantic properties, its overall frequency, and its fre- quency in various constructions.</p><p>A focus of computational models has been to show under what conditions a learner generalizes to the DO construction having observed a verb in the PD, and vice versa. For example, the hierar- chical Bayesian models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Perfors et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Parisien and Stevenson (2010)</ref> show the ability to generalize from one construction to the other. How- ever, both models are limited in their semantic repre- sentations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Perfors et al. (2010)</ref> use semantic prop- erties that directly (albeit noisily) encode the knowl- edge of the alternating and non-alternating (DO- only or PD-only) classes. The model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Parisien and Stevenson (2010)</ref> addresses this limitation by learn- ing alternation classes from the data (including the dative), but it uses only syntactic slot features that can be gleaned automatically from a corpus. In ad- dition, both models use batch processing, failing to address how learning to generalize across an alter- nation might be achieved incrementally. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alishahi and Stevenson (2008)</ref> presents an in- cremental Bayesian model shown to capture vari- ous aspects of verb argument structure acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alishahi and Pyykko¨nenPyykko¨nen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barak et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barak et al., , 2013b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Matusevych et al., 2016</ref>), but the model is unable to mimic alternation learning behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barak et al. (2014)</ref> extends this construction- learning model to incrementally learn both construc- tions and classes of alternating verbs, and show the role of the classes in learning the dative. However, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Parisien and Stevenson (2010)</ref>, the input to the model in this study is limited to syntactic properties, not allowing for a full analysis of the relevant factors that influence acquisition of alternations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref> propose the first computational model of this phenomenon to include a rich representation of the verb/construction seman- tics, drawn from human judgments. In evaluation, however, they only report the ability of the model to predict the DO usage (i.e., only one pair of the alternation), which does not give the full picture of the alternation behaviour. Moreover, their assump- tions about the nature of the input -including the use of raw vs. log frequencies and the treatment of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ruh and Westermann (2009)</ref>.) The input nodes correspond to the se- mantic properties of the verbs, the verb lexemes, and a "transfer" node (explained in the text). The output nodes correspond to the target constructions.</p><p>non-dative construction usages -differ from earlier models, making it difficult to compare the results.</p><p>In this paper, we compare the models of Am- bridge and Blything (2015) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barak et al. (2014)</ref>, using the same input settings for each, so that, for the first time, two computational models of this gen- eralization phenomenon can be directly compared. Moreover, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref> and in line with the other studies mentioned above, we evaluate the ability of the models to gen- erate both the DO and the PD alternates, on a per verb basis, in order to more accurately assess the fit to human judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Computational Models</head><p>In this section, we give an overview of the con- nectionist model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>, hereafter the AB model, and the Bayesian model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barak et al. (2014)</ref>, hereafter the BFS model, fol- lowed by a comparison of their relevant properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Overview of the Connectionist Model</head><p>The AB connectionist model of Ambridge and Bly- thing (2015) aims to predict the preference of a verb for each of three target constructions, on the basis of verb semantics and the observed distribution of verbs in those constructions in the input. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> provides an illustration of the 3-layer feed-forward network, trained using backpropagation. Each input to the model consists of lexical and semantic fea- tures of a verb and its usage. The target output is a 1-hot pattern across output nodes, each of which represents the use of the verb in the associated con- struction. The possible constructions are DO, PD, or other, representing all other constructions the verb appears in. Training presents the slate of input fea- tures with the appropriate output node activated rep- resenting the construction the verb appears in. In a full sweep of training, the model observes all verbs in proportion to their frequency in the input; for each verb, the proportion of training trials with 1 in each of the output nodes corresponds to the frequency of the verb in each of those constructions. During test- ing, only the input nodes are activated (correspond- ing to a verb and its semantics), and the activation of output nodes reveals the learned proportional ac- tivation rate corresponding to the degree of verb bias toward either the DO or the PD (or other).</p><p>The structure of the AB model encodes some as- sumptions regarding the information and learning mechanisms available to the learner. The model in- corporates awareness of individual verbs by having a node per verb in the input to distinguish the usage of each verb and its accompanying features. Each verb is also represented by a vector of semantic features that capture properties relevant to its meaning when used in one of the two dative constructions (based on elicited human judgments from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al., 2014</ref>). The "transfer" input node encodes the abil- ity to distinguish the semantic properties of the da- tive constructions from other constructions: i.e., this node is set to 1 for a DO or PD usage, and to 0 oth- erwise. Representing the construction of the input usage (DO, PD, or other) on the output nodes re- flects the formalization of the learning as an associa- tion of semantic and lexical features with a syntactic pattern, and the knowledge of the model is demon- strated by activating the construction output nodes in response to a lexical/semantic input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Overview of the Bayesian Model</head><p>The BFS of model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barak et al. (2014)</ref> is a Bayesian clustering model that simultaneously and incremen- tally learns both constructions and verb classes in a two-level design; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for an illustration of each level. In learning, the model processes an input sequence of verb usages, represented as collections of semantic and syntactic features, one usage at a time. The first step of processing each input aims to find the best cluster at level one as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">BestCluster(F i ) = argmax k∈Clusters P (k|F i ) (1)</formula><p>where F i is the set of features for input i, and k ranges over all existing clusters and a new one. The number of possible clusters is not set in advanced, and thus at any step the best choice may be to start a new cluster (of size 1) with this input.</p><p>Using Bayes rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (k|F i ) = P (k)P (F i |k) P (F i ) ∝ P (k)P (F i |k) (2)</formula><p>The prior probability of a cluster P (k) is propor- tional to the number of verb usages clustered to k so far, thus assigning a higher prior to larger clus- ters. The likelihood P (F i |k) is estimated based on the match of feature values in the current verb usage to those aggregated in the cluster, where the quality of the match depends on the frequency and vector similarity of the two sets of features. The clusters at this level correspond to construc- tions of the language -i.e., probabilistic associa- tions of form and meaning. For example, a clus- ter emerges from semantically-similar verbs like tell and ask, in a particular syntax, such as the DO. Cre- ating a new cluster -forming a new construction - depends on both the likelihood and the prior. Early on, the P (F i |k) term has more influence and differ- ences in feature values between a new usage and ex- isting clusters will often trigger a new cluster. Later, the model will favour adding a new input to an ex- isting cluster -even if it makes it more heteroge- neous -because the P (k) term prefers larger clus- ters as the number of observed inputs increases. This mechanism mimics human language learning behav- ior of moving from more verb-specific constructions to more general constructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Tomasello, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Each verb can occur in several clusters in the first level based on its association with various seman- tic and syntactic features. For instance, the alternat- ing verb give can occur in one cluster associating a transfer meaning with PD syntax and in a second cluster associating a transfer meaning with DO syn- tax. To capture the common behaviour of such al- ternating verbs -where verbs with similar meanings occur across the same set of clusters -the model rep- resents the similarity in distributional properties of the verbs in a second level of representation, which captures such verb class behaviours.</p><p>Formally, after each clustering decision in the first level, the model calculates the current frequency dis- tribution of the input verb over all level-one clus- ters. This distribution vector is used as input for the second level: the model measures the similarity of this vector to the weighted average distribution rep- resented by each second-level cluster, adding the in- put verb's distribution to the most similar one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">BestClass(d vt ) = argmax c∈Classes (1 − D JS (d c d vt )) (3)</formula><p>where d vt is the current distribution of the verb v over the clusters (i.e., at time t), c ranges over all the classes in the second level, d c is the weighted aver- age of c given the distributions of its member verb tokens, and D JS is the Jensen-Shannon divergence. As in the first level, the model may create a new clus- ter in the second level if none of the existing clusters is similar enough to d vt .</p><p>The resulting second-level clusters capture verb class behavior by grouping verbs that share a pat- tern of usages across constructions, e.g., alternating verbs that occur with the DO and PD syntax. These clusters encode a snapshot of the distribution of each verb each time it occurs in the input, reflecting the need of the language learner to incrementally update their knowledge of the distributional behavior of the verb across constructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Comparison of the Models</head><p>Both models capture the semantic and statistical properties of language proposed as possible fac- tors in the ability to learn an alternation appropri-ately -i.e., to generalize to new uses but not over- generalize to inappropriate verbs. Semantic influ- ences are reflected in the use of meaning features, and each model incorporates the key idea behind statistical preemption <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Goldberg, 1995)</ref>, namely that semantically-appropriate constructions compete with one another. The statistical effects of over- all verb frequency and of frequency of the verb-in- construction are captured by inputting each verb in proportion to its frequency with each construction.</p><p>The models have a crucial difference in how they reflect the influence of the various features in learn- ing alternations. As a feed-forward network, the AB model learns the weight of the semantic features given the entire set of input, and uses these weight- ings to shape the prediction of a verb's preference for each of the syntactic constructions (represented by the target output nodes). The BFS model does not explicitly weight features, but the influence of a fea- ture is determined by its local context within a clus- ter. For example, if the value of a feature has high frequency in a cluster -e.g., the cluster records us- ages with only the DO syntax -the predictions based on this cluster would strongly prefer matching us- ages based on this feature value; a less-frequent fea- ture would have less influence on this cluster's pre- dictions, but could have more influence in a cluster where it is more represented. This property, along with the representation of an open-ended set of con- structions (level one clusters) and verb classes (level two clusters), enables the model to capture rich in- teractions among the lexical, semantic, and syntactic features. We evaluate the role of these differences in the fit of each model to the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Setup</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Input and Training</head><p>We base the learning and evaluation on the 281 dis- tinct verbs used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>, which had been determined to occur in the dou- ble object (DO) and/or the preposition-dative (PD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pinker, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Levin, 1993)</ref>. Following Ambridge and Blything (2015), we consider a third (artificial) construction labeled as other that corresponds to all non-DO and non-PD usages of a verb. The mod- els are trained on usages of the verbs in proportion to their frequencies in the British National Corpus  (BNC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Leech, 1992)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> summarizes the per- construction frequency data for the verbs. 1 Note that 98 of the verbs can occur in the DO and/or PD but have no such occurrences in the BNC; these verbs unseen in the dative are important for judging the appropriate generalization behavior of the models. The input to the models include: the lexeme of the verb, the semantic features of the verb, a "trans- fer" feature marking the common meaning of the da- tive constructions, and (in training only) a syntactic feature. The syntactic feature indicates whether a verb is used with the DO, PD, or other construc- tion; in the AB model, this is given as the target output node in training. The verb semantic features are those used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>. These vectors are based on the ratings of each verb on 18 meaning properties relevant to use of the verb in the dative (e.g., "The verb specifies the means of transfer" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al., 2014</ref>), subject to Princi- pal Component Analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>, yielding a vector of 7 dimensions. The trans- fer feature is 1 for a verb usage in one of the two da- tive constructions, and 0 for the other construction, to indicate the shared transfer meaning conveyed by the DO and the PD. The input to each model is gen- erated automatically to correspond to the BNC fre- quencies of each verb in each of the constructions.</p><p>It should be noted that, while we adopt the se- mantic features of Ambridge and Blything (2015), they reflect the meaning within the two dative con- structions and may be less applicable to the other construction. In addition, we found that there are alternating and non-alternating verbs that have very similar semantic vectors, indicating that these fea-tures may not sufficiently distinguish the alternation behaviours.</p><p>The models are trained with sufficient input to converge on stable behavior. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref> in training and testing the AB model using the OXlearn MATLAB package <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ruh and Westermann, 2009)</ref>; the input is generated us- ing a random seed, in random input order without replacements, and the model is trained with a learn- ing rate of 0.01 for 1K sweeps for log frequencies; 100K sweeps for raw frequencies. We train the BFS model using the input generation method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barak et al. (2014)</ref>, with the features as above. The model is trained on 5K input verb usages (in proportion to their frequencies in the constructions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation of the Models</head><p>As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>, to test the model preferences for the DO or PD, the models are presented with an input consisting of a verb lexeme, its semantic features, and the transfer feature set to 1 (i.e., this is a "transfer" semantics suitable for a da- tive construction). For the AB model, we measure preferences for each construction as the activation rate of each of the corresponding output nodes, as in Ambridge and Blything <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>. In the BFS model, the preference for each construction is measured as its likelihood over the learned clusters given the verb and its semantic features. Formally, the prediction in the Bayesian model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (s|F test ) = k∈Clusters P (s|k)P (k|F test ) (4)</formula><p>where s is the predicted syntactic construction (DO or PD) and F test is the set of test features represent- ing a verb v and its corresponding semantic features. P (s|k) is the probability of the syntactic pattern fea- ture having the value s in cluster k, calculated as the proportional occurrences of s in k. P (k|F test ) is the probability of cluster k given test features F test , cal- culated as in Eqn. (2). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barak et al. (2014)</ref>, we calculate P (k|F test ) in two ways, using just the constructions (level one) or both the classes (level two) and the constructions, to see whether verb class knowledge improves performance. Using solely the construction level, the probability of k reflects the frequency with which usages of verb v occur in clus- ter k. Using the verb class level in addition, the dis- tribution of the verb over classes in the second level is combined with the distribution of those classes over the constructions in level one, to get the like- lihood of k.</p><p>These model preferences of the verbs for a da- tive construction are compared, using Pearson cor- relation, to the DO/PD acceptability judgment data collected from adult participants by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al. (2014)</ref>. Note that Ambridge and Blything <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref> only evaluate their model's preferences for verbs to take the DO construction. To fully understand the preference and generalization patterns, we also an- alyze the results for the PD preference. Even more importantly, we calculate the difference between the preferences for the DO and the PD constructions per verb, and compare these to analogous scores for the human data, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al. (2014)</ref>. The DO−PD difference scores, which we will refer to as the verb bias score, are crucial because, as in the human data, it is these scores that accurately cap- ture a learner's relative preference for a construction given a particular verb.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Analysis of Results</head><p>We examine the ability of each model to match the dative construction preferences of human judg- ments, as described just above, under two different experimental scenarios. In Section 5.1, we follow the experimental settings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>. We replicate their results on the AB model showing correlation with human DO preferences, but find that only the BFS model achieves a signifi- cant correlation with the crucial verb bias score that appropriately assesses per-verb preference. We ad- just the experimental settings in Section 5.2 to use more naturalistic input data -by training in propor- tion to raw frequencies and excluding the artificial other construction -achieving an improvement in the verb bias score for both models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Exp 1: Log Freq Input; 3 Constructions</head><p>Results. We first evaluated the models under the experimental conditions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>, providing input corresponding to the verbs in 3 constructions (DO, PD, and other), in propor- tion to their log frequencies; see  model preferences for each construction and the verb- bias score (DO−PD); training on log frequencies and 3 constructions. All correlations significant with p-value &lt; 0.001, except the one value in square brackets. Best result for each row is marked in boldface.</p><p>the ratings for the DO construction found in Am- bridge and Blything <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>. In addition, our analy- sis shows that the AB model produces a significant positive correlation with the PD acceptability rating. However, the AB model has no correlation with the verb bias score. Although the model ranks the sep- arate verb preferences for DO and PD similarly to humans, the model does not produce the same rel- ative preference for individual verbs. For exam- ple, the human data rank give with high acceptabil- ity in both the DO and the PD, with a higher value for the DO construction. Although the AB model has a high preference for both constructions for give (compared with other verbs), the model erroneously prefers give in the PD construction. The BFS model also produces preferences for verbs in each construction that have a significant positive correlation with human judgments. While the AB model shows better correlation with the DO judgments, the BFS model correlates more strongly with the PD judgments. Importantly, in contrast to the AB model, the verb bias score of the BFS model also significantly correlates with the judgment data. That is, the BFS model provides a better prediction of the preference per verb, which is key to producing a verb in the appropriate syntax.</p><p>Analysis. We can explain these results by look- ing more closely at the properties of the input and the differences in the learning mechanisms of each model. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ambridge and Blything (2015)</ref>, the input presents an artificial other construction in proportion to the frequency of the verbs with all non- dative constructions. The very high frequency of this single artificial construction (see other in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>) results in higher predictions of it for any of the verbs, even though the "transfer" feature in test inputs has a value intended to signal one of the dative construc- tions. As a result, the preferences for the dative con- structions in both models have a very small range of values, showing relatively small differences.</p><p>The BFS model is also affected by the relatively compressed semantic space of the input, which is exacerbated by the use of log frequencies to guide the input. As noted earlier, we found that the se- mantic features of alternating verbs can be highly similar to non-alternating verbs -e.g., give (alternat- ing) and pull (PO-only) have similar semantic vec- tors. With such input, the model cannot form suf- ficiently distinct first-level clusters based on the se- mantics, particularly when the data is presented with such a flat distribution (note the small differences in log frequencies in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Visual inspection re- veals that these clusters in the model largely form around syntactic constructions, with mixed seman- tic properties. Despite this, the first-level clusters capture a strong enough association between indi- vidual verbs and their constructions to yield a good correlation of the verb bias score with human judg- ments, and drawing on the second-level (verb-class) clusters improves the results.</p><p>Conclusions. The use of an artificial high- frequency non-dative construction (other), and the use of log frequencies, seem to mask the influ- ence of the semantic and syntactic properties on learning the verb-bias for each verb. Previous psy- cholinguistic data and computational models have found that a skewed naturalistic distribution of the input is helpful in learning constructions, due to the high-frequency verbs establishing appropriate construction-meaning associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Casenhiser and Goldberg, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Borovsky and Elman, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barak et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Matusevych et al., 2014</ref>). To allow a more direct analysis of the role of statistical and semantic properties in learning and generalizing the dative, we adjust the input to the models in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Exp 2: Raw Freq Input; 2 Constructions</head><p>Results. Here we perform the same type of experi- ments, but using input in proportion to the raw fre- quencies of the verbs (instead of log frequencies) over occurrences only in the two dative construc- tions (with no other construction). Since 98 of the 281 verbs do not occur with either dative construc-  tion in the BNC, this also allows us to more strin- gently test the generalization ability of the models, by considering their behavior wheñ1/3 of the verbs are unseen in training. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> presents the correlation results for the two models' preferences for each construction and the verb bias score; we also show the correlation plots for the verb bias score in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. The AB model does not correlate with the judgments for the DO. However, the model produces significant posi- tive correlations with the PD judgments and with the verb bias score. The BFS model, on the other hand, achieves significant positive correlations on all mea- sures, by both levels. As in the earlier experiments, the best correlation with the verb bias score is pro- duced by the second level of the BFS model, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 3</ref> demonstrates.</p><p>Analysis. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barak et al. (2013b)</ref>, the Bayesian model is better at learning the distri- bution pattern of each verb class given a skewed distribution, as in the raw frequencies here. The model learns an association of each construction to the frequently-observed meaning of high-frequency verbs. For example, the semantics of the DO is most strongly influenced by the semantics of its most fre- quently occurring instance: give. The accuracy of preference judgments benefits from the entrench- ment of the relevant meaning with the construction. This supports appropriate generalization -e.g., be- cause reward is semantically similar to give, it has a good fit to the human preference judgments even though it is unseen with the dative (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3)</ref>. But the same factor can serve to limit generaliza- tion -e.g., because the unseen verb mail is semantic dissimilar to a frequent PD-only verb like pull, its preference for the PD syntax is limited, giving it a good match to human judgments by preventing its overgeneralization (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>).</p><p>The AB model can also take advantage of high frequency verbs biasing the preference toward the frequently observed association. However, the se- mantic similarity across verbs within alternating or non-alternating classes is less effective in this model. The representation of the lexemes as 281 nodes in the input (compared to less than a dozen other nodes) make the learning more verb specific, reduc- ing the ability of the model to generalize to the unat- tested verbs.</p><p>Conclusions. The success of the BFS model, and especially the results using both constructions and classes, point to the role of probabilistic con- structions and verb classes in generalizing exist-ing knowledge while avoiding overgeneralizations. Moreover, the use of a skewed distribution reveals the role of the high verb-in-construction frequency in guiding the association of construction and mean- ing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ambridge et al., 2014</ref>, for discussion). Yet both models would benefit from a richer seman- tic representation that better captures the distinctive properties of verbs across various constructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>This paper presents a comparative analysis of two computational cognitive models on the sample task of learning the dative alternation. This study en- ables an evaluation of the psycholinguistic plausi- bility of each model for the given task when facing identical input and experimental settings. Adopting the semantic representation of Ambridge and Bly- thing (2015), our input incorporates both seman- tic and syntactic properties over a large number of verbs. By providing the first direct comparison be- tween two existing models of this phenomenon, we are the first to demonstrate the complex interac- tion of various linguistic properties in the input, and how rich learning mechanisms are required in or- der to achieve generalizations compatible with hu- man judgments in this area. Moreover, comparison of learning mechanisms and of input properties can inform CL/NLP more generally by shedding light on potential factors in achieving humanlike behaviours.</p><p>We find that the Bayesian model of BFS signifi- cantly correlates with human judgments on the 3 key evaluation measures. Importantly, this model out- performs the connectionist model of AB in the cor- relation with the verb-bias score (the per-verb differ- ence between DO and PD preference), which points to its advantage in choosing the more appropriate construction per verb. We argue that the fit of the model relies on a rich learning mechanism that ex- ploits distributional properties of naturalistic input.</p><p>The AB model has a streamlined design to sup- port learning a particular semantic-syntactic associ- ation underlying the dative alternation. While the BFS model is richer computationally, its properties were motivated in earlier work explaining many hu- man behaviours. When we consider more natural in- put, the simple input[semantics]-output <ref type="bibr">[syntax]</ref> as- sociation mechanism of the AB model is unable to capture the necessary interactions among the verb semantic properties, the syntactic usages, and their patterns across different types of verbs. By con- trast, the two-level design of the BFS model captures these interactions. The first level learns the verb- semantics-syntax associations as clusters of similar configurations of those features. The second level captures the commonalities of behaviour of sets of verbs by forming classes of verbs that have simi- lar distributional patterns over the first-level clus- ters. We also observe that the replication of adult- like language competence relies on several naturalis- tic properties of the input: skewed distribution, and a rich semantic representation combined with syntac- tic information. The skewed input enables the for- mation of clusters representing more entrenched as- sociations, which are biased towards high-frequency verbs associated with certain semantic and syntactic features.</p><p>Given the role of these linguistic properties, the results here call for additional analysis and develop- ment of the input to computational cognitive models. The predictions may be improved given more real- istic syntactic and semantic information about the verb usages. On the syntax side, the input should reflect the distribution of verbs across more syntac- tic constructions, as statistical patterns over such us- ages can indirectly indicate aspects of a verb's se- mantics (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barak et al., 2013a</ref>). In the future, we aim to analyze the role of fuller syntactic dis- tributions in restricting overgeneralization patterns. Moreover, the semantic annotations used here repli- cate the settings originally tested for the AB model, which correspond to the verb as used in the rele- vant constructions. This contrasts with typical au- tomated extractions of verb-meaning representation (e.g., <ref type="bibr">word2vec, Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, which cap- ture a more general verb meaning across all its us- ages. In preliminary experiments, we have found an advantage in using word2vec representations in ad- dition to the semantic properties reported here. We aim to further analyze manual and automated meth- ods for semantic feature extraction in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A visual representation of the feed-forward network used by the AB model.
