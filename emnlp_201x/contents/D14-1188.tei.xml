				<p>We introduce new features for incorporating semantic predicate-argument structures in machine translation (MT). The methods focus on the completeness of the semantic structures of the translations, as well as the order of the translated semantic roles. We experiment with translation rules which contain the core arguments for the predicates in the source side of a MT system, and observe that using these rules significantly improves the translation quality. We also present a new semantic feature that resembles a language model. Our results show that the language model feature can also significantly improve MT results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, there have been increasing ef- forts to incorporate semantics in statistical ma- chine translation (SMT), and the use of predicate- argument structures has provided promising im- provements in translation quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Wu and Fung (2009)</ref> showed that shallow semantic parsing can improve the translation quality in a machine trans- lation system. They introduced a two step model, in which they used a semantic parser to rerank the translation hypotheses of a phrase-based sys- tem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liu and Gildea (2010)</ref> used semantic fea- tures for a tree-to-string syntax based SMT sys- tem. Their features modeled deletion and reorder- ing for source side semantic roles, and they im- proved the translation quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Xiong et al. (2012)</ref> incorporated the semantic structures into phrase- based SMT by adding syntactic and semantic fea- tures to their translation model. They proposed two discriminative models which included fea- tures for predicate translation and argument re- ordering from source to target side. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bazrafshan and Gildea (2013)</ref> used semantic structures in a string-to-tree translation system by extracting translation rules enriched with semantic informa- tion, and showed that this can improve the trans- lation quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li et al. (2013)</ref> used predicate- argument structure reordering models for hierar- chical phrase-based translation, and they used lin- guistically motivated constraints for phrase trans- lation.</p><p>In this paper, we experiment with methods for incorporating semantics in a string-to-tree MT system. These methods are designed to model the order of translation, as well as the completeness of the semantic structures. We extract translation rules that include the complete semantic structure in the source side, and compare that with using semantic rules for the target side predicates. We present a method for modeling the order of seman- tic role sequences that appear spread across multi- ple syntax-based translation rules, in order to over- come the problem that a rule representing the en- tire semantic structure of a predicate is often too large and too specific to apply to new sentences during decoding. For this method, we compare the verb-specific roles of PropBank and the more gen- eral thematic roles of VerbNet.</p><p>These essential arguments of a verbal predicate are called the core arguments. Standard syntax- based MT is incapable of ensuring that the tar- get translation includes all of the core arguments of a predicate that appear in the source sentence. To encourage the translation of the likely core ar- guments, we follow the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bazrafshan and Gildea (2013)</ref>, who use special translation rules with complete semantic structures of the predi- cates in the target side of their MT system. Each of these rules includes a predicate and all of its core arguments. Instead of incorporating only the target side semantic rules, we extract the special rules for both the source and the target sides, and compare the effectiveness of adding these rules to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S-8 NP-7-ARG1 1 victimized by NP-7-ARG0 2 NP-7-ARG1 1 受 NP-7-ARG0 2</formula><p>Figure 1: A complete semantic rule ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bazrafshan and Gildea (2013)</ref>).</p><p>the system separately and simultaneously. Besides the completeness of the arguments, it is also important for the arguments to appear in the correct order. Our second method is designed to encourage correct order of translation for both the core and the non-core roles in the target sentence. We designed a new feature that resembles the lan- guage model feature in a standard MT system. We train a n-gram language model on sequences of se- mantic roles, by treating the semantic roles as the words in what we call the semantic language. Our experimental results show that the language model feature significantly improves translation quality.</p><p>Semantic Role Labeling (SRL): We use se- mantic role labelers to annotate the training data that we use to extract the translation rules. For tar- get side SRL, the role labels are attached to the nonterminal nodes in the syntactic parse of each sentence. For source side SRL, the labels annotate the spans from the source sentence that they cover. We train our semantic role labeler using two differ- ent standards: <ref type="bibr">Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005</ref>) and VerbNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kipper Schuler, 2005</ref>).</p><p>PropBank annotates the Penn Treebank with predicate-argument structures.It use generic labels (such as Arg0, Arg1, etc.) which are defined specifically for each verb. We trained a semantic role labeler on the annotated Penn Treebank data and used the classifier to tag our training data.</p><p>VerbNet is a verb lexicon that categorizes En- glish verbs into hierarchical classes, and annotates them with thematic roles for the arguments that they accept. Since the thematic roles use more meaningful labels (e.g. Agent, Patient, etc.), a lan- guage model trained on VerbNet labels may be more likely to generalize across verbs than one trained on PropBank labels. It may also provide more information, since VerbNet has a larger set of labels than PropBank. To train the semantic role labeler on VerbNet, we used the mappings</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A → BC c 0 [B, i, j] c 1 [C, j, k] c 2 [A, i, k] c 0 + c 1 + c 2</formula><p>Figure 2: A deduction step in our baseline decoder provided by the SemLink project <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Palmer, 2009)</ref> to annotate the Penn Treebank with the VerbNet roles. These mappings map the roles in PropBank to the thematic roles of VerbNet. When there is no mapping for a role, we keep the role from Prop- bank.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Using Semantics in Machine Translation</head><p>In this section, we present our techniques for in- corporating semantics in MT: source side semantic rules, and the semantic language model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Source Side Semantic Rules</head><p>Bazrafshan and Gildea (2013) extracted transla- tion rules that included a predicate and all of its arguments from the target side, and added those rules to the baseline rules of their string-to-tree MT system. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of such rules, which we refer to as complete semantic rules. The new rules encourage the decoder to generate translations that include all of the seman- tic roles that appear in the source sentence.</p><p>In this paper, we use the same idea to extract rules from the semantic structures of the source side. The complete semantic rules consist of the smallest fragments of the combination of GHKM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Galley et al., 2004</ref>) rules that include one pred- icate and all of its core arguments that appear in the sentence. Rather than keeping the predicate and argument labels attached to the non-terminals, we remove those labels from our extracted seman- tic rules, to keep the non-terminals in the semantic rules consistent with the non-terminals of the base- line GHKM rules. This is also important when us- ing both the source and the target semantic rules (i.e. Chinese and English rules), as it has been shown that there are cross lingual mismatches be- tween Chinese and English semantic roles in bilin- gual sentences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fung et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>We extract a complete semantic rule for each verbal predicate of each sentence pair in the train- ing data. To extract the target side complete se- mantic rules, using the target side SRL anno- tated training data, we follow the general GHKM method, and modify it to ensure that each fron- tier node ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Galley et al., 2004</ref>) in a rule includes ei- ther all or none of the semantic role labels (i.e. the predicate and all of its present core arguments) in its descendants in the target side tree. The result- ing rule then includes the predicate and all of its arguments. We use the source side SRL annotated training data to extract the source side semantic rules. Since the annotations specify the spans of the semantic roles, we extract the semantic rules by ensuring that the span of the root (in the target side) of the extracted rule covers all of the spans of the roles in the predicate-argument structure. The semantic rules are then used together with the original GHKM rules. We add a binary feature to distinguish the semantic rules from the rest. We experiment with adding the semantic rules from the source side, and compare that with adding se- mantic rules of both the source and the target side.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A → BC to space c 0 (x1 x2 Destination) [B, i, j, (Agent, )] c 1 [C, j, k, (P RED bring, T heme, )] c 2 [A, i, k, (Agent, PRED bring,-*-, Theme, Destination)] c 0 + c 1 + c + + LMcost(Agent, PRED</formula><p>In all of the experiments in this paper, we use a string-to-tree decoder which uses a CYK style parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yamada and Knight, 2002</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> de- picts a deduction step in the baseline decoder. The CFG rule in the first line is used to generate a new item A with span (i, k) using items B and C, which have spans (i, j) and (j, k) respectively. The cost of each item is shown on the right. For experimenting with complete semantic rules, in addition having more rules, the only other modi- fication made to the baseline system is extending the feature vector to include the new feature. We do not modify the decoder in any significant way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Semantic Language Model</head><p>The semantic language model is designed to en- courage the correct order of translation for the se- mantic roles. While the complete translation rules of Section 2.1 contain the order of the translation for core semantic roles, they do not include the non-core semantic roles, that is, semantic roles which are not essential for the verbal predicates, but do contribute to the meaning of the predicate.</p><p>In addition, the semantic LM can help in cases where no specific complete semantic rule can ap- ply, which makes the system more flexible.</p><p>The semantic language model resembles a reg- ular language model, but instead of words, it de- fines a probability distribution over sequences of semantic roles. For this method we also use a se- mantic role labeler on our training data, and use the labeled data to train a tri-gram semantic lan- guage model.</p><p>The rules are extracted using the baseline rule extraction method. As opposed to the previous method, the rules for this method are not derived by combining GHKM rules, but rather are reg- ular GHKM rules which are annotated with se- mantic roles. We make a new field in each rule to keep the ordered list of the semantic roles in that rule. We also include the nonterminals of the right-hand-side of the rule in that ordered list, to be able to substitute the semantic roles from the input translation items in the correct order. The decoder uses this new field to save the semantic roles in the translation items, and propagates the semantic LM states in the same way that the reg- ular language model states are propagated by the decoder.</p><p>We define a new feature for the semantic lan- guage model, and score the semantic states in each translation item, again analogously to a regular language model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref> depicts how the de- duction for this method is different from our base- line. In this example, the semantic roles "Agent", "PRED bring" and "Theme" come from the input items, and the role "Destination" (which tags the terminals "to space") comes from the translation rule.</p><p>We stemmed the verbs for training this feature, and also annotated our rules with stemmed verbal predicates. The stemming helps the training since the argument types of a verb are normally inde- pendent of its inflected variants. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>The data that we used for training the MT sys- tem was a Chinese-English corpus derived from newswire text from LDC. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The data consists of 250K sentences, which is 6.3M words in the En- glish side. Our language model was trained on the English side of the entire data, which consisted of 1.65M sentences (39.3M words). Our develop- ment and test sets are from the newswire portion of NIST evaluations <ref type="bibr">(2004,</ref><ref type="bibr">2005,</ref><ref type="bibr">2006</ref>). We used 392 sentences for the development set and 428 sentences for the test set. These sentences have lengths smaller than 30, and they each have 4 ref- erence translations. We used our in-house string- to-tree decoder that uses Earley parsing. Other than the features that we presented for our new methods, we used a set of nine standard features. The rules for the baseline system were extracted using the GHKM method. Our baseline GHKM rules also include composed rules, where larger rules are constructed by combining two levels of the regular GHKM rules. We exclude any unary rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chung et al., 2011)</ref>, and only keep rules that have scope up to 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hopkins and Langmead, 2010)</ref>. For the semantic language model, we used the SRILM package <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stolcke, 2002</ref>) and trained a tri-gram language model with the default Good- Turing smoothing. Our target side semantic role labeler uses a max- imum entropy classifier to label parsed sentences. We used Sections 02-22 of the Penn TreeBank to train the labeler, and sections 24 and 23 for devel- opment set and training set respectively. The la- beler has a precision of 90% and a recall of 88%. We used the Chinese semantic role labeler of Wu and Palmer (2011) for source side SRL, which uses the LIBLINEAR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fan et al., 2008</ref>) as a classi- fier. Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Och, 2003)</ref> was used for tuning the feature weights. For all of our experiments, we ran 15 instances of MERT with random initial weight vectors, and used the weights of the top 3 results on the de- velopment set to test the systems on the test set. We chose to use the top 3 runs (rather than the best run) of each system to account for the insta- bility of MERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Clark et al., 2011</ref>). This method is designed to reflect the average performance of the MT system when trained with random restarts of MERT: we wish to discount runs in which the optimizer is stuck in a poor region of the weight space, but also to average across several good runs in order not to be mislead by the high variance of the single best run. For each of our MT systems, we merged the results of the top 3 runs on the test set into one file, and ran a statistical significance test, comparing it to the merged top 3 results from our baseline system. The 3 runs were merged by duplicating each run 3 times, and arranging them in the file so that the significance testing compares each run with all the runs of the baseline. We per- formed significance testing using paired bootstrap resampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Koehn, 2004)</ref>. The difference is con- sidered statistically significant if p &lt; 0.05 using 1000 iterations of paired bootstrap resampling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results</head><p>Our results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The second and the third columns contain the average BLEU score ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>) on the top three re- sults on the development and test sets. The fourth column is the p-value for statistical significance testing against the baseline. The first row shows the results for our baseline. The second row con- tains the results for using the source (Chinese) side complete semantic rules of Section 2.1, and the third row is the results for combining both the source and the target side complete semantic rules. As noted before, in both of these experi- ments we also use the regular GHKM rules. The result show that the source side complete seman- tic rules improve the system (p = 0.048), and as we expected, combining the source and the tar-</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Source Sentence 因此 , 保护 儿童 免 受 武装冲突 的 伤害 是 国际 社会 重要 的 职责 .

To measure the effect of combining the rules, in a separate experiment we replicated the complete semantic rules exper- iments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bazrafshan and Gildea (2013)</ref>, and ran statistical significance tests comparing the combi- nation of the source and target rules with using only the source or the target semantic rules sep- arately.

We observed that using a semantic lan- guage model can significantly improve the trans- lations, and help the decoder to generate the se- mantic roles in the correct order. Adding transla- tion rules with complete semantic structures also improved our MT system. We experimented with using source side complete semantic rules, as well as using rules for both the source and the target sides. Both of our experiments showed improve- ments over the baseline, and as expected, the sec- ond one had a higher improvement.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: A deduction step in the semantic language model method.</figDesc></figure>
