				<p>We address the task of native language identification in the context of social media content , where authors are highly-fluent, advanced nonnative speakers (of English). Using both linguistically-motivated features and the characteristics of the social media outlet, we obtain high accuracy on this challenging task. We provide a detailed analysis of the features that sheds light on differences between native and nonnative speakers, and among nonnative speakers with different backgrounds.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of native language identification (NLI) aims at determining the native language (L1) of an author given only text in a foreign language (L2). NLI has gained much popularity recently, usually with an eye to educational applications ( ): the errors that learners make when they write English depend on their native language <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Swan and Smith, 2001)</ref>, and understanding the different types of errors is a prerequisite for cor- recting them ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Leacock et al., 2010)</ref>. Consequently, tutoring applications can use NLI to offer better targeted advice to language learners. However, the NLI task is not limited to the lan- guage of learners; it is relevant also, perhaps even more so, in the (much more challenging) con- text of highly-fluent, advanced nonnative speak- ers. While the English language dominates the internet, native English speakers are far outnum- bered by speakers of English as a foreign lan- guage. Consequently, a vast amount of static and dynamic web content is continuously generated by nonnative writers. Developing methods for iden- tifying the native language of nonnative English authors on social media outlets is therefore an im- portant and pertinent goal. â‡¤ *Work done while the second author was at the Univer- sity of Haifa.</p><p>We address the task of native language identi- fication in the context of user generated content (UGC) in online communities. Specifically, we use a large corpus of English Reddit posts in which the L1 of authors had been accurately annotated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Rabinovich et al., 2018)</ref>. On this dataset, we de- fine three closely-related tasks: (i) distinguishing between native and nonnative authors; (ii) deter- mining to which language family the native lan- guage of nonnative authors belongs; (iii) identify- ing the native language of nonnative authors. Im- portantly, we employ features that take advantage of both linguistic traits present in the texts and the characteristics of the social media outlet. We ob- tain excellent results: up to 92% accuracy for dis- tinguishing between natives and nonnatives, and up to 69% for the 23-way NLI classification task. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The contribution of this paper is manifold. First, this is one of the first works to address NLI with highly-advanced nonnatives; it is also among the first to address the task in the context of UGC. Fur- thermore, we define a plethora of features, some which have been used in earlier works but others that are novel. In particular, we define a set of features that rely on the characteristics of the so- cial media outlet, thereby extending the task some- what, from linguistic analysis to user profiling. Fi- nally, we provide a detailed analysis of the results, including the specific contribution of various fea- tures and feature sets. This analysis will be instru- mental for future extensions of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The NLI task was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Koppel et al. (2005)</ref>, who worked on the International Corpus of Learner English <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Granger, 2003)</ref>, which in- cludes texts written by students from Russia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, France, and Spain. The same experimental setup was adopted by several other authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tsur and Rappoport, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dras, 2009, 2011</ref>). The task gained popular- ity with the release of nonnative TOEFL essays by the Educational Testing Service ( ; this dataset has been used for the first NLI Shared Task (  and also for the 2017 NLI Shared Task ( ).</p><p>Our task is closely related to the task of dialect identification, in which the goal is to discrimi- nate among similar languages, language varieties and dialects. Classic machine learning classifi- cation methods are usually applied for this task, often with SVM models. The best reported fea- tures include word and character n-grams, part of speech n-grams and function words ( .</p><p>The current state of the art in NLI, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Malmasi and Dras (2017)</ref>, utilizes some variant of contemporary machine learning classifier with the following types of features: (i) word, lemma and character n-grams, (ii) function words (FW), (iii) part-of-speech (POS) n-grams, (iv) adaptor grammar collocations, (v) Stanford dependencies, (vi) CFG rules, and (vii) Tree Substitution Gram- mar fragments. The best result under cross- validation on the TOEFL dataset, which includes 11 native languages (with a rather diverse distri- bution of language families), was 85.2% accuracy. Applying these methods to different datasets (the ASK corpus of learners of Norwegian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Tenfjord et al., 2006</ref>) and the Jinan Chinese Learner Cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang et al., 2015</ref>), 10-11 native languages in each) resulted in 76.5% accuracy for the Chi- nese data and 81.8% for the Norwegian data, with LDA-based classification yielding top results.</p><p>Notably, all these works identify the native lan- guage of learners. Identifying the native language of advanced, fluent speakers is a much harder task. Furthermore, our dataset includes texts by native speakers of 23 languages, more than double the number of languages used in previous works; and our L1s are all European, and often typologically close, which makes the task much harder.</p><p>Two recent works address the task of NLI on UGC in social media. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anand et al. (2017)</ref> sum- marized the shared task on Indian NLI: given a corpus of Facebook English comments, the task was to identify which of six Indian languages is the L1 of the author. The best reported result was 48.8%, obtained by an SVM with character and word n-grams as features. These are content based features that are highly domain-dependent and are not likely to generalize across domains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Volkova et al. (2018)</ref> explored the contribution of various (lexical, syntactic, and stylistic) signals for pre- dicting the foreign language of non-English speak- ers based on their English posts on Twitter. This effectively results in a 12-way classification task, with 12 different L1s (data sizes are distributed very unevenly), and the best results are unsurpris- ingly obtained with word unigrams and bigrams.</p><p>In contrast to these two studies, we work with many more L1s (23); we explore various types of features, including features based on social net- work structures and content-independent features; and we evaluate our classifiers both in and outside of the domain of training.</p><p>Several works address social aspects of social networks, and in particular identify "influential" users ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ghosh and Lerman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Trusov et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Afrasiabi Rad and Benyoucef, 2011</ref>). Net- work structure has been shown to be useful in other tasks of user profiling, such as geolocation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jurgens et al., 2015)</ref>. Our design of the social network features (Section 3.5.4) are motivated by these works.</p><p>Works that aim to distinguish between native and nonnative authors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bergsma et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rabinovich et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tomokiyo and Jones, 2001</ref>) typically rely on lexical and grammatical charac- teristics that reflect influences of L1 on L2. We used such features, but augmented them by fea- tures that can be induced from the network struc- ture of social media outlets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jurgens et al., 2015)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that extensively exploits social network properties for the task of NLI. Our work is also inspired by research on the (related but different) task of iden- tifying translations ( <ref type="bibr">Baroni and Bernardini, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Volansky et al., 2015)</ref> and their source language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Koppel and Ordan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rabinovich et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental setup 3.1 Dataset</head><p>Reddit is an online community consisting of thou- sands of forums for news aggregation, content rat- ing, and discussions. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called subreddits, ranging from main forums that receive much attention to smaller ones that foster discussion on niche areas. Subred- dit topics include news, science, arts, and many others. An increasing body of work has used Red- dit data for social media analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jurgens et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Newell et al., 2016</ref>, and many more).</p><p>We used the Reddit dataset released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rabinovich et al. (2018)</ref>. It includes Reddit posts (both initial submissions and subsequent comments), fo- cusing on subreddits (Europe, AskEurope, Euro- peanCulture) whose content is generated by users specifying their country as a flair (metadata at- tribute). We refer to these subreddits as European. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rabinovich et al. (2018)</ref>, we view the country information as an accurate, albeit not per- fect, proxy for the native language of the author.</p><p>Rabinovich et al. <ref type="formula">(2018)</ref> justified their trust in the accuracy of the L1 annotation; we conducted an additional validation of the data. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We used a specific Reddit thread in which users were asked to comment in their native language. We collected the comments in this thread of all the users in our dataset. Then, we used the Polyglot language identification tool to determine the language of the comments. We filtered out short comments, com- ments for which the tool's confidence was low, and comments in English of users from non-English speaking countries. Of the remaining 572 users, 479 (84%) contributed comments in the language that we considered their native. We inspected the remaining users, and for many (albeit not all) we attribute the mismatch to errors in the tool (i.e., comments in Serbian written in the Latin alpha- bet are wrongly predicted to be in closely-related Slavic languages). We conclude that the accuracy of the L1 annotation is high; finally, we note ad- ditionally that any noise in this labeling can only work against us in this work.</p><p>We filtered out data from multilingual countries (Belgium, Canada, and Switzerland). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rabinovich et al. (2018)</ref> showed that the English of reddit non- native authors is highly advanced, almost at the level of native speakers, making the NLI task par- ticularly demanding.</p><p>All the posts in the dataset are associated with a unique user ID. The dataset also contains submis- sions and comments in other subreddits that were written by the same authors, based on their user ID. This provided us with an out-of-domain test set for evaluating the robustness of our methods. The collected data reflect about 50 (mostly Eu- <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this. ropean) countries, and consist of over 230M sen- tences, or 3.5B tokens, annotated with authors' L1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Preprocessing</head><p>Each sentence in the dataset is tagged with the au- thor's user ID, the subreddit it appeared in and the author's country. We segmented the dataset into chunks of 100 sentences, each chunk contain- ing sentences authored by the same user. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The sentences were kept in their original order in the posts; users with fewer than 100 sentences were filtered out. We also left out native languages with fewer than 100 users (after the initial fil- tering). The resulting dataset includes 23 native languages spanning 29 countries, and consists of 34,511 unique users, almost 200M sentences and over 3B tokens. The countries and languages re- flected in the dataset are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref> (see Supplementary Materials).</p><p>All chunks were annotated for part-of-speech using Spacy. We used Aspell to spell-check the texts; every misspelled word in the original chunk was annotated with the first correction suggested by the spell checker. We also extracted from reddit additional social network properties such as users' karma scores, number of comments and submis- sions, number of comments per submission, as well as the number of months each user was ac- tive on Reddit and all the subreddits that each user in our dataset posted in (see Section 3.5.4). The processed dataset will be made publicly available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Task</head><p>We define three classification tasks: binary clas- sification, distinguishing between native and non- native authors; language family classification de- termining the language family (Germanic, Bal- toSlavic, Romance, or native English) of the user; and language identification whose goal is to iden- tify the native language of the user.</p><p>Different countries which have the same official language (e.g., Germany and Austria) were tagged with the same language label. For example, USA, UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia were all tagged with the label 'English' for the NLI task.</p><p>We then randomly downsampled the data to en- sure that each class had the same number of users.</p><p>See the precise details in Section A.1 of the Sup- plementary Materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Methodology</head><p>We cast NLI as a supervised classification task and used logistic regression (as implemented in Scikit-learn) as a classification model. We defined several features that had been proven useful for similar tasks; some of them are general stylistic features that are presumably content-independent: these include function words, POS n-grams, sim- plification measures such as sentence length, etc.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Volansky et al., 2015</ref>). Other features are content based; most ob- viously, token n-grams, but also character n-grams ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Avner et al., 2016</ref>). We expect content-based fea- tures to be highly accurate but also highly domain- dependent, and in the case of our dataset, topic- dependent. Content-independent features are ex- pected to be weaker yet more robust.</p><p>In addition, we used features that reflect spelling and grammar errors. We assume that na- tive and nonnative speakers make different kinds of errors in English, and that the errors of non- natives may reveal traces of their L1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kochmar, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berzak et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Aiming to enhance the quality of classification we exploited properties that can be induced from conversational networks. We hypothesize that na- tive speakers of the same language tend to inter- act more with each other (than with speakers of other languages). We hypothesize further that na- tive speakers post more than nonnatives, and hence we defined user centrality measures that reflect that. We also hypothesize that native speakers' posts tend to be more spontaneous, coherent and clear, thereby drawing more attention. To reflect that, we counted the number of comments, up- votes and down-votes that were submitted to each post. While these and similar properties have been studied in the domain of social networking, to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to use an extensive set of features inferred from so- cial networks for the NLI task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Features</head><p>We designed several features to be used in all three tasks. In this section we describe these features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Content features</head><p>Authors are more likely to write about topics that are related to their country and their culture, hence features that reflect content may help dis- tinguish among authors from different countries <ref type="bibr">(and, therefore, languages)</ref>. For example, the word 'Paris' is more likely to occur in texts written by French authors, while the word 'canal' is more likely to occur in texts of Dutch authors. We de- fined features that take text content into account. We expect these features to yield high accuracy when testing on the training domain, but much lower accuracy when testing on different domains.</p><p>Character tri-grams The top 1000 most fre- quent character 3-grams in the dataset were used as features. For each chunk the value of a cer- tain character 3-gram feature was the number of its occurrences in the chunk normalized by the to- tal number of character 3-grams in the chunk.</p><p>Token uni-grams The top 1000 most frequent tokens in the dataset were used as features. For each chunk the value of a certain token feature was the number of its occurrences in the chunk normal- ized by the total number of tokens in the chunk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Spelling and grammar</head><p>We used a spell checker (Section 3.1) to dis- cover the (first) closest correction for each word marked as incorrect. Based on this correction, we defined several edit-distance-based features using Python's Python-Levenshtein extension.</p><p>Edit distance Assuming that nonnative speak- ers will make more spelling errors than natives, we used the average Levenshtein distance between the original word and the correction offered by the spell checker, for all words in a chunk, as a feature.</p><p>Spelling errors Again, we assume that the spelling errors that nonnatives make may reflect properties of their L1; this has already been shown for learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Tsvetkov et al., 2013)</ref>. Using the edit distance between a mis-spelled word w in a text chunk, marked by the spell checker, and its sug- gested correction c, we extract insertions, dele- tions and substitutions that yield c from w and use them as features. For each chunk, the value of this feature is the number of occurrences of each substitution (a character pair), insertions, and dele- tions in the chunk. We only used the top-400 most frequent substitutions.</p><p>We initially classified spelling errors as content- independent features, assuming that they would reflect transfer of linguistic phenomena from L1. However, having analyzed this feature type, we observed that many of the mis-spelled words turned out to be non-English words, which appar- ently are abundant in our dataset even after remov- ing non-English sentences. We therefore view this feature as content dependent.</p><p>Grammar errors We hypothesize that gram- mar errors made by nonnatives may reflect gram- matical structures revealing their L1. We there- fore used LanguageTool, a rule-based grammar checker, to identify grammatical errors in the text. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We defined an indicator binary feature for each of the (over 2000) grammar rules detected by the grammar checker. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.3">Content-independent features</head><p>Content-based features may overly depend on the domain of the training data, and consequently be less effective when testing on different domains. Content-independent features are expected to be more robust when they are used out-of-domain.</p><p>Function words Function words are highly fre- quent and as such they are assumed to be se- lected unconsciously; they are therefore consid- ered to reflect style, rather than content. Func- tion words have been used successfully in a variety of style-based classification tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mosteller and Wallace, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Koppel and Ordan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Volansky et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rabinovich et al., 2016)</ref>. We used as features (the frequencies of) about 400 function words, taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Volansky et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>POS tri-grams POS n-grams are assumed to re- flect (shallow) grammar. The native language of the author is likely to influence the structure of his or her productions in English, and we assume that this will be reflected in this feature set. We used as features the normalized frequency of the top 300 most frequent POS tri-grams in the data set. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Sentence length Texts of nonnative speakers are assumed to be simpler than those of natives; in par- ticular, we expect them to have shorter sentences. The value of this feature is the average length of the sentences in the chunk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.4">Social network features</head><p>We defined several features that are extracted from the social network data, particularly its structure.</p><p>First, we defined feature sets that express the cen- trality of users, under the assumption that native speakers would be more central on social net- works. Consequently, this set of features is ex- pected to be beneficial mainly for the binary na- tive/nonnative classification.</p><p>User centrality in the social network of Reddit can be reflected in various ways:</p><p>Karma Reddit assigns a karma score to each user. This score "reflects how much good the user has done for the reddit community. The best way to gain karma is to submit links that other peo- ple like and vote for". <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The Karma score is an undisclosed function of two separate scores: link karma, which is calculated from the user's posts that contain links, and comment karma, which is computed from the user's comments. We extracted both types of karma scores for all users in the dataset and used each of them (specifically, the user's monthly average scores) as a feature.</p><p>Average score Reddit calculates a score for each submission as the number of up-votes minus the number of down-votes the submission received. We used the user's average score per month as a feature.</p><p>Average number of submissions We counted for each user the total number of submissions he or she authored. For each chunk the value of this fea- ture is the user's average number of submissions per month.</p><p>Average number of comments Same as the above, but counting user's comments (responses to submissions) instead of submissions.</p><p>Most popular subreddits Finally, we assume that native speakers of the same language tend to interact more with each other than with others, and we also assume that they are more likely to be interested in similar topics, influenced by their country and culture; specifically, we hypothesize that the forums in which users post most will be common for users from the same country. There- fore, we extracted for each country in the dataset the most popular subreddits among users from this country. For each country, we sorted subreddits according to the number of users from this coun- try who posted at least once in this subreddit. The 30 most popular subreddits of each country were taken as features. The unique list of popu- lar subreddits contains 141 subreddits. For each chunk the value of a certain subreddit feature was a binary value indicating whether or not the author of this chunk has posted in this subreddit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Evaluation</head><p>It is well known that similar classification tasks are highly domain-dependent; simply put, the proper- ties of the domain overshadow the much more sub- tle signal of the author's L1. To test the robustness of various feature sets in the face of domain noise, we defined two evaluation scenarios: in-domain, where training and testing is done only on chunks from the European subreddits; and out-of-domain, where we train on chunks from the European sub- reddits and test on chunks from other subreddits, making sure they were authored by different users. Note that the out-of-domain corpus spans tens of thousands of subreddits with a huge number of topics. The precise evaluation scenario is some- what involved and is detailed in Section A.2 of the Supplementary Materials. We report accuracy, defined as the percentage of chunks that were clas- sified correctly out of the total number of chunks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>We implemented the features discussed in Sec- tion 3.5 and evaluated the accuracy of the three classification tasks mentioned in Section 3.4 under the configurations described in Section 3.6. The trivial baseline for the binary classification task is 50%, for language family classification 25%, and for the language identification task 4.35%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Individual feature sets</head><p>The accuracy results for each feature set described in Section 3.5 for the in-domain evaluation sce- nario are presented in Evidently, all feature sets outperform the base- line, although some are far better than others. The feature that yields the best accuracy is Subreddits, with 87% accuracy on the binary task, 82% on the language family task and 74% on the NLI task. We elaborate on this feature in Section 4.2 be- low. As expected, the content based features yield relatively high results when the evaluation is in- domain. POS 3-grams and function words yield reasonable results, but not as good as in other clas- sification setups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rabinovich et al. (2016)</ref>), where the evaluation was done by shuffling texts of various users. As we evaluate on chunks of single users, the personal style of the user may dominate the subtler signal of his or her native lan- guage. Sentence length performs poorly, even on the binary task. Our assumption was that the so- cial network feature set will work well only for the binary classification; this seems to be borne out by the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Feature combination</head><p>We now set out to investigate different feature combinations in both evaluation scenarios, aim- ing to define feature types that yield the best in- domain accuracy, as well as those that are most robust and generalize well out-of-domain. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> depicts the results obtained by combin- ing character trigrams, tokens, and spelling fea- tures (Sections 3.5.1, 3.5.2). As expected, these content features yield excellent results in-domain, but the accuracy deteriorates out-of-domain, espe- cially in the most challenging task of NLI.  The content-independent features (Sec- tion 3.5.3), whose contribution is depicted in   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> shows the results obtained by combin- ing the spelling features with the grammar features (Section 3.5.2). Clearly, these two feature types reflect somewhat different phenomena, as the re- sults are better than using any of the two alone.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> shows the accuracy obtained by all the centrality features (Section 3.5.4), excluding the most popular subreddits. As expected, the contri- bution of these features is small, and is most ev- ident on the binary task. The signal of the native language reflected by these features is very subtle, but is nonetheless present, as the results are con- sistently higher than the baseline.  Finally, the contribution of the most popular subreddits feature is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 6</ref>. The results for this single feature type are superb, both in-and out-of-domain. However, as this feature is unique to the dataset used for the present work, it is hard to see it generalized to similar tasks that use other datasets, even in the context of UGC.    Summing up, we have shown that the challeng- ing task of native language identification in the context of user generated content, where English texts are authored by highly competent nonnative speakers with as many as 23 native languages, can be accomplished with very high accuracy, as high as 86% when evaluated in-domain, and al- most 79% out-of-domain <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 7)</ref>. While these results deteriorate when the specific characteris- tics of our dataset are not taken advantage of, we still obtain very high accuracy on the binary task of distinguishing native from nonnative speakers, and on the four-way task of identifying the lan- guage family of the authors' L1 <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">(Table 8</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Dialect robustness</head><p>To assess the robustness of our results, especially in the context of dialect identification, we repeated the experiments in a special scenario: we trained classifiers on all the data, but removed from the English training set users from Ireland. Then, we tested the classifiers only on users from Ireland. We used all the features listed above, except the subreddit feature.</p><p>The results are 59.09% accuracy in-domain, compared with 69.21% in the standard scenario, where users from Ireland are also used for train- ing; and 37.51% out-of-domain, compared with 47.85% in the standard scenario. In both cases, accuracy drops by 10 percent points. We conclude that our method is reasonably robust to dialectal variation, at least in the case of English varieties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analysis</head><p>We now set out to analyze some of the more inter- esting features, both in terms of their contribution to the accuracy of the classification and in terms of what they reveal about the English of advanced nonnative speakers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Social network features</head><p>Subreddits This feature set works so well be- cause many of the most popular subreddits in which users post are culturally revealing. Specif- ically, there is a significant presence in this list to (subreddits focusing on) specific countries. Very likely, most of the active users in those subreddits reside in these countries, thereby revealing their native language. This corroborates our hypothesis that native users of the same language tend to be active in mutual subreddits. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 9</ref> lists the average val- ues of the centrality features, comparing native vs. nonnative authors. The average values are higher for native users than for the nonnative ones in all of the centrality features, as we hypothesized. Ev- idently, native speakers are more central in social networks than nonnative ones.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Spelling</head><p>Edit Distance As expected, the average word edit distance of native users (0.048) was signifi- cantly lower compared to nonnative ones (0.071).</p><p>Substitutions Most revealing was the analysis of substitutions suggested by the spell checker, as they shed light on phonetic and orthographic influ- ences of the authors' L1 on their English. We list below some of the most common spelling errors. Vowels Replacing 'e' with 'a' was twice as common among nonnative users than native ones. Examples include 'existance', 'independance', 'privillages', and 'apparantly'. Similarly, replac- ing 'y' with 'i' was three times more common for nonnatives: 'synonims', 'analized', etc. Replac- ing 'o' with 'a' was common among nonnatives, especially in the context of diphthongs: 'enaugh' instead of 'enough', or 'cauntry' for 'country'.</p><p>Voicing Replacing 'f' with 'v' was com- mon mostly among German speakers: 'devense', 'bevore', 'sacrivice', etc. Another error that was relatively common in texts written by German speakers is the replacement of 'd' with 't' : 'un- terstand', 'canditate', 'upgradet', 'hundret', etc. Confusing 'z' with 's' was very common across all L1s, even for natives. Among native users this reflects spelling variations between US and UK English. Thus, the spell-checker marks the follow- ing forms, i.a., in New Zealand English: 'Organ- isation', 'Recognise', 'Realise', 'Criticise', etc. Replacing 's' with 'z' was not as common in the dataset, and was present mostly in texts of French users: 'advertize', 'tablez', and, most frequently, 'surprize'.</p><p>Other substitutions Replacing 'c' with 'k' was almost four times more common with non- natives; it was significantly more common among Germanic and Balto-Slavic speakers, and much less common among Romance speakers. Exam- ples include 'inspektor', 'klassik', etc. Replacing 't' with 'c' was common in words in which the 't' is pronounced <ref type="bibr">[S]</ref>: 'negociate', 'nacional'. This error was prevalent in texts of Spanish authors.</p><p>Insertions and deletions Insertion of 'o' was common for all nonnative speakers, often when the word contains one 'o' but the pronunciation is [u], e.g., 'proove' instead of 'prove'. Spurious oc- currences of 'e' were also very common among all nonnative users, especially authors whose L1 was French: 'governement', 'unemployement', 'ex- plicitely'. Deletions of 'e' were also very com- mon, especially in the context of words that end with 'ely' : 'definitly', 'completly', 'extremly', 'absolutly', etc. Spurious instances of 'u' were mostly present in texts of authors with Germanic and Romance L1s, e.g.: 'languague', 'percentu- age'.</p><p>Wrong insertions of 'l' were very common, es- pecially at the end of words that end with 'l' : 'un- till', 'controll', 'usefull'. Deletion of 'l' was com- mon for all nonnative users, especially with Balto- Slavic L1s. The most common context for this error is words ending with 'ally' : 'literaly', 'ac- tualy', 'basicaly', 'illegaly', 'totaly', 'personaly', etc.</p><p>The most common deletion among nonnatives was omission of the first 'r' in 'surprise', followed by omitting the first 'n' in 'government'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Grammar</head><p>We list below some of the grammar rules whose violations distinguish well between native and nonnative speakers, using the original grammar checker rule names. Unsurprisingly, several gram- mar rules were violated much more (twice as fre- quently) by nonnative users:</p><p>adverb word order wrong position of adverb, e.g., 'people sometimes will respond' instead of 'people will sometimes respond'.</p><p>cd nn agreement error of a numeral followed by a singular count noun, e.g., 'I have 5 book'. this nns using 'this' instead of 'these' or vice versa, e.g., 'you don't know what these symbol represent'. did baseform using a tensed verb after 'did' or 'didn't' : 'the court didn't gave him a fair trial'. a uncountable an indefinite article before non- count nouns: 'smaller places have an access to...'.</p><p>fewer less confusing 'fewer' with 'less' : 'with less possibilities'. much countable using 'much' instead of 'many' : 'no matter how much people'. This error was much more common among nonnative users, although, among native speakers, it was significantly more common in texts written by users from New-Zealand and Ireland than in texts of other English speaking users.</p><p>en a vs an confusing 'a' with 'an' : 'it pro- vides a organized way to discuss'. This error was very common among speakers of Germanic and Romance languages, but less common among speakers of Balto-slavic languages (presumably due to the lack of articles in their L1s).</p><p>In contrast, some grammar rules were violated more by native speakers:</p><p>possessive apostrophe omitting the apostro- phe in possessive ''s' : 'they had 20% of the worlds remittance'. This error was more than twice as common in texts of natives.</p><p>try and the verb 'try' followed by 'and' ; this is common in colloquial speech, but is prescrip- tively wrong: 'a candidate should try and repre- sent'. This rule was violated over three times more frequently by native speakers (but rarely in texts of New-Zealand users).</p><p>their is 'there' and 'their' are commonly con- fused; this rule spots such cases by the presence of 'be' : 'their are a lot of'. about its nn confusing 'its' and 'it's' is com- mon; this rule identifies wrong usage after a prepo- sition: 'lash out regularly towards it's neighbors'. This error was most common in texts of English speakers from Australia, Ireland and the UK, but not the US.</p><p>Summing up, it seems that nonnative speakers make more grammatical errors, while the mistakes of native speakers either stem from sloppy writing style and lack of attention, or reflect style varia- tions and casual style rather than actual errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We described a system that can accurately iden- tify the native language of highly-advanced, fluent nonnative authors as reflected in the social media Reddit corpus. This is among the first studies to perform NLI in the highly challenging scenario of user generated content, particularly at such a large scale. We showed that while content-dependent features yield more accurate results, features that abstract away from content tend to be more ro- bust when tested out of the domain of training. The in-depth analysis of spelling and grammar er- rors demonstrates that mistakes made by nonna- tive speakers reflect traces of their native language. We also illuminated some of the social characteris- tics of native and nonnative authors on social me- dia outlets.</p><p>Our future plans include adaptation of the trained models to additional corpora, e.g., user generated content collected from Facebook and Twitter. Furthermore, we plan to devise unsu- pervised approaches to the identification of native language with the same dataset. We would also like to test the classifiers defined here in the more challenging scenario of smaller text chunks (e.g., 10-20 sentences rather than the 100-sentence text chunks we used here). Finally, we are currently experimenting with adversarial learning models for this task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="true"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Feature Set

			<note place="foot" n="1"> It is important to note that some of our features are specific to the Reddit corpus and will not easily generalize to other datasets.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Similar classification tasks, e.g., the TOEFL task (Tetreault et al., 2013; Malmasi et al., 2017), used single essays as the unit for classification. Tasks aiming to identify translation and its source language typically use chunks of 2000 tokens (Volansky et al., 2015). We plan to experiment also with smaller chunks.</note>
