				<p>This paper presents a set of dimensions to characterize the association between two people. We distinguish between interactions (when somebody refers to somebody in a conversation) and relationships (a sequence of interactions). We work with dialogue scripts from the TV show Friends, and do not impose any restrictions on the interactions and relationships. We introduce and analyze a new corpus, and present experimental results showing that the task can be automated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>People interact with each other and as a result form relationships. These relationships range from weak (e.g., John talking to a waiter to order a drink) to strong (e.g., John and his best friend discussing career options). Tradi- tionally, information extraction systems target, among others, relationships between people, e.g., PARENT, SIBLING, OTHER-PERSONAL, OTHER- PROFESSIONAL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Doddington et al., 2004</ref>).</p><p>Extracting a label describing the general rela- tionship between two entities-often called rela- tion type-is useful for tasks such as summariza- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jijkoun et al., 2004</ref>) and question answer- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">White et al., 2001</ref>). Only assigning a rela- tion type, however, does not account for nuances in the relationship between two individuals. First, a relationship can be characterized beyond a re- lation type. For example, people having a PRO- FESSIONAL relationship may be spatially near or distant (working at the same or different offices), and have an equal or hierarchical relationship (two software developers or a developer and the CEO). Second, relationships are defined by mul- tiple interactions, and the fine-grained character- istics of interactions do not necessarily mirror the characteristics of the corresponding relationship.</p><p>For example, software developers having a coop- erative PROFESSIONAL relationship may have a heated interaction in a meeting that does not affect the long-term PROFESSIONAL relationship. Simi- larly, the same software developers having a task- oriented PROFESSIONAL relationship may have occasionally pleasure oriented interactions (e.g., when they go out for drinks on Fridays).</p><p>This kind of fine-grained characteristics of in- teractions and relationships are called dimensions in social science ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wish et al., 1976)</ref>. Social sci- entists have also studied language usage and how people interact with each other depending on their relationship. For example, Gibbs (2000) studies irony (sarcasm, hyperbole, understatement, etc.) in communications among friends, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Snyder and Stukas Jr (1999)</ref> analyze the expectations in social interactions (e.g., interactions between strangers tend to be more formal) as well as the conse- quences of breaking expectations. In the social sciences, however, researchers mostly focus on how people act (e.g., how they talk to each other and about each other) and how people perceive in- teractions and relationships. In general, they do not attempt to automatically characterize interac- tions or relationships from language usage.</p><p>In this paper, we characterize the interactions between people and the resulting relationships. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) a set of dimensions to characterize interactions and re- lationships, including dimensions previously de- fined in the social sciences and two novel dimen- sions; (b) annotations of these dimensions for all interactions and relationships in 24 episodes of the TV show Friends (Season 1); (c) corpus analy- sis including agreements, label distributions and correlations; and (d) experimental results showing that classifiers grounded on language usage (and discarding the names of people being considered) are successful at automating the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Previous Work</head><p>Within natural language processing, there have been several recent efforts working with relation- ships between people. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Voskarides et al. (2015)</ref> ex- tract human-readable descriptions of relations in a knowledge graph. Unlike the work presented here, they experiment with a proprietary knowl- edge graph and rely heavily on features extracted from the graph. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Iyyer et al. (2016)</ref> propose an unsupervised algorithm to extract relationship tra- jectories of fictional characters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bracewell et al. (2012)</ref> introduce social acts (e.g., agreement, un- dermining) designed to characterize relationships exhibiting adversarial and collegial behavior (sim- ilar to our cooperative vs. competitive dimension). None of these works distinguish between interac- tions and relationships, characterize interactions and relationships with dimensions, or consider all interactions between two people.</p><p>In our previous work, we characterize interper- sonal relationships with dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rashid and Blanco, 2017)</ref>. In this paper, we improve upon our previous effort as follows. First, we distin- guish between interpersonal interactions and rela- tions. Second, we work with dialogues thus the same people interact with each other many times.</p><p>There have been a few studies on analyzing language usage when people communicate. For example, Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) study how power differences affect language style in online communities, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Prabhakaran and Rambow (2014)</ref> present a classifier to detect power relationships in email threads. Similarly, Gilbert (2012) explores how people in hierarchical rela- tionships communicate through email, and Bram- sen et al. (2011) focus on identifying power rela- tionships in social networks. Politeness in online forums has also been studied (Danescu-Niculescu- Mizil et al., 2013). While power (similar to our equal vs. hierarchical dimension, Section 3) and politeness could be considered dimensions, these works exploit structural and linguistic features derived from communications between two indi- viduals. Unlike all of them, we distinguish be- tween and characterize interactions and relation- ships, and automate the task using only informa- tion derived from language usage.</p><p>Information extraction systems target, among others, relationships between people. There have been many evaluations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Grishman and Sundheim, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Doddington et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kulick et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Surdeanu and Heng, 2014)</ref>, and there are two main approaches. Traditionally, relationships are defined before training takes place (e.g., PAR- ENT, FRIENDS), and systems are trained using su- pervised machine learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu and Lam, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nguyen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">West et al., 2014</ref>). On the other hand, open information extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wu and Weld, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angeli et al., 2015)</ref> has emerged as an unsupervised domain-independent approach to extract relations. Regardless of details, these pre- vious works extract explicit relationships and do not attempt to characterize instances of relation- ships with dimensions. Additionally, they do not distinguish between interactions and relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Interpersonal Interactions and Relationships</head><p>In this paper, we work with transcripts of conver- sations and define interaction and relationship as follows. An interaction between two people x and y exists for each conversation turn by either x or y referring to the other person. A relationship be- tween two people x and y exists if there is at least one interaction between them. One could under- stand a relationship between x and y as the asso- ciation defined by a sequence of interactions be- tween x and y. Beyond these definitions, we do not impose any restriction on what constitutes an interaction or relationship: interactions occur each time two people refer to each other in their speech (even if they are not talking to each other), and one or more interactions constitute a relationship. Interactions and relationships between people have been extensively studied in psychology and social sciences in general. The right set of di- mensions is not agreed upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wish et al., 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deutsch, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adamopoulos, 2012)</ref>, and we ar- gue that it depends on the domain of interest (e.g., personal diaries vs. news articles covering pol- itics). We note that dimensions apply to inter- actions and relationships between specific people (i.e., instances of interactions and relationships), not relation types. For example, a KINSHIP rela- tionship between x and y could be intense or super- ficial (depending on x and y) and a particular inter- action of that relationship may be spatially near or distant (even for the same x and y).</p><p>The dimensions we work with are briefly sum- marized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and described below. All but two dimensions are defined in previous work in the social sciences (see references in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other descriptors</head><p>Ref. Dimensions of Interactions. We consider four di- mension of interactions between people, i.e., when a speaker refers to a person in a conversation:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction</head><p>• Cooperative vs. Competitive. A interaction is cooperative if both people (a) have a common interest or goal, (b) like each other, (c) ben- efit from the interaction, or (d) think alike or share similar views. Otherwise, the interac- tion is competitive.</p><p>• Active vs. Passive. An interaction is active if both people communicate directly. Other- wise, the interaction is passive. For example, when John talks to Bill about Mary, John and Bill have an active interaction, and John and Mary have a passive interaction.</p><p>• Concurrent vs. Nonconcurrent. An interac- tion is concurrent if both people are involved in an event or action at the same time (the event does not need to be a communicating event). Otherwise, the interaction is noncon- current. For example, when John talks to Bill about a trip with Mary, John and Mary have a concurrent interaction, but when John talks to Bill about Paul's house, John and Paul have a nonconcurrent interaction.</p><p>• Spatially Near vs. Distant. An interaction is spatially near (or near for short) if the in- teraction is concurrent and both people are at the same location during the event in which they are involved. Otherwise, the interaction is spatially distant (or distant for short).</p><p>Dimensions of Relationships. We consider five dimensions of relationships between people:</p><p>• Equal vs. Hierarchical. A relationship is equal if both people (a) have the same social status, (b) are at the same level in the power structure, (c) share similar responsibilities, or (d) have the same role. Otherwise, the rela- tionship is hierarchical.</p><p>• Intense vs. Superficial. A relationship is in- tense if both people interact with each other frequently, i.e., they are involved repeatedly. Otherwise, the relationship is superficial.</p><p>• Pleasure vs. Task Oriented. A relationship is pleasure oriented if both people interact so- cially and their relationship is not bound by professional rules or regulations. Otherwise, the relationship is task oriented.</p><p>• Intimate vs. Unintimate. A relationship is in- timate if both people are emotionally close and warm to each other. Otherwise, the rela- tionship in unintimate.</p><p>• Temporary vs. Enduring. A relationship is temporary if it lasts less than a day. A rela- tionship is enduring if it last over a month. Otherwise (if it lasts more than a day and less than a month), this dimension is undefined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Annotating Dimensions of Interactions and Relationships</head><p>Annotating dimensions of interactions and rela- tionships requires a corpus in which the same peo- ple interact several times. We augment an existing corpus of scripts from the TV show Friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen and Choi, 2016</ref>). More specifically, we work with the 24 episodes from Season 1 because they:</p><p>• contain a large number of conversation turns (9,168, see counts per episode in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>); • involve many characters (42 characters speak at least 100 conservation turns, see the char- acters that interact the most in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, and the full list in the supplementary materials);</p><p>• include speaker information (i.e., we have ac- cess to who says what); and • include annotations linking each mention of people in each conversation turn to the actual person (the name of the person). Beyond size, the main motivation to use this corpus is the last item above: starting from scratch with another corpus of dialogues would require a substantially larger annotation effort. We refer the reader to the afore-cited paper for details, but the original corpus clusters mentions to people such as guy, my brother and he together with other men- tions of the same person. The original corpus is publicly available, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> and we release our annotations as stand-alone annotations. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Selecting Pairs of People</head><p>The corpus we start with makes it straightforward to select pairs of people whose interactions and corresponding relationships will be annotated. We consider as interactions all instances of somebody mentioning (or referring to) somebody else in a conversation turn. We consider as relationships in- dividuals who interact at least once. Note that we do not (a) distinguish between x mentioning y and y mentioning x, and (b) consider as an interaction x talking to y unless the conversation turn contains a mention to y (the mention need not be the ac- tual name, it could be a pronoun or any nominal mention). Our rationale is as follows. First, all dimensions of interactions are symmetric; and all dimensions of relationships are symmetric except equal vs. hierarchical. Second, the characters of Friends refer to each other explicitly at least once in most conversations and scenes, either using first names or the pronoun you. Thus we are consider- ing as an interaction most verbal exchanges. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows basic counts per episode. We show the number of interactions, unique relation- ships (i.e., interactions between unique pairs of people), and the pair of people who interact the most. The supplementary materials include an ex- tended table listing the number of times each pair of people interact per episode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Annotation Process</head><p>The annotations were done one episode at a time. Annotators were presented with the full tran- script of the episode including speaker informa- tion (who speaks what?) and the names of the individuals mentioned in each conversation turn (who do speakers talk about?). Annotators read each episode from the beginning, and annotate dimensions of interactions and relationships af- ter each interaction. Regarding interactions, they were instructed to annotate dimensions taking into account the language of the current conversa- tion turn. Regarding relationships, they were in- structed to annotate dimensions taking into ac- count all previous conversation turns within the same episode. For example, if previous turns state that Rachel and Monica are best friends, the rela- tionship will continue to be annotated intense even if an interaction does not indicate so (until a turn indicates that they are not friends, if applicable).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speaker 2nd party</head><p>Cooperative (I) 1: Wait, does he eat chalk? Phoebe Paul -1 2: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. Ross Woman -1 3: She is so peaceful.</p><p>Monica Phoebe 1 Speaker 2nd party Concurrent (I) 4: Well, then can we meet him? Rachel Alan -</p><note type="other">1 5: Hey, buddy, what's up!

Monica Mr. Geller -1 Speaker 2nd party</note><p>Intense (R) 10: Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by? Rachel Dr. Franzblau -1 11: There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! Chandler Aurora -1 12: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.</p><p>Monica Rachel 1  We discovered during pilot annotations that the value for a dimension sometimes cannot be deter- mined. For example, if the first interaction be- tween Rachel and Monica is Rachel: How are [you] Monica doing?, we cannot tell if the relation- ship is temporary or enduring. We note, however, that all interaction after we find out that they are best friends (as long as they remain best friends) will be annotated enduring. Hereafter, we refer to dimensions by the first descriptor in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and use 1 if the first descriptor of a dimension is true, -1 if the second descriptor is true, and 0 if neither the first nor the second descriptor can be chosen. Annotation Quality. The annotations were done by two graduate students in computational linguis- tics. First, they did pilot annotations to better de- fine the dimensions (Section 3). After several iter- ations, both of them annotated 3 episodes (15% of all interactions). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> presents the inter- annotator agreements. Cohen's κ range between 0.77 and 0.89, and most (7 out of 9) are above 0.80, which is considered perfect agreement. Val- ues between 0.60 and 0.80 are considered substan- tial ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref>. The remaining episodes were annotated once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Annotation Examples</head><p>We present annotation examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The interactions in conversation turns 1 and 2 are com- petitive: Phoebe is ridiculing Paul by asking Mon- ica if he eats chalk, and Ross is confronting an unnamed woman. In turn (3), Monica refers to Phoebe with affection (as the latter sleeps), thus the interaction is cooperative. Turns (4-6) exem- plify concurrent vs. nonconcurrent. In (4), Rachel is inquiring whether she can meet Alan (Monica's boyfriend), and Rachel and Alan are not involved in the same event (at this point, the meeting may or may not happen). In (5-6), however the speaker and second party are involved directly in a com- munication event. In examples (4-6), the values for active are the same as for concurrent.</p><p>Turns 7-12 present examples for dimensions of relationships. Examples 7 and 9 are fairly straight- forward: previous interactions reveal that Joey is   an adult and Monica's father is indeed Mr. Geller. Example 8 is annotated equal, as Chandler and Ross are friends based on previous interactions (the use of pal also helps). Examples 10-12 re- quire more explanation, as additional information beyond the current conversation turn is required (recall that dimensions of relationships are anno- tated taking into account the previous turns within the same episode, Section 4.2). Dr. Franzblau is the doctor of a friend's ex-wife, so Monica and him have a superficial relationship (Turn 10). At the point Turn (11) is spoken by Chandler, she and Aurora are strangers, so they have a superficial re- lationship. In (12), previous conversations reveal that Monica and Rachel are close friends, and they interact often (intense).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Corpus Analysis</head><p>The pie charts in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> present the label dis- tributions per dimension. Regarding interactions, we note that (a) values for all dimensions can be determined almost always (the percentages of 0 (unknown) are almost zero), and (b) the first de- scriptor is much more common in all dimensions. These percentages do not represent the distribu- tion of interactions between people in general: the scripts of the TV show Friends mostly contain conversation between friends. Regarding relation- ships, we observe a larger percentage of 0 (un- known) although values of all dimension can be determined most of the time (labels 1 and -1, in- dicating that the first or second descriptor apply). Most dimensions are biased towards 1 (the only exception is temporary, as most relationships are  enduring), especially pleasure oriented and equal (91.2% and 84.8%). Again, these distributions would be different if we worked with other sources of dialogue than the TV show Friends.</p><p>Many of the dimensions we consider in this work are intuitively correlated. For example, con- current interactions must be active, and pleasure oriented interactions are probably also equal. We note, however, that interactions can be passive and concurrent, e.g., in (Monica talking to Joey) <ref type="bibr">[He]</ref> Paul is just [a guy] Paul I am dating!, Monica and Paul have a passive and concurrent interac- tion (they are dating, but they are not talking to each other). <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>  of 36), although some pairs do have high correla- tions. In particular, active interactions tend to be both concurrent (0.81) and spatially near (0.71), and spatially near interactions tend to be concur- rent (0.89). Regarding relationships, intimate cor- relates with intense (0.75), pleasure oriented with equal (0.50), and temporary with both superficial (0.52) and intimate (0.54).</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the most salient words of dimensions spatially near and intense. We calculated salience using tf-idf ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schütze et al., 2008)</ref>. Interactions containing derogatory words (e.g., pig, bugs, pretending, cheating) tend to be distant, and near interactions contain mostly neu- tral and nicer words such as friends, sweatheart and please. We also note that cognitive verbs and nouns (e.g., thinking, figured (out), looking (into), cause), as well as important events (birth- day, thanksgiving) and slang usage (e.g., whad- dya) signal intense relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments and Results</head><p>We experimented with SVM classifiers with RBF kernel to predict dimensions of interactions and relationships. We divided the 24 episodes into train (episodes 1-20) and test <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>, and trained one classifier per dimension using scikit-learn (Pe-  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Results obtained with the test set with several systems (average of all dimensions).

Each classifier is trained with three labels: 1 (1st descriptor), -1 (2nd de- scriptor) and 0 (unknown). The SVM parame- ters (C and γ) were tuned using 10-fold cross- validation with the train split, and results are re- ported using the test split.</p><p>Note that different pairs of people interact more or less in each episode <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. Thus, the classi- fiers are grounded on general language usage and not modeling who talks and who is talked about. We also experimented with LSTMs taking as input the current conversation turn and previous turns, but do not report results because SVM classifiers yielded better results.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 (1st descriptor) 0 (unknown) -1 (2nd descriptor) All P R F P R F P R F P R F Interaction</formula><p>Cooperative 0.83 0.96 0.89 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.31 0.08 0.13 0.73 0.80 0.75 Active 0.92 0.90 0.92 n/a n/a n/a 0.75 0.76 0.75 0.87 0.87 0.87 Concurrent 0.92 0.92 0.92 n/a n/a n/a 0.70 0.69 0.70 0.87 0.87 0.87 Spat.

We use a combination of features extracted directly from the conversation turn, sen- timent lexica and context. Specifically, we ex- tract (a) the first word in the conversation turn, (b) bag-of-words features (binary flags and tf-idf scores), and (c) the root verb, and flags indicat- ing the presence of exclamation, question marks and negation cues from (Morante and Daelemans, 2012) (other). Regarding sentiment, we extract flags indicating whether the turn has a positive, negative or neutral word in the list by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hamilton et al. (2016)</ref>, the sentiment score of the turn (sum- mation of sentiment scores per token over number of tokens in the turn), and a flag indicating whether the turn contains a negative word from the list by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hu and Liu (2004)</ref>. Regarding context, we extract bag-of-words features from the previous conver- sation turn in which the same people interact (not necessarily the preceding turn). <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the overall results (average of all di- mensions) obtained with the majority baseline and several feature combinations. All feature combi- nations outperform the baseline. Sentiment fea- tures are not beneficial, leading to the conclusion that sentiment does not correlate with dimensions of interactions and relationships between people. This may look surprising at first sight, but recall that our dimensions capture much more than if two people get along <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Finally the bag- of-words features from the previous turn in which the same people interacted bring a small improve- ment (F: 0.70 vs. 0.72).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presents the task of characterizing in- teractions and relationships between people. We work with dialogue transcripts, and define an in- teraction as a speaker referring to somebody else, and a relationship as a sequence of one or more in- teractions. Unlike previous work (Section 2), we target all interactions and relationships, and use dimensions that are applicable to any interaction or relationship regardless of the underlying type (e.g., SIBLINGS, FRIENDS, DOCTOR-PATIENT).</p><p>We have presented an annotation effort on 24 episodes of the popular TV show Friends (Sea- son 1). The total number of conversation turns is 9,168, and the total number of interactions is 2,331. The label distribution per dimension shows that the labels are unbalanced, but a relatively straightforward SVM is able to outperform the majority baseline (F: 0.62 vs. 0.72, <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Fea- tures extracted using well-known sentiment lexica yield no improvements, leading to the conclusion that the dimensions we work with capture infor- mation beyond whether two people get along.</p><p>Crucially, values for the dimensions we work with can be determined most of the time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  1</ref>, labels 1 and -1). Since we do not impose any restriction on the interactions or relationships we work with, we conclude that these dimensions may be universally applicable.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Interactions</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
