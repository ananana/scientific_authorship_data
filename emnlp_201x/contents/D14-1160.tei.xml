				<p>Connecting words with senses, namely, sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, to comprehend the sensorial information in language is a straightforward task for humans by using commonsense knowledge. With this in mind, a lexicon associating words with senses would be crucial for the computational tasks aiming at interpretation of language. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic attempt in the literature to build such a resource. In this paper, we present a senso-rial lexicon that associates English words with senses. To obtain this resource, we apply a computational method based on bootstrapping and corpus statistics. The quality of the resulting lexicon is evaluated with a gold standard created via crowd-sourcing. The results show that a simple classifier relying on the lexicon out-performs two baselines on a sensory classification task, both at word and sentence level, and confirm the soundness of the proposed approach for the construction of the lexicon and the usefulness of the resource for computational applications.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sensorial information interpenetrates languages with various semantic roles in different levels since the main interaction instrument of humans with the outside world is the sensory organs. The trans- formation of the raw sensations that we receive through the sensory organs into our understand- ing of the world has been an important philo- sophical topic for centuries. According to a clas- sification that dates back to Aristotle <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johansen, 1997)</ref>, senses can be categorized into five modali- ties, namely, sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. With the help of perception, we can process the data coming from our sensory receptors and be- come aware of our environment. While interpret- ing sensory data, we unconsciously use our exist- ing knowledge and experience about the world to create a private experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bernstein, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Language has a significant role as our main communication device to convert our private ex- periences to shared representations of the environ- ment that we perceive ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Majid and Levinson, 2011)</ref>. As a basic example, onomatopoeic words, such as knock or woof, are acquired by direct imitation of the sounds allowing us to share the experience of what we hear. As another example, where an im- itation is not possible, is that giving a name to a color, such as blue, provides a tool to describe a visual feature of an object. In addition to the words that describe the direct sensorial features of ob- jects, languages include many other lexical items that are connected to sensory modalities in various semantic roles. For instance, while some words can be used to describe a perception activity (e.g., to sniff, to watch, to feel), others can simply be physical phenomena that can be perceived by sen- sory receptors <ref type="bibr">(e.g., light, song, salt, smoke)</ref>.</p><p>Common usage of language, either written or spoken, can be very dense in terms of sensorial words. As an example, the sentence "I felt the cold breeze." contains three sensorial words: to feel as a perception activity, cold as a perceived sensorial feature and breeze as a physical phenomenon. The connection to the sense modalities of the words might not be mutually exclusive, that is to say a word can be associated with more than one senses. For instance, the adjective sweet could be associ- ated with both the senses of taste and smell. While we, as humans, have the ability to connect words with senses intuitively by using our commonsense knowledge, it is not straightforward for machines to interpret sensorial information.</p><p>Making use of a lexicon containing sensorial words could be beneficial for many computa- tional scenarios. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rodriguez-Esteban and Rzhetsky (2008)</ref> report that using words related to senses in a text could clarify the meaning of an abstract concept by facilitating a more concrete imagina- tion. To this respect, an existing text could be au- tomatically modified with sensory words for vari- ous purposes such as attracting attention or biasing the audience towards a specific concept. Addition- ally, sensory words can be utilized to affect private psychology by inducing a positive or negative sen- timent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Majid and Levinson, 2011</ref>). For instance, de <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Araujo et al. (2005)</ref> show that the pleasantness level of the same odor can be altered by labeling it as body odor or cheddar cheese. As another moti- vation, the readability and understandability of text could also be enhanced by using sensory words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rodriguez-Esteban and Rzhetsky, 2008)</ref>. A com- pelling use case of a sensorial lexicon is that auto- matic text modification to change the density of a specific sense could help people with sensory dis- abilities. For instance, while teaching a concept to a congenitally blind child, an application that elim- inates color-related descriptions would be benefi- cial. A sensorial lexicon could also be exploited by search engines to personalize the results according to user needs.</p><p>Advertising is another broad area which would benefit from such a resource especially by using synaesthesia 1 , as it strengthens creative thinking and it is commonly exploited as an imagination boosting tool in advertisement slogans <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pricken, 2008)</ref>. As an example, we can consider the slogans "The taste of a paradise" where the sense of sight is combined with the sense of taste or "Hear the big picture" where sight and hearing are merged.</p><p>Various studies have been conducted both in computational linguistics and cognitive sci- ence that build resources associating words with several cognitive features such as abstractness- concreteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Coltheart, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Turney et al., 2011</ref>), emotions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mohammad and Turney, 2010)</ref>, colors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Özbal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mohammad, 2011</ref>) and imageability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Coltheart, 1981)</ref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no attempt in the literature to build a resource that associates words with senses. In this paper, we propose a computational method to automatically generate a sensorial lexicon that associates words in English with senses. Our method consists of two main steps. First, we gen-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">American</head><p>Heritage Dictionary (http:// ahdictionary.com/) defines synaesthesia in linguis- tics as the description of one kind of sense impression by using words that normally describe another. erate a set of seed words for each sense category with the help of a bootstrapping approach. In the second step, we exploit a corpus based probabilis- tic technique to create the final lexicon. We eval- uate this lexicon with the help of a gold standard that we obtain by using the crowdsourcing service of CrowdFlower 2 .</p><p>The sensorial lexicon, which we named Sen- sicon, embodies 22,684 English lemmas together with their part-of-speech (POS) information that have been linked to one or more of the five senses. Each entry in this lexicon consists of a lemma-POS pair and a score for each sensory modality that in- dicates the degree of association. For instance, the verb stink has the highest score for smell as ex- pected while the scores for the other four senses are very low. The noun tree, which is a concrete object and might be perceived by multiple senses, has high scores for sight, touch and smell.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first review previous work relevant to this task in Section 2. Then in Section 3, we describe the proposed approach in detail. In Section 4, we ex- plain the annotation process that we conducted and the evaluation strategy that we employed. Finally, in Section 5, we draw our conclusions and outline possible future directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Since to the best of our knowledge there is no at- tempt in the literature to automatically associate words with human senses, in this section we will summarize the most relevant studies that focused on linking words with various other cognitive fea- tures.</p><p>There are several studies focusing on word- emotion associations. WordNet Affect Lexicon ( ) maps WordNet <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998</ref>) synsets to various cognitive fea- tures (e.g., emotion, mood, behaviour). This re- source is created by using a small set of synsets as seeds and expanding them with the help of se- mantic and lexical relations among these synsets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al. (2007)</ref> propose a collocation model with emoticons instead of seed words while creat- ing an emotion lexicon from a corpus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Perrie et al. (2013)</ref> build a word-emotion association lexicon by using subsets of a human-annotated lexicon as seed sets. The authors use frequencies, counts, or unique seed words extracted from an n-gram cor- pus to create lexicons in different sizes. They pro-pose that larger lexicons with less accurate genera- tion method perform better than the smaller human annotated lexicons. While a major drawback of manually generated lexicons is that they require a great deal of human labor, crowdsourcing services provide an easier procedure for manual annota- tions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mohammad and Turney (2010)</ref> generate an emotion lexicon by using the crowdsourcing ser- vice provided by Amazon Mechanical Turk 3 and it covers 14,200 term-emotion associations.</p><p>Regarding the sentiment orientations and sub- jectivity levels of words, Sentiwordnet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006</ref>) is constructed as an extension to WordNet and it provides sentiments in synset level. Positive, negative and neutral values are as- signed to synsets by using ternary classifiers and synset glosses. Another study that has been inspi- rational for the design of our approach is <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banea et al. (2008)</ref>. The authors generate a subjectivity lexicon starting with a set of seed words and then using a similarity measure among the seeds and the candidate words.</p><p>Another cognitive feature relevant to sensorial load of the words is the association between col- ors and words. Mohammad (2011) builds a color- word association lexicon by organizing a crowd- sourcing task on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In- stead, <ref type="bibr">Özbal et al. (2011)</ref> aim to automate this process and propose three computational methods based on image analysis, language models and la- tent semantic analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Du- mais, 1997). The authors compare these meth- ods against a gold standard obtained by the crowd- sourcing service of Amazon Mechanical Turk. The best performance is obtained by using image features while LSA performs slightly better than the baseline.</p><p>Finally, there have been efforts in the liter- ature about the association of words with their abstractness-concreteness and imageability levels. MRC Psycholinguistic Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Coltheart, 1981)</ref> includes abstractness-concreteness and imageabil- ity ratings of a small set of words determined according to psycholinguistic experiments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Turney et al. (2011)</ref> propose to use LSA similarities of words with a set of seed words to automati- cally calculate the abstractness and concreteness degrees of words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Automatic Association of Senses with Words</head><p>We adopt a two phased computational approach to construct a large sensorial lexicon. First, we em- ploy a bootstrapping strategy to generate a suffi- cient number of sensory seed words from a small set of manually selected seed words. In the sec- ond phase, we perform a corpus based probabilistic method to estimate the association scores to build a larger lexicon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Selecting Seed Words</head><p>The first phase of the lexicon construction pro- cess aims to collect sensorial seed words, which are directly related to senses (e.g., sound, tasty and sightedness). To achieve that, we utilized a lexical database called FrameNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker et al., 1998)</ref>, which is built upon semantic frames of con- cepts in English and lexical units (i.e., words) that evoke these frames. The basic idea behind this resource is that meanings of words can be under- stood on the basis of a semantic frame. A semantic frame consists of semantic roles called frame ele- ments, which are manually annotated in more than 170,000 sentences. We have considered FrameNet to be especially suitable for the collection of sen- sorial seed words since it includes semantic roles and syntactic features of sensational and percep- tional concepts.</p><p>In order to determine the seed lemma-POS pairs in FrameNet, we first manually determined 31 frames that we found to be highly connected to senses such as Hear, Color, Temperature and Per- ception_experience. Then, we conducted an an- notation task and asked 3 annotators to determine which senses the lemma-POS pairs evoking the collected frames are associated with. At the end of this task, we collected all the pairs (i.e. 277) with 100% agreement to constitute our initial seed set. This set contains 277 lemma-POS pairs associated with a specific sense such as the verb click with hearing, the noun glitter with sight and aromatic with smell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Seed Expansion via Bootstrapping</head><p>In this step, we aim to extend the seed list that we obtained from FrameNet with the help of a boot- strapping approach. To achieve that, we adopt a similar approach to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dias et al. (2014)</ref>, who pro- pose a repetitive semantic expansion model to au- tomatically build temporal associations of synsets in WordNet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> provides an overview of the bootstrapping process. At each iteration, we first expand the seed list by using semantic rela- tions provided by WordNet. We then evaluate the accuracy of the new seed list for sense classifica- tion by means of cross-validation against WordNet glosses. For each sense, we continue iterating un- til the cross-validation accuracy becomes stable or starts to decrease. The following sections explain the whole process in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Extending the Seed List with WordNet</head><p>While the initial sensory seed list obtained from FrameNet contains only 277 lemma-POS pairs, we extend this list by utilizing the semantic re- lations provided by WordNet. To achieve that, we first map each lemma-POS pair in the seed list to WordNet synsets with the help of Map- Net ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tonelli and Pighin, 2009)</ref>, which is a re- source providing direct mapping between Word- Net synsets and FrameNet lexical units. Then, we add to the list the synsets that have WordNet re- lations direct antonymy, similarity, derived-from, derivationally-related, pertains-to, attribute and also-see with the already existing seeds. For in- stance, we add the synset containing the verb laugh for the synset of the verb cry with the relation di- rect antonymy, or the synset containing the ad- jective chilly for the synset of the adjective cold with the relation similarity. We prefer to use these relations as they might allow us to preserve the semantic information as much as possible during the extension process. It is worth mentioning that these relations were also found to be appropriate for preserving the affective connotation by . Additionally, we use the rela- tions hyponym and hyponym-instance to enrich the seed set with semantically more specific synsets. For instance, for the noun seed smell, we expand the list with the hyponyms of its synset such as the nouns bouquet, fragrance, fragrancy, redolence and sweetness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Cross-validation of Sensorial Model</head><p>After obtaining new synsets with the help of Word- Net relations in each bootstrapping cycle, we build a five-class sense classifier over the seed synsets defined by their glosses provided in WordNet.</p><p>Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dias et al. (2014)</ref>, we assume that the sense information of sensorial synsets is pre- served in their definitions. Accordingly, we em- ploy a support vector machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boser et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Vapnik, 1998</ref>) model with second de- gree polynomial kernel by representing the gloss of each synset as a vector of lemmas weighted by their counts. For each synset, its gloss is lemma- tized by using Stanford Core NLP 4 and cleaned from the stop words. After each iteration cycle, we perform a 10-fold cross-validation in the updated seed list to detect the accuracy of the new sensorial model. For each sense class, we continue iterating and thereby expanding the seed list until the clas- sifier accuracy steadily drops. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the precision (P), recall (R) and F1 values obtained for each sense after each it- eration until the bootstrapping mechanism stops. While the iteration number is provided in the first column, the values under the last column group present the micro-average of the resulting multi- class classifier. The change in the performance values of each class in each iteration reveals that the number of iterations required to obtain the seed lists varies for each sense. For instance, the F1 value of touch continues to increase until the fourth cycle whereas hearing records a sharp decrease af- ter the first iteration.</p><p>After the bootstrapping process, we create the final lexicon by repeating the expansion for each class until the optimal number of iterations is reached. The last row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, labeled as Final, demonstrates the accuracy of the classifier trained and tested on the final lexicon, i.e., using the seeds selected after iteration 2 for Sight, iteration 1 for Hearing, iteration 3 for Taste and Smell and it- eration 4 for Touch. According to F1 measure- ments of each iteration, while hearing and taste have a lower value for the final model, sight, smell and touch have higher results. It should also be noted that the micro-average of the F1 values of the final model shows an increase when compared to the third iteration, which has the highest av- erage F1 value among the iterations. At the end of this step we have a seed synset list consisting of 2572 synsets yielding the highest performance when used to learn a sensorial model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Sensorial Lexicon Construction Using Corpus Statistics</head><p>After generating the seed lists consisting of synsets for each sense category with the help of a set of WordNet relations and a bootstrapping process, we use corpus statistics to create our final sensorial lexicon. More specifically, we exploit a proba- bilistic approach based on the co-occurrence of the seeds and the candidate lexical entries. Since working on the synset level would raise the data sparsity problem in synset tagged corpora such as SemCor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miller et al., 1993</ref>) and we need a cor- pus that provides sufficient statistical information, we migrate from synset level to lexical level. Ac- cordingly, we treat each POS role of the same lem- mas as a distinct seed and extract 4287 lemma-POS pairs from 2572 synsets. In this section, we explain the steps to construct our final sensorial lexicon in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Corpus and Candidate Words</head><p>As a corpus, we use a subset of English Giga- Word 5th Edition released by Linguistic Data Con- sortium (LDC) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . This resource is a collection of almost 10 million English newswire documents collected in recent years, whose content sums up to nearly 5 billion words. The richly annotated GigaWord data comprises automatic parses ob- tained with the Stanford parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Klein and Manning, 2003</ref>) so that we easily have access to the lemma and POS information of each word in the resource. For the scope of this study, we work on a randomly chosen subset that contains 79800 sentences and we define a co-occurrence event as the co-existence of a candidate word and a seed word within a window of 9 words(the candidate word, 4 words to its left and 4 words to its right).</p><p>In this manner, we analyze the co-occurrence of each unique lemma-POS pair in the corpus with the sense seeds. We eliminate the candidates which have less than 5 co-occurrences with the sense cat- egories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information</head><p>For the co-occurrence analysis of the candidate words and seeds, we use pointwise mutual in- formation (PMI), which is simply a measure of association between the probability of the co- occurrence of two events and their individual prob- abilities when they are assumed to be independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Church and Hanks, 1990)</ref>. PMI can be exploited as a semantic similarity measure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Han et al., 2013)</ref> and it is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P M I(x, y) = log [ p(x, y) p(x)p(y) ]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>To calculate the PMI value of a candidate word and a specific sense, we consider p(x) as the proba- bility of the candidate word to occur in the corpus. Therefore, p(x) is calculated as p(x) = c(x)/N , where c(x) is the total count of the occurrences of the candidate word x in the corpus and N is the to- tal co-occurrence count of all words in the corpus. Similarly, we calculate p(y) as the total occurrence count of all the seeds for the sense considered (y). p(y) can thus be formulated as c(y)/N . p(x,y) is the probability of the co-occurrence of a candidate word x with a sense event y.</p><p>A major shortcoming of PMI is its sensitivity for low frequency data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bouma, 2009)</ref>. As one pos- sible solution, the author introduces Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI), which nor- malizes the PMI values to the range (-1, +1) with the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N P M I(x, y) = P M I(x, y) − log p(x, y)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We adopt the proposed solution and calculate NPMI values for each candidate word and five sense events in the corpus. Sensicon covers 22,684 lemma-POS pairs and a score for each sense class that denotes their association degrees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the sensorial clas- sification and the quality of Sensicon, we first cre- ated a gold standard with the help of a crowdsourc- ing task. Then, we compared the decisions com- ing from Sensicon against the gold standard. In this section, we explain the annotation process that we conducted and the evaluation technique that we adopted in detail. We also provide a brief discus- sion about the obtained results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Crowdsourcing to Build a Gold Standard</head><p>The evaluation phase of Sensicon requires a gold standard data to be able to conduct a meaningful assessment. Since to our best knowledge there is no resource with sensory associations of words or  <ref type="table">Taste  Smell  Touch  Micro-average  It#  P  R  F1  P  R  F1  P  R  F1  P  R  F1  P  R  F1  P  R</ref>   sentences, we designed our own annotation task using the crowdsourcing service of CrowdFlower.</p><p>For the annotation task, we first compiled a col- lection of sentences to be annotated. Then, we de- signed two questions that the annotators were ex- pected to answer for a given sentence. While the first question is related to the sense association of a whole sentence, the second asks the annotators to collect a fine-grained gold standard for word-sense associations.</p><p>We collected a dataset of 340 sentences consist- ing of 300 advertisement slogans from 11 adver- tisement categories (e.g., fashion, food, electron- ics) and 40 story sentences from a story corpus. We collected the slogans from various online resources such as http://slogans.wikia.com/wiki and http://www.adslogans.co.uk/. The story corpus is generated as part of a dissertation re- search <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alm, 2008)</ref> and it provides stories as a col- lection of sentences.</p><p>In both resources, we first determined the can- didate sentences that had at least five tokens and contained at least one adjective, verb or noun. In addition, we replaced the brand names in the ad- vertisement slogans with X to prevent any bias. For instance, the name of a well-known restaurant in a slogan might cause a bias towards taste. Fi- nally, the slogans used in the annotation task were chosen randomly among the candidate sentences by considering a balanced number of slogans from each category. Similarly, 40 story sentences were selected randomly among the candidate story sen- tences. To give a more concrete idea, for our dataset we obtained an advertisement slogan such as "X's Sugar Frosted Flakes They're Great!" or a story sentence such as "The ground is frozen, and besides the snow has covered everything."</p><p>In the crowdsourcing task we designed, the an- notators were required to answer 2 questions for a given sentence. In the first question, they were asked to detect the human senses conveyed or di- rectly described by a given sentence. To exemplify these cases, we provided two examples such as "I saw the cat" that directly mentions the action of seeing and "The sun was shining on the blue wa- ter." that conveys the sense of sight by using vi- sual descriptions or elements like "blue" or "shine" which are notable for their visual properties. The annotators were able to select more than one sense for each sentence and together with the five senses we provided another option as None which should be selected when an annotator could not associate a sentence with any sense. The second question was devoted do determining word-sense associa- tions. Here, the annotators were expected to asso- ciate the words in each sentence with at least one sense. Again, annotators could choose None for every word that they could not confidently asso- ciate with a sense.</p><p>The reliability of the annotators was evaluated on the basis of 20 control sentences which were highly associated with a specific sense and which included at least one sensorial word. For instance, for the control sentence "The skin you love to touch", we only considered as reliable the anno- tators who associated the sentence with touch and the word touch with the sense touch 6 . Similarly, for the slogan "The most colourful name in cos- metics.", an annotator was expected to associate the sentence with at least the sense sight and the word colorful to at least the sense sight. The raters who scored at least 70% accuracy on average on the control questions for the two tasks were con- sidered to be reliable. Each unit was annotated by at least 10 reliable raters.</p><p>Similarly to Mohammad (2011) and <ref type="bibr">Özbal et al. (2011)</ref>, we calculated the majority class of each annotated item to measure the agreement among the annotators. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> demonstrates the observed agreement at both word and sentence level. Since 10 annotators participated in the task, the annota- tions with a majority class greater than 5 can be considered as reliable <ref type="bibr">(Özbal et al., 2011</ref>). In- deed, for 85.10% of the word annotations the ab- solute majority agreed on the same decision, while 77.58% of the annotations in the sentence level have majority class greater than 5. The high agree- ment observed among the annotators in both cases confirms the quality of the resulting gold standard data.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we present the results of the anno- tation task by providing the association percent- age of each category with each sense, namely sight (Si), hear (He), taste (Ta), smell (Sm) and touch (To). As demonstrated in the table, while the sense of sight can be observed in almost every advertise- ment category and in story, smell and taste are very rare. We observe that the story sentences invoke all sensory modalities except taste, although the per- centage of sentences annotated with smell is rela- tively low. Similarly, personal care category has an association with four of the senses while the other categories have either very low or no asso- ciation with some of the sense classes. Indeed, the perceived sensorial effects in the sentences vary according to the category such that the slogans in the travel category are highly associated with sight whereas the communication category is highly as- sociated with hearing. While the connection of the food and beverages categories with taste is very high as expected, they have no association with the sense of smell. This kind of analysis could be use- ful for copywriters to decide which sensory modal- ities to invoke while creating a slogan for a specific product category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Measures</head><p>Based on the annotation results of our crowdsourc- ing task, we propose an evaluation technique con- sidering that a lemma-POS or a sentence might be associated with more than one sensory modalities. Similar to the evaluation framework defined by <ref type="bibr">Özbal et al. (2011)</ref>, we adapt the evaluation mea- sures of <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2007 English Lexical Substitution Task (McCarthy and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Navigli, 2007)</ref>, where  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The categories of the annotated data and their sense association percentages.</p><p>a system generates one or more possible substitu- tions for a target word in a sentence preserving its meaning.</p><p>For a given lemma-POS or a sentence, which we will name as item in the rest of the section, we allow our system to provide as many sensorial as- sociations as it determines by using a specific lex- icon. While evaluating a sense-item association of a method, a best and an oot score are calculated by considering the number of the annotators who as- sociate that sense with the given item, the number of the annotators who associate any sense with the given item and the number of the senses the sys- tem gives as an answer for that item. More specif- ically, best scoring provides a credit for the best answer for a given item by dividing it to the num- ber of the answers of the system. oot scoring, on the other hand, considers only a certain number of system answers for a given item and does not di- vide the credit to the total number of the answers. Unlike the lexical substitution task, a limited set of labels (i.e., 5 sense labels and none) are allowed for the sensorial annotation of sentences or lemma- POS pairs. For this reason, we reformulate out-of- ten (oot) scoring used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McCarthy and Navigli (2007)</ref> as out-of-two.</p><p>In Equation 3, best score for a given item i from the set of items I, which consists of the items an- notated with a specific sense by a majority of 5 annotators, is formulated where H i is the multiset of gold standard sense associations for item i and S i is the set of sense associations provided by the system. oot scoring, as formulated in Equation 4, accepts up to 2 sense associations s from the an- swers of system S i for a given item i and the credit is not divided by the number of the answers of the system.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">best (i) = ∑ s∈S i f req (s ∈ H i ) |H i | · |S i | (3) oot (i) = ∑ s∈S i f req (s ∈ H i ) |H i |<label>(4)</label></formula><p>As formulated in Equation 5, to calculate the precision of an item-sense association task with a specific method, the sum of the scores (i.e., best or oot) for each item is divided by the number of items A, for which the method can provide an an- swer. In recall, the denominator is the number of the items in the gold standard for which an answer is given by the annotators.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P = ∑ i∈A score i |A| R = ∑ i∈I score i |I|<label>(5)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation Method</head><p>For the evaluation, we compare the accuracy of a simple classifier based on Sensicon against two baselines on a sense classification task both at word and sentence level. To achieve that, we use the gold standard that we obtain from the crowd- sourcing task and the evaluation measures best and oot. The lexicon-based classifier simply assigns to each word in a sentence the sense values found in the lexicon. The first baseline assigns the most frequently annotated sensory modality, which is sight, via crowdsourcing task with a float value of 1.0 to each lemma-POS pair in the sensorial lexi- con. The second baseline instead builds the associ- ations by using a Latent Semantic Analysis space generated from the same subset of LDC that we ex- ploit for constructing Sensicon. More specifically, this baseline calculates the LSA similarities be- tween each candidate lemma-POS pair and sense class by taking the cosine similarity between the vector of the target lemma-POS pair and the aver- age of the vectors of the related sensory word (i.e., see, hear, touch, taste, and smell) for each possi- ble POS tag. For instance, to get the association score of a lemma-POS pair with the sense sight, we first average the vectors of see (noun) and see (verb) before calculating its cosine similarity with the target lemma-POS pair. For the first experiment, i.e., word-sense as- sociation, we automatically associate the lemma- POS pairs obtained from the annotated dataset with senses by using i) Sensicon, ii) the most-frequent- sense baseline (MFS), iii) the LSA baseline. To achieve that, we lemmatize and POS tag each sen- tence in the dataset by using Stanford Core NLP. In the end, for each method and target word, we obtain a list of senses sorted according to their sensorial association values in decreasing order. It is worth noting that we only consider the non- negative sensorial associations for Sensicon and both baselines. For instance, Sensicon associates the noun wine with <ref type="bibr">[smell, taste, sight]</ref>. In this experiment, best scoring considers the associated senses as the best answer, smell, taste, sight ac- cording to the previous example, and calculates a score with respect to the best answer in the gold standard and the number of the senses in this an- swer. Instead, oot scoring takes the first two an- swers, smell and taste according to the previous example, and assigns the score accordingly.</p><p>To determine the senses associated with a sen- tence for the second experiment, we use a method similar to the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Turney (2002)</ref>. For each sense, we simply calculate the average score of the lemma-POS pairs in a sentence. We set a threshold value of 0 to decide whether a sentence is associated with a given sense. In this manner, we obtain a sorted list of average sensory scores for each sentence according to the three methods. For instance, the classifier based on Sensicon as- sociates the sentence Smash it to pieces, love it to bits. with <ref type="bibr">[touch, taste]</ref>. For the best score, only touch would be considered, whereas oot would consider both touch and taste.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Evaluation Results</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, we list the F1 values that we obtained with the classifier using Sensicon and the two base- lines (MFS and LSA) according to both best and oot measures. In addition, we provide the perfor- mance of Sensicon in two preliminary steps, before bootstrapping (BB) and after bootstrapping (AB) to observe the incremental progress of the lexicon construction method. As can be observed from the table, the best performance for both experiments is achieved by Sensicon when compared against the baselines.</p><p>While in the first experiment the lexicon gen- erated after the bootstrapping step (AB) provides a very similar performance to the final lexicon according to the best measure, it can only build sense associations for 69 lemmas out of 153 ap- pearing in the gold standard. Instead, the final lex- icon attempts to resolve 129 lemma-sense associa- tions and results in a better recall value. Addition- ally, AB yields a very high precision as expected, since it is created by a controlled semantical ex- pansion from manually annotated sensorial words. BB lexicon includes only 573 lemmas which are collected from 277 synsets and we can not ob- tain 2 sense association scores for oot in this lexi- con since each lemma is associated with only one sense with a value of 1. The LSA baseline yields a very low performance in the best measure due to its tendency to derive positive values for all sen- sorial associations of a given lemma-POS tuple. Another observed shortcoming of LSA is its fail- ure to correlate the names of the colors with sight while this association is explicit for the annotators. On the other hand, LSA baseline significantly im- proves the MFS baseline with a p-value of 0.0009 in oot measures. This result points out that even though LSA provides very similar positive asso- ciation values for almost all the sensory modali- ties for a given item, the first two sensorial asso- ciations with the highest values yield a better per- formance on guessing the sensorial characteristics of a lemma-POS. Nevertheless, Sensicon signifi- cantly outperforms the LSA baseline in both best and oot measures with the p-values of 0.0009 and 0.0189 respectively. The statistical significance tests are conducted using one-sided bootstrap re- sampling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Concerning the sentence classification experi- ment, the classifier using Sensicon yields the high- est performance in both measures. The very high F1 value obtained with the oot scoring indicates that the right answer for a sentence is included in the first two decisions in many cases. Sensi- con significantly outperforms the LSA baseline on the best measure (p-value = 0.0069). On the other hand, when systems are allowed to provide two an- swers (oot), the performance of LSA comes close to Sensicon in terms of F1 measure.</p><p>After the manual analysis of Sensicon and gold standard data, we observe that the sensorial clas- sification task could be nontrivial. For instance, a story sentence "He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook." has been most fre- quently annotated as hearing. While the sensorial- lexicon classifier associates this sentence with touch as the best answer, it can provide the cor- rect association hearing as the second best answer. To find out the best sensorial association for a sen- tence, a classification method which exploits var- ious aspects of sensorial elements in a sentence, such as the number of sensorial words or their de- pendencies, could be a better approach than using only the average sensorial values.  Based on our observations of the error cases, we believe that synaesthesia, which is one of the most common metaphoric transfers in language <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Williams, 1976)</ref>, should be further explored for sense classification. As an example observation, the advertisement slogan "100% pure squeezed sunshine" is associated with touch as the best an- swer by Sensicon and taste by LSA baseline while it is most frequently annotated as sight in the gold standard. This slogan is an example usage of synaesthesia and metaphors in advertising lan- guage. To clarify, a product from the category of beverages, which might be assumed to have a taste association, is described by a metaphorical substi- tution of a taste-related noun, most probably the name of a fruit, with a sight-related noun; sun- shine. This metaphorical substitution, then used as the object of a touch-related verb, to squeeze, produces a synaesthetic expression with touch and sight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have presented the construction of Sensicon, a sensorial lexicon, which associates words with sensory modalities. This novel aspect of word semantics is captured by employing a two- step strategy. First, we collected seed words by using a bootstrapping approach based on a set of WordNet relations. Then, we performed a cor- pus based statistical analysis to produce the final lexicon. Sensicon consists of 22,684 lemma-POS pairs and their association degrees with five sen- sory modalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic attempt to build a sen- sorial lexicon and we believe that our contribution constitutes a valid starting point for the commu- nity to consider sensorial information conveyed by text as a feature for various tasks and applications. The results that we obtain by comparing our lexi- con against the gold standard and two baselines are promising even though not conclusive. The results confirm the soundness of the proposed approach for the construction of the lexicon and the useful-ness of the resource for text classification and pos- sibly other computational applications.</p><p>Sensicon is publicly available upon request to the authors so that the community can benefit from it for relevant tasks. From a resource point of view, we would like to explore the effect of us- ing different kinds of WordNet relations during the bootstrapping phase. It would also be interest- ing to experiment with relations provided by other resources such as ConceptNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu and Singh, 2004</ref>), which is a semantic network containing common sense, cultural and scientific knowledge. We would also like to use the sensorial lexicon for various applicative scenarios such as slanting ex- isting text towards a specific sense with text modi- fication. We believe that our resource could be ex- tremely useful for automatic content personaliza- tion according to user profiles. As an example, one can imagine a system that automatically replaces hearing based expressions with sight based ones in pieces of texts for a hearing-impaired person. Au- tomating the task of building sensorial associations could also be beneficial for various tasks that need linguistic creativity. For instance, copywriters can take advantage of a system detecting the sensorial load of a piece of text to generate more appropri- ate advertisement slogans for specific product cat- egories. Finally, we plan to investigate the impact of using sensory information for metaphor detec- tion and interpretation based on our observations during the evaluation. For instance, the synaes- thetic metaphor bittersweet symphony could be de- tected by determining the sensorial characteriza- tions of its components.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Bootstrapping procedure to expand the seed list.</figDesc></figure>
