				<p>Prepositions are highly polysemous, and their variegated senses encode significant semantic information. In this paper we match each preposition&apos;s left-and right context, and their interplay to the geometry of the word vectors to the left and right of the preposition. Extracting these features from a large corpus and using them with machine learning models makes for an efficient preposition sense dis-ambiguation (PSD) algorithm, which is comparable to and better than state-of-the-art on two benchmark datasets. Our reliance on no linguistic tool allows us to scale the PSD algorithm to a large corpus and learn sense-specific preposition representations. The crucial abstraction of preposition senses as word representations permits their use in downstream applications-phrasal verb paraphrasing and preposition selection-with new state-of-the-art results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>English prepositions form a closed class show- ing no inflectional variation and are some of the most frequent words. A computational-linguistic understanding of prepositions remains challeng- ing owing to their highly polysemous nature and frequent participation in idiomatic expressions <ref type="bibr">(Saint-Dizier, 2006</ref>). In this paper, we study the problem of sense disambiguation for prepositions.  The highly polysemous nature of prepositions drives several syntactic and semantic processes. For instance, the preposition with has 18 senses listed in The Preposition Project (TPP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005</ref>), examples of which, are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We notice that with indicates an emotional state in with confusion and refers to an accompanier in combine with, while it sug- gests the idea of a tool or means in wash with wa- ter. Thus, preposition sense disambiguation (PSD) is vital for natural language understanding and a closer look at the function of prepositions in spe- cific contexts is an important computational step.</p><p>Previous approaches to PSD (for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ye and Baldwin, 2007;</ref>) have re- lied on linguistic tools and resources (the mini- mum of which involves dependency parsers and POS taggers) to capture the crucial contextual in- formation of prepositions. We depart from prior art by using no linguistic resources or tools other than a set of word representations (trained on a large corpus). We interpret preposition senses as groups of similar contexts, where each instance of the preposition 'sense' is represented as a vec- tor of context-dependent features. We find a sim- ple feature extraction process that creatively har- nesses the geometry of word representations and contributes to a scalable PSD algorithm. Our al- gorithm can reach near and even beat state-of-the- art performance on two benchmark datasets <ref type="bibr">(SemEval 2007 and OEC)</ref>; this is true in both unsu- pervised and supervised PSD settings.</p><p>A PSD algorithm that efficiently scales to a large corpus naturally paves the way for dis- tributed representations of the preposition senses: we enrich the corpus with sense-specific infor- mation of prepositions using our PSD algorithm. Next, we repurpose an off-the-shelf word repre- sentation algorithm (Word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>) to relearn word representations with the key aspect that the length of the context surround- ing the prepositions is crucially reduced. Sense- specific preposition representations thus learnt are strongly validated by using them in two applications-phrasal verb paraphrasing and prepo- sition selection-using available datasets. We re- leased our PSD system and paraphrasing dataset 1 available.</p><p>We summarize our contributions below:</p><p>• Novel Perspective of Preposition Behavior:</p><p>We provide a novel selectional aspect of the context that best represents the sense of a preposition, where we match classical ideas from linguistics with the appropriate geome- try of word embeddings. The standard view focuses on the left context (attachment) and the right context (complement) of the prepo- sition; in this paper, we include the interplay between these two elements via an appropri- ate geometric representation.</p><p>• Resource-independent Disambiguation:</p><p>We rely only on a set of trained word repre- sentations and no other language processing tool, where almost all prior approaches have included at least POS tagging and depen- dency parsing. Our results are comparable to, or better than, state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.</p><p>• Preposition Sense Representation Learn- ing: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on preposition sense represen- tation. The power of our sense represen- tation is reflected in the experimental com- parisons with strong baseline approaches to phrasal verb paraphrasing and preposition se- lection, where we demonstrate the superiority of our approach that uses sense representa- tion of prepositions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Works</head><p>We place our work in the context of related stud- ies in preposition representation and Preposition Sense Disambiguation: Preposition disambigua- tion has been explored on the SemEval dataset via various methods and external resources (part of speech taggers, chunkers, dependency parsers, named entity extractors, WordNet based super- sense taggers and semantic role labelers) since 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yuret, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ye and Baldwin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tratz and Hovy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Popescu et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srikumar and Roth, 2013)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gonen and Goldberg, 2016</ref>) use a multilingual parallel corpus processed using se- quence to sequence neural networks for prepo- sition disambiguation and achieve an accuracy within 5% of the state-of-the-art, which includes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Litkowski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srikumar and Roth, 2013)</ref>. We note that we achieve the compa- rable performance as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gonen and Goldberg, 2016)</ref> using only word embeddings.</p><p>Preposition Representation: Representation learning is fundamental to machine learning mod- els ( <ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Xu et al., 2018</ref>). Word embeddings such as Word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) and GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) have been widely recognized for their ability to cap- ture linguistic regularities (including syntactic and semantic relations). On the other hand, no lin- guistic property of their prepositional embeddings is known; to the best of our knowledge, we pro- pose the first sense-specific prepositional embed- dings and demonstrate their linguistic regularities. A recent unsupervised approach by Gong et al. learns preposition representations to encode the syntactics and semantics by capturing their attach- ment and complement properties. Distantly re- lated is <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hashimoto and Tsuruoka, 2015)</ref>, which learns embeddings of prepositions acting as verb adjuncts by the factorization of a predicate tensor. Similarly, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Belinkov et al., 2014</ref>) explores the use of preposition representations optimized for the task of prepositional phrase attachment, but do not analyze their sense-specificity.</p><p>Sense-specific Representations: Several prior studies have sought polysemy-aware alternatives to word representations that take into account the context of the target word, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Erk and Padó, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mitchell and Lapata, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Reisinger and Mooney, 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Thater et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dinu et al., 2012</ref>). More recently polysemy disambigua- tion for word embeddings have been proposed us- ing external resources such as WordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rothe and Schütze, 2015)</ref> or in an unsupervised way ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Song et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arora et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Neelakantan et al., 2014</ref>) with the latter two limit- ing the number of senses and validated for only nouns and verbs. The approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Neelakantan et al., 2014</ref>) is roughly similar to our baseline method using the average context vector. Our un- supervised approach is similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Reisinger and Mooney, 2010a</ref>), but limited to prepositions and uses novel features described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Preposition Sense Disambiguation</head><p>The key intuition behind our sense disambiguation approach is the modern descriptive linguistic view <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Huddleston, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">DeCarrico, 2000)</ref>: the sense of a preposition in any sentence is driven by both its attachment and its complement; classical pre- scriptive linguistics had focused only on the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beal, 2004</ref>), pp. 110, (Cobbett, 1823), pp. 16, (Lowth, 1762), pp. 8, 91.</p><p>Referring again to the examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> we point out that italicized words determine the sense of "with." In the first sentence, the word 'confu- sion,' appearing as the right context of the prepo- sition, is the complement of 'with', from which we infer that 'with' encodes the sense of 'manner'. In the second sentence, the accompanier sense of 'with' is because of its governor (attachment), the verb 'combine' appearing in the left context. In the last sentence, the sense of 'with' is 'by means of' and is determined by both the verb in its left context and the argument in its right context. Con- sider a new sentence with changed right context: 'He washed a small cup with a handle.' Here 'with' functions as an attribute. Again, changing its left context we get the sentence 'He asked for a small cup with water', where 'with' serves as an attribute instead of encoding the sense of means.</p><p>That the left and right context and their inter- play are critical to prepositional sense disambigua- tion is also well established in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Litkowski and Hargraves, 2007)</ref>. We match these linguistic properties to appropriate ge- ometric objects within the space of word embed- dings; the word embeddings are borrowed off-the- shelf -this work uses word2vec. We describe this next, focusing first on the left context, next on the right context and then on their interplay. Left context feature v ` is the average of the vec- tors of the left k ` words (here k ` is a parameter roughly taking values 1 through 4). This simple geometric operation is motivated by recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Faruqui et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kenter et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Yu et al., 2014</ref>) representing a sentence by the average of its constituent words robustly and successfully in a variety of downstream settings. Although prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al., 2010</ref>) points out that fixed win- dow sizes are insufficient, when compared to us- ing specific syntactic features (e.g., POS tags and dependency as done in prior works), we will see that the semantic information embedded in word vectors largely compensates for this limitation.</p><p>Right context feature v r is the average of the vec- tors of the right k r words (here k r is a parameter roughly taking values 1 through 4). This is identi- cal to the method adopted for the left context. We model the Context-interplay feature v inter to geometrically relate to both the left and the right contexts as follows. We choose it to be the vector closest to both the subspace spanned by the left context word vectors and that spanned by the right context word vectors. This geometric representa- tion appears crucial to capture the prepositional- sense when the interplay between the contexts matters decisively, as seen empirically in our ex- tensive experiments.</p><p>Let v ` i and v r j be the left-and the right context word vectors respectively. A precise mathematical definition of v inter is below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v inter = argmin v:kvk 2 =1 ( min a 1 ,...,a k ` kv k ` X i=1 a i v ` i k 2 2 + min b 1 ,...,b kr kv kr X j=1 b j v r j k 2 2 ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">{a i } k ` i=1</formula><p>and {b j } kr j=1 are scalars. It is easy to find optimal {a ⇤ i } and {b ⇤ j } to solve the inner minimization problem. We have</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">a ⇤ i = v T v ` i kvìkv` kvì k 2 , and b ⇤ j = v T v r j kv r j k 2 .</formula><p>The minimization problem (1) is a quadratic op- timization problem, so we can find a closed form solution to the unit vector v inter . Suppose that we stack context word vectors {vì{v`{vì } and {v r j } as a ma- trix V d⇥(k ` +kr) , where d is the dimension of word vectors. The optimal ddimension vector v inter is the first principal component of matrix V . Unsupervised learning of the senses of a given preposition is conducted by clustering its in- stances represented as a concatenation of the three feature vectors, while harnessing the large number of instances of each preposition in the large Wiki- Corpus (here we fix k ` = k r = 2 and use k-means clustering). If the features do capture the prepo- sitional sense efficiently, then the same-sense in- stances belong to the same cluster. Based on this intuition, we label each cluster with the dominant label of the training instances within this cluster. Given a test instance, we assign it to the nearest cluster (based on its Euclidean distance), and tag it with the cluster label. We note that the preposi- tion senses are not balanced in the training dataset leading to a situation where frequent senses dom- inate more than one cluster. We address this by setting the number of clusters k equal to twice the number of senses and find that it separates the in- frequent senses from frequent ones, about as well as traditional approaches such as those based on information criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sugar and James, 2003)</ref> and the elbow method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ketchen Jr and Shook, 1996)</ref>. Supervised learning of the senses using the three feature vectors was conducted based on the train- ing examples provided in the benchmark PSD datasets. We did this using the standard sup- port vector machines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995)</ref>, multilayer perceptron (MLP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Glorot and Bengio, 2010)</ref> and weighted k-nearest neigh- bor (k-NN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andoni and Indyk, 2006</ref>) classifiers. Each of these allows potentially different weight- ing of the three features in a context dependent way. The parameters were tuned to maximize the disambiguation accuracy on the development set provided in the benchmark PSD datasets. These experiments are discussed in detail next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments on Sense Disambiguation</head><p>The PSD algorithms were validated on the general sense disambiguation task using two datasets pro- vided by TPP. We begin by introducing two bench- marks: SemEval and OEC datasets. The SemEval Dataset consists of 34 prepositions instantiated by 24, 663 sentences covering 332 senses. Among them, 16, 557 sentences are used as training instances (semtrain) and 8096 sen- tences are test instances (semtest) for the prepo- sition disambiguation task. The OEC dataset consists of 7, 650 sentences col- lected from the Oxford English Corpus. Since these sentences included more prepositions than those in the SemEval dataset, we chose 3, 587 sen- tences that included the same 34 prepositions as used in the SemEval task. Word embeddings. The word embeddings we used in our experiments were trained on the most recent scrape of the English Wikipedia with the Word2Vec CBOW model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, with dimension 300. The linear combination of three vectors v ` , v r and v inter is the feature to k- NN classifier. Unsupervised PSD was performed by clustering the training instances fom the SemEval dataset us- ing k-means. In the evaluation phase, each test in- stance was assigned to the closest cluster, and its sense was the dominant training sense within this cluster. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> we report the disambiguation accuracy on semtest, a new state-of-the-art result. Supervised PSD was conducted by first conduct- ing a 80/20 split of semtrain into training and development sets. The disambiguation accuracy calculated on both semtest and OEC datasets is reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, using standard off-the-shelf classifiers. The sense disambiguation can be re- garded as a multi-class classification problem. We used the SVM classifier with a linear kernel and its penalty parameter C as a tunable parameter, the MLP classifier with one hidden layer, and the number of neurons as a tunable parameter, and the k-NN classifier (weighted k-NN), with the num- ber of nearest neighbors and the feature weights as tunable parameters (a linear combination of the three vectors v ` , v r and v inter was the feature in- put to the k-NN classifier); all tunable parameters were tuned using the development set. The out- put dimension of these classifiers was the number of senses of prepositions. Additionally, the con- text window sizes k ` and k r were parameters for all the three classifiers, each tuned on the develop- ment set. Baseline. Recent works have shown that the aver- age word embedding serves as a good represen- tation of the compositional sentential semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Faruqui et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kenter et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Yu et al., 2014)</ref>, and this single feature -the average of all context word vectors (both to the left and the right) -serves as a natural baseline.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Spatial Expression Disambiguation</head><p>Prepositions such as 'in' and 'on' are used to en- code spatial relations between the point of attach- ment and the complement of the preposition, but their senses show diversity depending on the con- text. For example, 'on' refers to the support from above in the sentence clothes on the rack, while it refers to support from below in clothes on the desk. These are instances of a phenomenon in natural language in which the mere concatena- tion of lexical information is not sufficient to de- rive the meaning of the phrase but the interactions among the meanings of the words is to be con- sidered (termed compositional distributional se- mantic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Marelli et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ritter et al., 2015)</ref>). We hypothesize that the relative place- ment of the objects involved in these phrases is achieved by considering the spatial senses of the prepositions involved, which in turn, is done by considering the interaction of its contexts as done by our approach. For this study, we focus on the disambiguation of the spatial senses encoded us- ing the prepositions 'in' and 'on'. Dataset. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ritter et al., 2015</ref>) studied ways of com- bining the meanings of the words in context to ar- rive at the meaning of the phrase which included spatial expressions using the prepositions 'in' and 'on'. Their dataset consists of 420 training ex- amples and 80 test examples, covering 5 types of locative expressions and given a sentence, the task is to arrive at the kind of locative expres- sion encoded by the preposition. As examples, the preposition in refers to full containment in the sentence "an apple in the refrigerator", whereas it refers to partial containment in "finger in the ring". Similarly, the spatial relations represented by the preposition on is classified into three cate- gories: adhesion to vertical surface (e.g., "sign on the building"), support by horizontal surface (e.g., "leaf on the ground") and support from above (e.g., "bat on the branch"). A key observation here is that the spatial sense of the preposition (equiv- alently, spatial category) is a function of the two objects connected by the preposition. Task. Given a sentence, we need to classify each occurrence of the preposition to its spatial cate- gory; for our study this is a fine-grained intra- preposition sense disambiguation problem (intra- sense because the sense is one of the spatial senses, albeit different from the TPP senses). Method. The very small size of the training set in this experiment calls for a reduction in the feature dimension. Accordingly, we use a weighted linear combination of the three features used in our PSD algorithm and the resulting feature is v = v ` + v r + v inter .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Preposition Sense Representation</head><p>Thus far, we have empirically validated our dis- ambiguation algorithm on standardized, but still stylized, datasets. A more thorough analysis is enabled by conducting preposition sense disam- biguation on a very large unlabeled corpus. Such is the goal of this section, where we scale our lightweight PSD algorithm on a large corpus and learn sense-specific prepositional representations. The quality of the representations serves as an "ex- trinsic" evaluation of our PSD algorithm; this val- idation is done by repurposing datasets meant for other tasks.</p><p>Standard embedding methods do not account for the inherent polysemy in words. This is exac- erbated in the case of prepositions. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, no linguistic properties of the standard embeddings (say, word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) or GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>) are known for preposition vectors. Recent works that learn sense-specific embeddings use the dis- tinct "topics" assumed by the senses of a given word (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rothe and Schütze, 2015</ref>) that explic- itly uses WordNet senses) and have only been val- idated with respect to nouns and verbs.</p><p>Below, we validate the quality of the resulting sense representations in two tasks, where prepo- sitional senses play an important role: (a) phrasal verb paraphrasing, and (b) preposition selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Phrasal Verb Paraphrasing</head><p>Prepositions often act as a connection between verbs and complements, carrying nontrivial se- mantic information. We used the trained k-NN classifier on TPP senses to label the prepositions in the English Wikipedia corpus, and learned sense- specific embeddings. These sense-specific repre- sentations are readily interpretable in terms of the extensive-resources of TPP. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows several senses of "in" together with their nearest neigh- bors in the vector space.</p><p>Embedding Global Simplex Sense Accuracy 0.44 0.44 0.73 <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Accuracy on phrasal verbs paraphrasing.</p><p>To validate the sense-specific preposition rep- resentation, we infer the meaning of verb-particle construction (VPC), such as climb down with sense embeddings. This is a lexical paraphrasing task of finding one word that captures the meaning of VPC (e.g., climb down = descend). Dataset. Because a dataset for paraphrasing of VPCs was not available, we created one (which is made available in the supplementary material). It consists of 91 phrasal verbs, extracted from the VPC datasets in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baldwin, 2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McCarthy et al., 2003</ref>) and the online Oxford dictionary 2 .</p><p>For each VPC instance, we first disambiguated the preposition sense in the given context using the supervised method described in Section 3. We consider a linear approximation of phrasal embed- dings under three settings: (1) Sense-specific embedding, approximating the representation of a VPC as the sum of the vectors of its verb and its preposition with a specific sense. ), we list the nearest three verbs (excluding the verb in the phrase) as its para- phrase, with the distance measured by the cosine similarity between the word vectors.</p><p>Two proficient English speakers set the gold standard for whether the paraphrase was valid or not (for polysemous verbs, we consider the verb to be a valid paraphrase if it conveys the meaning in any of its senses) and reconciled disagreements. We used accuracy as the evaluation metric, which is the percent of phrasal verbs with a valid para- phrase among candidates. Results. We note that sense representations are able to capture the nuance of polysemous verb 2 https://en.oxforddictionaries.com phrases. As is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>, the phrase "fight for" has more than one meaning depending on the sense of its preposition. In the expression "fight for human rights", for carries the sense of purpose. Since the expression is semantically equivalent to "defend human rights", "defend" can paraphrase the phrase "fight for". In another context "fight for the prize" where for is related with benefits, "fight for" should be paraphrased as "win" and the expression "win the prize" is similar to "fight for the prize".</p><p>Some examples of phrasal verbs and para- phrases are shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, with valid para- phrases highlighted. We report the performance of different embeddings in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, where we notice that paraphrasing with the preposition sense em- bedding has a much higher accuracy than the two baselines. This validates the sense-specific prepo- sition embedding suggesting its use in automatic paraphrasing of VPCs. Examples of paraphrases are shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. A more detailed analysis of the results are in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Preposition Selection</head><p>Given the polysemous and idiosyncratic nature of prepositions, choosing a preposition to fit a context can be a particularly challenging task for non-native English learners. Not surprisingly, preposition errors constitute the largest category of grammatical errors made by English learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chodorow et al., 2007)</ref>. In this work, we show how the sense representations adequately capture the prepositional semantics, thus aiding preposi- tion selection. Since TPP senses are fine-grained, we limit the senses available to be concrete or ab- stract by conflating the TPP senses to one of these sentence phrasal verb paraphrasing sense global simplex The teaching is carried on in the form of folklore.</p><p>carried on conducted laid placed he brought in new ideas in the discussion. brought in introduced came came She could not keep from crying.</p><p>keep from avoid get maintain Without a word he leaned forward and switched on the engine. switched on starting shifted reverted I have certainly been kicked in the teeth by those bastards. kicked in knocked throw knocked I have chosen to block off the easy track and so turn it into a dead end. block off stopped cleared cleared The Rishon Le Zion killings sparked off a wave of sympathy protests. sparked off ensued spurred ignited Stanley put down his paper and glared at her. put down laid slammed brought <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Paraphrasing of phrasal verbs.</p><p>two types <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Reisinger and Mooney, 2010b</ref>). For ex- ample, "in a room" stands for the concrete sense of the preposition 'in', while "in her heart" corre- sponds to the abstract sense. In this part, we con- sider two senses for each preposition.</p><p>Dataset. We used three datasets, which consist of sentences marked with grammatical corrections out of which we only chose those with preposition errors. The Cambridge First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset contains 60, 279 prepositions with 4.8% error, the CoNLL dataset has 3, 241 prepo- sitions with 4.7% errors and the Stack Exchange (SE) dataset has 15, 814 prepositions with 38.2% error ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Prokofyev et al., 2014</ref>). Owing to its size, the FCE dataset was used for training, and the other two were used for testing. For each sentence with a preposition the task is to replace it with the correct one if it is used incorrectly.</p><p>Method. We classify all occurrences of each preposition sense into the two senses (abstract and concrete) by using the unsupervised PSD ap- proach described in Section 4 to cluster the avail- able senses. Then the prepositions in Wikipedia are labeled with one of the two senses, again us- ing the unsupervised PSD approach. We then train sense embeddings on the newly labeled corpus with word2vec.</p><p>For a given sentence in the preposition selection task, we first disambiguate the sense of the prepo- sition by checking which cluster it is closest to. The selection task is divided into preposition er- ror detection and error correction. At the detection stage, we decide whether a preposition is used ap- propriately in the sentence. For this, we use as fea- tures the cosine similarity between the preposition sense embedding and the average word embedding in the context (the context size is 3), the rank of the preposition among all preposition choices with re- spect to the cosine similarity just mentioned, and the probability that the current preposition is re- placed estimated from the training corpus. A de- cision tree classifier is used with these features to identify preposition errors.</p><p>At the second stage, we replace the current preposition p with another one if an error was de- tected at the first stage. Suppose that we consider replacing preposition p with q. We first disam- biguate preposition q's sense given the context. We then use preposition q's sense embedding, the left context vector v ` , the right context vector v r , the interplay vector v inter and the probability that q takes the place of p in the training corpus as input features to a two-layer MLP with 500 and 10 units in each layer. The MLP outputs a scalar to esti- mate how well the preposition q fits in p's context. The preposition with highest score is selected as the replacement.</p><p>Baseline. The state-of-the-art on preposition selection is one of the baselines, which makes use of lexical statistics from a large corpus as well as part-of-speech tags ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Prokofyev et al., 2014</ref>). Also to evaluate the advantage of preposition sense rep- resentation over word representation, we have an- other baseline which uses the same classifier but the input features are the word embeddings in- stead of sense embeddings. The word embeddings were trained on Wikipedia English corpus with word2vec CBOW model.</p><p>Result. We compare the sense embedding- based approach against baselines in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 8</ref>. As we can see, the use of sense representation achieves comparable performance to the state-of- the-art without using external linguistic tools. It also outperforms the baseline with word represen- tation by a large margin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Resource-independence: Previous approaches to PSD relied on a part-of-speech tagger or depen-  dency parser to extract words modified by and modifying a preposition. In general, these words occur in the preposition's local context. We have allowed the context window to be a tunable pa- rameter so that the classifier can learn to cover informative words in the context, and thus effec- tively captures the dependency information in a resource-independent fashion.</p><p>Context feature: The context averaging ap- proach, which disregards context word order, suf- fers in accuracy compared to models that use left and right context words. This indicates that infor- mation about the word order relative to the prepo- sition is useful in preposition disambiguation. Ad- ditionally, our use of the context-interplay fea- ture combines the information on both sides of the preposition to infer its underlying sense.</p><p>Suppose that three expressions a cup of medicine, professor of humanity and professor of mathematics are in the training corpus, and the senses of the preposition of are 'contents', 'pos- sessor' and 'field'. Given a test instance profes- sor of medicine, it would be hard for the method with only the left or the right feature to decide the preposition sense since the test instance has the same word as each of the training instance, and their features in these two baselines are simi- lar. However, the interplay vector in professor of medicine is closer to that in "professor of mathe- matics" than to other two training instances. The interplay feature prompts that of refers to a field (or species) instead of contents or possessor.</p><p>Data-driven insights into context dependence: Knowing the weights on the context features in the k-NN supervised PSD classifier, we can infer the extent to which prepositions rely on the comple- ment and the attachment. For example, we found that in the case of the prepositions behind (occur- ring in, "shut behind her", "dip behind clouds"), to (e.g., "testify to the depth", "mumbling to him- self"), and with (e.g., "amalgamated with her old school", and "rub with bare hands"), the verbs they attach to strongly influence their sense. For other prepositions such as during (e.g., "during the incident") and on (e.g., "on his hands"), the com- plement noun has more influence on the senses than governors. Sense helps paraphrasing: We observe that sense-specific preposition representation helps im- prove phrasal verb paraphrasing greatly. Working with the VPC dataset and the simplistic model of compositionality, we interpret the results as pos- itive indicators of the viability of using sense- specific prepositional embeddings to paraphrase verb-particle constructions. In the case of light verbs, whose meaning is determined largely by the particles they combine with, (e.g., come down ⇠ fall), a valid paraphrase is found in the top 3 can- didates when the sense-specific representation is used, and not when the simplex or the global rep- resentation is used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>This paper studies the preposition sense disam- biguation by encoding the attachment and comple- ment properties into context features. The disam- biguation method performs well on three standard PSD tasks and readily scales to a large corpus. The resulting sense-specific representations are shown to capture semantics of preposition senses in our quantitative analysis. They are also shown to aid two downstream tasks: phrasal verb paraphrasing and preposition selection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>She blinked with confusion.</head><label></label><figDesc>(Manner &amp; Mood) He combines professionalism with humor.
