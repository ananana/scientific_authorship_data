			<abstract>
				<p>Distantly supervised approaches have become popular in recent years as they allow training relation extractors without text-bound annotation, using instead known relations from a knowledge base and a large textual corpus from an appropriate domain. While state of the art distant supervision approaches use off-the-shelf named entity recognition and classification (NERC) systems to identify relation arguments, discrepancies in domain or genre between the data used for NERC training and the intended domain for the relation extractor can lead to low performance. This is particularly problematic for &quot;non-standard&quot; named entities such as album which would fall into the MISC category. We propose to ameliorate this issue by jointly training the named entity classifier and the relation extractor using imitation learning which reduces struc-tured prediction learning to classification learning. We further experiment with Web features different features and compare against using two off-the-shelf supervised NERC systems, Stanford NER and FIGER, for named entity classification. Our experiments show that imitation learning improves average precision by 4 points over an one-stage classification model, while removing Web features results in a 6 points reduction. Compared to using FIGER and Stanford NER, average precision is 10 points and 19 points higher with our imitation learning approach.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Factual answers to queries such as "What albums did The Beatles release?" are commonly stored in knowledge bases and can then be accessed by an information retrieval system, a commercial exam- ple for this being Google's knowledge vault ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xin et al., 2014</ref>). In order to keep knowledge bases up to date should new facts emerge, and to quickly adapt to new domains, there is a need for flexi- ble and accurate information extraction (IE) ap- proaches which do not require manual effort to be developed for new domains. A popular approach for creating IE methods to extract such relations is distant supervision <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Craven and Kumlien, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mintz et al., 2009</ref>) which is a method for learn- ing relation extractors using relations stored in a knowledge base combined with raw text to auto- matically generate training data.</p><p>An important first step in distant supervision is to identify named entities (NEs) and their types to determine if a pair of NEs is a suitable candi- date for the relation. As an example, the album relation has a Musical Artist and an Album as ar- guments. Existing works use supervised named entity recognisers and classifiers (NERC) with ei- ther a small set of types such as the Stanford NER system ( ), or fine-grained NE types ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ling and Weld, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu et al., 2014</ref>). However, supervised NERCs typically focus on recognising persons, locations and organisations and perform poorly for other types of NEs, e.g. we find that Stanford NER only recognises 43% of all MISC NEs in our corpus. In addition, they do not always perform well if they are trained on a dif- ferent type of text or for a different domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Derczynski et al., 2015)</ref>. This issue becomes more im- portant as focus is shifting from using curated text collections such as Wikipedia to texts collected from the Web via search queries (Web-based dis- tant supervision) which can provide better cover- age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">West et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In order to ameliorate this issue, we propose to recognise NEs with simple heuristics, then use the imitation learning algorithm DAGGER <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ross et al., 2011</ref>) to learn the NEC component jointly with re- lation extraction (RE), without requiring explicitly labeled data for NERC. Instead, training signal is obtained by assessing the predictions of the rela- tion extraction component. In this paper we make the following contributions:</p><p>1. We learn jointly training a named entity clas- sifier and a relation extractor for Web-based distant supervision. Our method does not rely on hand-labeled training data and is appli- cable to any domain, which is shown in our evaluation on 18 different relations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Distant Supervision</head><p>Distantly supervised RE is defined as automati- cally labelling a corpus with properties, P , and re- sources, R, where resources stand for entities from a knowledge base, KB, to train a classifier to learn to predict binary relations. The distant supervision paradigm is defined as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mintz et al., 2009</ref>):</p><p>If two entities participate in a relation, any sen- tence that contains those two entities might ex- press that relation.</p><p>In general relations are of the form (s, p, o) ∈ R × P × R, consisting of a subject, a predicate and an object; during training, we only consider statements which are contained in a knowledge base, i.e. (s, p, o) ∈ KB ⊂ R × P × R. In any single extraction we consider only those sub- jects in a particular class C ⊂ R, i.e. (s, p, o) ∈ KB ∩ C × P × R. Each resource r ∈ R has a set of lexicalisations, L r ⊂ L. Lexicalisations are re- trieved from the KB, where they are represented as the name or alias, i.e. less frequent name of a resource.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach Overview</head><p>The input to the approach is a KB which con- tains entities and is partly populated with relations, the task is to complete the knowledge base. As an example, consider a KB about musical artists and their albums, which contains names of mu- sical artists, and albums for some of them. The task is then to find albums for the remaining musi- cal artists. Queries are automatically formulated containing C, s and o, e.g. "Musical Artist al- bum 'The Beatles"' and we obtain Web pages us- ing a search engine. For each sentence on the Web pages retrieved which contains s, all candidates for C are identified using NER heuristics (Sec- tion 4.2). Next, the distant supervision assump- tion is applied to all such sentences containing s (e.g. "Michael Jackson") and a candidate for that relation (e.g. " <ref type="bibr">Music &amp; Me")</ref>. If the candidate is an example of a relation according to the KB, it is used as a positive example, and if not, as a negative example. The examples are then used to train a model to recognise if the candidate is of the right type for the relation (NEC) and if it is of the correct relation (RE). The model is applied to the sentences of all the incomplete entries in the KB. Since different sentences could predict differ- ent answers to the query, all predictions are com- bined for the final answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction</head><p>The input to the learning task is a collection of training examples for a specific relation. The ex- amples are sentences containing the subject of the relation and one further NE identified using simple heuristics. The examples are labeled as true (rela- tion is contained in knowledge base) or as false (relation is not contained in the knowledge base).</p><p>We model the task in two binary classifica- . Existing approaches as- sume that named entity recognition and classifica- tion is done as part of the pre-processing. How- ever, this is not possible domains for which NE classifiers are not readily available. To amelio- rate this issue, existing approaches -e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mintz et al. (2009)</ref> -perform NEC to provide additional features for relation extraction. We use two such baselines with off-the-shelf NECs and add the NE labels to the relation features. The first baseline (Stanf) is with the Stanford NER 7-class (Time, Location, Organization, Person, Money, Percent and Date) model, the second (FIGER) is with the fine-grained FIGER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ling and Weld, 2012</ref>). An alternative approach is to simply add NEC features to relation extraction features, which we call one-stage model (OS) here. NEC features are typically morphological features extracted from the NE mention and features to model its con- text, whereas relation features typically model the path between the subject and object of the rela- tion. While NEC features may be useful to deter- mine if the NE has the correct type for the rela- tion, such features are usually less sparse and also not directly related to the relation extraction task. Consider the following sentence, containing an ex- ample of the relation director:</p><p>"One of director &lt;o&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/o&gt;'s greatest heroes was &lt;o&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/o&gt;, the mastermind behind &lt;s&gt;Psycho&lt;/s&gt;. This sentence contains two relation candidates, "Steven Spielberg" and "Alfred Hitchcock", be- tween which the decision for the final prediction has to be made. Both of the candidates are direc- tors, but only one of them is the director of "Psy- cho". Because the context around "Steven Spiel- berg" is stronger (preceded by "director"), NEC features alone are more likely to indicate that as the correct candidate and also likely overpower re- lation features for the final prediction, as the latter tend to be sparser.</p><p>Ideally, we would like to train two models, one for NEC and one for RE, which would be applied in sequence. If the NEC stage concludes that the candidate is of the correct type for the relation, the RE stage determines whether the relation between the two entities is expressed. If the NEC stage con- cludes that the entity is not of the correct type, then the RE stage is not reached. However, distant su- pervision only provides positive labels for NEC, since if a sentence is labeled as false we do not know if it is due to the candidate not being of the correct type, or the relation not being true for the two entities. To overcome this, we learn models for the two stages, NEC and RE, jointly using the imitation learning algorithm DAGGER (Ross et al., 2011), as described in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Imitation Learning</head><p>Imitation learning 1 algorithms such as SEARN <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Daumé III et al., 2009</ref>) and DAGGER <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ross et al., 2011</ref>) have been applied successfully to a va- riety of structured prediction tasks due to their flexibility in incorporating features and their abil- ity to learn with non-decomposable loss functions. Sample applications include biomedical event ex- traction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Vlachos and Craven, 2011</ref>), dynamic fea- ture selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(He et al., 2013)</ref>, and machine trans- lation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Grissom II et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Imitation learning algorithms for structured pre- diction decompose the prediction task into a se- quence of actions; these actions are predicted by classifiers which are trained to take into account the effect of their predictions on the whole se- quence by assessing their effect using a (possibly non-decomposable) loss function on the complete structure predicted. The dependencies between the actions are learnt via appropriate generation of training examples.</p><p>The ability to learn by assessing only the final prediction and not the intermediate steps is very useful in the face of missing labels, such as in the case of the labels for the NEC stage. Recall that the action sequence in our case consists of one NEC action and possibly one RE action, depen- dent on whether the NEC action is true, i.e. the en- tity is of the appropriate type for the relation. Fol- lowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vlachos and Clark (2014)</ref>, for each train- ing instance, we obtain supervision for the NEC stage by taking both options for this stage, true or false, obtaining the prediction from the RE stage in the former case and then comparing the out- comes against the label obtained from distant su- pervision. Thus the NEC stage is learned so that it enhances the performance of RE. In parallel, the RE stage is learned using only instances that actu- ally reach this stage. The process is iterated so that the models learned adjust to each other. For more details on this we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vlachos and Clark (2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Relation Candidate Identification</head><p>To extract relations among NEs, the latter have to be detected first. Most distantly supervised ap- proaches use supervised NER systems for this, which, especially for relations involving MISC NEs, achieve a low recall. High recall for NE identification is more important than high preci- sion, since precision errors can be dealt with by the NEC stage. For a relation candidate identi- fication stage with higher recall we instead rely on POS-based heuristics for detecting NEs <ref type="bibr">2</ref> and HTML markup. We use the following POS heuris- tics:</p><p>• Noun phrases: Sequences of N tags • Capitalised phrases: Those can be distinct from noun phrases, e.g. some album titles are capitalised verb phrases.</p><p>We further consider as relation candidates words which contain the following HTML markup:</p><p>• Phrases from HTML markup: All se- quences of words marked as: &lt;ahref&gt; (links), &lt;li&gt; (list elements), &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; (headers and subheaders, i.e. titles), &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;b&gt; (bold), &lt;em&gt; (emphasised), &lt;i&gt; (italics)</p><p>Different relation candidate identification strate- gies are then applied depending on the coarse NE types of objects of relation as defined in the KB <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2</ref>).</p><p>• PER: All capitalised noun phrases. We allow for a maximum of two characters to be sur- rounded by quotes to capture alternative first names, e.g. "Jerome David 'J. D.' Salinger".</p><p>• LOC: All capitalised noun phrases.</p><p>• ORG: All capitalised phrases and phrases from HTML markup. The latter is to capture ORG names which are not capitalised, e.g. the school "Woodrow Wilson School of Pub- lic and International Affairs" or the record la- bel "Sympathy for the Record Industry".</p><p>• MISC: As for ORG, we use all capitalised phrases and phrases from HTML markup. MISC NEs are even more varied than ORG NEs and it is difficult to find the right balance between recognising most of them and gener- ating unecessary candidates.</p><p>To assess how useful these strategies are, we randomly sample 30 instances of each Freebase class per coarse NE type of the object and manu- ally examine all sentences which contain the sub- ject of the relation. We used precision, i.e. how many of the relation candidates are appropriate  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Results for POS-based candidate identifi- cation strategies compared to Stanford NER for the relation, and recall to compare the relation candidate identification strategies described above against the identification of candidates by Stanford NER (ignoring the NE label). As shown in Ta- ble 1, while supervised identification of NE labels achieves a higher precision for all NE types, the recall is higher for all NE types using POS-based heuristics. The simple heuristics are especially helpful for MISC NEs, for which recall is twice as high compared to Stanford NER and precision only marginally higher. If we were to use the NE label to enforce hard constraints, recall would be reduced even further: 88% of all PER entities are correctly identified as persons, compared to 58% for locations and 87% for organisations. MISC NE are identified as PER (45%), LOC (40%) or ORG (15%). Overall, precision is not as important for candidate identification as recall, since choosing correct entities among the candidates can be dealt with in a NEC stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">NEC features</head><p>For the one-stage and imitation learning model, we use the following Web features based on HTML markup, both as local features if the entity mention contains the markup, and as global features if a mention somewhere else in the document with the same lexicalisation contains that markup: is link, is list element, is header or subheader, is bold, is emphasised, is italics, is title, is in title. •</p><note type="other">Object occurrence • Sequence and BOW of occurrence • Sequence and bag of POS of occurrence • Number of words, characters and digits of object • Ends with period, is roman number, contains apostrophe, hyphen, ampersand, possessive • Digit and capitalisation pattern Context features, as 1-grams (1cont) and 2-grams, 2 words to left and right of occurrence (2cont): BOW, sequence, bag of POS, POS sequence.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">RE Features</head><p>The following features are used for RE, based on Hoffman et al <ref type="formula">(2011)</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> for relation types): educational institution, city, director, actor and author. Since FIGER performs multi-label classification, it an- notates some of the relation candidates with more than one NE label. In that case, we add all NE labels returned as features, though more experi- ments on how best to integrate multiple NE labels as features could be performed, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu et al. (2014)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Corpus</head><p>To create a corpus 3 for Web RE, seven Free- base classes and two to four of their relations are selected <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2</ref>). The selected classes are subclasses of PER (Musical Artist, Politician), LOC (River), ORG (Business (Operation)), Ed- ucation(al Institution)) or MISC (Film, Book). To avoid noisy training data, we only use enti- ties which have values for all of those properties, which resulted in 1800 to 2200 entities per class. For each entity, 10 Web pages were retrieved via the Google Search API using the search pattern "'subject entity" class name relation name', e.g. "'The Beatles" Musical Artist Origin'. In total, the corpus consists of around one million pages drawn from 76,000 different websites. Text content is ex- tracted from HTML pages using the Jsoup API <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and processed with Stanford CoreNLP 5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Models and Metrics</head><p>We evaluate the following models: imitation learning (IL) as described in Section 4.1, a one- stage model (OS), a one-stage model with rela- tion features only (RelOnly), and using Stanford <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The resources for experiments documented in this pa- per are available online via http://tinyurl.com/ o8ykn4y</p><p>4 http://jsoup.org 5 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml</p><p>Model R-top P-top F1-top R-all P-all P-avg  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Results for best model for each relation, macro average over all relations.</p><p>(Stanf) and FIGER (FIGER) NE labels as fea- tures (Section 4). For all models we use lin- ear classifiers learned with passive-aggressive up- dates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Crammer et al., 2006</ref>). For imitation learn- ing, we use the learning algorithm DAGGER (Ross et al., 2011), which requires two parameters: the learning rate, i.e. how quickly the learning algo- rithm moves away from the optimal policy, and the number of iterations. We found empirically that the best learning rate for our prediction task is 0.25 and that the best number of iterations is 12.</p><p>The output of the models is a score for each re- lation example and stage, i.e. for the one-stage model, the output is one score and for the imita- tion learning model, there is a score each for the NEC stage and the RE stage. The default for de- ciding whether the relation label should be true or false depends on stage thresholds, which are 0 by default. Instead of using the default thresholds, we automatically pick thresholds for all models on 1/3 of the training set, which we set aside as a develop- ment set, then retrain on the whole training set and predict relations based on the learnt thresholds.</p><p>We use the metrics first best precision (P-top), first best recall (R-top), first best F1 (F1-top), all precision (P-all), all recall (P-all), and all average precision (P-avg). For top, only the top-ranked answer is considered, whereas for all all answers are returned until either the correct one is found or they are exhausted. Finally, in the all mode we evaluated precision at all recall points by varying the thresholds used in the respective classifiers and we report average precision (P-avg) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Manning et al., 2008)</ref>. This evaluation measure provides an assessment of how well a system trades precision for recall. The number of all results for computing recall is the number of all relation tuples in the KB.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Comparison of Models</head><p>Overall results in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> show that both of our models (IL and OS) outperform the baselines with off-the-shelf supervised NEC (Stanf, FIGER) for all metrics. Detailed results for different relations <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref> show that IL outperforms both OS and Base in terms of average precision. FIGER re- sults fall in between Stanf and OS results. For some relations, there is a dramatic improvement by using fine-grained FIGER NE features over coarse-grained Stanford NE features; occasionally FIGER even outperforms OS, as for the relation author. This is because FIGER has a correspond- ing NE type (see Section 4.5). For most relations, including those whose objects are of type MISC, IL shows a significant improve- ment in terms of F1 or average precision over OS <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 5)</ref>. This confirms our hypothesis that sepa- rating the NEC and relation extraction stages using imitation learning can achieve a higher precision and recall for non-standard relations than prepro- cessing sentences with a supervised NEC model. Furthermore, we show that it can also be useful for most standard relations. The main relations for which Stanf, FIGER or OS can have a benefit over IL are those for which entities are easy to classify, specifically LOC NEs, but also PER NEs. This is because, if NEs are easy to classify, a separate NEC is less likely to be useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Imitation Learning vs One-Stage</head><p>To give more insight into why IL is overall more successful than OS, common errors made by OS are shown here, along with an explanation of how those errors are prevented by using IL. One exam- ple of IL predicting correctly but OS incorrectly is from the following sentence, expressing the direc- tor relation: "In 2010 he appeared in a leading role in &lt;o&gt;Alicia Duffy&lt;/o&gt;'s &lt;s&gt;All Good Children&lt;/s&gt;.</p><p>In that example, the NEC features extracted for &lt;o&gt;Alicia Duffy&lt;/o&gt; are not very strong indi- cators, since neither the object string itself nor the surrounding context give any direct indication for the director relation. The RE features, which are based on the dependency path, are a stronger indi- cator. Since in the OS model all features are com- bined, the NEC features overpower the RE fea- tures. The IL model, on the other hand, learns a permissive NEC as a first stage, which filters NEs with respect to if they are generally appropriate for the relation or not, and then leaves the RE to the second stage.</p><p>Another example is a sentence for which OS in- correctly predicts the relation author, whereas IL correctly predicts "false":</p><p>"&lt;o&gt;Laura&lt;/o&gt; and Mary went to school for the first time in Pepin rather than Walnut Grove, which is not included in &lt;s&gt;Little House in the Big Woods&lt;/s&gt;."    For this example, OS relation features have small positive weights, which then overall lead to a positive prediction.</p><p>For IL, the first stage predicts "false", since the one-token string &lt;o&gt;Laura&lt;/o&gt; is not a likely candidate for au- thor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Comparison of Features</head><p>All different feature groups have an overall posi- tive effect on the results (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>). While low precision, high frequency features improve recall (1cont), they do not always improve precision. Both OS and IL benefit from high precision, low frequency features, e.g. for author and mouth, the best results are achieved with only sparse parsing features for RE. Web features improve performance for 10 out of 18 relations. For n-ary relations the is list ele- ment feature is very useful because Web pages about musical artist, films or books often contain lists with their attributes, e.g. a Web page about a musical artist typically contains a list with their albums. For relations with persons as objects, is link and is bold is useful because Web pages often highlight persons or provide links to Web pages with more information about them. As an exam- ple, for the author relation, the strongest positive Web feature is is in title and the strongest nega- tive feature is is list element. This makes sense since a book is frequently mentioned with its au- thor and one of the most important attributes of a book, whereas lists on Web pages about books mention less important attributes, such as the char- acters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Overall Comparison</head><p>Overall, we showed that using an off-the-shelf NEC as a pre-processing step for distant super-vision as done by existing works often causes er- rors which can be prevented by instead separat- ing NEC and RE with imitation learning. We also showed that using Web features increases preci- sion for NEC. Finally, it is worth noting that the recall for some of the relations is quite low be- cause they only infrequently occur in text, espe- cially in the same sentence as the subject of the relation. These issues can be overcome by per- forming coreference resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Augenstein et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Koch et al., 2014)</ref>, by retrieving more Web pages or improving the information retrieval com- ponent of the approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(West et al., 2014</ref>) and by combining extractors operating on sentences with other extractors for semi-structured content on Web pages <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carlson et al., 2010</ref>).</p></div>

To date, there is very little research on improv- ing NERC for distant supervision to extract rela- tions between non-standard entities such as musi- cal artists and albums. Some research has been done on improving distant supervision by using fine-grained named entity classifiers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ling and Weld, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu et al., 2014</ref>) and on using named entity linking for distant supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Koch et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu et al. (2014)</ref> train a supervised fine- grained NERC on Wikipedia and show that us- ing those types as entity contraints improves pre- cision and recall for a distantly supervised RE on newswire. However, they assume that labeled training data is available, making it unsuitable for applying distant supervision to domains with rela- tions involving non-standard entity types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vlachos and Clark (2014)</ref> also proposed a dis- tantly supervised approach for joint learning of NEC and RE with imitation learning for the archi- tecture domain. However, they only used two re- lations in their experiments which involved rather standard entity types and they did not compare against using off-the shelf NEC systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a method for extract- ing non-standard relations with distant supervi- sion that learns a NEC jointly with relation ex- traction using imitation learning. Our proposed imitation learning approach outperforms models with supervised NEC for relations involving non- standard entities as well as relations involving per- sons, locations and organisations. We achieve an increase of 4 points in average precision over a simple one-stage classification model, and an in- crease in 10 points and 19 points over baselines with FIGER and Stanford NE labels. We further demonstrate that using specialised Web features, such as appearances of entities in lists and links to other Web pages, improves average precision by 7 points, which other Web search-based relation ex- traction approaches could also benefit from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Augenstein et al., 2014</ref>). In future work, the proposed approach could be combined with other approaches to solve typical issues arising in the context of distant supervision, such as dealing with overlapping relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hoffmann et al., 2011)</ref>, improving heuristic labelling of sentences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Takamatsu et al., 2012</ref>) or deal- ing with incomplete knowledge bases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Min et al., 2013</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overview of approach</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,72.00,62.81,453.56,234.37" type="bitmap" /></figure>

NE labels are then used in addition to the RE features listed in Section 4.4. For the Stanf baseline, Stanford NER 7-class la- bels are added as RE features. Those are: Time, Location, Organization, Person, Money, Percent, Date. FIGER classifies NEs according to 112 types, most of which are subtypes of Person, Orga- nization, Location, Product, Art, Event and Build- ing. Some of the types are relation types we eval- uate (see</figDesc></figure>
