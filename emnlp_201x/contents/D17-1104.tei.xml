			<abstract>
				<p>Verbs can only be used with a few specific arrangements of their arguments (syn-tactic frames). Most theorists note that verbs can be organized into a hierarchy of verb classes based on the frames they admit. Here we show that such a hierarchy is objectively well-supported by the patterns of verbs and frames in English, since a systematic hierarchical clustering algorithm converges on the same structure as the handcrafted taxonomy of VerbNet, a broad-coverage verb lexicon. We also show that the hierarchies capture meaningful psychological dimensions of generalization by predicting novel verb coercions by human participants. We discuss limitations of a simple hierarchical representation and suggest similar approaches for identifying the representations underpinning verb argument structure.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Why can Sally like to read but not *appreciate to read? Key to the grammar of sentences are verbs and the arguments with which they appear. How children learn the constraints that govern the ways verbs and arguments combine is a central question in language acquisition.</p><p>Theorists have long noted that verbs can be or- ganized into classes based on their syntactic con- structions and the events they express (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005</ref> for review). Verb classes are included in most theories of argument structure acquisition, whether as first class objects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Perfors et al., 2010)</ref> or mere epiphenomena of other claims about the structure of form-meaning mappings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pinker, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Goldberg, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Most theories also propose further structure be- tween classes. One common assumption is that verb argument structure can be at least partially described by a hierarchy: Each verb belongs to a class, which itself may belong to a number of broader superclasses.</p><p>While many theories predict more complex structure (e.g. cross-cutting categories; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005</ref>), providing (psy- cho)linguistic evidence for a simple hierarchy of verbs is an important starting point for investi- gating more complex theories. <ref type="bibr">VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008)</ref>, the largest English verb argument structure resource, 1 organizes verbs and classes into a shallow hierarchy, but its structure has been handcrafted incrementally over time (starting with seminal work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Levin, 1993)</ref>. On the other hand, recently-developed, state-of-the-art machine learning methods offer a unique alternative ap- proach to constructing such a hierarchy.</p><p>In this paper, we first conduct a broad-coverage analysis of how verbs might be hierarchically ar- ranged by comparing VerbNet's handcrafted hi- erarchy to structure systematically inferred by a Bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm. We find that the two arrive at similar structure, thus substantiating both methods (i.e. intuition vs. clus- tering) and the common hierarchy they find.</p><p>Second, we investigate the psychological valid- ity of this representation: if classes capture mean- ingful dimensions of generalization, one would in- tuit that a verb in a class should behave more simi- larly to verbs in nearby classes than distant classes according to some measure of "distance". Indeed, this kind of assumption plays an important role in theoretical ( <ref type="bibr">Suttle and Goldberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pinker, 1989)</ref> and empirical <ref type="bibr">(Ambridge et al., 2011</ref>) work. We thus ask human participants to rate the compat- ibility of a wide range of existing verbs in attested and unattested syntactic frames. We find that such coercions are indeed predicted by a hierarchical taxonomy of verbs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>There is a substantial literature from both the NLP and psycholinguistics communities on un- supervised learning of verb classes from corpora and other resources (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Reichart and Korhonen, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vlachos et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Joanis and Stevenson, 2003</ref>) and computational cogni- tive models of argument structure acquisition (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Barak et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ambridge and Blything, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barak et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Parisien and Stevenson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Perfors et al., 2010)</ref>, respectively.</p><p>Our work differs in several ways. First, we do not consider the basic problem of learning verb classes from semantic or syntactic primitives (cf. <ref type="bibr">Sun et al., 2008)</ref> or verb usages extracted from corpora; instead, we examine what higher-level structure is implied by the gold-standard catalog of already-clustered verbs and syntactic frames in VerbNet. Second, we do not attempt to model incremental learning (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Parisien and Stevenson, 2010)</ref> or instantiate a specific theory (cf. Am- bridge and Blything, 2015). Rather, we conduct an at-scale investigation of verb argument struc- ture through cluster analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Discovering structure via clustering</head><p>VerbNet suggests a shallow and disconnected hi- erarchy of verbs, with lower-level subclasses of verbs that take the exact same frames, broader standard classes, and at the top, 101 unrelated superclasses ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1a)</ref>. There is a broad as- sumption of weaker relations between members of higher-level classes than lower-level classes.</p><p>We compared this to the hierarchy obtained from Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (BHC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Heller and Ghahramani, 2005</ref>) implemented in R by <ref type="bibr">Savage et al. (2009)</ref>, a state-of-the-art ag- glomerative clustering method that can be seen as a bottom-up approximation to a Dirichlet Pro- cess Mixture Model. Unlike traditional hierarchi- cal clustering algorithms, BHC uses Bayesian hy- pothesis testing to merge subtrees: at each pro- posed merge, BHC evaluates the probability p that  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: (a) Simplified VerbNet hierarchy, depict- ing a superclass, standard classes, subclasses, and toy verbs V i and frames F i . (b) We train BHC on the frame data D. Dotted lines are merges BHC prefers not to make (p &lt; 0.5).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data</head><p>As input to BHC, we used VerbNet's compre- hensive set of verb-frame combinations. VerbNet v3.2 3 can be represented as a 6334 verb × n frame binary matrix, with 1s in cells with attested verb- frame pairs <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref>. Thus, each verb is repre- sented as a binary vector of frames.</p><p>The number of frames n depends on what se- mantic and syntactic annotations are considered to be part of the frame. VerbNet includes 3 kinds of annotations: selectional restrictions on argu- ments, thematic roles, and prepositional literals <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2)</ref>. For this paper, we included selectional restrictions and thematic roles, resulting in 1613 frames. These annotations made it easiest to pro- duce experimental stimuli in Section 4, although our analysis produced similar results across the other possible frame encodings (see Appendix A). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation</head><p>Here we evaluated the extent to which BHC con- verged on VerbNet's structure at low (sub and standard classes) and high levels (superclasses). We consider ground truth classes across the levels of VerbNet gran- ularity: low-level subclasses (H sub , C sub ), stan- dard classes (H standard , C standard ), and superclasses (H super , C super ) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>. The important comparison is with superclasses, for which both H and C were high. This indi- cates that BHC clusters rarely included verbs from multiple VerbNet superclasses (H super = .88) and rarely split verbs from the same VerbNet super- class into different BHC clusters (C super = .72).</p><p>Tanglegram While H and C focus on the size and membership of two clustering solutions, tan- glegrams (Huson and Scornavacca, 2012) allow a more general visualization and comparison of two hierarchies. Using the heuristic of Scornavacca et al. (2011), <ref type="bibr">4</ref> we drew the optimal tanglegram of VerbNet and BHC, where the two trees are drawn such that lines connect common leaves and the number of intersections made by these lines is minimized. We computed the entanglement of the tanglegram by normalizing the number of in- tersections to the 0-1 interval by dividing by the worst case; this is a holistic measure of the simi- larity of the hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Galili, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The tanglegram <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref> shows that qualita- tively, much of VerbNet's structure aligns well be- tween the trees. We observed an entanglement of 0.20, compared to a random baseline of 0.66.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion</head><p>The high H and C <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> and low entanglement <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref> suggest that both VerbNet's handcrafted hierarchical taxonomy and the one systematically created by BHC converge on similar results. In- terestingly, both methods result in a fairly shallow hierarchy with many unrelated subtrees. This sug- gests that while small clusters of verbs are highly related, the principles governing verb argument structure are relatively narrow and do not gener- alize across more than a small subset of verbs. Alternatively, it could suggest that a hierarchical taxonomy is too simple to fully capture argument structure patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Human coercion judgments</head><p>We next evaluated the hierarchies for their abil- ity to account for human generalization. Re- searchers often test generalization along a spe- cific dimension through extension to novel verbs ("wug tests"; <ref type="bibr">Ambridge et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pinker, 1989)</ref>. While this works well for studies of spe- cific phenomena, it is difficult to deploy in a large study like ours, where we do not have hypotheses about what drives generalization language-wide. Thus, we assessed generalization through a coer- cion task, asking whether speakers are more likely to extend a known verb to a unattested frame if the frame is attested for verbs in a closely-related class. This matches a common theoretical claim that verbs are attracted to the frames of similar verbs, with the notion of similarity varying by the- ory ( <ref type="bibr">Ambridge et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Suttle and Goldberg, 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Predicting verb-frame coercion</head><p>VerbNet makes straightforward coarse predic- tions. For any syntactic frame, we grouped verbs into 3 categories: Exact, if the verb can take the frame; Sibling, if one of the verb's super or sub- classes can take the frame; and None otherwise. Conversely, as a Bayesian probabilistic model, BHC defines a predictive distribution on new data. We were interested in whether this precision re- sulted in better fit, so we also tested BHC: for any verb and frame, we can evaluate the posterior probability that the verb admits the frame of inter- est while conditioning on the verb's other frames <ref type="figure">(Figure 1c</ref>; see Appendix B for details). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: 2 sampled frames and their correspond- ing sentence templates, each with 3 example verbs and predicted compatibilities. To form the stimuli, each verb is placed into the sentence template, e.g. Beyond the place arose the thing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Materials and methods</head><p>We sampled 10 frames and 10 verbs for each frame, resulting in 100 verb-frame pairs. To con- trol for possible verb frequency effects <ref type="bibr">(Braine and Brooks, 1995)</ref>, we ensured there was no signif- icant correlation between the predicted compati- bility of a verb-frame pair and the Brown corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kučera and Francis, 1967</ref>) frequency of the verb (r = 0.13, p = 0.17). We then converted verb- frame pairs into sentence stimuli, which required that we choose nouns to represent NPs in frames. We chose the most generic noun compatible with the thematic role restriction, if present. For exam- ple, for NP.AGENT, we used a generic name, and for NP.LOCATION, we used place. Example stim- uli are located in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. We recruited 50 native English speakers from Mechanical Turk. For each sentence, participants judged the grammaticality of the sentence on a Likert scale, from 1 ("not at all") to 5 ("perfect").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results and discussion</head><p>First, we noticed that all verbs in some frames re- ceived consistently low coercion judgments (&lt; 3). For example, while the verb fly and the frame THERE V NP.THEME FOR NP.LOCATION is at- tested (Exact), There flew a thing for the place received a mean judgment of 2.4. We trans- lated judgments so that the mean judgments across verbs for each frame was average (3), to examine the relative effects of coercing verbs into frames. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4a</ref> shows that VerbNet's 3 categories pre- dict differences in the mean coercion ratings of verb-frame pairs (F = 43.46, p &lt; 0.001). No- tably, there was a significant difference between the means of the unattested categories (Sibling vs. None; t = 3.55, p &lt; 0.01). While there was a high correlation between the judgments and BHC predictions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4b</ref>; r = 0.59), BHC's hierar- chy did not significantly improve fit to the data. These results provide additional psychological evidence for the effects associated with Verb- Net's coarse distinctions: for unattested verb- frame pairs, participants tend to assign a higher compatibility rating when the verb has sibling VerbNet classes that can take the frame. However, the range of compatibility judgments is highly variable across all three categories, and BHC's finer-grained predictions fail to account for much of this variability. Given the similarity of BHC to VerbNet's hierarchy, this result is unsurprising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">General discussion</head><p>We presented converging evidence that a shallow hierarchy of verbs <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> is well supported by the distribution of verbs and syntactic frames in lan- guage, since VerbNet's hand-crafted hierarchy and a systematic unsupervised learner (BHC) reach similar results; and (2) captures important features of verb argument structure by predicting human generalization intuitions in a coercion task.</p><p>Of course, it is clear from the variability of our coercion data that a simple hierarchy is not a sufficiently sophisticated representation of argu- ment structure to fully explain language-wide co- ercion. However, our novel computational frame- work (unsupervised learning on VerbNet data) opens up many potentially fruitful avenues for providing language-wide evidence for argument structure hypotheses. The lack of broad-coverage predictions is often a limitation of work in this area (see Section 2). Sophisticated machine learning models that make the assumptions proposed by richer theories of argument structure and can operate at VerbNet scale are only recently coming into fruition. For example, since some theories argue for a cross- categorization of verbs and argument structures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005</ref>), using mod- els that find such a (possibly hierarchical) cross- categorization (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mansinghka et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li and Shafto, 2011</ref>) is a particularly interesting av- enue for further exploration.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Information associated with a VerbNet frame entry.</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="3,79.24,50.89,220.34,89.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Here, we used homogeneity (H) and com- pleteness (C), entropy-based measures of cluster- ing similarity analogous to precision and recall in binary classification (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). Treating VerbNet classes as ground truth, H = 1 indicates that every BHC cluster contains only members of a single VerbNet class. C = 1 indicates that members of a VerbNet class are al- ways assigned to the same BHC cluster. The worst case for both is 0. H and C have different meanings depend- ing on what we consider to be VerbNet's flat ground truth classes.</figDesc></figure>
