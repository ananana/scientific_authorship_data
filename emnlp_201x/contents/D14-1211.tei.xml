				<p>We investigate the interaction of power, gender, and language use in the Enron email corpus. We present a freely available extension to the Enron corpus, with the gender of senders of 87% messages reliably identified. Using this data, we test two specific hypotheses drawn from the sociolinguistic literature pertaining to gender and power: women managers use face-saving communicative strategies, and women use language more explicitly than men to create and maintain social relations. We introduce the notion of &quot;gender environment&quot; to the computational study of written conversations; we interpret this notion as the gender makeup of an email thread, and show that some manifestations of power differ significantly between gender environments. Finally, we show the utility of gender information in the problem of automatically predicting the direction of power between pairs of participants in email interactions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>It has long been observed that men and women communicate differently in different contexts. This phenomenon has been studied by sociolin- guists, who typically rely on case studies or sur- veys. The availability of large corpora of nat- urally occurring social interactions has given us the opportunity to study language use at a broader level than before. In this paper, we use the Enron Corpus of work-related emails to examine written communication in a corporate setting. We inves- tigate three factors that affect choices in commu- nication: the writer's gender, the gender of his or her fellow discourse participants (what we call the "gender environment"), and the relations of orga- nizational power he or she has to the discourse par- ticipants. We concentrate on modeling the writer's choices related to discourse structure, rather than lexical choice. Specifically, our goal is to show that gender, gender environment, and power all af- fect individuals' choices in complex ways, result- ing in patterns in the discourse that reveal the un- derlying factors.</p><p>This paper makes three major contributions. First, we introduce an extension to the well-known Enron corpus of emails: we semi-automatically identify the sender's gender of 87% of email mes- sages in the corpus. This extension will be made publicly available. Second, we use this enriched version of the corpus to investigate the interaction of hierarchical power and gender. We formalize the notion of "gender environment", which reflects the gender makeup of the discourse participants of a particular conversation. We study how gen- der, power, and gender environment influence dis- course participants' choices in dialog. We inves- tigate two specific hypotheses from the sociolin- guistic literature, relating to face-saving use of lan- guage, and to the use of language to strengthen so- cial relations. This contribution does not exhaust the possibilities of our corpus, but it shows how social science can benefit from advanced natural language processing techniques in analyzing cor- pora, allowing social scientists to tackle corpora such as the Enron corpus which cannot be exam- ined in its entirety by hand. Third, we show that the gender information in the enriched corpus can be useful for computational tasks, specifically for training a system that predicts the direction of hier- archical power between participants in an interac- tion. Our use of the gender-based features boosts the accuracy of predicting the direction of power between pairs of email interactants from 68.9% to 70.2% on an unseen test set.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. We review related work in Section 2. We present the Gender Identified Enron Corpus (our first contribution) in Section 3. Section 4 defines the problem of pre- dicting power and the various dimensions of in- teraction we analyze. We turn to our second con- tribution, the analysis of the data, in Sections 5 and 6. Section 7 describes our third contribution, the machine learning experiments using gender- related features in the prediction of hierarchical power. We then conclude and discuss future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>There is much sociolinguistic background related to gender and language use, some of it specifically related to language use in the work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kendall and Tannen, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Holmes and Stubbe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kendall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Herring, 2008</ref>). We do not provide a full discussion of this work for lack of space, but single out one paper which has partic- ularly influenced our work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Holmes and Stubbe (2003)</ref> provide two case studies that do not look at the differences between male and female man- agers' communication, but at the difference be- tween female managers' communication in more heavily female vs. more heavily male environ- ments. They find that, while female managers tend to break many stereotypes of "feminine" commu- nication, they have different strategies in connect- ing with employees and exhibiting power in the two gender environments. This work has inspired us to look at this phenomenon by including "Gen- der Environment" in our study. By finding the ra- tios of males to females on a thread, we can look at whether indicators change within a more heavily male or female thread. This notion of gender envi- ronment is supported by an idea in recent Twitter- based sociolinguistic research on gender identity and lexical variation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bamman et al., 2014</ref>). One of the many insights from their work is that gen- dered linguistic behavior is oriented by a number of factors, one of which includes the speaker's au- dience. Their work looks at Twitter users whose linguistic style fails to identify their gender in clas- sification experiments, and finds that the linguis- tic gender norms can be influenced by the style of their interlocutors.</p><p>Within the NLP community, there has been substantial research exploring language use and power. A large number of these studies are per- formed in the domain of organizational email where the notion of power is well defined in terms of organizational hierarchy. It is also aided by the availability of the moderately large Enron email corpus which captures email interactions in an or- ganizational setting. Earlier approaches used sim- ple lexical features alone (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bramsen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gilbert, 2012)</ref>) as a means to predict power. Later studies have used more complex linguistic and structural features, such as formality <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Peterson et al., 2011</ref>), dialog acts , and thread structure . Our work is also on the Enron email corpus, and our baseline features are derived from some of this prior work. Researchers have also studied power and influence in other genres of interactions, such as online forums <ref type="bibr">(DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Biran et al., 2012)</ref>, multi-party chats ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Strzalkowski et al., 2012</ref>) and off-line interactions such as presidential debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Nguyen et al., 2013;</ref>.</p><p>There is also some work within the NLP field on analyzing language use in relation to gender. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mohammad and Yang (2011)</ref> analyzed the way gender affects the expression of sentiments in text, while we are interested in how gender relates to manifestations of organizational power. For their study, they assigned gender for the core employees in the Enron email corpus based on whether the first name of the person was easily gender iden- tifiable or not. If the person had an unfamiliar name or a name that could be of either gender, they marked his/her gender as unknown and ex- cluded them from their study. 1 For example, the gender of the employee Kay Mann was marked as unknown in their gender assignment. However, in our work, we manually research and determine the gender of every core employee.</p><p>Researchers have also attempted to automati- cally predict the gender of email senders using su- pervised learning techniques based on linguistic features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Corney et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deitrick et al., 2012</ref>), a task we do not address in this paper. These studies use datasets that are rel- atively smaller in size. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Corney et al. (2002)</ref> use around 4K emails from 325 gender identified au- thors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al. (2011)</ref> use around 9K emails from 108 gender identified authors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deitrick et al. (2012)</ref> use around 18K emails from 144 gender identified authors. The dataset we offer is much larger in size, with around 97K emails whose au- thors are gender identified. We believe that our resource will aid further research in this area.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Enron Corpus</head><p>In our work, we use the version of Enron email corpus released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yeh and Harnly (2006)</ref>. The corpus contains emails from the mailboxes of 145 core employees who held top managerial positions within Enron at the time of bankruptcy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yeh and Harnly (2006)</ref> preprocessed the corpus to combine multiple email addresses belonging to the same entity and identify each entity in the corpus with a unique identifier. The corpus contains a total of 111,933 messages. This version of the corpus has been enriched later by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al. (2012)</ref> with gold organizational power relations, manually de- termined using information from Enron organiza- tional charts. It includes relations of 1,518 em- ployees and captures dominance relations between 13,724 pairs of them. This information enables us to study the manifestations of power in these inter- actions, in relation to gender.</p><p>In this version of the corpus, the thread structure of email messages is reconstructed, with the miss- ing messages restored from other emails in which they were quoted. This allows us to go beyond isolated messages and study the dialog structure within email threads. There were 34,156 unique discourse participants across all the email threads present in the corpus. Manually determining the gender of all the discourse participants in the cor- pus is not feasible. Hence, we adopt a two-step approach through which we reliably identify the gender of a large majority of entities in the email threads within the corpus. We manually deter- mine the gender of the 145 core employees who have a bigger representation in the corpus, and we systemically determine the gender of the rest of the discourse participants using the Social Secu- rity Administration's baby names database. We adopt a conservative approach so that we assign a gender only when the name of the participant meets a very low ambiguity threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Manual Gender Assignment</head><p>We researched each of the 145 core employees us- ing web search and found public records about them or articles referring to them. In order to make sure that the results are about the same per- son we want, we added the word 'enron' to the search queries. Within the public records returned for each core employee, we looked for instances in which they were being referred to either using a gender revealing pronoun (he/him/his vs. she/her) or using a gender revealing addressing form (Mr. vs. Mrs./Ms./Miss). Since these employees held top managerial positions within Enron at the time of bankruptcy, it was fairly easy to find public records or articles referring to them. For example, the page we found for Kay Mann clearly identifies her gender. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We were able to correctly determine the gender of each of the 145 core employees in this manner. A benefit of manually determining the gender of these core employees is that it en- sures a high coverage of 100% confident gender assignments in the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Automatic Gender Assignment</head><p>As mentioned in Section 3.1, our corpus contains a large number of discourse participants in addi- tion to the 145 core employees for which we man- ually identified the gender. To attempt to find the gender of these other discourse participants, we first determine their first names and then find how ambiguous the names are by querying the So- cial Security Administration's (SSA) baby names dataset. We first describe how we calculate an am- biguity score for a name using the SSA dataset and then describe how we use it to determine the gen- der of discourse participants in our corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">SSA Names and Gender Dataset</head><p>The US Social Security Administration maintains a dataset of baby names, gender, and name count for each year starting with the 1880s, for names with at least five counts. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We used this dataset in order to determine the gender ambiguity of a name. The Enron data set contains emails from 1998 to 2001. We estimate the common age range for a large, corporate firm like Enron at 24-67, 4 so we used the SSA data from 1931-1977 to calculate ambiguity scores for our purposes.</p><p>For each name n in the database, let mp(n) and fp(n) denote the percentages of males and fe- males with the name n. Then, we calculate the ambiguity score AS (n) as 100 − |mp(n) − fp(n)|.</p><p>The value of AS (n) varies between 0 and 100. A name that is 'perfectly unambiguous' would have an ambiguity score of 0, while a 'perfectly am- biguous' name (i.e., 50%/50% split between gen- ders) would have an ambiguity score of 100. We assign the likely gender of the name to be the one with the higher percentage, if the ambiguity score is below a threshold AS T .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G(n) = M, if AS (n) ≤ AS T and mp(n) &gt; f p(n) F, if AS (n) ≤ AS T and mp(n) ≤ f p(n) I, if AS (n) &gt; AS T</formula><p>Around 88% of the names in the SSA dataset have AS (n) = 0. We choose a very conserva- tive threshold of AS T = 10 for our gender assign- ments, which assigns gender to around 93% names in the SSA dataset. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Identifying the First Name</head><p>Each discourse participant in our corpus has at least one email address and zero or more names associated with it. The name field is automatically assembled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yeh and Harnly (2006)</ref>, where they captured the different names from email headers, which are populated from individual email clients and do not follow a standard format. Not all dis- course participants are human; some may refer to organizational groups (e.g., HR Department) or anonymous corporate email accounts (e.g., a web- master account, do-not-reply address etc.). The name field may sometimes be empty, contain mul- tiple names, contain an email address, or show other irregularities. Hence, it is nontrivial to deter- mine the first name of our discourse participants. We used the heuristics below to extract the most likely first name for each discourse participant.</p><p>• If the name field contains two words, pick the second or first word, depending on whether a comma separates them or not.</p><p>• If the name field contains three words and a comma, choose the second and third words (a likely first and middle name, respectively).</p><p>If the name field contains three words but no comma, choose the first and second words (again, a likely first and middle name).</p><p>• If the name field contains an email address, pick the portion from the beginning of the string to a '.',' ' or '-'; if the email address is in camel case, take portion from the begin- ning of the string to the first upper case letter.</p><p>• If the name field is empty, apply the above rule to the email address field to pick a name. The above heuristics create a list of candidate names for each discourse participant which we then query for an ambiguity score (Section 3.3.1) and the likely gender. We find the candidate name with the lowest ambiguity score that passes the threshold and assign the associated gender to the discourse participant. If none of the candi- date names for a discourse participant passes the threshold, we assign the gender to be 'I' (Indeter- minate). We also assign the gender to be 'I', if none of the candidate names is present in the SSA dataset. This will occur if the name is a first name that is not in the database (an unusual or interna- tional name; e.g., Vladi), or if no true first name was found (e.g., the name field was empty and the email address was only a pseudonym). This will also include most of the cases where the discourse participant is not a human.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Coverage and Accuracy</head><p>We evaluated the coverage and accuracy of our gender assignment system on the manually as- signed gender data of the 145 core people. We obtained a coverage of 90.3%, i.e., for 14 of the 145 core people, the ambiguity score was higher than the threshold. Of the 131 people the sys- tem assigned a gender to, we obtained an accu- racy of 89.3% in correctly identifying the gender. We investigated the errors and found that all er- rors were caused due to incorrectly identifying the first name. These errors arise because the name fields are automatically populated and sometimes the core discourse participants' name fields in- clude their secretaries. While this is common for people in higher managerial positions, we expect this not to happen in the middle management and below, to which most of the automatically gender- assigned discourse participants belong.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Corpus Statistics and Divisions</head><p>We apply the gender assignment system described above to all discourse participants of all email threads in the entire Enron corpus described in Section 3.1. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the coverage of gen- der assignment in our corpus at different lev- els: unique discourse participants, messages and threads. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we show the male/female per- centage split of all unique discourse participants, as well as the split at the level of messages (i.e., messages sent by males vs. females).   We also create a sub-corpus of the threads called All Participants Gender Identified (APGI), con- taining the 18,030 threads for which the gender as- signment system succeeded in assigning the gen- ders of all participants, including senders and all recipients (To and CC). For the analysis and ex- periments presented in the rest of this paper, we use 17,788 threads from this APGI subset, exclud- ing the remaining 242 threads that were used for previous manual annotation efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Manifestations of Power</head><p>We use the gender information of the participants to investigate how the gender of the sender and recipients affect the manifestations of hierarchical power in interactions. In order to do this, we use the interaction analysis framework from our prior work . In this section, we give a brief overview of the problem formulation and the structural features we used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Hierarchically Related Interacting Pairs</head><p>Let t denote an email thread and M t denote the set of all messages in t. Also, let P t be the set of all participants in t, i.e., the union of senders and recipients (To and CC) of all messages in M t . We are interested in analyzing the power relations between pairs of participants who interact within a given email thread. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the total number of pairs in IPP t and RIPP t from all the threads in the APGI subset of our corpus and across Train, Dev and Test sets.  </p><note type="other">Not every pair of partic- ipants (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ P t × P t interact with one an- other within t. Let IM t (p 1 , p 2 ) denote the set of Interaction Messages -non-empty messages in t in which either p 1 is the sender and p 2 is one of the recipients or vice versa. We call the set of (p 1 , p 2 ) such that |IM t (p 1 , p 2 )| &gt; 0 the inter- acting participant pairs of t (IPP t ). For every (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ IPP t , we query the set of dominance relations in the gold hierarchy and assign their hi- erarchical power relation (HP (p 1 , p 2 )) to be su- perior if p 1 dominates p 2 , and subordinate if p 2 dominates p 1 . We exclude pairs that do not exist in the gold hierarchy from our analysis and call the remaining set related interacting participant pairs (RIPP t ).</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Structural Features</head><p>Now, we describe various features that capture the structure of interaction between the pairs of participants in a thread. Each feature f is ex- tracted with respect to a person p over a refer- ence set of messages M (denoted f p M ). For a pair (p 1 , p 2 ), we extract 4 versions of each feature f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f p 1 IMt (p 1 ,p 2 ) , f p 2 IMt (p 1 ,p 2 ) , f p 1 Mt and f p 2</formula><p>Mt . The first two capture behavior of each person of the pair in in- teractions between themselves, while the third and fourth capture their overall behavior in the entire thread. We group our features into three categories -THR STR , THR META and DIA. THR STR cap- tures the thread structure in terms of verbosity and positional features of messages (e.g., how many emails did a person send). THR META contain email header meta-data based features that cap- ture the thread structure (e.g., how many recipients were there). Both sets of features do not perform any NLP analysis on the the content of the emails. DIA captures the pragmatics of the dialog and re- quires a deeper analysis of the email content (e.g., did they issue any requests). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THR META : This feature set includes the av- erage number of recipients (AvgRecipients) and</head><p>To recipients (AvgToRecipients) in emails sent by p, the percentage of emails p received in which he/she was in the To list (InToList%), boolean fea- tures denoting whether p added or removed peo- ple when responding to a message (AddPerson and RemovePerson), average number of replies re- ceived per message sent by p (ReplyRate) and av- erage number of replies received from the other person of the pair to messages where he/she was a To recipient (ReplyRateWithinPair). ReplyRate- WithinPair applies only to IM t (p 1 , p 2 ).</p><p>DIA: We use dialog acts (DA) and overt dis- plays of power (ODP) tags to model the struc- ture of interactions within the message content. We obtain DA and ODP tags using automatic tag- gers trained on manual annotations. The DA tag- ger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Omuya et al., 2013</ref>) obtained an accuracy of 92%. The ODP tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Prabhakaran et al., 2012)</ref> obtained an accuracy of 96% and F-measure of 54%. The DA tagger labels each sentence to be one of the 4 dialog acts: Request Action, Request Information, Inform, and Conventional. The ODP Tagger identifies sentences (mostly requests) that express additional constraints on their addressee, beyond those introduced by the dialog act. For example, the sentence "Please come to my of- fice right now" is considered as an ODP, while "It would be great if you could come to my of- fice now" is not, even though both issue the same request. For more details on ODP, we refer the   reader to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Prabhakaran et al., 2012</ref>). We use 5 features: ReqAction, ReqInform, Inform, Conven- tional, and ODPCount to capture the number of sentences in messages sent by p that have each of these labels. We also use a feature to capture the number of p's messages with a request that did not get a reply, i.e., dangling request percentage (Dan- glingReq%), over all messages sent by p.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Gender and Power</head><p>In this subsection, we analyze the impact of gen- der on the expression of power in email. We per- form an ANOVA test on all features described in Section 4.2 keeping both Hierarchical Power and Gender as independent variables. We perform this on the Train subset of the APGI subset of our cor- pus.  groups of Hierarchical Power and Gender. For ex- ample, ReplyRate was highly significant; female superiors obtain the highest reply rate. It is crucial to note that ANOVA only deter- mines that there is a significant difference between groups, but does not tell which groups are signifi- cantly different. In order to ascertain that, we must use the Tukey's HSD (Honest Significant Differ- ence) Test. We do not describe the analysis of all our features to that depth in this paper due to space limitations. Instead, we investigate specific hypotheses which we have derived from sociolin- guistic literature. The first hypothesis we investi- gate is:</p><p>• Hypothesis 1: Female superiors tend to use "face-saving" strategies at work that include conventionally polite requests and imperson- alized directives, and that avoid imperatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Herring, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>As a stand-in for a face-threatening communica- tive strategy, we use our "Overt Display of Power" feature (ODP). An ODP limits the addressee's range of possible responses, and thus threatens his or her (negative) face. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We thus reformulate our hypothesis as follows: the use of ODP by superi- ors changes when looking at the splits by gender, with female superiors using fewer ODPs than male superiors. We look further into the ANOVA anal- ysis of the thread-level ODPCount treating Hierar- chical Power and Gender as independent variables. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows the mean values of ODP counts in <ref type="bibr">6</ref> For a discussion of the notion of "face", see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown and Levinson, 1987)</ref>. each group of participants. A summary of the re- sults follows. The results confirm our hypothesis: female superiors use fewer ODPs than male superiors. However, we also see that among women, there is no significant difference between superiors and subordinates, and the difference between superi- ors and subordinates in general (which is signif- icant) is entirely due to men. This in fact shows that a more specific (and more interesting) hypoth- esis than our original hypothesis is validated: only male superiors use more ODPs than subordinates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Gender Environment and Power</head><p>We now turn to gender environments and their re- lation to the expression of power in written di- alogs. We again start with a hypothesis based on the sociolinguistic literature.</p><p>• Hypothesis 2: Women use language to cre- ate and maintain social relations, for exam- ple, they use more small talk (based on a re- ported "stereotype" in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Holmes and Stubbe, 2003)</ref>).</p><p>We first define more formally what we mean by "gender environment" (Section 6.1), and then in- vestigate our hypothesis (Section 6.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">The Notion of "Gender Environment"</head><p>The notion of "gender environment" refers to the gender composition of a group who are communi- cating. In the sociolinguistic studies we have con- sulted ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Holmes and Stubbe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Herring, 2008)</ref>, the notion refers to a stable work group who in- teract regularly. Since we are interested in study- ing email conversations (threads), we adapt the notion to refer to a single thread at a time. Fur- thermore, we assume that a discourse participant makes communicative decisions based on (among other factors) his or her own gender, and based on the genders of the people he or she is commu- nicating with in a given conversation (i.e., email thread). We therefore consider the "gender envi- ronment" to be specific to each discourse partic- ipant and to describe the other participants from his or her point of view. Put differently, we use the notion of "gender environment" to model a dis- course participant's (potential) audience in a con- versation. For example, a conversation among five women and one man looks like an all-female audi- ence from the man's point of view, but a majority- female audience from the women's points of view. We define the gender environment of a dis- course participant p in a thread t as follows. As discussed, we assume that the gender environment is a property of each discourse participant p in thread t. We take the set of all discourse partic- ipants of the thread t, P t (see Section 4.1), and exclude p from it: P t \ {p}. We then calculate the percentage of women in this set. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We obtain three groups by setting thresholds on these per- centages. Finer-grained gender environments re- sulted in partitions of the data with very few in- stances, since most of our data involves fairly bal- anced gender ratios. The three gender environ- ments we use are the following:</p><p>• Female Environment: if the percentage of women in P t \ {p} is above 66.7%.</p><p>• Mixed Environment: if the percentage of women in P t \ {p} is between 33.3% and 66.7%.</p><p>• Male Environment: if the percentage of women in P t \ {p} is below 33.3%</p><p>Across all threads and discourse participants in the threads, we have 791 female, 2087 mixed and 1642 male gender environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Gender Environment and Conventional Dialog Acts</head><p>We now turn to testing Hypothesis 2. We have at present no way of testing for "small talk" as op- posed to work-related talk, so we instead test Hy- pothesis 2 by asking how many conventional dia- log acts a person performs. Conventional dialog acts serve not to convey information or requests (both of which would typically be work-related in the Enron corpus), but to establish communication (greetings) and to manage communication (sign- offs); since communication is an important way of creating and maintaining social relations, we can say that conventional dialog acts serve the purpose of easing conversations and thus of maintaining social relations. Since this aspect of language is specifically dependent on a group of people (it is an inherently social function), we assume that the relevant feature is not simply Gender, but Gender Environment. Specifically, we make our Hypothe- sis 2 more precise by saying that a higher number of conventional dialog acts is used in Female En- vironments. We use the thread level version of the feature ConventionalCount. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the mean values of Conven- tionalCount in each sub-group of participants. Hierarchical Power was highly significant as per ANOVA results. Subordinates use conven- tional language more (0.60 counts) than Superiors (0.52). Gender is a very highly significant vari- able; Males use 0.60 counts on average, whereas Our hypothesis is thus only partially verified: while gender environment is a crucial aspect of the use of conventional DAs, we also need to look at the power status of the writer. In fact only sub- ordinates in female environments use more con- ventional DAs than any other group (as defined by power status and gender environment). While our hypothesis is not fully verified, we interpret the results to mean that subordinates are more com- fortable in female environments to use a style of communication which includes more conventional DAs than outside the female environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Predicting Power in Participant Pairs</head><p>In this section, we use the formulation of the power prediction problem presented in our prior work . Given a thread t and a pair of participants (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ RIPP t , we want to automatically de- tect HP (p 1 , p 2 ). We use the SVM-based su- pervised learning system from ) that can predict HP (p 1 , p 2 ) to be either superior or subordinate based on the in- teraction within a thread t for any pair of partici- pants (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ RIPP t . The order of participants in (p 1 , p 2 ) is fixed such that p 1 is the sender of the first message in IM t (p 1 , p 2 ). The power pre- diction system is built using the <ref type="bibr">ClearTK (Ogren et al., 2008)</ref> wrapper for SVMLight <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Joachims, 1999)</ref> package. It uses a quadratic kernel to cap- ture feature-feature interactions, which is very im- portant as we see in Section 5 and 6. We use the Train, Dev and Test subsets of the APGI subset of our corpus for our experiments. We use the re- lated interacting participant pairs in threads from the Train set to train our models and optimize our performance on those from the Dev set. We report results on both Dev and Test sets.</p><p>In addition to the features described in Sec- tion 4.2, the power prediction system presented in ) uses a lexi- cal feature set (LEX) that captures word ngrams, POS (part of speech) ngrams and mixed ngrams, since lexical features have been established to be very useful for power prediction. Mixed ngrams are word ngrams where words belonging to open classes are replaced with their POS tags. We add two gender-based feature sets: GEN containing the gender of both persons of the pair and ENV containing the gender environment feature. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 6</ref> presents the results obtained using vari- ous feature combinations. We experimented using all subsets of {LEX, THR STR , THR META , DIA, GEN, ENV } on the Dev set; we report the most interesting results here. The majority baseline (subordinate) obtains an accuracy of 55.8%. Us- ing the gender-based features alone performs only slightly better than the majority baseline. We use the best performing feature subset from ) (LEX + THR META ) as another baseline, which obtains an accuracy of 68.2%. Adding the GEN features improves the performance to 70.6%. Further adding the ENV features improves the performance, but only marginally to 70.7% (our overall best result, an improvment of 2.4% points). The best perform- ing feature set without using LEX was the combi- nation of DIA, THR META and GEN (67.3%). Re- moving the gender features from this reduced the performance to 64.6%. Similarly, the best per- forming feature set which do not use the content of emails at all was THR STR + THR META + GEN (66.6). Removing the gender features decreases the accuracy by a larger margin (5.4% accuracy reduction to 63.0).</p><p>We interpret the differences in absolute im- provement as follows: the gender-based features on their own are not very useful, and gain predic- tive value only when paired with other features. This is because the other features in fact make quite different predictions depending on gender and/or gender environment. However, the content features (and in particular the lexical features) are so powerful on their own that the relative contribu- tion of the gender-based features decreases again. Nonetheless, we take these results as validation of the claim that gender-based features enhance the value of other features in the task of predicting power relations.</p><p>We performed another experiment where we partitioned the data into two subsets according to the gender of the first person of the pair and trained two separate models to predict power. At test time, we chose the appropriate model based on the gen- der of the first person of the pair. However, this did not improve the performance.</p><p>On our blind test set, the majority baseline ob- tains an accuracy of 57.9% and the ) baseline obtains an accuracy of 68.9%. On adding the gender-based features, the accuracy of the system improves to 70.2%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a new, freely available resource: the Gender Identified Enron Corpus, and explored the relation between power, gender, and language us- ing this resource. We also introduced the notion of gender environment, and showed that the man- ifestations of power differ significantly between gender environments. We also showed that the gender-related features helps in improving power prediction. In future work, we will explore ma- chine learning algorithms which capture the inter- actions between features better than our SVM with quadratic kernel.</p><p>We expect our corpus to be a rich resource for social scientists interested in the effect of power and gender on language use. We will investi- gate several other sociolinguistic-inspired research questions; for example, do the strategies managers use for "effectiveness" of communication differ based on gender environments?</p><p>While our findings pertain to the Enron data set, we believe that the insights and techniques from this study can be extended to other genres in which there is an independent notion of hierar- chical power, such as moderated online forums.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>THR STR :</head><label></label><figDesc>This feature set includes two kinds of features -positional and verbosity.

Male Superiors used the most ODPs, with an average of 0.135 counts. Somewhat surprisingly, Female Superiors used the least of the entire group, with an average of 0.072 counts. Among Subordinates, Females actually used slightly more ODP, with an average of 0.096 counts. Male Subordinates had an average of 0.086 ODP counts.
