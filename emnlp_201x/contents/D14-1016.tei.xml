				<p>We present a novel approach to improve word alignment for statistical machine translation (SMT). Conventional word alignment methods allow discontin-uous alignment, meaning that a source (or target) word links to several target (or source) words whose positions are dis-continuous. However, we cannot extract phrase pairs from this kind of alignments as they break the alignment consistency constraint. In this paper, we use a weighted vote method to transform dis-continuous word alignment to continuous alignment, which enables SMT systems extract more phrase pairs. We carry out experiments on large scale Chinese-to-English and German-to-English translation tasks. Experimental results show statistically significant improvements of BLEU score in both cases over the base-line systems. Our method produces a gain of +1.68 BLEU on NIST OpenMT04 for the phrase-based system, and a gain of +1.28 BLEU on NIST OpenMT06 for the hierarchical phrase-based system.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Word alignment, indicating the correspondence between the source and target words in bilingual sentences, plays an important role in statistical machine translation <ref type="bibr">(SMT)</ref>. Almost all of the SMT models, not only phrase-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Koehn et al., 2003</ref>), but also syntax-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chiang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Liu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Huang et al., 2006</ref>), derive translation knowledge from large amount bilingual text anno- tated with word alignment. Therefore, the quality of the word alignment has big impact on the qual- ity of translation output.</p><p>Word alignments are usually automatically ob- tained from a large amount of bilingual training corpus. The most widely used toolkit for word alignment in SMT community is GIZA++ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Och and Ney, 2004</ref>), which implements the well known IBM models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brown et al., 1993</ref>) and the HM- M model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Vogel and Ney, 1996)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Koehn et al. (2003)</ref> proposed some heuristic methods (e.g. the "grow-diag-final" method) to refine word align- ments trained by GIZA++. Another group of word alignment methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Moore et al., 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riesa and Marcu, 2010</ref>) define feature functions to describe word alignment. They need manually aligned bilingual texts to train the mod- el. However, the manually annotated data is too expensive to be available for all languages. Al- though these models reported high accuracy, the GIZA++ and "grow-diag-final" method are domi- nant in practice.</p><p>However, automatic word alignments are usu- ally very noisy. The example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a Chinese and English sentence pair, with word alignment automatically trained by GIZA++ and the "grow-diag-final" method. We find many er- rors (dashed links) are caused by discontinuous alignment (formal definition is described in Sec- tion 2), a source (or target) word linking to sev- eral discontinuous target (or source) words. This kind of errors will result in the loss of many use- ful phrase pairs that are learned based on bilingual word alignment. Actually, according to the defini- tion of phrases in a standard phrase-based model, we cannot extract phrases from the discontinuous alignment. The reason is that this kind of align- ment break the alignment consistency constrain- t ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Koehn et al., 2003)</ref>. For example, the Chi-  Figure 1: An example of word alignment between a Chinese and English sentence pair. The dashed links are incorrect alignments.</p><p>nese word "shi 2 " 1 is aligned to the English words "was 4 " and "that 10 ". However, these two English words are discontinuous, and we cannot extract the phrase pair "(shi, was)".</p><p>In this paper, we propose a simple weighed vote method to deal with the discontinuous word align- ment. Firstly, we split the discontinuous align- ment into several continuous alignment group- s, and consider each continuous alignment group as a bucket. Secondly, we vote for each buck- et with alignment score measured by word trans- lation probabilities. Finally, we select the buck- et with the highest score as the final alignment. The strength of our method is that we refine word alignment without using any external knowledge, as the word translation probabilities can be esti- mated from the bilingual corpus with the original word alignment.</p><p>We notice that the discontinuous alignment is helpful for hierarchical phrase-based model, as the model allows discontinuous phrases. Thus, for the hierarchical phrase-based model, our method may lost some discontinuous phrases. To solve the problem, we keep the original discontinuous alignment in the training corpus.</p><p>We carry out experiment with the state-of-the- art phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chiang, 2005</ref>) SMT systems implemented in Moses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koehn et al., 2007)</ref>. Experiments on large scale Chinese-to-English and German-to-English translation tasks demonstrate significant improve- ments in both cases over the baseline systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Weighted Vote Method</head><p>To refine the discontinuous alignment, we propose a weighted vote method to transform discontinu- ous alignment to continuous alignment by discard- ing noisy links. We split discontinuous alignment <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The subscript denotes the word position.</p><p>into several continuous groups, and select the best group with the highest score computed by word translation probabilities as the final alignment.</p><p>For further understanding, we first describe some definitions. Given a word-aligned sentence pair</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(F I 1 , E J 1 , A), an alignment set A set (i)</formula><p>is the set of target word positions that aligned to the source word F i i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A set (i) = {j|(i, j) ∈ A} (1)</formula><p>For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the alignment set for the Chinese word "shaoshu 3 " is A set (3) = {5, 7, 8, 10}.</p><p>We define an alignment s- pan</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A span (i) as [min(A set (i)), max(A set (i))].</formula><p>Thus, the alignment span for the Chinese word "shaoshu 3 " is A span (3) = <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>.</p><p>The alignment for F i i is discontinuous if there exist some target words in A span (i) linking to an- other source word, i.e. ∃(i , j ) ∈ A, where i = i, j ∈ A span (i). Otherwise, the alignment is contin- uous. According to the definition, the alignment for "shaoshu 3 " is discontinuous. Because the tar- get words "the 6 " and "nations 9 " in the alignmen- t span link to another Chinese words "de 9 " and "guojia 10 ", respectively. For a target word E j j , the definition is similar.</p><p>If the alignment for F i i is discontinuous, we can split the alignment span</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A span (i) = [j 1 , j 2 ] into m continuous spans {[j k p , j k q ]}, where k = 1, 2, ..., m, and j k p , j k q ∈ [j 1 , j 2 ].</formula><p>Our goal is to se- lect the best continuous span for the word F i i . To do this, we score each continuous span with word translation probabilities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S([j k p , j k q ]) = q t=p (P r(E j k t |F i ) + P r(F i |E j k t ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P r(f |e) = count(f, e) f count(f , e)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>a m o n g th e h a n d fu l o f n a ti o n s th a t 少数 shaoshu 0.1 0.5 0.2 0.1 <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: An example of weighted voted method for selecting the best continuous alignment from the discontinuous alignment. The heavy shading area is selected as the final alignment.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P r(e|f ) = count(e, f ) e count(f, e )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The word translation probabilities can be comput- ed from the bilingual corpus with the initial word alignment. Finally, we select the span with the highest score as the final alignment, and discard all other alignments. We illustrate our method in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which shows the source word "shaoshu" and its align- ment in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. We split the alignments into three continuous alignment spans and compute s- core for each span. Finally, the span with highest score (heavy shading area) is selected as the final alignment.</p><p>We conduct the procedure for each source and target word, the improved alignment (solid links) is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiment</head><p>To demonstrate the effect of the proposed method, we use the state-of-the-art phrase-based system and hierarchical phrase-based system implement- ed in Moses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koehn et al., 2007</ref>). The phrase- based system uses continuous phrase pair as the main translation knowledge. While the hierarchi- cal phrase-based system uses both continuous and discontinuous phrase pairs, which has an ability to capture long distance phrase reordering.</p><p>we carried out experiments on two translation tasks: the Chinese-to-English task comes from the NIST Open MT Evaluation, and the German-to- English task comes from the Workshop on Ma- chine Translation (WMT) shared task.</p></div>

The reason is that by dis- carding noisy word alignments from the discon- tinuous alignments, the phrase pairs constrained by the noisy alignments can be extracted. Thus the system utilized more phrase pairs than the baseline did.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Hierarchical Phrase-based System</head><p>The hierarchical phrase-based system utilizes dis- continuous phrase pairs for long distance phrase reordering. Some of the discontinuous phrase pairs are extracted from the discontinuous align- ments. By transforming the discontinuous align- ments to continuous alignments, on the one hand, we may lost some discontinuous phrase pairs. On the other hand, we may extract additional contin- uous and discontinuous phrase pairs as the align- ment restriction is loose.</p><p>See <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for illustration. From the initial alignment, we can extract a hierarchical phrase pair "(dang X 1 shi, when X 1 )" from the discon- tinuous alignment of the English word "when". However, the hierarchical phrase pair cannot be extracted from our refined alignment, because our method discards the link between the Chinese word "dang" and the English word "when". In- stead, we can extract another hierarchical phrase pair "(X 1 shi, when X 1 )".</p><p>Does our method still obtain improvements on the hierarchical phrase-based system? <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4 and  Table 5</ref> shows Chinese-to-English and German- to-English translation quality of the hierarchical phrase-based system, respectively.

While for German-to-English translation, the im- provements ranged from 0.12 to 0.59 BLEU% on the test set (the row "Refined").</p><p>We find that the improvements are less than that of the phrase-based system. As discussed above, our method may lost some hierarchical phrase pairs that extracted from the discontinuous alignments. To solve the problem, we combine 2 the initial alignments and the refined alignments to train the SMT system. The results are shown in the row "Combined" in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4 and Table 5</ref>. For Chinese-to-English translation, we obtained an improvements of 1.28 BLEU% on NIST06 over the baseline. While for German-to-English trans- lation, the greatest improvements is 1.10 BLEU% on WMT11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analyses</head><p>In order to further study the performance of the proposed method, we analyze the word alignment and the phrase table for Chinese-to-English trans- lation. We find that our method improves the qual- ity of word alignment. And as a result, more useful phrase pairs are extracted from the refined word alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Word Alignment</head><p>The Chinese-to-English training corpus contains 4.5M sentence pairs. By applying GIZA++ and the "grow-diag-final" method, we obtained initial alignments. We find that 4.0M (accounting for 89%) sentence pairs contain discontinuous align- ments. We then used the proposed method to dis- card noisy links. By doing this, the total links between words in the training corpus are reduced from 99.6M to 78.9M, indicating that 21% links are discarded.   <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: The phrase number extracted from the initial and refined alignment for the hierarchical phrase-based system on Chinese-to-English trans- lation.

It is observed that our method improves the precision and decreases the AER, while keeping a high re- call. This means that our method effectively dis- cards noisy links in the initial word alignments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Phrase Table</head><p>According to the standard definition of phrase in SMT, phrase pairs cannot be extracted from the discontinuous alignments. By transforming dis- continuous alignments into continuous alignmen- t, we can extract more phrase pairs. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows the number of standard phrases and hier- archical phrases extracted from the initial and re- fined word alignments. We find that the number of both phrases and hierarchical phrases grows heav- ily. This is because that the word alignment con- straint for phrase extraction is loosed by removing noisy links. Although the phrase table becomes larger, fortunately, there are some methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">He et al., 2009</ref>) to prune phrase table without hurting translation quality.</p><p>For further illustration, we compare the phrase pairs extracted from the initial alignment and re- fined alignment in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. From the initial align- ments, we extracted only 3 standard phrase pairs and no hierarchical phrase pairs <ref type="table">(Table 8)</ref>.

The method re- fines initial word alignments by transforming dis- continuous alignment to continuous alignment. As a result, more useful phrase pairs are extracted from the refined word alignment. Our method is simple and efficient, since it uses only the word translation probabilities obtained from the initial alignments to discard noisy links. Our method is independent of languages and can be applied to most SMT models. Experimental results show significantly improvements for the state-of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based sys- tems on all Chinese-to-English and German-to- English translation tasks.</p><p>In the future, we will refine the method by con- sidering neighbor words and alignments when dis- carding noisy links.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
