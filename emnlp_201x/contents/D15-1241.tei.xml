				<p>Large-scale Knowledge Bases (such as NELL, Yago, Freebase, etc.) are often sparse, i.e., a large number of valid relations between existing entities are missing. Recent research have addressed this problem by augmenting the KB graph with additional edges mined from a large text corpus while keeping the set of nodes fixed, and then using the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) to perform KB inference over this augmented graph. In this paper, we extend this line of work by augmenting the KB graph not only with edges, but also with bridging entities, where both the edges and bridging entities are mined from a 500 million web text corpus. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the value of bridging entities in improving the performance and running time of PRA in the KB inference task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Large-scale knowledge bases (KB) like Freebase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bollacker et al., 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007</ref>), NELL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mitchell et al., 2015)</ref> can be use- ful in a variety of applications like natural lan- guage question answering, semantic search en- gines, etc. These knowledge bases consist of mil- lions of real world entities and relationships be- tween them which are stored in the form of a di- rected graph where links represent relations and nodes represent the entities. Although such KBs contain millions of entities, they are still very sparse, i.e., they are missing a large number of relations between existing entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(West et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Performing inference over the knowledge graph for predicting relations between two entities is one way of densifying the KB graph. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Example showing how addition of the bridging entity, Brian McCain, and the two edges incident on it can help the PRA algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Lao and Cohen, 2010)</ref> to infer the initially missing relation instance teamPlaysSport(Yankees, BaseBall). The original KB graph consisted only of two nodes, Yankees and Baseball, and no edges. from (Germany, playsinTournament, FIFA) and (FIFA, tournamentofSport, Soccer), we can infer (Germany, playsSport, Soccer). The Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lao and Cohen, 2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lao et al., 2011</ref>) performs such an inference by learning inference rules over the knowledge graph.</p><p>If the knowledge graph is sparse, i.e., if there are a very few or no paths between source and target entities, then PRA is unable to predict the existence of a relation. To address this shortcom- ing, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lao et al., 2012</ref>) augmented the knowledge graph with paths obtained from an external corpus. The added paths consisted of unlexicalized depen- dency labels obtained from a dependency parsed external corpus. To improve the expressivity of the added paths, instead of the unlexicalized la- bels, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013</ref>) augmented the KB graph with verbs (surface relations) from a corpus containing over 600 million Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triples. These verbs act as edges that con- nect previously unconnected entities thereby in- creasing the connectivity of the KB graph which can potentially improve PRA performance.</p><p>However, na¨ıvelyna¨ıvely adding these edges increases the feature sparsity which degrades the discrim- inative ability of the logistic regression classifier used in PRA. This can be addressed by adding la- tent relations obtained by clustering the surface re- lations, instead of directly adding the surface rela- tions. This reduces feature sparsity and has been shown to improve PRA inference ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013)</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gardner et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In this article we propose a scheme for aug- menting the KB using paths obtained by mining noun phrases that connect two SVO triples from an external corpus. We term these noun phrases as bridging entities since they bridge two KB re- lations to form a path. This is different from the scheme in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013)</ref> and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014)</ref>, which adds edges between KB nodes by mining surface relations from an external cor- pus. We search for such bridging entities in the corpus by performing a limited depth DFS (depth first search) on the corpus graph in an on-demand fashion.</p><p>We term this procedure as On-Demand Aug- mentation (ODA), because the search can be per- formed during test time in an on-demand man- ner. In contrast, the previous approaches of adding edges or embeddings to the KB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013)</ref>, and vector space random walk PRA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>) are batch procedures. As we shall see in Section 4, due to a limited search space, on-demand augmentation is much faster compared to algorithms in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>). Furthermore, since edges are not added blindly, on-demand augmentation does not increase feature sparsity which is responsible for performance degradation. Our experiments sug- gest that ODA provides better performance than ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013</ref>) and nearly the same pre- diction performance as provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gardner et al., 2014</ref>), but in both cases with the added ad- vantage of faster running time and greater flex- ibility due to its online and on-demand nature. The code along with the results can be obtained at https://github.com/malllabiisc/pra-oda.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Using surface level relations and noun phrases for extracting meaningful relational facts is not a new idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hearst, 1992)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brin, 1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Etzioni et al., 2004</ref>). However, none of them make use of Knowledge Bases for improving information ex- traction.</p><p>The Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) first pro- posed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Lao and Cohen, 2010</ref>) was used for per- forming inference over a KB in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lao et al., 2011</ref>). It was extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Lao et al., 2012)</ref>, to improve the inference by augmenting the KB with syntactic information obtained from a dependency parsed corpus. Augmenting the KB for improving PRA inference using surface relations mined from an external corpus and using latent edge labels ob- tained by performing PCA on the surface relations was explored in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013</ref>). Instead of hard mapping of surface relations to latent em- beddings, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>) perform a 'soft' mapping using vector space random walks. This allows the random walker to traverse an edge se- mantically similar to the current edge type more frequently than other edges.</p><p>Although, like others, we too use an external corpus to augment the KB, the crucial difference in our approach is that apart from adding surface relations, we also add bridging entities that enable us to create new paths in the KB. Furthermore, the procedure is targeted so that only paths that play a part in inferring the relations that are of interest are added. Thus, the number of paths added in this manner is much lower than the number of surface relations added using the procedure in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013</ref>). As we shall see in Section 4, this results in a more effective algorithm with faster runtime.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Background: Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA)</head><p>We first present a brief overview of the Path Rank- ing Algorithm (PRA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lao and Cohen, 2010)</ref>. The PRA uses paths as features for a logistic regres- sion classifier which predicts if the given relation exists between a pair of entities. For a given pair of entities s and t, the path type connecting s to t form the feature vector. A path types π is an or- dered set of relations. Paths with the same ordered relations but different intermediate or terminal en- tities belong to the same path type. For example,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s 1 v 0 −→ x 1 v 1 −→ t 1 and s 2 v 0 −→ x 2 v 1 −→ t 2 belong to path type v 0 −→ v 1 −→.</formula><p>The value of a feature, is taken to be P (s → t; π), where P (s → t; π) is the probability of reaching t from s by traversing paths of type π. PRA approximates these proba- bilities by running a random walk (RW) on the KB graph. Let F = {π 1 , π 2 , ..., π k } be the set of all path types. For predicting the existence of relation r between entities s and t, the logistic regression classifier outputs a score which is a measure of the confidence that r exists between s and t. It does so by first assigning weights to the features in the training phase. The score is given by</p><note type="other">Query Candidate Answer Path added by PRA-ODA with bridging entity (in bold) sportsteamPositionForSport(right handed pitcher, ?</note><formula xml:id="formula_1">S(s, t, r) = π∈F P (s → t; π) × θ r π<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where θ r π is the weight learned by the logistic re- gression classifier during training specially for re- lation r and path type π. During the test phase, since targets are not available, the PRA gathers candidate targets by performing a random walk and then computes feature vectors and the score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">PRA-SVO and PRA-VS</head><p>PRA-SVO and PRA-VS are the systems proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013)</ref> and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>) respectively, where the KB graph is augmented with edges mined from a large subject-verb-object (SVO) triple corpus. In these two systems, only new edges are added over the fixed set of nodes, and the augmentation happens in a batch, offline setting. In contrast, PRA-ODA, the method pro- posed in the paper, also expands the set of nodes through bridging entities, and performs the aug- mentation in an on-demand manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">PRA On-Demand Augmentation</head><p>(PRA-ODA) Training: Let s and t be any two KB entities and let s (n) and t (n) be their corresponding noun phrase representations or aliases. We search for bridging entities x 1 , x 2 , ..x n by performing lim- ited depth first search (DFS) starting with s n such that we obtain a path s</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ALIAS −→ s (n) v 0 −→ x 1 v 1 −→ ... v n−1 −→ x n vn −→ t (n) ALIAS −→ t,</formula><p>where v i are verbs present in the corpus graph. This is done for all n ≤ d max − 1, where d max is the maximum depth of DFS. We add an 'ALIAS' edge between the KB entity and its noun phase representation. The use- fulness of bridging entities is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>We mine bridging entities from a corpus con- taining over 600 million SVO triples which were obtained from the ClueWeb09 corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Callan et al., 2009</ref>) parsed using the MALT parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Nivre et al., 2007)</ref>. We use Mongo DB to store the triples as an adjacency list. During training time, for any relation that is being inferred, both the source and its corresponding target entities are known. A lim- ited depth DFS is performed for all depths less then d max on the SVO graph with the aliases of subject entity acting as the starting points. Such aliases are available for the NELL and Freebase knowledge bases. The DFS is said to discover a path if the terminating entity of the path matches any alias of the target entity. We choose to use aliases to perform string match, since it is easy to change the softness of the match by simply adding more aliases. This is done for all training source- target pairs. A few examples of added paths are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The SVO graph is noisy since it is obtained by parsing the ClueWeb corpus which was obtained by scraping the web. To reduce noise, we add the top K most frequent discovered SVO path types, where K is a tunable parameter. By SVO path type we refer to a set of ordered verbs mined from the SVO corpus. There is a possibility that the bridg- ing entities, extracted from the corpus, may be present in the KB. If the bridging entity matches any alias, then it is treated as an alias to an existing KB entity. If not, then the bridging entity is added to the KB as a new entity. To avoid overfitting we add negative data to the training set. Further- more, only high quality expressive bridging enti- ties result in meaningful and discriminative paths. Although the quality of bridging entities depend on the corpus, low quality bridging entities can be filtered out by adding negative training data. Low quality bridging entities connect source tar- get pairs from both positive and negative training sets, and hence are eliminated by the sparse lo- gistic regression classifier. The negative dataset is generated using the closed world assumption by performing a random walk.</p><p>After augmenting the KB, we run the training phase of the PRA algorithm to obtain the feature (path) weights computed by the logistic regression KB Relations  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Comparison of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric for 10 relations from NELL (higher is better). PRA-SVO, PRA-VS are the systems proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>). PRA-ODA is the approach proposed in this paper. Improvements in PRA-ODA over PRA- SVO is statistically significant with p &lt; 0.007, with PRA-SVO as null hypothesis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">PRA PRA- SVO PRA- VS PRA- ODA actorstarredinmovie 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 atheleteplaysforteam 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 citylocatedincountry 0.166 0.25 1.0 1.0 journalistwritesfor publication 1.0 1.0 1.</formula></div>

We use all the entities included in the range of the relation being predicted as candidate target entities.

The DFS is now performed starting from source entities as during training, but this time only restricting to paths with positive weights learned during train- ing. Any path (along with bridging entities) found during this search are added to the KB, and the PRA algorithm is now run over this augmented graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We used the implementation of PRA provided by the authors of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>). For our ex- periments, we used the same 10 NELL relation data as used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>). The aug- mentation resulted in the addition of 1086 paths during training and 1430 paths during test time.</p><p>We split the NELL data into 60% training data, 15 % development data and 25% test data. Values for d max , and K, the most fre- quent paths, were obtained by tuning on a development set for 4 relations (athleteplaysfor- sport,actorstarredinmovie,citylocatedincountry  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Runtime comparison for the entire ex- periment (lower is better). PRA-SVO, PRA-VS are the systems proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>). PRA-ODA is the approach proposed in this paper. Between the two top per- forming systems, i.e., PRA-ODA and PRA-VS, PRA-ODA is faster by a factor of 1.8. and journalistwritesforpublication). The hyper- parameter values d max = 2, K = 10 reported the highest MRR and were used for the rest of the relations. For the L 1 and L 2 regularization parameters in the logistic regression classifier, we used the same values as used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>), viz., L 1 = 0.005, and L 2 = 1.0. This is because the parameters were reported to be robust, and seemed to work well even when the knowledge base was augmented.</p><p>We compare the results (PRA-ODA) with the PRA algorithm executed on the NELL KB, NELL KB augmented with surface relations (PRA-SVO) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gardner et al., 2013</ref>) and vector space random walk PRA (PRA-VS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardner et al., 2014</ref>). The run times, i.e, the time taken to perform an entire experiment for PRA-SVO and PRA-VS includes the time taken to augment NELL KB with SVO edges. The PRA-VS runtime also includes the time taken for generating embeddings to perform the vector space random walk. As can be seen from <ref type="table">Table 2 and Table 3</ref>, our scheme, PRA-ODA, provides performance equivalent to PRA-VS with faster running time (speed up of 1.8). In addition to the time taken for the full SVO augmentation, PRA-VS takes additional time to generate embed- dings (13 minutes) from the added verbs. We note that the batch augmentation in case of PRA-SVO and PRA-VS, and embedding computation in case of PRA-VS are all specific to the relations in the evaluation set, and hence can't be ignored as a one-time offline cost. In other words, these costs are likely to increase as more relations (and their instances) are included during training and test- ing. Runtime gains with PRA-ODA are likely to be even more pronounced in such settings.</p><p>An additional advantage of the proposed algo- rithm is that it can also be run on the top of any PRA based algorithm such as the PRA-SVO and PRA-VS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we investigated the usefulness of adding paths to a Knowledge Base for improving its connectivity by mining bridging entities from an external corpus. While previous KB augmen- tation methods focused only on augmentation us- ing mined surface verbs while keeping the node set fixed, we extended these approaches by also adding bridging entities in an online fashion. We used a large corpus of 500 million web text corpus to mine these additional edges and bridging enti- ties. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is not only comparable or better than other state-of-the- art baselines, but more importantly provides faster overall runtime compared with the alternatives.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="true"><head>Table 1 : Examples of paths involving bridging entities (marked in bold) added to the KB by PRA-ODA.</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>)
