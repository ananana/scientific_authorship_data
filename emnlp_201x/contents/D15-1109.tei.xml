				<p>In this paper we present the first ever, to the best of our knowledge, discourse parser for multi-party chat dialogues. Discourse in multi-party dialogues dramatically differs from monologues since threaded conversations are commonplace rendering prediction of the discourse structure compelling. Moreover, the fact that our data come from chats renders the use of syntactic and lexical information useless since people take great liberties in expressing themselves lexically and syntactically. We use the dependency parsing paradigm as has been done in the past (Muller et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014). We learn local probability distributions and then use MST for decoding. We achieve 0.680 F 1 on unlabelled structures and 0.516 F 1 on fully labeled structures which is better than many state of the art systems for monologues, despite the inherent difficulties that multi-party chat dialogues have.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Discourse parsing is a difficult, multifaceted prob- lem involving the understanding and modeling of various semantic and pragmatic phenomena as well as understanding the structural properties that a discourse graph can have. Unsurprisingly, most extant theories and computational approaches pos- tulate an extremely simplified version of discourse structure. One of the most widely cited theories, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mann and Thompson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mann and Thompson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Taboada and Mann, 2006</ref>), requires that only adja- cent discourse units be connected together with a discourse relation. Another widely cited approach, the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Prasad et al., 2008)</ref>, focuses on decisions about the dis- course connectives that label the attachment of po- tentially arbitrary text spans but does not make any claims as to what the overall discourse struc- ture of the resulting annotation looks like. Further, all computational work on the PDTB takes the at- tachments as given in discourse parsing tasks. In both cases, the attachment problem, finding which discourse units are attached to which, is vastly simplified, though this has enabled researchers to explore various approaches for discourse parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Marcu, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sagae, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hernault et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Joty et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>Our paper's main contribution is to provide a discourse parsing model for multi-party chat di- alogue (i.e. typed online dialogue), trained on a large corpus we have developed annotated with full discourse structures. We study attachment problem in detail for this genre, without using the simplifying hypotheses mentioned above that we know to be inadequate. In the following section, we describe the Settlers of Catan game and our corpus in more detail and discuss some problem- atic structures for discourse parsing from our cor- pus. We motivate our choice of a particular dis- course theory, the Segmented Discourse Repre- sentation Theory (SDRT), as the underlying the- oretical model for our annotations. In section 4 we present our parsing approach, which consists of building a local probability distribution model which serves as input to a series of decoder mech- anisms. We present and discuss the results we obtain in section 5, while related work and con- clusions are presented in sections 6 and 7 respec- tively.</p><p>a person might pose a question that concerns all the participants; and once everybody has replied, that same person might reply to all of them with a single comment (e.g. thanking them) or with a sin- gle acknowledgment. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> provides an exam- ple from our corpus. In turn 234, gotwood4sheep asks a question and makes an underspecified of- fer to all the players. He then gets back nega- tive responses to his question from inca, Cheshire- CatGrin and dmm; and then he broadcasts in 239 an acknowledgment of all the negative responses. That is, we have 235, 236 &amp; 238 all attached to 234 as answers to the question in 234; and we have 239 that is attached to <ref type="bibr">235, 236 &amp; 238</ref> as an ac- knowledgment of the contents of those turns. A graphical representation is shown on the right of the same picture.</p><p>The presence of such structures makes a pow- erful case that the general framework guiding the annotation of multi-party dialogues should take non-tree-like graphs as the basic form of discourse structures. This will require then rethinking the task of discourse parsing when attempting to learn such structures. In particular, the following ques- tions present themselves: 1) how many non-tree- like structures are there? 2) what are the con- straints on discourse graphs, if they are not trees? 3) how far can traditional tree-based decoding mechanisms get us in dealing with such data?</p><p>Another complicated phenomenon in multi- party chat dialogues is the presence of crossing de- pendencies. Many theories of discourse structure like RST, given that they allow attachment only of adjacent spans will perforce not allow structures with crossing dependencies. Also theories that postulate a simple right frontier constraint, ac- cording to which only elements on the right fron- tier of a discourse structure (whether graph or tree) will in general not generate structures with cross- ing dependencies. However, crossing dependen- cies are commonplace in multi-party chat. Several subgroups of interlocutors can and do momentar- ily form and carry on a discussion amongst them- selves, forming thus multiple concurrent discus- sion threads. Since, though, what is being written is publicly available to all involved parties, it can be the case that participants of one thread might reply or comment to something said to another thread. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> contains an example from our corpus.</p><p>There are at least three threads in this excerpt, and we have given them different fonts to aid the reader. The intuitive attachments in this ex- cerpt involve the following crossing dependen- cies: <ref type="bibr">(165,</ref><ref type="bibr">168)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(167,</ref><ref type="bibr">170)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(176,</ref><ref type="bibr">178)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(177,</ref><ref type="bibr">179)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(175,</ref><ref type="bibr">181)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(177,</ref><ref type="bibr">182)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">(180,</ref><ref type="bibr">183)</ref>. We note also the lack of standard discourse markers such as those found in the PDTB or RST manu- als, "personalized" orthography, the lack of elabo- rate syntactic structure and the frequent presence of sentence fragments, all of which means we cannot rely on sentential syntax to aid with dis- course parsing (syntax is very useful in monologue discourse parsing, as witnessed by the dramati- cally higher scores for intra-sentential discourse parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Joty et al., 2015)</ref>). Multi-party dialogue presents a discourse parsing problem free of syn- tactic crutches.</p><p>The phenomena we have just described are just some of the complications that appear in the dis- course representation of multi-party dialogues, un- fortunately rendering discourse theories based on attaching only adjacent units unsuitable for the representation of multi-party dialogues. In order to be able to capture the discourse phenomena present in our chat corpus, we have decided to use the Segmented Discourse Representation The- ory (SDRT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asher and Lascarides, 2003</ref>). This theory not only allows long distance attachments, which (Ginzburg, 2012) finds attested in multi- logue, but also has semantics capable of deal- ing with fragments or non sentential utterances <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Schlangen, 2003)</ref>, which are frequent in our cor- pus. Also, it can model non-tree like structures, like that shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, which account for at least 9% of the links in our corpus. Such struc- tures make theories that model discourse struc- tures with rooted trees, like Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mann and Thompson, 1987)</ref> or simple dialogue models where attachments are al- ways made to <ref type="bibr">Last-cf. (Schegloff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Poesio and Traum, 1997</ref>)-unsuitable.</p><p>A final feature of discourse annotations that multi-party dialogue and monologue share is the presence of complex discourse units or CDUs. CDUs are in fact subgraphs of the discourse graph that have a rhetorical function or bear some dis- course relation to another constituent. Examples are easy to come by. Consider the following ex- ample:</p><p>(  Clearly, th's two turns combine to form a CDU that is then related by a conditional discourse relation to I do. That is you give me an ore and or a wood form together the antecedent to the conditional that he expresses. In order to reflect this semantic dependency, SDRT creates collections of Elemen- tary Discourse Units (EDUs) forming a coherent discourse unit (called Complex Discourse Unit, CDU) and link it to any other discourse unit. The end result of this process is the creation of a hyper- graph or, equivalently, a graph with two types of edges. Thus, our general conception of a discourse structure for a discourse D = {e 1 , . . . , e n }, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e i are the EDUs of D, is a tuple (V, E 1 , E 2 , ),</formula><p>where V is a set of nodes or discourse units in- cluding {e 1 , . . . , e n }, E 1 ⊆ V × V a set of edges representing discourse relations and E 2 ⊆ V × V a set of edges that represents parthood in the sense that if (x, y) ∈ E 2 , then x is a discourse unit that is an element of the CDU y. : E 1 → Relations is a function that assigns each arc a discourse rela- tion type. Our corpus contains many instances of CDUs, some of which are quite large, encompass- ing an entire question answering session like that seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The STAC corpus</head><p>The corpus that we use was collected from an on- line version of the game The Settlers of Catan. Settlers is a multi-party, win-lose game in which players use resources such as wood and sheep to build roads and settlements. In the standard on- line version, players interact solely through the game interface, making trades and building roads, etc., without saying a word. In our online version, players were asked to discuss and negotiate their trades via a chat interface before finalizing them non-linguistically via the game interface. As a re- sult, players frequently chatted not only to nego- tiate trades, but to discuss numerous topics, some unrelated to the task at hand.</p><p>The Settlers corpus is ideal for studying mul- tilogue. First, while the chats maintain the ad- vantage of written text (no need for transcrip- tion), they approximate spoken communication. We have to deal with many sentence fragments, non-standard orthography and sometimes lack of syntax. Second, they manifest phenomena partic- ular to multilogue, such as multiple conversation threads and non-tree-like structures.</p><p>The corpus consists of 59 games out of which 36 games have so far been annotated for discourse structure in the style of SDRT. Each game consists of several dialogues representing a single turn of the game. Each dialogue is treated as a separate document. About 10% of our corpus was held out for evaluation purposes while the rest was kept for training. Detailed statistics on the number of dia- logues, EDUs and relations contained in each sub- corpus can be found in table 1.</p><p>The dialogues in our corpus have an average size of 10 EDUs with 8 speaker turns, though the longest has 156 EDUs and 119 turns. The vast majority of our discourse connections thus lie be- tween turns. All dialogues also have a dialogue act <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Total Training Testing   Dialogues  1091  968  123   EDUs   10677  9545  1132  Relations 11348  10158  1190   Table 1</ref>: Dataset overview style annotation in which each EDU is assigned a particular type (it can be an offer or counter-offer, an acceptance or refusal, or other) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sidner, 1994a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sidner, 1994b</ref>). The dialogue act annotations have been used to train an automatic classifier for EDUs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cadilhac et al., 2013)</ref>. This large annotation ef- fort was carried out by 4 annotators who had no special knowledge of linguistics, but who received training over 22 negotiation dialogues with 560 turns. Because annotating full discourse structures is a very complex task (using an exact match cri- terion of success, the inter annotator agreement score was a Kappa of 0.72 attachment on struc- tures, 0.58 on labelling (Afantenos et al., 2012a)), experts made several passes over the annotations from the naive annotators, improving the data and debugging it. The discourse graphs in our development cor- pus exhibited several interesting properties. First of all they are DAGs with a unique root, one unit that has no incoming edges. Secondly, the graphs are weakly connected in almost all cases: i.e., ev- ery discourse unit in it is connected to some other discourse unit. Thirdly, our graphs are reactive in the sense that speakers' contributions are reactions and attach anaphorically to prior contributions of other speakers. This means that edges between the contributions of different speakers are always ori- ented in one direction. This is a general feature of dialogue, as we explain in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dependency Structures</head><p>For a given discourse graph for SDRT of the form (V, E 1 , E 2 , ), we have as yet no general and re- liable method to calculate edges in E 2 ; and no such method has been presented in the literature. In order to perform constrained decoding over lo- cal probability distributions, we have opted for a strategy first presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muller et al. (2012)</ref> for SDRT. The strategy involves transforming hyper- graphs into dependency graphs. We transform our full graphs (V, E 1 , E 2 , ) into dependency struc-</p><note type="other">tures (V , E 1 , ), with V ⊂ V the set of EDUs in V by replacing any attachment to a CDU with an attachment to the CDU's head-the textually first EDU within the CDU which has no incoming links. Our transformation in effect sets E 2 in our general definition of a graph to ∅. In the case that we have a discourse relation between two EDUs, this relation is kept intact since it already repre- sents a dependency arc. In case a discourse rela- tion has one or two CDUs as arguments, the CDUs need to be replaced with their recursive head. In order to calculate the recursive head we identify all the DUs with no incoming links; if they are CDUs we recursively apply the algorithm until we get an EDU. If there is more than one EDU with no incoming links we pick the leftmost, i.e. the one firstly introduced in the text. Hirao et al. (2013) and Li et al. (2014) later fol- lowed a similar strategy for the creation of depen- dency structures for RST. Every single nucleus- satellite relation was transformed into a depen- dency relation with the governor being the EDU representing the nucleus</note><p>and the dependent be- ing the satellite. For relations between non-EDU higher spans, the recursive head was used. It is un- clear how <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al. (2014)</ref> deal with binary multi- nucleus relations like CONTRAST for example; it is not clear how to calculate the recursive head of the span. 1 In such cases an arbitrary decision- like always taking as the nucleus the leftmost or the rightmost span-has to be taken. In the SDRT annotations, however, every edge in the graph is already directed and so such arbitrary decisions can be avoided.</p><p>Ideally, what one then wants is to learn a func- tion h :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X E n → Y G</formula><p>where X E n is the domain of instances represent- ing a collection of EDUs for each dialogue and Y G is the set of all possible SDRT graphs. However, given the complexity of this task and the fact that it would require an amount of training data that we currently lack in the community, we aim at the more modest goal of learning a function</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h : X E 2 → Y R</formula><p>where the domain of instances X E 2 represents fea- tures for a pair of EDUs and Y R represents the set of SDRT relations. The upshot of this is that we are building a local sort of model that learns relations between individual EDUs with a certain probability but that it does not learn a local or even global structure. One of the drawbacks of this approach, how- ever, is that it does not guarantee an object that is well formed. Learning a probability distribution over EDUs and then choosing the most probable relation or attachment for each pair of EDUs po- tentially leads to structures that contain cycles. To avoid this, we can't blindly choose the most prob- able relation or attachment decision for each pair of EDUs. Instead, we should use this probability distribution as an input to a decoding mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Local probability distributions</head><p>We used a regularized maximum entropy (short- ened as MaxEnt) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berger et al., 1996</ref>). In MaxEnt, we estimate the parameters of an expo- nential model of the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (r|p) = 1 Z(c) exp m i=1 w i f i (p, r)</formula><p>where p represents the current pair of EDUs and r the learnt label (i.e. the type of relation, or a binary attachment value between the two EDUs). Each pair of EDUs p is encoded as a vector of m indicator features f i (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">table 2</ref> for more details). There is one weight/parameter w i for each feature f i that predicts its classification behavior. Finally, Z(c) is a normalization factor over the different class labels, which guarantees that the model out- puts probabilities. In MaxEnt, the values for the different parametersˆwparametersˆ parametersˆw are obtained by maximiz- ing the log-likelihood of the training data T with respect to the model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berger et al., 1996)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ˆ w = argmax w T i log P (r (i) |p (i) )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The turn constraint</head><p>Given our observations about the structure of di- alogues in our corpus, we hypothesize that a di- alogue is fundamentally sequential: first one per- son talks and then others react to them or ignore them, but the discourse links that do occur be- tween speaker turns are reactive. In other words, a turn can't be anaphorically and rhetorically de- pendent on a turn that comes after it. Thus, the nature of dialogue imposes an essential and im- portant constraint on the attachment process that is not present for monologue or single-authored text, where an EDU may be dependent upon any EDU, later in the ordering or not: in dialogue there are no "backwards" rhetorical links such that an EDU in turn n by speaker a is rhetorically and anaphor- ically dependent upon an EDU in turn n + m of speaker b with a = b. We call this the Turn Con- straint. Within a turn, however, just as in mono- logue (as is evident from a study of most styles of discourse annotations of text), backwards links are allowed. Given this observation, we decided to split our local model into two different ones. The first one concerns the learning of a model for intra-turn ut- terances, 2 while the second models inter-turn ut- terances. The intra-turn model considers as in- put during learning all pairs of EDUs (i, j) with i = j. The inter-turn model on the other hand does not contain any backward links during learn- ing. In other words it takes as input all pairs of EDUs (i, j) with i &lt; j. We apply the turn con- straint not only during learning of the local mod- els, but also during decoding. This practice is also followed-at the sentence level-for monologues <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Wellner and Pustejovsky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Joty et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Joty et al., 2013</ref>), though our turn constraint, we believe, is firmly supported not only by our data but also by a good theoretical model of dialogue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Decoders</head><p>The local probability distributions obtained are used as decoder inputs. We have experimented with several decoders. As a baseline measure we have included what we call a LOCAL decoder which creates a simple classifier out of the raw lo- cal probability distribution. In the case of MaxEnt, for example, this decoder selectsˆr</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">selectsˆ selectsˆr = argmax r 1 Z(c) exp m i=1 w i f i (p, r)</formula><p>with r representing a relation type or a binary at- tachment value. We also used the baseline LAST, where each EDU is attached to the immediately preceding EDU in the linear, textual order.</p><p>Maximum Spanning Trees To answer our questions, "how many non-tree-like structures are there?" and "how far can tree decoding algorithms get us in multi-party dialogue?", our first decoder is the classic Maximum Spanning Trees (MST) algorithm-used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McDonald et al. (2005)</ref> for syntactic dependency parsing as well as by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muller et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al. (2014)</ref> for discourse parsing-tweaking it in order to produce struc- tures that are closer to the ones specific to multi- party dialogue. We are looking for:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T * = argmax T a spanning tree of G e∈E(T )</formula><p>w <ref type="formula">(e)</ref> w(e) = log p(e)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 − p(e)</formula><p>G being the complete graph of possible edges returned by the classifiers ; E(D) representing the edges of D. The weight function w computes the log-odds of the probability returned by the model.</p><p>We used Chu-Liu-Edmonds version of the MST algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chu and Liu, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Edmonds, 1967)</ref>, which requires a specific node to be the root, i.e. a node without any incoming edges, of the initial complete graph. For each dialogue, we made an artificial node as the root with special dummy fea- tures. At the end of the procedure, this node points the real root of the discourse graph.</p><p>Combining intra-and inter-turn models with the turn constraint As described above, we learn a separate local model for intra-and inter- turn EDUs. We also use the turn constraint during decoding. For the intra-turn decoding, we have experimented with various options. One concerns the creation of a classifier out of the local prob- ability distribution. Another intra-turn decoder is Last, which always takes the last EDU for attach- ment. Finally we also used MST.</p><p>We used the exact same decoding approaches for inter-turn decoding. With the structure for the inter-turn EDUs produced separately, we replace those structures with their heads. The detection of a structure's head, be it intra-or inter-turn, uses the same trick as <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McDonald et al. (2005)</ref> did for syn- tactic parsing: inserting a dummy node as a fake head which contains only outgoing links enabling us essentially to learn the real head of our struc- tures. Our best overall model used Last to link EDUs inside the turn together with MST and the turn constraint for predicting the global structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>To train our local models, we extracted features for every pair of EDUs in a given dialogue.

In other words, training in- stances for the local models include only forward links.</p><p>We used two baselines. The first one, Last, sim- ply attaches every EDU to its previous one. This is a very strong baseline in discourse parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Muller et al., 2012</ref>, for example). The second baseline is essentially the local classifier without any fur- ther decoding; in other words, we simply select the class with the highest probability both for at- tachment and labeling. Attaching to last gives us an F-score of 0.584 for attachment and 0.391 when we add the relations as well. Using only classifica- tion from the local probability distribution without decoding gives 0.541 for attachment and 0.446 for attachments and relations.</p><p>The best results for the global parsing problem exploited the turn constraint both during learn- ing the local model and during decoding. Within a turn, our discourse structures are simple and largely linear; the best intra-turn results came from using Last. Most of our interlocutors did not create elaborate discourse structures with long-distance attachments within the same turn. The inter-turn level was a different story, as the figures show. For inter-turn and the global problem, MST us- ing the heads of the intra-turn substructures com- puted with Last, produced the best results. The F1 score for unlabeled structures is at 0.671 while for labelled structures we have 0.516. To enable a comparison with RST style parsing where ex- act arguments for discourse relations are not com- puted, the undirected attachment F1 score = 0.68 for the global parsing problem.</p><p>Despite the inherent difficulty of discourse pars- ing on multi-party chat dialogues (simultaneous, multiple discussion threads, lack of syntax) our re- sults are close to or better than the current state of the art for discourse parsing on monologue. There are two approaches currently that use dependency parsing strategies for discourse, thoroughly de- scribed in the next section. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al. (2014)</ref> report an accuracy of 0.7506 for unlabelled structures and 0.4309 for the full labelled structures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muller et al. (2012)</ref> report 0.662 for unlabelled structure and 0.361 for labelled structures. We outperform both systems for full labelled structures, and de- spite our non-tree-like structures beat or are close to these on unlabelled attachments. Though com- parisons across different corpora are difficult, the numbers suggest that our results are more than competitive. Our results also suggest that one can get quite far with tree-based decoding algorithms, though we know that in principle MST cannot do better than 91% even with a perfect local model (a model in which an arc is giving probability 1 just in case it occurs in the gold standard annotation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>To date, discourse parsing has almost exclu- sively been applied to monologue. Multi-party chat dialogues have never been considered be- fore. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baldridge and Lascarides (2005)</ref> predicted tree discourse structures for 2 party "directed" di- alogues from the Verbmobil corpus by training a PCFG that exploited the structure of the under- lying task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Elsner and Charniak (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Elsner and Charniak (2011)</ref> are presenting a combination of local coherence models initially provided for monologues showing that those models can satis- factorily model local coherence in chat dialogues. Nonetheless they do not present a full-fledged dis- course parsing model. Our data required a more open domain approach and a more sophisticated approach to structure.</p><p>Our use of dependency parsing for learning dis- course structure has a few antecedents in the litera- ture on monologue. One of the first papers to intro- duce this technique is <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muller et al. (2012)</ref>, work- ing with a small French language corpus, ANN- ODIS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Afantenos et al., 2012a</ref>). They use a simi- lar approach to us, including the classic version of the MST decoder. They also used an A * search as another decoding mechanism but it gave the same results as MST. As we have said, our results better theirs both on attachment and full labeled struc- tures. In the context of RST, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hirao et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al. (2014)</ref> transform RST trees into de- pendency structures; we have discussed their in section 4.1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al. (2014)</ref> use both the Eisner algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Eisner, 1996)</ref> as well as the MST algo- rithm from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McDonald et al. (2005)</ref>. As we men- tioned, our labelled scores are higher than theirs, though we are cautious of making comparisons across such different corpora.</p><p>Most work on discourse parsing focuses on the task of discourse relation labeling between pairs of discourse units-e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Marcu and</ref><ref type="bibr">Echihabi (2002) Sporleder and</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lin et al. (2009)</ref>. This corresponds to our local model. As we have shown in this paper, this setting makes an unwarranted assumption, as it assumes inde-  <ref type="table">Full Labelled Structure  prec  rec  F1  prec  rec  F1  prec  rec  F1</ref> LAST 0.602 0.566 0.584 0.602 0.566 0.584 0.403 0.379 0.391 LOCAL 0.698 0.488 0.574 0.623 0.478 0.541 0.513 0.  pendence of local attachment decisions. There is also work on discourse structure within a single sentence; e.g., Soricut and Marcu (2003) makes use of dynamic programming along with a stan- dard bottom-up chart parsing, while Sagae (2009) uses shift-reduce algorithm for intra-sentential dis- course analysis. Such approaches do not apply to our data, as most of the structure in our dialogues lies beyond the sentence level.</p><p>As for document-level discourse parsers, Subba and Di Eugenio (2009) use a transition-based ap- proach, following the paradigm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sagae (2009)</ref>. duVerle and Prendinger (2009) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hernault et al. (2010)</ref> both rely on locally greedy methods. Like us, they treat attachment prediction and re- lation label prediction as independent problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Feng and Hirst (2012)</ref> extend this approach by additional feature engineering but is restricted to sentence-level parsing. Finally, <ref type="bibr">Joty et al. (2012)</ref> present a sentence-level discourse parser that uses Conditional Random Fields to capture label inter- dependencies and chart parsing for decoding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Joty et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Joty et al. (2015)</ref> extend this ap- proach on the level of documents and have the best results non-dependency based discourse parsing, with an F1 of 0.689 on unlabelled structures and 0.5587 on labelled structures. Our scores are very close to Joty et al.'s, however, and achieved with much simpler methods than theirs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>As far as we know, this is the first paper to deal with discourse parsing in multi-party chat dia- logues. We believe that such data will be useful for other discourse parsing tasks like analyzing fora with multi-threads. We have used the STAC cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Afantenos et al., 2012b</ref>) for our data. To sim- plify the parsing task, we transformed our SDRT structures into dependency ones. We used two different local probability distribution models as input to several decoding mechanisms, including one based on the Maximum Spanning Tree al- gorithm, and an enhanced version of it in order to produce structures closer to the ones we ob- serve. We obtain the best results using the en- hanced version of the MST algorithm. In future work, we plan to investigate ILP constraints in greater depth to develop a plausible alternative to MST on DAGs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Example of interleaved threads</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> What&apos;s so special about multi party dialogue? Multi-party dialogue or multi-party chat involves multiple interlocutors that may address one or more interlocutors during their turn. For example,</note>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Although Li et al. (2014) do explain how to treat nary multinuclear relations, following others (Hernault et al., 2010, for example).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> EDUs are considered as belonging to the same turn if they are by the same speaker without any interjection from an other speaker. In other words any consecutive EDU by the same speaker is considered as belonging to the same turn.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> We use a number of lexicons (opinion markers, quantifiers, etc.), each corresponding to a feature 4 Provided by the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline (Manning et al., 2014). 5 The prediction model of Cadilhac et al. (2013) generates EDU tags such as Offer, Refusal, etc.</note>
