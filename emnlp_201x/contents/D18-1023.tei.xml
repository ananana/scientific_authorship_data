				<p>We construct a multilingual common semantic space based on distributional semantics, where words from multiple languages are projected into a shared space via which all available resources and knowledge can be shared across multiple languages. Beyond word alignment, we introduce multiple cluster-level alignments and enforce the word clusters to be consistently distributed across multiple languages. We exploit three signals for clustering: (1) neighbor words in the monolingual word embedding space; (2) character-level information ; and (3) linguistic properties (e.g., appo-sition, locative suffix) derived from linguistic structure knowledge bases available for thousands of languages. We introduce a new cluster-consistent correlational neural network to construct the common semantic space by aligning words as well as clusters. Intrinsic evaluation on monolingual and multilingual QVEC tasks shows our approach achieves significantly higher correlation with linguistic features which are extracted from manually crafted lexical resources than state-of-the-art multilingual embedding learning methods do. Using low-resource language name tagging as a case study for extrinsic evaluation, our approach achieves up to 14.6% absolute F-score gain over the state of the art on cross-lingual direct transfer. Our approach is also shown to be robust even when the size of bilingual dictionary is small. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>More than 3,000 languages have electronic record, e.g., at least a portion of the Christian Bible had been translated into 2,508 different languages. However, the training data for mainstream natu- ral language processing (NLP) tasks such as Infor- mation Extraction (IE) and Machine Translation <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The resources and programs are available for research purpose: https://github.com/wilburOne/CommonSpace/ (MT) is only available for dozens of dominant lan- guages. In this paper we aim to construct a mul- tilingual common semantic space where words in multiple languages are mapped into a distributed, language-agnostic semantic continuous space, so that resources and knowledge can be shared across languages.</p><p>Previous multilingual embedding methods align the semantic distributions of words from multi- ple languages within the common semantic space. Though several recent attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Artetxe et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Artetxe et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Conneau et al., 2017</ref>) have shown that it is possible to extract multilingual word embed- ding from a pair of potentially unaligned corpora in multiple languages, we claim that it is necessary to impose more constraints to preserve linguistic properties and facilitate downstream NLP tasks, such as cross-lingual IE, and MT. We find that words also can be clustered through explicit (e.g., sharing affixes of certain linguistic functions) or implicit clues (e.g., sharing neighbors from mono- lingual word embedding) and such clusters should also be consistent across multiple languages. To do so, we design a new algorithm, called cluster- consistent multilingual word embedding, that ex- tracts multilingual word embedding vectors which preserve the natural clustering structures of words across multiple languages.</p><p>We propose to create clusters through three kinds of signals as follows, without any extra hu- man annotation effort. Then we aggregate the em- bedding vectors of words in each cluster and en- sure that the clusters (or the words therein) are consistent across multiple languages.</p><p>Neighbor based clustering and alignment. We build our common space based on correla- tional neural network (CorrNet) which is an ex- tension of autoencoder framework by enabling cross-lingual reconstruction. In contrast to previ- ous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chandar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rajendran et al., 2015)</ref>, we extend CorrNet to neighbor-consistent correlation network by using each word's neigh- bors (the nearest words within monolingual se- mantic space) to ensure that the cross-lingual map- ping from and to the common semantic space is lo- cally smooth. For instance, the neighboring words of China in English (Japan, India and Taiwan) should be close to the neighboring words of Cina in Italian (Beijing, Korea, Japan) in the common semantic space. In other words, we encourage the consistency of neighborhoods across multiple lan- guages.</p><p>Character based clustering and alignment. Many related languages share very similar char- acter set, and many words that refer to the same concept share similar compositional characters or patterns, e.g., China (English), Kina (Danish), and Cina (Italian).</p><p>Linguistic property based clustering and alignment. Many languages also share linguistic properties, e.g., apposition, conjunction, and plu- ral suffix (English (-s / -es), Turkish (-lar / -ler), Somali (-o)). Linguists have created a wide variety of linguistic property knowledge bases, which are readily available for thousands of languages. For example, the CLDR (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository) 2 includes closed word classes and affixes indicating various linguistic properties. We propose to take advantage of these language- universal resources to create clusters, where the words within one cluster share the same linguis- tic property, and build alignment between clusters for common semantic space construction.</p><p>We evaluate our approach on monolingual and multilingual QVEC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tsvetkov et al., 2015</ref>) tasks, which measure the quality of word embeddings based on the alignment of the embeddings to lin- guistic feature vectors extracted from manually crafted linguistic resources, as well as an extrinsic evaluation on name tagging for low-resource lan- guages. Experiments demonstrate that our frame- work is effective at capturing linguistic proper- ties and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-lingual embedding learning methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Multilingual word embeddings have advanced many multilingual NLP tasks, such as machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mikolov et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madhyastha and España-Bonet, 2017</ref>), de-pendency parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2016a)</ref>, and name tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tsai and Roth, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cheung et al.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhang et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Feng et al., 2017)</ref>. Using bilingual aligned words, previ- ous methods project multiple monolingual embed- dings into a shared semantic space using linear mappings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mikolov et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rothe et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baroni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Xing et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Smith et al., 2017)</ref> or canonical cor- relation analysis (CCA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ammar et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Faruqui and Dyer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lu et al., 2015)</ref>. Com- pared with CCA, which only optimizes the corre- lation for each individual pair of languages, lin- ear mapping based methods can jointly optimize all the languages in the common semantic space. We focus on learning linear mappings to construct the common semantic space and adopt correla- tional neural networks (CorrNet) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chandar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rajendran et al., 2015</ref>) as the basic model. In contrast to previous work which only exploited monolingual word semantics, we introduce mul- tiple cluster-level alignments and design a new cluster consistent CorrNet to align both words and clusters.</p><p>Another branch of approaches for multilingual word embeddings are based on parallel or compa- rable data, such as parallel sentences (AP <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chandar et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gouws et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Luong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermann and Blunsom, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schwenk et al., 2017)</ref>, phrase translations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Duong et al., 2016)</ref> and comparable documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Vulic and Moens, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, to reduce the need of bilingual alignment, several approaches have been designed to learn cross-lingual embeddings based on a small seed dictionary <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Vulic and Korhonen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Artetxe et al., 2017)</ref>, or even with no supervision <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017d,c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Conneau et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Artetxe et al., 2018)</ref>. However, such methods are still limited to bilingual word embedding learning and remaining to be explored for common semantic space con- struction.</p></div>

In each monolingual semantic space, the words within solid rectangle denote a neighbor based cluster and the words within dotted rectangle denote a linguistic property based cluster.</p><p>word-level, we build a neighborhood-consistent CorrNet to augment word representations with neighbor based clusters and align them in the common semantic space.

Finally, we con- struct clusters based on linguistic properties, in- cluding closed word classes and affixes, and align them in the common semantic space. We jointly optimize for all the alignments in the common se- mantic space for each pair of languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Basic Model</head><p>We briefly describe the basic model for learning the common semantic space: correlational neural networks (CorrNets) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chandar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rajendran et al., 2015)</ref>. It combines the advantages of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and autoen- coder (AE).</p><p>Given the bilingual aligned word pairs between two languages l 1 and l 2 , we first use their mono- lingual word embeddings to initialize each word with a vector and obtain M l 1 ∈ R |V l 1 |×d l 1 and M l 2 ∈ R |V l 2 |×d l 2 , where V l 1 and V l 2 are the bilin- gual dictionary of l 1 and l 2 . V i l 1 is the translation of V i l 2</p><p>, and d l 1 and d l 2 are the vector dimensionali- ties. Then for each language we learn a linear pro- jection function to project M l 1 and M l 2 into the common semantic space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H l 1 = σ(M l 1 · W l 1 + b l 1 ) , H l 2 = σ(M l 2 · W l 2 + b l 2 ) ,</formula><p>where H l 1 ∈ R |V l 1 |×h and H l 2 ∈ R |V l 2 |×h are the vector representations for V l 1 and V l 2 in the com- mon semantic space respectively. h is the vec- tor dimensionality in the shared semantic space.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W l 1 ∈ R d l 1 ×h and W l 2 ∈ R d l 2 ×h</formula><p>are the transfor- mation matrices, and b l 1 and b l 2 are the bias vec- tors. σ denotes Sigmoid function.</p><p>After we project the monolingual embeddings into the common semantic space, we further re- construct M l 1 and M l 2 from H l 1 and H l 2 sepa- rately:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M l 1 = σ(H l 1 · W l 1 + b l 1 ) , M * l 1 = σ(H l 2 · W l 1 + b l 1 ) , M l 2 = σ(H l 2 · W l 2 + b l 2 ) , M * l 2 = σ(H l 1 · W l 2 + b l 2 ) , where b l 1 , b l 2</formula><p>are the bias vectors. M To learn the common semantic representations, we minimize the distance between the aligned word vectors as well as the loss of monolingual and cross-lingual reconstruction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">O W = {l i ,l j }∈A L(M l i , M l i ) + L(M * l i , M l i ) + L(M l j , M l j ) + L(M * l j , M l j ) + L(H l i , H l j ) ,</formula><p>where l denotes any language that we want to project into the common semantic space, A de- notes all bilingual dictionaries, and L denotes a similarity metric. In our work, we use cosine sim- ilarity as the similarity metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Neighborhood-Consistent CorrNet</head><p>CorrNet can project multiple monolingual word embeddings into a common semantic space using bilingual word alignment. However, the same con- cepts may have different semantic bias in various languages. For example, the top five nearest words of the concept "China" are: (Japan, India, Taiwan, Chinese, Asia) in English, (Cosco, Shenzhen, Aus- tralian, Shanghai, manufacturing) in Danish, and (Beijing, Korea, Japan, aluminum, copper) in Ital- ian respectively. In order to ensure the consistency of the neighborhoods within the common seman- tic space and make the cross-lingual mapping lo- cally smooth, we propose to augment monolingual word representation with its top-N nearest neigh- boring words from the original monolingual se- mantic space. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Given the monolingual embeddings of the bilin- gual aligned words for two languages l 1 and l 2 , M l 1 and M l 2 , for each word, we extract the top-N nearest neighbors and construct the neighborhood clusters. Each cluster t l = {w 1 , w 2 , ..., w |t l | } in language l is represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">c t l = 1 |t l | w∈t l E w ,</formula><p>where E w denotes the monolingual word embed- ding for w.</p><p>We obtain all the neighborhood cluster vector representations C l 1 , C l 2 for l 1 and l 2 . We incorpo- rate the neighborhood cluster information into the common semantic space when projecting mono- lingual embeddings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">H l 1 = σ(M l 1 · W l 1 + C l 1 · U l 1 + b l 1 ), H l 2 = σ(M l 2 · W l 2 + C l 2 · U l 2 + b l 2 ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Besides the monolingual and cross-lingual re- constructions for M l 1 and M l 2 in CorrNets, we also add monolingual and cross-lingual recon- structions for the neighborhood clusters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C l 1 = σ(H l 1 · U l 1 + b * l 1 ) , C * l 1 = σ(H l 2 · U l 1 + b * l 1 ) , C l 2 = σ(H l 2 · U l 2 + b * l 2 ) ,</formula><p>3 We set N = 10 in our experiments since it performed best on the intrinsic evaluation among {2, 5, 10, 20, 50}.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C * l 2 = σ(H l 1 · U l 2 + b * l 2 ) ,</formula><p>In addition to optimizing the loss functions de- scribed in the Section 3.2, we further optimize the monolingual and cross-lingual reconstruction for neighborhood clusters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">O N = {l i ,l j }∈A L(C l i , C l i ) + L(C * l i , C l i ) + L(C l j , C l j ) + L(C * l j , C l j ) ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Character-Level Word Alignment</head><p>Bilingual word alignment is not always enough or available to induce a common semantic space, es- pecially for low-resource languages. Although the words that refer to the same concept are not ex- actly the same in multiple languages, they often share a set of similar characters, especially in re- lated languages written in the same script. For example, the same entity is spelled slightly dif- ferently in three languages: Semsettin Gunaltay in English, S ¸emsettin Günaltay in Turkish, and Semsetin Ganoltey in Somali. Beyond word-level alignment, we introduce character-level alignment by composing word representations from its com- positional characters using convolutional neural networks (CNN). For each language, we adopt a language-independent CNN to generate character- level word representation. Character Lookup Embeddings Let S l be the character set for language l and E S l ∈ R |S l |×d be the character lookup embeddings, where d is the dimensionality of each character embedding. Here, we use a simple yet effective method to induce character embeddings from word embed- dings <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . For each character c, we initialize its em- bedding by averaging the embeddings of all words which contain the character. The character embed- dings will be further tuned by the model. Character-Level CNN ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kim et al., 2016</ref>) The input layer is a sequence of characters of length k for each word. Each character is represented by a d-dimensional lookup embedding. Thus each in- put sequence is represented as a feature map of dimensionality d × k.</p><p>We use the convolution layer to learn the repre- sentation for each sliding n-gram characters. We make p i as the concatenated embeddings of n con- tinuous columns from the input matrix, where n is the filter width. We then apply the convolution weights W ∈ R d×nd to p i with a biased vector b ∈ R d , i.e., p i = tanh(W · p i + b). All n-gram representations p i are used to generate the word representation y by max-pooling.</p><p>In our experiments, we apply multiple filters with various widths to obtain the representation for word w l i . The final character-level word repre- sentationˆwsentationˆ sentationˆw l i is the concatenation of all word rep- resentations with varying filter widths. Cross-lingual Mapping Given the bilingual aligned word pairs, we directly minimize the dis- tance of the character-level word representations in the common semantic space by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">O char = {l i ,l j }∈A L( ˆ W char l i , ˆ W char l j )</formula><p>The final word representation of w l i in the common semantic space is the concatenation of character-level word presentationˆwpresentationˆ presentationˆw l i and projected word representation h l i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Linguistic Property Alignment</head><p>Linguists have made great efforts at building lin- guistic property knowledge bases for thousands of languages in the world. These knowledge bases include a large number of topological properties (phonological, lexical and grammatical) which we will use to build a high-level alignment between words across languages. We exploit the following resources:</p><p>• CLDR (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository) 5 which includes multilingual gazetteers for months, weekdays, cardinal and ordinal numbers;</p><p>• Wiktionary 6 which is a multilingual, web- based collaborative project to create an En- glish content dictionary, includes word and prefix/suffix dictionaries for 1,247 languages;</p><p>• Panlex 7 database which contains 1.1 billion pairwise translations among 21 million ex- pressions in about 10,000 language varieties.</p><p>We mainly exploit two types of linguistic prop- erties to extract word clusters. The first type is language-independent closed word classes, such as colors, weekdays, and months. properties. These properties tend to be consistent across many languages. For example, "-like" is a suffix denoting "similar to" in English, while in Danish "-agtig" performs the same function. Wik- tionary and Panlex include the affix alignments be- tween English and any other languages. We fil- tered out the many-to-many affix alignments and obtained hundreds of alignments between each language and English. For each affix, we derive a set of word pairs (basic word, extended word with affix) by first selecting all the word pairs where ba- sic word + affix = extended word, then ranking all word pairs based on the cosine similarity of their monolingual word embedding. Finally we select the top ranked 20 word pairs to form the cluster for each affix. We extract a set of word clusters from each lan- guage, and align the clusters based on their func- tions defined in CLDR, Wiktionary and Panlex. For each language l, each cluster r l i ∈ R l con- tains a set of words or word-pairs sharing the same function. We use the average operation to obtain an overall vector representation for each cluster M R l . 8 Then, we project the cluster-level vectors into the shared semantic space and minimize the distance between them:  </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H R l i = σ(M R l i · W l i + b R l i ) , H R l j = σ(M R l j · W l j + b R l j ) , Parameter</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">O R = {l i ,l j }∈A L(H R l i , H R l j ) ,</formula><p>where W is the same as the W used in Sec- tion 3.3 for each language. We finally optimize the sum of the losses by finding the parameters</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">θ = {W l , b l , b l , U l , b * l , CNN l , b R l },</formula><p>where l de- notes a specific language:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">O θ = O W + O N + O char + O R</formula></div>

For each word, each dimension of its linguistic feature vector defines the proba- bility of that word belongs to a supersense (e.g., NN.FOOD) which is summarized from Word- Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>QVEC is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">QVEC = max j a ij ≤1 D i=1 P j=1 r(x i , s j ) × a ij ,</formula><p>where x ∈ R D×1 denotes a distributional word vector and s ∈ R P ×1 denotes a linguistic word vector. D and P denote the sizes of vectors re- spectively. a ij = 1 iff x i is aligned to s j , other- wise a ij = 0. r(x i , s j ) is the Pearson's correlation between x i and s j . QVEC-CCA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ammar et al., 2016b</ref>) is extended from QVEC by using CCA to measure the correlation between the distributional matrix and the linguistic vector matrix, instead of cumulative dimension-wise correlation.  As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>, our approaches outper- form previous approaches in almost all cases <ref type="bibr">13</ref> . Specifically, by augmenting word representation with neighboring words in the common semantic space as in Eq. (1), the performance for mono- lingual and multilingual QVEC and QVEC-CCA tasks is consistently improved. In addition, by aligning character-level compositional representa- tions and linguistic property based clusters in the shared semantic space, the monolingual and multi- lingual representation quality is further improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Impact of Bilingual Dictionary Size</head><p>In order to show the impact of the size of bilingual lexicons, we use three languages as a case study, and gradually reduce the size of the lexicons for each pair of languages from 40,000 to 10,000 and further to 2,000, 1,000, 500 and 250. For follow- ing experiments, we use MultiCluster and Multi- CCA as baselines <ref type="bibr">14</ref> . <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> shows the results. We observe that both MultiCCA and CorrNet ap- proaches are sensitive to the size of the bilingual lexicons. Our approach on the other hand can maintain high performance, even when the size of bilingual lexicons is reduced to 250. The per- formances of MultiCluster based on various sizes of bilingual dictionary are close because it jointly trains the embedding of multiple languages from scratch and by default takes advantage of identical strings among all the languages. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We conduct paired t-test between CorrNet W+N+Ch+L and all the other models on 10 randomly sampled subsets. The differences are all statistically significant while all p- values are less than 0.05 <ref type="bibr">14</ref> MultiSkip requires parallel corpora to train cross-lingual embeddings while the original implementation of MultiCross is not public.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Low-Resource Name Tagging</head><p>We evaluate the quality of multilingual embed- dings on a downstream task by using the embed- dings as input features. Here, we use low-resource language name tagging as a target task, which aims to automatically identify and named entities from text and classify them into certain types, in- cluding Person (PER), Location (LOC), Organiza- tion (ORG), and Geo-Political Entities (GPE). We experiment with two sets of languages. The first set Amh+Tig consists of Amharic and Tigrinya. Both languages share the same Ge'ez script and descend from the proto-Semitic language fam- ily. The other set Eng+Uig+Tur consists of one high-resource language (English), one medium- resource language (Turkish) and one low-resource language (Uighur). It also consists of two distinct language scripts: English and Turkish use Latin script while Uighur uses Arabic script.</p><p>We use an LSTM-CRF architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Huang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lample et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ma and Hovy, 2016)</ref> for name tagging. It takes only word em- bedding as input and predict a tag for each word. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> shows the statistics of training, develop- ment, and test sets for each language released by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). <ref type="bibr">15</ref> For each language pair, we combine the bilingual aligned words extracted from Wiktionary and monolingual dictionaries based on identical strings. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We eval- uate the quality from several aspects: <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The annotations are from: Amh (LDC2016E87), Tig (LDC2017E27), Uig (LDC2016E70), Tur (LDC2014E115), Eng <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003)</ref>. We combined these corpora with Wikipedia dump to train word embeddings with Word2Vec toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mikolov et al., 2013a</ref>   Monolingual embedding quality evaluation <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref> shows the name tagging performance for each language using the original monolingual em- beddings and multilingual embeddings. For all languages, the multilingual embeddings learned from our approach significantly outperform those learned from MultiCCA and MultiCluster, which shows the effectiveness of our approach. More importantly, the multilingual embeddings learned from our approach also outperform original mono- lingual embeddings, which demonstrates that by projecting multiple languages into one common space, the monolingual embedding quality can be further improved.</p><p>Cross-lingual direct transfer In this setting, we train a name tagger on one or two languages using multilingual embeddings and test it on a new lan- guage without any annotated data.  approach achieves better performance than Mul- tiCCA and MultiCluster. The closer that the lan- guages are, such as Amharic and Tigrinya, the bet- ter performance is achieved. Cross-lingual mutual enhancement We finally show the improvement by adding more cross- lingual annotated data and also using multilingual embeddings in   tated set from other languages (e.g., Uig+Tur or Eng+Uig+Tur) doesn't necessarily result in im- provement. This is partially due to the use of Ara- bic script in Uighur, which differs from Turkish and English. Thus we suggest to project closely related languages using the same script into the common semantic space. We take Turkish name tagging as a case study to show the benefit of the common semantic space with extra English annotations. The monolingual model failed to identify Belgrad´da as a geopoliti- cal entity (GPE) because it doesn't occur in Turk- ish training data. However, by adding English an- notations, the tagger successfully tags it as a GPE since it's semantically close to Belgrade in the common semantic space according to their charac- ter level compositional embeddings and Belgrade is frequently tagged as GPE in English annota- tions. In another example, using Turkish annota- tions only, Kraliyet Donanması´na is mistakenly tagged as a GPE since it's following da and all entity mentions following da in Turkish annota- tions are annotated as GPE. After adding English annotations into training, it is correctly tagged as an ORG because da is well aligned with in in the common semantic space according to the linguis- tic property alignment between Turkish and En- glish, and many entity mentions following in are annotated as ORG in English annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We construct a common semantic space for multi- ple languages based on a cluster-consistent corre- lational neural network. It combines word-level alignment and multi-level cluster alignment, in- cluding neighbor based clusters, character-level compositional word representations, and linguistic property based clusters induced from the readily available language-universal linguistic knowledge bases. Our approach achieved significantly higher performance than state-of-the-art multilingual em- bedding learning methods through both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. In the future, we will further extend our approach to multi-lingual multi- media common semantic space construction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>l 1 and M l 2 are the monolingual reconstructions of M l 1 and M l 2 from the common space, and M * l 1 and M * l 2 are cross-lingual reconstructions.
