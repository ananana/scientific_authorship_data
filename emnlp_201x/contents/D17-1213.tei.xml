			<abstract>
				<p>Most studies on human editing focus merely on syntactic revision operations, failing to capture the intentions behind revision changes, which are essential for facilitating the single and collaborative writing process. In this work, we develop in collaboration with Wikipedia editors a 13-category taxonomy of the semantic intention behind edits in Wikipedia articles. Using labeled article edits, we build a computational classifier of intentions that achieved a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.621. We use this model to investigate edit intention effectiveness: how different types of edits predict the retention of newcomers and changes in the quality of articles, two key concerns for Wikipedia today. Our analysis shows that the types of edits that users make in their first session predict their subsequent survival as Wikipedia editors, and articles in different stages need different types of edits.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many online text production communities, in- cluding Wikipedia, maintain a history of revi- sions made by millions of participants. As Wikipedia statistics as of January 2017 show, English Wikipedia has 5.3 million articles with an average of 162.89 revisions per article, with revisions growing at a rate of about 2 revisions per second. This provides an amazing corpus for studying the types and effectiveness of revisions. Specifically, differences between revisions contain valuable information for modeling document qual- ity or extracting users' expertise, and can addition- ally support various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentence compression , lexical simplification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yatskar et al., 2010)</ref>, information retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aji et al., 2010)</ref>, textual entailment recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010</ref>), language bias de- tection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Recasens et al., 2013)</ref>, spelling errors and paraphrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Zesch, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Max and Wisniewski, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>To avoid building different approaches to ex- tract the information needed by different NLP tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferschke et al., 2013</ref>), a unified framework to recognize edits from revisions is needed. Prior research on revision editing primarily develop syntactic edit action categories, from which they try to understand the effects of edits on meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Faigley and Witte, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Daxenberger and Gurevych (2012)</ref> categorized edits based on whether edits affect the text meaning, resulting in syntactic edit categories such as file deletion, reference modification, etc. However, simply understanding the syntactic re- vision operation types does not provide the in- formation we seek: why do editors do what they do? how effective are their actions? For exam- ple, syntactic edit type taxonomies cannot tell the difference between simplifying a paragraph and maliciously damaging that paragraph, since both involve deleting a sentence.</p><p>In this work, we focus explicitly on revision intention. We introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of the reasons why an author in Wikipedia made an edit. Example edit intentions include copy editing, elaboration, verification, and simplifica- tion. Compared to taxonomies that either focus on low-level syntactic operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Faigley and Witte, 1981)</ref> or that mix syntactic and seman- tic classes ), a clean higher-level semantic categorization enables us to easily identify textual meaning changes, and to connect revisions to "what happens in the mind of the revising author during the revision" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fitzgerald, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daxenberger, 2016)</ref>. In order to capture the meaning behind edits, we worked with 13 Wikipedians to build a taxonomy that captured the meaning of an revision, which we term edit intention, and hand-labeled a corpus of 7,177 revisions with their edit intentions. We then developed an automated method to identify these edit intentions from differences between revisions of Wikipedia articles. To explore the utility of this taxonomy, we applied this model to better un- derstand two important issues for Wikipedia: new editor retention and article quality. Specifically, we examined whether edit intentions in newcom- ers' first editing sessions predict their retention, and examined how edits with different intentions lead to changes in article quality. These analyses showed that specific types of editing work were positively correlated with newcomer survival and articles in different stages of development bene- fited differently from different types of edits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Wikipedia revision histories have been used for a wide range of NLP tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aji et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ganter and Strube, 2009;</ref>). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yatskar et al. (2010)</ref> used Wikipedia comments associated with revi- sions to collect relevant edits for sentence simpli- fication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Max and Wisniewski (2010)</ref> constructed a corpus of rewritings that can be used for spelling errors and paraphrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Zesch, 2012)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti (2010)</ref> used edits as training data for textual entailment recognition, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Recasens et al. (2013)</ref> analyzed real instances of human edits designed to remove bias from Wikipedia articles. Most of these work employed manually defined rules or filters to collect relevant edits to the NLP task at hand.</p><p>Towards analyzing revisions and developing unified revision taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bronner and Monz, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liu and Ram, 2011</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fong and Biuk-Aghai (2010)</ref> built machine learning models to distin- guish between factual and fluency edits in revi- sion histories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Faigley and Witte (1981)</ref> made a distinction between changes that affect mean- ing, called text-base changes and changes which do not affect meaning, called surface changes. The two categories are further divided into for- mal changes, meaning-preserving changes, micro- structure changes and macro-structure changes.</p><p>This taxonomy was later extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jones (2008)</ref> to take into account edit categories such as signif- icant deletion, style, image insertion, revert, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pfeil et al. (2006)</ref> proposed a 13-category tax- onomy based on the data and performed manual annotation to compare cultural differences in the writing process in different versions of Wikipedia.  introduced a finer-grained edit taxonomy, and performed multi-label classification to extract edit categories based on unparsed source text <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2012)</ref>. However, most taxonomies of edit categories contain only syntactic actions or a mixture of syntactic and semantic actions, failing to capturing the intention of revisions.</p><p>In terms of revision intentions, Zhang and Litman (2016) incorporated both argumentative writing features and surface changes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Faigley and Witte (1981)</ref> and constructed eight categories of revision purposes, such as claims/ideas, war- rant/reasoning/backing, rebuttal/reservation, orga- nization, clarify, etc. Tan and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lee (2014)</ref> used revisions to understand statement strength in aca- demic writings. There are multiple works on the detection of specific subsets of revision intentions in Wikipedia, such as vandalism detection where the goal is to classify revisions as vandalized or non-vandalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Harpalani et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adler et al., 2011</ref>) and language bias/neutral point of view detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Recasens et al., 2013</ref>). Instead of recognizing a specific type of revision intention each time, our work aims at designing a systematic and comprehensive edit intention taxonomy to capture intentions behind textual changes.</p><p>Prior work also used edit types and intentions to better understand the process of collaborative writing, such as article quality improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kittur and Kraut, 2008)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liu and Ram (2011)</ref> found that Wikipedia article quality corre- lates with different types of contributors; similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang et al. (2016)</ref> pointed out articles in differ- ent quality stages need different types of editors. However, there are few studies examining the specific types of edits that are predictive of article quality. Recent research shows that the number of active contributors in Wikipedia has been steadily declining since <ref type="bibr">2007, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Halfaker et al.

In this paper, we take advantage of this new taxonomy to explore correlations between edit intentions, newcomers' retention, and article quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Semantic Taxonomy of Edit Intentions</head><p>A revision is created whenever an editor saves changes to a Wikipedia page. As one revi- sion could contain multiple local changes, each revision can be labeled with one or more edit intentions, representing the purposes of why an editor made that change. Different from prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daxenberger, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang et al., 2016</ref>), we do not distinguish between revisions and edits.</p><p>Although an edit is a coherent local change and might belong to any edit categories, it cannot be used to represent the intentions of editors during the revision. For example, it might be difficult to recognize Refactoring if only one single edit is present. Since relocation or reorganization might involve several changes in the article, looking at one might lose the whole picture and lead to infor- mation loss. Moreover, edit types simply extracted from an edit is inadequate in outlining the correct intentions, for instance, adding a sentence could be Clarification, Elaboration, or Vandalism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Taxonomy of Edit Intentions</head><p>Our semantic taxonomy of edit intentions builds on prior literature on collaborative writing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Faigley and Witte, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fitzgerald, 1987)</ref>, re- search on document revision analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bronner and Monz, 2012)</ref>, studies on edit categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fong and BiukAghai, 2010)</ref>, and work on purpose/intention clas- sification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhang and Litman, 2016)</ref>. In order to ensure that our taxonomy captured the intentions that Wikipedians would find meaningful, we set up discussions with a group of 12 interested editors on a Wikipedia project talk page, and iteratively refined our taxonomy based on their feedback. Our discussion with Wikipedia editors is in this page <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . We also analyzed which intentions get more confused with which and used that to guide the refinement. We define a top level layer for the revision intention taxonomy: intentions that are common in general revisions: General Revision Inten- tions, and intentions that are specific in Wikipedia: Wikipedia Specific Intentions. This categoriza- tion leads to 13 distinct semantic intentions, and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides detailed descriptions. Specifi- cally, general revision intentions include: Clar- ification, Copy Editing, Elaboration, Fact Up- date, Point of View, Refactoring, Simplification and verification, and can be applicable to other contexts. Counter Vandalism, Disambiguation, Process, Vandalism, and Wikification are edit in- tentions related to Wikipeida. We also propose an Other category, intended for edits that cannot be labeled using the above taxonomy.</p><p>As the first work to model intentions of revi- sions, our taxonomy distills and extends existing edit type taxonomies. For instance, our intentions of "elaboration" and "verification" are extensions of "evidence" type proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Zhang and Litman, 2016)</ref>, and a syntactic category of "infor- mation deletion" in  could be an instance of our "vandalism" or "simplification" depending on the context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Corpus Construction</head><p>To construct a reliable, hand-coded dataset to serve as ground truth for automatic recognition of edit intentions, we employed four undergraduate students who had basic Wikipedia editing experi- ence to label edits using our intention taxonomy, based on written annotation guidelines 2 vetted by Wikipedia editors and provided examples 3 . More- over, to expose annotators to more working knowl- edge of Wikipedia, we provided three one-hour training sessions where annotators were asked to label a small set of revisions (around 50 each time) and to discuss their disagreements until consensus.</p><p>We randomly sampled 5,000 revisions from Jan, 2016 to June 2016 from the recent changes table <ref type="bibr">4</ref> in the Wikipedia database. For each revision, we displayed the content difference 5 before and after the change to annotators, via a labeling interface that we developed. Because an editor could make several different types of edits within a single revision, we asked four RAs to label each revision with one or more of the possible semantic intentions. We collected four valid annotations for 4,977 revisions. We used Cronbach's α, a mea- sure of internal consistency, to evaluate agreement among the annotators. The overall agreement α score was 0.782, indicating substantial agreement between different annotators; The rule of thumb 1993 suggests that Cronbachs alpha scores larger than 0.7 are considered as acceptable. The inter- annotator agreement per semantic intention is de- scribed in column α in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Corpus Expansion</head><p>As shown in column Before in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, some types of edit intentions, such as disambiguation and clarification, were very rare in the random-sample corpus. To address this under-representation prob- lem, we used the text of editors' comments to expand the corpus by retrieving 200 more revi- sions for each edit intention except Vandalism and Counter-Vandalism, resulting in 2,200 revisions 6 . More precisely, as a common practice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Recasens et al., 2013)</ref>, we utilized regular expressions to match the text from the comments, which editors often wrote when saving their revisions, to the edit intentions. For example, editors might be signalling that they were intending to fix problems of Point of View when their comments contained keywords such as "npov" or "neutral". Even though the com- ments sometimes signal the editors' intents, they are not infallible, editors may fail to complete the comment field, may only label one of the multiple edit intentions for a single revision, or write comments that are inaccurate, irrelevant, or incomplete. Thus the first author annotated the 2,200 revisions from the expanded corpus and merged it with the randomly sampled corpus. The frequency of the edit intentions before and after the expansion is in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We used the majority voting to resolve the disagreement. That is, if at least 3 out of 4 annotators picked an intention for a revision, it will be selected as the ground-truth. The final corpus contains 5,777 revisions, and can be downloaded from here 7 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Identification of Edit Intentions</head><p>We frame automated identification of edit inten- tions as a multi-label classification task. We designed four sets of features for identifying edit intentions from revisions. Set I comprised two features associated with the Editor: user registra- tion indicating whether the editor of a particular revision was registered or anonymous and tenure, which refers to the elapsed months between the current revision and editors' registration date. Set II comprised 16 features associated with the Com- ment written by the editor to describe the revision, including comment length and a set of regular expressions to match intentions such as *pov*, *clarify*, *simplif*, *add link*, etc. Set III comprised 198 features associated with the Revision Diff, based on content differences between current revision and the previous one. They are similar to textual features defined in Dax- enberger and Gurevych (2013), but we considered a wider range of objects being modified. In par- ticular, we computed the difference in the number of characters, uppercase words, numeric chars, white-spaces, markups, Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters, HTML entity characters, URLs, punc- tuations, break characters, etc. We also considered languages features, such as the use of stop words, obscene words and informal words. Set IV com- prises two features associated with Vandalism and Revert. We utilized the Wikipedia API to extract whether a revision was likely to be vandalism 8 or reverting revisions 9 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Identification Result</head><p>We extracted the input features with the help of Revision Scoring package 10 and framed this task a multi-label classification problem. For multi- label classification, we considered solving them by using single-label classification algorithms and by transforming it into one or more single-label classification tasks. We used the multi-label clas- sifiers implemented in Mulan ( <ref type="bibr">Tsoumakas et al., 2011</ref>), with 10-fold cross validation. We utilized Binary Relevance (BR) to convert our multi-label classification into 13 binary single-label problems. Similar to ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang et al. (2016)</ref>, we used Random k-labelsets RAKEL method that randomly chooses l small subset with k categories from the overall set of categories. We set l as 26, twice the size of the categories, and set k as 3. MLKNN method that classifies edit intentions based on K (K=10) nearest neighbor method. We used C4.5 decision tree classifiers in BR and RAKEL, as recommended by prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Potthast et al., 2013</ref>). Prior research shows that sophisticated neural network models for text-classification largely rely on fac- tors such as dataset size ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Joulin et al., 2016)</ref>. Due to the size of our corpus and the complexity of this task, we did not use them.</p><p>To evaluate the relative accuracy of the multi- label classifier, we compared it to several base- lines. The random baseline, denoted as Random in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, assigns labels randomly. The majority category baseline, denoted as Majority, assigns all edits the most frequent intention, elaboration. Since revision comments may be especially as informative in reflecting edit intentions, the com- ment baseline, denoted as CMT, is a Binary Rele- vance classifier that includes only the comments features from Set II. We also created a Binary Relevance classifier, denoted as BR-, which ex- cludes comment features and only used features from Sets I, III and IV. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the evaluation metrics for the baselines and our multi-label classifiers. The metrics include the Exact Match subset accuracy, which evaluates whether the predicted labels are the same as the actual labels. These classifiers are available upon request.   which evaluates how many times the top ranked predicted intention is not in the set of true labels of the instance. Results show that the Binary Relevance (BR) and MLKNN classifiers, which used all our constructed features, outperformed Random and Majority baselines.</p><p>Moreover, the BR and MLKNN methods show relatively similar best performances. Although multiple studies have utilized revisions' comments as "groundtruth" to collect desired edits, the CMT method, which includes only comment features, is less accurate than either the BR or MLKNN models. Note that predicting 14-category semantic intentions is more challenging compared to classifying low- level syntactic actions, such as inserting an image ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Intentions, Survival and Quality</head><p>The automated measurement of edit intentions provides a general framework to analyze revi- sions and can facilitate a wide range of applica- tions, such as collecting specific types of revisions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yatskar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Recasens et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010)</ref> and outlining the evolution of author roles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arazy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>. In this section, we demonstrate two examples of how this intention taxonomy can be applied to better understand the success of online collaboration communities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kraut et al., 2010)</ref>, specifically the process of these sites to retain new contributors and create innovative products. To this end, we first investigate what newcomers are intended for in their first sessions and whether their edit intentions can account for their survival in Wikipedia. We then examine how edits carry- ing on different intentions at distinct times in an article's history influence changes in its quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">How Edit Intentions Affect Survival</head><p>To explore newcomers' intentions during their first experience editing articles, we focus on users' first edit sessions in Wikipedia. Here, Edit Session is defined as a sequence of edits performed by a registered user with less than one hour's time gap between two adjacent edits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Halfaker et al., 2012</ref>). We then compare edit intentions of newcomers who survive -Survivors, and newcomers who do not -Non-survivors. Here, newcomers are defined as surviving if they performed an edit at  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The edit intention distribution in the first sessions (Intention Dist) and the revert ratio comparison (Revert Ratio), among non-survivors (NS) and survivors (SS). The numbers are bolded if 1-way ANOVA tests for difference between two groups are significant, with p&lt;0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Edit Intention</head><p>least two months after their first edit session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Intention Comparison</head><p>Among 100,000 randomly sampled Wikipedia users, 21,096 made revisions in the Main/Article namespace during their first editing session. Among these 4,407 were survivors (i.e., made an edit two months after registering) and 16,689 were non-survivors. We applied our edit intention model to 53,248 revisions in users' first sessions, and compared the percentages of different types of edit intentions between survivors and non- survivors, as shown in Intention Dist column in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We also performed 1-way ANOVA to test whether survivors and non-survivors have the same mean for each edit intention. We ob- served that, survivors tend to do more copy-editing (∆ + =2.3%) and more wikification (∆ + =6.5%), while non-survivors seem to perform more sim- plification and vandalism, which might provide signals for detecting vandals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Revert Analysis</head><p>To explore the relationship between rejection of contributions and newcomer retention, we also visualized the revert ratios of different types of edit intentions for survivors and non-survivors in their  first session. Here, Revert refers to whether an edit from the author was reverted or completely removed by another user, and we detect reverts using MediaWiki Reverts library <ref type="bibr">11</ref> . We then mea- sured the revert ratio for each edit intention by calculating the percentage of revisions belonging to a specific edit intention, among all reverted revisions in users' first sessions. As shown in the Revert Ratio column in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, in general, non- survivors get reverted more compared to survivors, across all edit intentions. Interestingly, non- survivors compared to survivors get reverted more when performing Wikification, verification and Refactoring, suggesting that sophisticated types of work might not be suitable for beginners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Newcomer Survival</head><p>As a further exploration of the relationship be- tween edit intentions and newcomer survival, we performed a logistic regression using edits in sur- vivors' and non-survivors' first sessions. To han- dle this imbalanced data (i.e., many more negative examples than positive examples in training), we performed majority-class under-sampling to make this dataset balanced. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Halfaker et al. (2012)</ref>, we controlled the number of revisions completed during the first session (a proxy for an editor's initial investment), and the number of revisions reverted in their first sessions. We described the regression coefficients of statisti- cally significant edit intentions in the Survival column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. This logistic model achieves an Accuracy of 60.98%, Recall of 58.30%, Precision of 78.08% and F1-score of 66.76%. Editing articles for the purposes of Process, Verification and Wikification significantly predict the survival of newcomers, while performing vandalism is a strong negative predictor for survival.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">How Intentions Affect Article Quality</head><p>Although there are over 5.5 million articles in the English Wikipedia, fewer than 0.2% have been evaluated by Wikipedians as good articles and around 92% have been evaluated as start or stub class articles, Wikipedia's two lowest quality categories. In this section, we examine how edits with different intentions at distinct times in an article's history influence changes in its quality. This task is framed as a prediction task, i.e. us- ing edits' intentions and a set of control variables to predict changes in article quality. We borrowed a Article Quality Prediction Dataset released in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang et al. (2016)</ref>, which consists of the quality ratings collected in January and June, 2015 of 151,452 articles. We collected 1,623,446 revisions made to these articles between January and June 2015, by randomly sampling 10% revisions that were made to these articles during that time pe- riods. Specifically, the outcome article quality change is calculated by subtracting the previous quality score from the end quality score. The con- trol variables include the previous article quality score, the total number of edits, the total number of editors, the changed bytes to an article, and the total number of edits to the article talk page during the six months. To construct edit-intention predictors, we summed the number of edits for each edit intention during the six months divided by the total number of revisions in this article.</p><p>Results of the linear regression model, shown in Quality Changes column of Table 4, show that our constructed regression model is significantly predictive of article quality changes (R 2 = 0.225). The results show that, keeping all control variables fixed, more Copy Editing, Elaboration, Refac- toring and Verification are positively associated with improvements in article quality; in contrast, Vandalism, Counter Vandalism, Disambiguation, Process and Simplification predict declines in arti- cle quality. The first four of these edits types often occur with reducing the article content, removing or redirecting pages. Improper use of them might be detrimental to article quality.</p><p>To determine if the effect of edit intentions on quality changes depends upon the initial quality of the article, we added the interaction terms between the previous quality score and edit percentages of different intentions (e.g., clarification x previous quality), and visualized interaction effects in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 2</ref>. When examining the interaction terms in more detail: the negative slope of copy editing (when prev=2) suggests that, as articles increase in quality, copy editing is needed less. We found similar trends for interactions between previous quality and elaboration and verification, which are essential for articles in the starting stages. In contrast, the positive slopes for simplification, wikification and process suggest that, as articles increase in quality, simplifying articles' content, adding proper links or reorganizing their structure becomes more important. Overall, these results reveal that different types of edit intentions are needed at different quality stages of articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we proposed 13 semantic inten- tions that motivate editors' revisions in English Wikipedia. Example edit intentions include copy editing, elaboration, simplification, etc. Based in a labeled corpus of revisions, we developed machine-learning models to automatically identify these edit intentions. We then examine the rela- tions between edit intentions, newcomers survival, and article quality improvement. We found that (1) survivors tend to do more copy editing and wikification; non-survivors seem to perform more vandalism and other sophisticated types of work, and the latter often gets reverted more; (2) Differ- ent types of contributions are needed by articles in different quality stages, with elaboration and verification are needed more for articles in the starting stages, and simplification and process be- come more important as article quality increases.</p><p>Our proposed edit intention taxonomy and the constructed corpus can facilitate a set of down- stream NLP applications. First, classifiers based on this intention taxonomy can help retrieve large scale and high quality revisions around simpli- fication, neutral point of view or copy editing, which provides amazing corpora for studying lex- ical simplification, language bias detection and paraphrases. Second, as we showed in Section 5.2, determining how different edit types influence changes in articles is of great use to better the causes of quality variance in collaborative writing, such as detecting quality flaws ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderka et al., 2012)</ref> and providing insights on which specific aspects of an article needs improvement and what type of work should be performed. The ability to identify the need for editing, and specifically the types of editing work required, can greatly assist not only collaborative writing but also individual improvement of text. Moreover, even though our edit taxonomy is for English Wikipedia, it can be applied to other language versions of Wikipedia. We are now deploying the same edit intention taxonomy for Italian Wikipedia, and plan to apply it to other low resourced languages in Wikipedia. Finally, beyond the context of Wikipedia, similar taxonomies can be designed for analyzing the collaboration and interaction happened in other online contexts such as academic writing (e.g., Google Docs or ShareLatex, etc).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The relative frequency of each edit intention, and its F1 score provided by the BR model.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="6,72.00,226.63,453.54,137.14" type="bitmap" /></figure>
