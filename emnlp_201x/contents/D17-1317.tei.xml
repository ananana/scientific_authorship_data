			<abstract>
				<p>We present an analytic study on the language of news media in the context of political fact-checking and fake news detection. We compare the language of real news with that of satire, hoaxes, and propaganda to find linguistic characteristics of untrustworthy text. To probe the feasibility of automatic political fact-checking, we also present a case study based on PolitiFact.com using their factuality judgments on a 6-point scale. Experiments show that while media fact-checking remains to be an open research question, stylistic cues can help determine the truthfulness of text.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Words in news media and political discourse have a considerable power in shaping people's beliefs and opinions. As a result, their truthfulness is of- ten compromised to maximize impact. Recently, fake news has captured worldwide interest, and the number of organized efforts dedicated solely to fact-checking has almost tripled since 2014. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Organizations, such as PolitiFact.com, actively in- vestigate and rate the veracity of comments made by public figures, journalists, and organizations. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows example quotes rated for truth- fulness by PolitiFact. Per their analysis, one com- ponent of the two statements' ratings is the mis- leading phrasing (bolded in green in the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>. For instance, in the first example, the statement is true as stated, though only because the speaker hedged their meaning with the quantifier just. In the second example, two correlated events -Brexit Figure 1: Example statements rated by PolitiFact as mostly true and mostly false. Misleading phras- ing -bolded in green -was one reason for the in- between ratings.</p><p>and Google search trends -are presented ambigu- ously as if they were directly linked.</p><p>Importantly, like above examples, most fact- checked statements on PolitiFact are rated as nei- ther entirely true nor entirely false. Analysis in- dicates that falsehoods often arise from subtle dif- ferences in phrasing rather than outright fabrica- tion ( <ref type="bibr">Rubin et al., 2015</ref>). Compared to most prior work on deception literature that focused on bi- nary categorization of truth and deception, politi- cal fact-checking poses a new challenge as it in- volves a graded notion of truthfulness.</p><p>While political fact-checking generally focuses on examining the accuracy of a single quoted statement by a public figure, the reliability of gen- eral news stories is also a concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Connolly et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Perrott, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> illustrates news types categorized along two dimensions: the intent of the authors (desire to deceive) and the content of the articles (true, mixed, false). In this paper, we present an analytic study char- acterizing the language of political quotes and news media written with varying intents and de- grees of truth. We also investigate graded de- ception detection, determining the truthfulness on a 6-point scale using the political fact-checking database available at PolitiFact. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Fake News Analysis</head><p>News Corpus with Varying Reliability To an- alyze linguistic patterns across different types of articles, we sampled standard trusted news articles from the English Gigaword corpus and crawled ar- ticles from seven different unreliable news sites of differing types. • Satire: mimics real news but still cues the reader that it is not meant to be taken seriously • Hoax: convinces readers of the validity of a paranoia-fueled story • Propaganda: misleads readers so that they be- lieve a particular political/social agenda Unlike hoaxes and propaganda, satire is intended to be notably different from real news so that audi- ences will recognize the humorous intent. Hoaxes and satire are more likely to invent stories, while propaganda frequently combines truths, false- hoods, and ambiguities to confound readers.</p><p>To characterize differences between news types, we applied various lexical resources to trusted and fake news articles. We draw lexical resources from prior works in communication theory and stylistic analysis in computational linguistics. We tokenize  the text with NLTK ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bird et al., 2009</ref>) and com- pute per-document count for each lexicon, and re- port averages per article of each type. First among these lexicons is the Linguistic In- quiry and Word Count (LIWC), a lexicon widely used in social science studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pennebaker et al., 2015</ref>). In addition, we estimate the use of strongly and weakly subjective words with a sentiment lex- icon ( <ref type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2005</ref>). Subjective words can be used to dramatize or sensationalize a news story. We also use lexicons for hedging from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hyland, 2015)</ref> because hedging can indicate vague, ob- scuring language. Lastly, we introduce intensi- fying lexicons that we crawled from Wiktionary based on a hypothesis that fake news articles try to enliven stories to attract readers. We compiled five lists from Wiktionary of words that imply a de- gree a dramatization (comparatives, superlatives, action adverbs, manner adverbs, and modal ad- verbs) and measured their presence.</p><p>Discussion <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarizes the ratio of av- erages between unreliable news and truthful news for a handful of the measured features. Ratios greater than one denote features more prominent in fake news, and ratios less than one denote fea- tures more prominent in truthful news. The ratios between unreliable/reliable news reported are sta- tistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) with Welsch t-test after Bonferroni correction.</p><p>Our results show that first-person and second- person pronouns are used more in less reliable or deceptive news types. This contrasts studies in other domains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Newman et al., 2003)</ref>, which found fewer self-references in people telling lies about their personal opinions. Unlike that do- main, news writers are trying to appear indifferent. Editors at trustworthy sources are possibly more   <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Linguistic features and their relationship with fake news. The ratio refers to how frequently it appears in fake news articles compared to the trusted ones. We list linguistic phenomena more pronounced in the fake news first, and then those that appear less in the fake news. Examples illustrate sample texts from news articles containing the lexicon words. All reported ratios are statistically significant. The last column (MAX) lists compares which type of fake news most prominently used words from that lexicon (P = propaganda, S = satire, H = hoax) rigorous about removing language that seems too personal, which is one reason why this result dif- fers from other lie detection domains. This find- ing instead corroborates previous work in written domains found by Ott et al. (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rayson et al. (2001)</ref>, who found that such pronouns were indicative of imaginative writing. Perhaps imagi- native storytelling domains is a closer match to de- tecting unreliable news than lie detection on opin- ions.</p><p>Our results also show that words that can be used to exaggerate -subjectives, superlatives, and modal adverbs -are all used more by fake news. Words used to offer concrete figures -compara- tives, money, and numbers -appear more in truth- ful news. This also builds on previous findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ott et al. (2011)</ref> on the difference between superla- tive/comparative usage.</p><p>Trusted sources are more likely to use assertive words and less likely to use hedging words, in- dicating that they are less vague about describing events, as well. This relates to psychology the- ories ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Buller and Burgoon, 1996</ref>) that deceivers show more "uncertainty and vagueness" and "in- direct forms of expression". Similarly, the trusted sources use the hear category words more often, possibly indicating that they are citing primary sources more often.</p><p>The last column in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the fake news type that uses the corresponding lexicon most prominently. We found that one distinctive fea- ture of satire compared to other types of untrusted news is its prominent use of adverbs. Hoax sto- ries tend to use fewer superlatives and compara- tives. In contrast, compared to other types of fake news, propaganda uses relatively more assertive verbs and superlatives.</p><p>News Reliability Prediction We study the fea- sibility of predicting the reliability of the news article into four categories: trusted, satire, hoax, or propaganda. We split our collected articles into balanced training (20k total articles from the Onion, American News, The Activist, and the Gi- gaword news excluding 'APW', 'WPB' sources) and test sets (3k articles from the remaining sources). Because articles in the training and test set come from different sources, the models must classify articles without relying on author-specific cues. We also use 20% of the training articles as an in-domain development set. We trained a Max-Entropy classifier with L2 regularization on n-gram tf-idf feature vectors (up to trigrams). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The model achieves F1 scores of 65% on the out-of-domain test set <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. This is a promis- ing result as it is much higher than random, but still leaves room for improvement compared to the Data Sources</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random MaxEnt</head><p>Dev in-domain 0.26 0.91 Test out-of-domain 0.26 0.65 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: F1 scores of 4-way classification of news reliability.</p><p>performance on the development set consisting of articles from in-domain sources. We examined the 50 highest weighted n-gram features in the MaxEnt classifier for each class. The highest weighted n-grams for trusted news were often specific places (e.g., "washington") or times ("on monday"). Many of the high- est weighted from satire were vaguely facetious hearsay ("reportedly", "confirmed"). For hoax articles, heavily weighted features included di- visive topics ("liberals", "trump") and dramatic cues ("breaking"). Heavily weighted features for propaganda tend towards abstract generali- ties ("truth", "freedom") as well as specific issues ("vaccines", "syria"). Interestingly, "youtube" and "video" are highly weighted for the propaganda and hoax classes respectively; indicating that they often rely on video clips as sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Predicting Truthfulness</head><p>Politifact Data Related to the issue of identify- ing the truthfulness of a news article is the fact- checking of individual statements made by public figures. Misleading statements can also have a va- riety of intents and levels of reliability depending on whom is making the statement.</p><p>PolitiFact 5 is a site led by Tampa Bay Times journalists who actively fact-check suspicious statements. One unique quality of PolitiFact is that each quote is evaluated on a 6-point scale of truth- fulness ranging from "True" (factual) to "Pants- on-Fire False" (absurdly false). This scale allows for distinction between categories like mostly true (the facts are correct but presented in an incom- plete manner) or mostly false (the facts are not cor- rect but are connected to a small kernel of truth).</p><p>We collected labelled statements from Poli- tiFact and its spin-off sites <ref type="bibr">(PunditFact, etc.</ref>  in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. Most statements are labeled as neither completely true nor false. We formulate a fine-grained truthfulness pre- diction task with Politifact data. We split quotes into training/development/test set of {2575, 712, 1074} statements, respectively, so that all of each speaker's quotes are in a single set. Given a state- ment, the model returns a rating for how reliable the statement is (Politifact ratings are used as gold labels). We ran the experiment in two settings, one considering all 6 classes and the other considering only 2 (treating the top three truthful ratings as true and the lower three as false).</p><p>Model We trained an LSTM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>) that takes the sequence of words as the input and predicts the Politifact rating. We also compared this model with Maxi- mum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Naive Bayes models, frequently used for text categorization.</p><p>For input to the MaxEnt and Naive Bayes mod- els, we tried two variants: one with the word tf- idf vectors as input, and one with the LIWC mea- surements concatenated to the tf-idf vectors. For the LSTM model, we used word sequences as in- put and also a version where LSTM output is con- catenated with LIWC feature vectors before un- dergoing the activation layer. The LSTM word embeddings are initialized with 100-dim embed- dings from GLOVE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) and fine-tuned during training. The LSTM was im- plemented with Theano and Keras with 300-dim hidden state and a batch size of 64. Training was done with ADAM to minimize categorical cross- entropy loss over 10 epochs.</p><p>Classifier Results <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> summarizes the per- formance on the development set. We report macro averaged F1 score in all tables. The LSTM outperforms the other models when only using text as input; however the other two models improve substantially with adding LIWC features, particu-   larly in the case of the multinomial naive Bayes model. In contrast, the LIWC features do not im- prove the neural model much, indicating that some of this lexical information is perhaps redundant to what the model was already learning from text.</p><p>We report results on the test set in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref>. We again find that LIWC features improves MaxEnt and NB models to perform similarly to the LSTM model. As in the dev. set results, the LIWC fea- tures do not improve the LSTM's performance, and even seem to hurt the performance slightly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>Deception Detection Psycholinguistic work in interpersonal deception theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Buller and Burgoon, 1996</ref>) has postulated that certain speech pat- terns can be signs of a speaker trying to purpose- fully obscure the truth. Hedge words and other vague qualifiers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Choi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Recasens et al., 2013)</ref>, for example, may add indirectness to a statement that obscures its meaning.</p><p>Linguistic aspects deception detection has been well-studied in a variety of NLP applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ott et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jindal and Liu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Girlea et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2004</ref>). In these applications, people purposefully tell lies to receive an extrinsic payoff. In our study, we compare varying types of unreliable news source, created with differing intents and levels of veracity.</p><p>Fact-Checking and Fake News There is re- search in political science exploring how effective fact-checking is at improving people's awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lord et al., 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thorson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Nyhan and Reifler, 2015)</ref>. Prior computational works <ref type="bibr">(Vlachos and Riedel, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ciampaglia et al., 2015</ref>) have proposed fact-checking through entailment from knowledge bases. Our work takes a more lin- guistic approach, performing lexical analysis over varying types of falsehood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biyani et al. (2016)</ref> examine the unique linguis- tic styles found in clickbait articles, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kumar et al. (2016)</ref> also characterize hoax documents on Wikipedia. The differentiation between these fake news types is also proposed in previous work <ref type="bibr">(Rubin et al., 2015)</ref>. Our paper extends this work by offering a quantitative study of linguistic differ- ences found in articles of different types of fake news, and build predictive models for graded de- ception across multiple domains -PolitiFact and news articles. More recent work ( <ref type="bibr">Wang, 2017)</ref> has also investigated PolitiFact data though they inves- tigated meta-data features for prediction whereas our investigation is focused on linguistic analysis through stylistic lexicons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We examine truthfulness and its contributing lin- guistic attributes across multiple domains e.g., on- line news sources and public statements. We per- form multiple prediction tasks on fact-checked statements of varying levels of truth (graded de- ception) as well as a deeper linguistic compari- son of differing types of fake news e.g., propa- ganda, satire and hoaxes. We have shown that fact- checking is indeed a challenging task but that var- ious lexical features can contribute to our under- standing of the differences between more reliable and less reliable digital news sources.</p></div>
