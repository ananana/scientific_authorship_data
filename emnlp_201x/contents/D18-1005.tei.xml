			<abstract>
				<p>Gang-involved youth in cities such as Chicago have increasingly turned to social media to post about their experiences and intents online. In some situations, when they experience the loss of a loved one, their online expression of emotion may evolve into aggression towards rival gangs and ultimately into real-world violence. In this paper, we present a novel system for detecting Aggression and Loss in social media. Our system features the use of domain-specific resources automatically derived from a large unlabeled corpus, and contextual representations of the emotional and semantic content of the user&apos;s recent tweets as well as their interactions with other users. Incorporating context in our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) leads to a significant improvement.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In cities such as Chicago, gang-involved youth have increasingly turned to social media to post about their experience, often expressing grief when friends or family members are shot and killed. As grief turns to anger, their posts turn to retribution and ultimately to plans for revenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Patton et al., 2018b</ref>). Research in this space has shown that on- line posts often affect life in the real world <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Moule et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Patton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pyrooz et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Patton et al., , 2017a</ref>). In some communities, violence outreach workers manually scour online spaces to identify such possibilities and intervene to diffuse situations. A tool that identifies Aggres- sion or Loss posts could help them filter irrelevant posts, but resources to develop a tool like this are scarce.</p><p>In this paper, we present automatic approaches for constructing resources and context features in this domain, and apply them to detecting Aggres- sion and Loss in the social media posts of gang- involved youth in Chicago. We exploit both a small labeled dataset (4,936 posts) and a much larger unlabeled dataset (approximately 1 million posts), which we constructed using a method that enabled us to gather Twitter posts representative of the com- munity we study. We incorporate our approaches into a CNN system, as well as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to match the architecture of prior work, thus enabling analysis of the impact in differ- ent frameworks <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</p><p>Key features of our system are the use of domain- specific word embeddings and a lexicon automat- ically induced from our unlabeled dataset. When classifying an individual tweet, our system consid- ers the content and emotional impact of the tweets in the author's recent history. If applicable, our sys- tem additionally takes into account a model of the pairwise interactions between the author and other users in the tweet referenced via either retweet or mention.</p><p>We compare our approaches with previous work that used a smaller dataset (800 tweets) and hand- curated resources with an SVM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blevins et al., 2016)</ref>. By integrating our induced domain-specific and context information in a CNN, we achieve a significant increase over their reported results.</p><p>Our contributions include:</p><p>• A new labeled dataset, six times larger than that of prior work;</p><p>• Domain-specific resources, automatically in- duced from our constructed unlabeled dataset;</p><p>• Context features that capture semantic and emotion content in the user's recent posts as well as their interactions with other users in the dataset.</p><p>Our approach brings us one step closer to build- ing a useful tool that can help reduce gang violence in urban neighborhoods. In the remainder of the paper, we present related work, the dataset that we used, and our methodology. We conclude with an error analysis and a discussion of the impact of our contributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Researchers have begun to explore how online data can be used to help prevent gun violence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pavlick et al. 2016</ref> are creating the Gun Violence Data Base by crowdsourcing annotations on newspaper articles that report on gun violence, labeling the sections of text that report on incidents, the shooter, and the victim. Researchers have also explored identifying deaths from police shootings with semi- supervised methods for both CNNs and logistic regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Keith et al., 2017)</ref> and found that logis- tic regression using a soft-labeling approach gave the best results. Researchers studying gun control issues analyzed social media for posts related to any issue around guns in the year following the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Benton et al., 2016)</ref> and argued that online media can be used to understand trends in gun violence and gun-related behaviors ( .</p><p>Closely related research aims to automatically identify gang members' Twitter profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balasuriya et al., 2016)</ref>. After collecting profiles using bootstrapping, they trained different classifiers on the tweets and meta-information about the authors. Further research analyzes the social networks of gangs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Radil et al., 2010)</ref> and predicts gang affil- iation based on the analysis of graffiti style fea- tures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Piergallini et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>The most relevant work in automatically analyz- ing social media posts by gang-involved youth is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blevins et al. 2016</ref>. The labeled dataset that Blevins and collaborators used is extremely challenging, in part due to its size, but also because it contains text in a particular dialect of English - African American English (AAE) -which has very little core NLP tool support. Other research investi- gating the development of tools for understanding AAE in social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blodgett et al., 2016)</ref> shows that existing tools (e.g., dependency parsers) per- form poorly on this language. Previous work by Patton on a subset of our dataset notes that due to the linguistic style, tweets from gang-involved youth in Chicago can be challenging for outsiders to interpret and thus are often open to misinterpre- tation and potential criminalization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Patton et al., 2017b)</ref>.</p><p>The challenges of interpreting our data are fur- ther compounded by the usual difficulties with Twit- ter data. Twitter data is sometimes handled by translating it to Standard American English (SAE) through the use of a phrasebook. The NoSlang Slang Translator <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(NoSlang, 2018b)</ref>, and the accom- panying NoSlang Drug Slang Translator <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(NoSlang, 2018a)</ref>, have been used in other tasks to translate social media communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sarker et al., 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Han and Baldwin, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>To engineer features for an SVM classifier, Blevins et al. 2016 learned a part-of-speech (POS) tagger for their data and constructed a word level translation phrasebook to map emojis and slang to the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) in order to identify their emotion.</p><p>In contrast to Blevins' translation approach, we leverage our large unlabeled dataset to auto- matically induce resources, such as word embed- dings, that function well within the domain of our task. Previous research on domain-specific word embeddings includes work in cybersecurity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roy et al., 2017)</ref>, disease surveillance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ghosh et al., 2016)</ref>, and construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tixier et al., 2016</ref>). These domain-specific word embeddings tend to improve performance on tasks within that domain.</p><p>Context has been used in previous research on detecting hate speech in social media. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Qian et al. 2018</ref> found significant improvements by collecting the entire history of a user's tweets and feeding them to a encoder to create an intra-user represen- tation, which was used as input to a Bidirectional LSTM. They also used a representation of tweets similar to the tweet being classified. While their ap- proach captures a user profile based on everything the user has posted, in our approach we investigate how the recent history of tweets and interactions with others can improve classification. Others also make use of a user profile, though not one learned from unlabeled data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dadvar et al., 2013)</ref>. ditional Twitter users in the same demographic, annotated by social work researchers who have been studying Gakirah and the associated Chicago gangs. Second, we use a much larger collection of approximately one million unlabeled tweets auto- matically scraped from 279 users in the same so- cial network. This social network is comprised of 214 users snowball-sampled from Gakirah Barnes' top 14 communicators. Traditionally, snowball sampling has been used to recruit hard-to-reach research subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson and Flint, 2001</ref>) and we have adapted it for social media. The remaining 65 users were added to this network by retaining those with the highest IQI score 2 from the full list of Gakirah's Twitter followers. Our tweets thus form a representative sample of Twitter dialogue between youth from Chicago neighborhoods with high levels of gang activity during that time period.</p><p>The social work researchers performed a de- tailed, qualitative analysis of a subset of the dataset, with a focus on analyzing how context influences determination of a label. For example, they note that an aggressive tweet may reference a previous event, and will often use coded language to do so. Since much of the language used in our data differs significantly from standard American En- glish, local youth active in similar environments served as consultants to answer questions about the language, as they were able to interpret the slang terms present in these tweets. The social work re- searchers conducted a fine-grained analysis using an online tool for annotation, identifying insults, threats, bragging, hypervigilance and challenges to authority, all of which were collapsed into a sin- gle category, Aggression. Posts including distress, sadness, loneliness and death were collapsed into the category Loss. The Other category includes discussion of other aspects of their life, such as friendships, relationships, drugs, general conver- sations, and happiness. We developed our system (as did <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blevins et al. 2016</ref>) on the collapsed la- bels, as the task is difficult even with three-way categorization.</p><p>Each tweet in a subset of the entire dataset con- sisting of 3,000 tweets was reviewed by two differ- ent annotators. Inter-rater reliability between raters was tracked, with dissimilar annotations flagged for further review. Flagged tweets were further analyzed by the social work researchers, which in- 2 https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/ uploads/2016/06/isis_twitter_census_ berger_morgan.pdf In order to mitigate potential issues with training and test data being drawn from different time peri- ods or having different distributions of labels, we shuffled our data and drew stratified samples with equal distribution across classes for our training, validation, and test sets for each of the cross vali- dation folds, using 64%, 16%, and 20% of our data for each respectively. The Aggression and Loss classes are relatively small, reflecting their low dis- tribution in real life: we have only 329 Aggression tweets and 734 Loss tweets, with the Other class comprising the remaining 3,873 tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methods</head><p>We approach this classification task using a stan- dard CNN classifier architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Collobert et al., 2011</ref>) as our starting point. We initially experimented with both character and word level CNNs but found the word level to be 1.6 macro-F1 points better than the character level, so we only include the word level here. We leveraged the unlabeled corpora by constructing domain-specific embeddings and a lexicon that better fit our unique and low-resource domain. We then integrated our domain-specific resources into the CNN to repre- sent the given tweet as well as to represent context features. Our context features represent a window of the user's recent tweets as well as the interac- tions of the author with other users via references in their tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Domain-Specific Resources</head><p>We exploited the large unlabeled corpus to build two domain-specific resources for this task: word embeddings and a task-specific lexicon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Word Embeddings</head><p>Word embeddings have proven useful in represent- ing the semantic content of sentences. The seman- tic representation of a word by its associated em- bedding, however, depends on its usage in the cor- pus the embedding was trained on, and so off-the- shelf word embeddings do not always adapt well to tasks with a unique domain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roy et al., 2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ghosh et al., 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tixier et al., 2016</ref>). Thus, we were motivated to use our unlabeled corpus to create domain-specific word embeddings. We used the Word2Vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) CBOW model to train the embeddings which is the default training algorithm available in Gensim <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . We used a window size of 5 words with a minimum word count of 5 to train w ∈ R 300 . The CBOW model was trained for 20 epochs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Computing a Lexicon of Aggression and Loss</head><p>Given the domain-specific nature of our users' lan- guage, we could not rely on standard NLP lexicons to represent emotion in their tweets. For our task, the two emotions of interest are Aggression and Loss. Previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blevins et al., 2016</ref>) used a phrasebook to translate the domain-specific words of their corpus to Standard American English so that they could access emotion in the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Whissell, 2009)</ref>, but this approach does not generalize to capture new words.</p><p>We therefore adapted the SENTPROP algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016</ref>) to automatically induce a lexicon of Aggression and Loss from our unlabeled corpus. The SENTPROP algorithm constructs a lexical graph out of the word embeddings, then propagates labels from the seed sets over the un- labeled nodes via a random walk method. The resulting output for each word indicates the proba- bility of a random walk from the seed set landing on that node. We chose SENTPROP as an induc- tion method because it performs especially well for domain-specific corpora, and it is resource-light and interpretable.</p><p>We created word embeddings by employing an SVD-based method that was reported by the SENT- PROP authors to perform optimally with their algo- rithm. We first constructed the positive point-wise mutual information matrix, M P P M I , over the unla- beled corpus, then computed singular value decom- position (SVD) to derive M P P M I = U ΣV . The word embedding for word w i was thus given by U i , truncated to a standard length of dimension 300. To construct our seed sets, we asked our annotators to consider words for Loss and Aggression which they associated most strongly with each class. They generated a set of 29 words for Aggression and a set of 40 words for Loss, which we include in our appendix.</p><p>We ran SENTPROP with our SVD-based em- beddings and the seed sets from our annotators. We used the output probabilities from the random walks to map words to their association with Ag- gression and Loss, thus forming our lexicon of Aggression and Loss. Finally, we scaled the proba- bilities per class to mean 0 and variance 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Context Features</head><p>Our context features utilize the domain-specific re- sources that we induced from the unlabeled corpora. To capture context, we first considered the author's recent history, separately exploring representations by our domain-specific word embeddings and by the SENTPROP lexicon (SPLex). If applicable, we also considered the interactions between the author and other users who were referenced in the tweet, either via retweet or mention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">User History</head><p>To obtain the user's recent history, we ordered all the tweets chronologically and bucketed them by author. Thus, for any given tweet occurring at time t, a t , we were able to retrieve previous tweets a t−1 , a t−2 , . . . by that user. We treated recent his- tory as a sliding window and fetched tweets within the past d days from when the current tweet was tweeted, such that recent history tweets would be the set {a t−1 , . . . , a t−k }, where t − k &lt; d.</p><p>To represent the tweets within the context of recent history, we first combined word level rep- resentations into tweet level, then tweet level rep-</p><note type="other">resentations into context level. At each stage of combination, we tried both summing and averag- ing. Thus, our recent history representations were built by aggregating either word embeddings or SPLex scores, which maintained their dimensional- ity of 300 or 2, respectively. We also considered three types of tweets that would be relevant to a user. The user's own tweets (SELF) would always be relevant; we ex- perimented with also including tweets where the user was retweeted (RETWEET) and tweets where the user was mentioned (MENTION). We included these parameters as additional sources of context because a user's tweet may be a response to a recent mention or retweet from another user.</note><p>We also experimented with weighting the most recent tweets more heavily than further tweets within the recent history window. This became especially important when we experimented with larger windows of a month or more, since tweets from a few days ago are more likely to be related to the current tweet than tweets from a few weeks ago. To model this diminishing relevance, we intro- duced a weighting protocol with a variable half-life where weights decay exponentially over time. The parameter we tuned was the half-life ratio r, which is the proportion of the window size d that cor- responds to the window's half-life. Then, before combining tweet level representations into context level, we multiplied each tweet representation b i by its weight, 2 − ∆t f , where ∆t = t − i is the dis- tance in days between the context tweet a i and the current tweet a t , and f = d * r is the half life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">User Interactions</head><p>As an additional context feature, we modeled the pairwise interactions between users. To identify interactions, we iterated through our unlabeled and labeled corpora and checked which users were in- volved in each tweet. We counted a user as in- volved in a tweet if they posted the tweet or were referenced via retweet or mention. For each pair of users, we aggregated all their tweets of mutual involvement into one document and averaged the document's word embeddings to create a represen- tation of their pairwise interactions in R 300 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>We experimented with the efficacy of our domain- specific resources, the impact of different context parameters, and the contribution of context to pre- dicting Aggression and Loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Corpus pre-processing</head><p>For word level models, we preprocess each tweet by: i) lowercasing every character, ii) replacing ev- ery user mention and url with special tokens "user" and "url", iii) considering each emoji an individual token, whether space separated or not, and iv) re- moving emoji modifiers to reduce sparsity, just as we used lowercasing. We select the top 40K to- kens based on frequency, replacing the remaining tokens with "UNKNOWN". We zero-pad or trim tweets so that tweet length will be 50 when passed to our CNN model. Similarly, we only consider users who occur (as author, source of retweet, or in mention) in the labeled and unlabeled corpus at least twice, resulting in 35,656 users in total.</p><p>We extract the author of the tweets from meta- data, and user mentions and original posters of retweets from the Twitter text, based on their Twit- ter display name. We used Twitter display name rather than user ID because we cannot collect user ID for interaction features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">CNN Architecture</head><p>For this 3-way classification task, we train two models; the first model predicts whether a tweet has the Aggression label and the second predicts for Loss. Each model maps a sequence of tokens to a probability value for a class. Here we define the architecture of our CNN model. Our input c is a token index sequence of length 50. We map each token index to a vector ∈ R 300 with a trainable embedding matrix, followed by dropout 0.5. We apply a 1D Convolutional layer with kernel sizes 1 and 2, filter size 200 each, to the embedded token sequence, followed by ReLU activation, max pool- ing and dropout 0.5. We concatenate the output of max pooling for kernel sizes 1 and 2, stack another dense layer h with dimension 256, and connect the output of h to the final single output unit with sigmoid activation.</p><p>In the prediction phase, for each data point, we classify it as Aggression if the the first model pro- duces the probability score above threshold t A . If it is not predicted as Aggression, then we classify it as Loss if the second model produces a score above a threshold t L . The remaining tweets are classified as Other. t A and t L are tuned on the validation set.</p><p>We incorporate context information into the neu- ral network in the following way. Each type of context feature takes the form of a real vector: both word embedding user history and word embedding user interaction features are in R 300 , and SPLex user history features are in R 2 . We concatenate these feature vectors with the last layer h before the final classification output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">SVM Baseline</head><p>We used as our baseline method a linear-kernel SVM classifier as used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blevins et al. 2016</ref>. We obtained code from the authors and trained on our larger dataset. In this method, after basic pre- processing is performed to replace urls and user mentions with special tokens, unigram, bigram, part-of-speech tag, and emotion features are ex- tracted. Feature selection is performed to prune the feature space. The part-of-speech tagger used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blevins et al. 2016</ref> was developed for use on this domain; emotion features are computed using scores for each tweet word taken from the Dictio- nary of Affect in Language (DAL). We performed gridsearch to re-tune the loss function, the regu- larization penalty type, and the penalty parameter C, but found that the original settings for these parameters still performed best even on our new development set. We also tuned the class weights used: while the model performed best on the orig- inal data with balanced class weights, we found that less extreme balancing performed better here (weights 2, 1, and 0.12 for Aggression, Loss, and Other, respectively).</p><p>While we retrained the SVM on our new training set, we did not modify the additional components used for feature selection such as the phrase table or the specialized part-of-speech tagger, as we had no additional data available for this. This indicates the difficulty of generalizing to new data with unseen vocabulary, and is one of the disadvantages of using manually-created specialized feature sets such as these.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Domain Experiments</head><p>In order to test the efficacy of our domain-specific word embeddings, we compared them with a num- ber of other embedding types. Our baseline method was <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pennington et al. 2014</ref>'s GloVe embeddings pretrained on a general Twitter dataset, available from their website <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . We trained a parallel set of word embeddings on the African American En- glish (AAE) corpus of around 1.1 million tweets provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blodgett et al. 2016</ref>, and another set on a corpus of a location-specific set of tweets that we scraped, drawn from users who posted from a spe- cific area within the South Side of Chicago where the gangs we study are based. We also compared performance with a randomly initialized word em- bedding matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Context Experiments</head><p>We first explored the impact of the user history parameters, tuning them separately for represen- tations by our domain-specific word embeddings and by SPLex. We kept these representations sepa- rate because we expected them to capture different types of context: word embeddings should capture the semantic content of the user's history, while SPLex scores should capture something closer to the user's emotional state leading up to the tweet.</p><p>With each representation, we experimented with summing versus averaging word embeddings to yield a tweet level representation, and similarly experimented with summing and averaging from tweet embeddings to context level representations. We varied the size of the context window, d, trying 2 days, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. We also varied the half-life ratio, r = .25, .5, .75, or no weighting. Lastly, we tried including different types of posts in the user history.</p><p>Once we tuned the user history parameters, we experimented with adding our context features (user history and user interactions) to the best tweet level model we could achieve without context. For our CNN, our best tweet level model used our domain-specific word embeddings as pretrained weights for the embedding layer (CNN-DS in Ta- ble 3). To evaluate the impact of our resources in different frameworks, we additionally experi- mented with the contribution of context in an SVM. The best tweet level SVM included the averaged domain-specific word embeddings and summed SPLex scores of the tokens in the tweet (SVM-DS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results and Discussion</head><p>We report results comparing different embeddings and comparing parameters for context. We use the best results from these experiments to produce our <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Diagram of our steps to generate domain-specific and context features for our neural net system. final systems in the SVM and CNN frameworks. The best resulting architecture for the CNN frame- work is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Comparison of Embeddings</head><p>Experiments were performed using five-fold cross- validation over the labeled data and were repeated five times for each fold to account for variance between runs. Reported F-scores, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  2</ref>, are averaged across runs and across folds.</p><p>Word embeddings trained on our unlabeled cor- pus outperformed other embeddings by over 4 points. Related datasets such as the location- specific or AAE corpus did not provide helpful semantic information, as their embeddings did not even beat random initialization. This was not an effect of corpus size, since these corpora contained 800,000 and 1.1 million tweets, respectively, com- pared to the 1 million in our unlabeled corpus. Thus, we attribute the difference to the importance of deriving embeddings directly from our commu- nity of interest, demonstrating that the language of our community is more specific than AAE in general and that our snowballing method was able to capture a better representation of user language than a location driven method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">User History Parameters</head><p>Experiments were performed using five-fold cross- validation and F-scores computed as in the word embedding experiments. We found that user history represented by domain-specific word embeddings performed optimally when we averaged from word to tweet level and from tweet to context level. The best window size was d = 90 days, including only SELF posts, and using a half-life ratio of r = 0.25. For user history represented by SPLex, we found the best method of combination to be summing, at both the word and tweet level. We hypothesize this is because summing captures not only the presence but also the number or density of highly indicative Aggression or Loss words posted by the user over the context window. The best window size was d = 2 days, including both SELF and RETWEET posts, without half-life weighting.</p><p>Our approach was designed to implement and <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Comparison of different models. The below pairs of algorithms achieve statistical significance p &lt; 0.002 for each class (the higher performing algorithm comes first): i) CNN-Context vs. CNN-DS; ii) CNN-DS vs. SVM- Retrained; iii) SVM-Context vs. SVM-DS. SVM-Context outperforms SVM-Retrained in the Aggression class by a robust margin (5 points). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Comparison of Best Systems</head><p>To develop a more stable measurement of com- parison between different systems, we create four independent sets of 5-fold cross validation splits on our data set (altogether 20 folds); to account for randomness in neural net training, we train each neural net model 5 times and take the majority vote of the predictions. For each class, we calculate the statistical significance of F-score based on the predictions on the concatenated test sets of all 20 folds using the Approximate Randomization Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Riezler and Maxwell 2005</ref>) with the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Adding context contributed to a significant im- provement in both the CNN and SVM frameworks, demonstrating the independent value of our con- text features over domain-specific resources. For contrast, we also compared our context features with user profiles built from averaging the word embeddings in all of the user's tweets. Our pair- wise and user history features outperformed user profiles by .7 points, demonstrating that it is valu- able to provide dynamic representations of users that can adjust to their recent posts or their interac- tions with other users, as opposed to stereotyping their overall behavior.</p><p>Additionally, we compare the impact of our domain-specific resources to those used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blevins et al. (2016)</ref>. In particular, we expect that their emo- tion scores will not generalize to the new vocabu- lary in our large unlabeled corpus (see Section 4.1). Our domain-specific resources alone without con- text raise our SVM to comparable performance with the Blevins et al. retrained baseline, and the resources push our CNN without context over this baseline. This demonstrates that our automatic methods can do as well as if not better than phrase- book methods, and they are significantly more effi- cient to generate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Error Analysis</head><p>In this section we provide an analysis of the trade- offs of each classifier by analyzing some of the examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Context vs non-context CNN. Our best CNN -a system which incorporated context -was able to correctly predict tweets 3 and 4, whereas our baseline using only our pretrained Word2Vec em- beddings was not. Correctly classifying tweet 4 relies on the knowledge that the referenced user, DMoney, is a deceased member of a rival gang of the poster. In tweet 3, the poster is saying that he has seen Gakirah's death on the news; this is an expression of loss.</p><p>Domain-specific vocabulary. Our CNN trained on domain-specific word embeddings is able to correctly classify tweet 5, while the one trained on Twitter word embeddings did not pick up the aggressive content. This user is talking about how their friend is ready to kill someone. This tweet contains the word thirsty but in this domain-specific context it means being ready and having an urge (although it would not always refer to killing).</p><p>Hashtags and character sequences. Despite their strengths, both our best CNN and our best SVM classifiers were still unable to correctly clas- sify some of the trickier cases. There were certain types of tweets they were categorically unable to recognize: tweet 1 features a hashtag that refers to an incarcerated acquaintance of the poster, but as both our CNN and SVM models operate at the word level, this tag would have appeared simply as a rare or unknown token to them.</p><p>Anger miscategorized as Aggression. At times, the classifier categorized posts that express anger as Aggression. For example, in tweet 4 the author uses profanity to express grief related to the loss of a friend. In addition, the devil face emoji, which is sometimes used to express aggression, is also used in the context of anger. While the best CNN model managed to correctly predict this as Loss, the SVM miscategorized it as Aggression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Ethics</head><p>Our ethics guidelines include just treatment of the users who provide our data, removal of identifying information for publication, and the inclusion of Chicago-based community members as domain ex- perts in the analysis and validation of our findings.</p><p>There are risks involved with detecting Aggres- sion and Loss in social media data using automatic detection systems. These risks include possible misidentifications of tweets, increased police in- volvement, and loss of privacy, which all have the potential to harm marginalized communities and people. Our mitigation strategies begin by part- nering with violence prevention organizations and incorporating domain experts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Frey et al., 2018)</ref> to ensure the highest ethical standards for interpret- ing social media posts and for the dissemination and use of our research for violence prevention. Through insights gained from these partnerships, we developed our own risk mitigation strategies: de-identifying each tweet and rendering it unsearch- able through textual modification without altering meaning; encrypting our social media corpus to protect user identities; and relying on violence pre- vention organizations' expertise in deciding if and when to involve law enforcement to prevent the unethical use of our data (e.g., hyper-surveillance of communities of color).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>Our approach shows that integrating emotions and semantic content of a user's recent posts is an important component for the task of predicting Aggression and Loss in social media posts of gang-involved youth. Furthermore, using domain- specific embeddings and an Aggression-Loss lexi- con induced from a corpus of language constructed to represent our specific community of users is also critical to success. Our experiments reveal that our snowballing technique is more effective than a location based approach and that fitting our community is more complex than resorting to their demographic, as captured in the AAE corpus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blodgett et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our work has real life implications for the use of machine learning to identify unique characteristics in social media data that may indicate the process by which gun violence may occur ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Patton et al., 2018a)</ref>. Our partnership between computer scien- tists, social work researchers and practitioners has advanced plans to create applications to help out- reach workers in Chicago identify factors related to potential violence, potentially allowing them to prevent and intervene in aggressive online activity. The tool, which would be co-created with commu- nity stakeholders, would enable quick scanning of large quantities of social media posts that outreach workers would be unable to perform manually.</p><p>We expect our methods to be generalizable be- cause we compute embeddings and lexicons from neighborhood-specific data and do not rely on large, hand-crafted resources such as dictionaries. How- ever, we hope to test generalizability in future work by applying our methods to other gang-related cor- pora, because there is variation in language, local concepts, and behavior across gangs. In the future, we are also interested in further experimenting with the context features introduced in this work; for instance, by extending our pairwise interaction fea- tures to take into account direction between users. Finally, we intend to explore other types of context, such as reference to specific events that may trigger the emotions of either Aggression or Loss.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="true"><head>Table 1 : Example tweets</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>No.
