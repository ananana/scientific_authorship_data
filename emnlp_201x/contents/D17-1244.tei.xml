				<p>This paper presents a corpus and experiments to determine dimensions of inter-personal relationships. We define a set of dimensions heavily inspired by work in social science. We create a corpus by retrieving pairs of people, and then annotating dimensions for their relationships. A corpus analysis shows that dimensions can be annotated reliably. Experimental results show that given a pair of people, values to dimensions can be assigned automatically.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of information extraction (IE) consists in creating structured representations from unstruc- tured text. These representations usually consist of relations explicitly stated in text, and involve two or more arguments. For example, IE sys- tems would extract SPOUSE(John, Mary) or MAR- RIED <ref type="bibr">(John, Mary, 1994 )</ref> from John and Mary have been married since 1994. IE systems have a long history, and became popular after eval- uations such as MUC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Grishman and Sundheim, 1996</ref>) and ACE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doddington et al., 2004</ref>).</p><p>Traditional IE systems are supervised and ex- tract relations defined before training takes place ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Peng and McCallum, 2004</ref>). More recently, open IE systems have been proposed to extract all re- lations explicitly stated in text in an unsuper- vised manner and without defining relations a priori ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mausam et al., 2012</ref>). Regarding inter- personal relations-relations that take as argu- ments two people-both IE approaches extract re- lations such as RELATIVE, FRIEND and COMMU- NICATES WITH. Open IE systems are domain in- dependent and would extract, in principle, rela- tions such as CLASSMATES and ADVISOR from students' diaries or biographies of scientists.</p><p>While useful for applications such as ques- tion answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Yao and Van Durme, 2014</ref>), these dyadic relations only provide a generic under- standing of the relationship between two people. For example, COMMUNICATES WITH may relate people who have an intense or superficial rela- tionship (e.g., engaged couples talking about wed- ding plans vs. home owners discussing remodels with contractors), pleasure-or task-oriented rela- tionships (e.g., friends planning a backpacking trip vs. software developers discussing the next deliv- ery), and may be spatially near or distant (e.g., inviduals having an in-person meeting vs. those exchanging emails or talking on the phone).</p><p>These elemental properties of interpersonal re- lationships are called dimensions in social science, and have been studied for decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Wish et al., 1976)</ref>. In those studies, the goal is to understand how relationships are perceived by people, not to extract them. Note that unlike interpersonal re- lationships, their dimensions are usually implic- itly stated in text, thus extracting them is chal- lenging. Also, extracting dimensions of interper- sonal relationships requires text understanding be- yond the event in which two people participate. As shown above, two people who communicate may have different dimension values depending on what they talk about or the communication device.</p><p>In this paper, we target dimensions of inter- personal relationships that characterize the nature of relationships beyond a name per relationship. The main contributions are: (a) set of dimensions of interpersonal relationships, including dimen- sions from previous work outside computational linguistics and novel ones; (b) corpus consisting of pairs of people and values for the dimensions of their relationships (Cohen's kappa: 0.68); (c) <ref type="bibr">de</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Dimensions of interpersonal relationships targeted in this paper.</p><p>[1] stands for ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wish et al., 1976)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> for <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kelley, 2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> for <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adamopoulos, 2012)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> for <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Deutsch, 2011)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Extracting relations between entities such as people, organizations and locations is the core goal of the task of information extraction. A few competitions have served as evaluation benchmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Grishman and Sundheim, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doddington et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kulick et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Surdeanu and Heng, 2014)</ref>, and include interper- sonal relationships such as BUSINESS, SPOUSE and CHILDREN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aguilar et al. (2014)</ref> compare several evaluations, and automated approaches to relation extraction-also referred to as link prediction and knowledge base completion- include ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Yu and Lam, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nguyen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">West et al., 2014</ref>). Open information extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wu and Weld, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angeli et al., 2015)</ref> has emerged as an unsupervised domain-independent approach to extract relations. Regardless of details, all these previous efforts extract explicit relations, and do not attempt to characterize instances of relations with dimensions. Besides extracting relations per se, there have been efforts within computational lin- guistics involving interpersonal relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Voskarides et al. (2015)</ref> extract human-readable descriptions of relations in a knowledge graph by ranking sentences that justify the relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Iyyer et al. (2016)</ref> propose an unsupervised algo- rithm to extract relationship trajectories of fic- tional characters, i.e., how interpersonal rela- tionships evolve over time in fictional stories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bracewell et al. (2012)</ref> introduce 9 social acts (e.g., agreement, undermining) designed to char- acterize relationships between individuals exhibit- ing adversarial and collegial behavior (similar to our cooperative vs. competitive dimension).</p><p>Researchers have studied from a com- putational perspective how people com- municate with each other.</p><p>For example, Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) study how power differences affects language style in online communities, and Prabhakaran and Rambow (2014) present a classifier to detect power re- lationships in email threads. Similarly, Gilbert (2012) explores how people in hierarchical relationships communicate through email, and Bramsen et al. (2011) focus on identifying power relationships in social networks. Po- liteness in online forums has also been studied (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013). While power (similar to our equal vs. hierarchical dimension, Section 3) and politeness could be considered dimensions, these works exploit structural and linguistic features derived from communications between two individuals. Unlike all of them, we extract 9 dimensions of interper- sonal relationships from sentences describing an event involving two people, and without needing language samples from them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dimensions of Interpersonal Relationships</head><p>Dimensions of interpersonal relationships have been studied for decades outside of computational linguistics, mostly in psychology and social sci- ence in general ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wish et al., 1976)</ref>. The set of di- mensions is by no means agreed upon, and neither is the terminology to refer to what apparently is the same dimension. For example, the terms domi- nance, submission, potency, autonomy and control are used to describe the distribution of power in a relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Deutsch, 2011</ref>). The dimensions we work with in this paper are primarily borrowed from previous works in social science, although we add two new dimensions. In- terestingly, the previous works which define these dimensions do so from a theoretical point of view or after conducting experiments with subjects to reveal how they perceive interpersonal relation- ships. The latter was done using multidimensional scaling analysis after subjects compared 25 rela- tionships, e.g., between a parent and child, be- tween business partners ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wish et al., 1976)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the nine dimensions targeted in this paper along with the original references and aliases found in the literature. Social scien- tists have proposed additional dimensions, e.g., voluntary vs. involuntary, public vs. private and licit vs. illicit (Deutsch, 2011), or self-benefiting vs. service-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adamopoulos, 2012)</ref>. We discarded these additional dimensions because we discovered that they are not applicable to most pairs of people we work with (Section 4).</p><p>We provide below brief descriptions of the nine dimensions of interpersonal relationships we work with. Note that these dimensions are not com- pletely independent, for example, enduring rela- tionships are usually intense and intimate, and in- tense and pleasure-oriented relationship are al- most always intimate. Section 4.3 presents exam- ples, and Section 4.4 discusses inter-dimensional correlations and inter-annotator agreement. We point the reader to the references in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for additional details, rationales, and examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperative vs. Competitive A relationship is</head><p>cooperative if both people (a) have a common interest or goal, (b) like each other, (c) bene- fit from the relationship, or (d) think alike or have similar views. Otherwise, the relation- ship is competitive. Equal vs. Hierarchical A relationship is equal if both people (a) have the same social sta- tus, (b) are at the same level in the power structure, (c) share similar responsibilities, or (d) have the same role. Otherwise, the rela- tionship is hierarchical. Intense vs. Superficial A relationship is intense if both people interact with each other fre- quently, i.e., they are involved repeatedly. Otherwise, the relationship is superficial. Pleasure vs. Task Oriented A relationship is pleasure oriented if both people interact so- cially and their relationship is not bound by professional rules or regulations. Otherwise, the relationship is task oriented. Active vs. Passive A relationship is active if both people are involved in a shared activity or event that grants the relationship. Otherwise, the relationship is passive. For example, in- dividuals commuting to work in the same car have an active relationship, but those who happen to take the same subway line to work have a passive relationship. Intimate vs. Unintimate A relationship is inti- mate if both people are emotionally close and warm to each other. Otherwise, the relation- ship in unintimate. Temporary vs. Enduring A relationship is tem- porary if it lasts less than a day. A relation- ship is enduring if it lasts over a month. Oth- erwise (if it lasts more than a day and less than a month), this dimension is undefined. Concurrent vs. Nonconcurrent A relationship is concurrent if both people are involved in an event or action at the same time.</p><p>Otherwise, the relationship is nonconcurrent. Spatially Near vs. Distant A relationship is spa- tially near (or near for short) if both people are at the same location during the event that grants the relationship. Otherwise, the rela- tionship is spatially distant (or distant).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Building a Corpus of Dimensions of Interpersonal Relationships</head><p>Existing corpora annotating relations (Section 2) only consider selected interpersonal relationships and do not target dimensions. Our goal is to tar- get dimensions of interpersonal relationships be- tween any two individuals, from weak links (e.g., journalists interviewing celebrities) to strong ties (e.g., close friends). Thus, we create a corpus 1 by first retrieving pairs of people, and then annotating dimensions for their relationships. We decided to add our annotations to OntoNotes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hovy et al., 2006</ref>). Doing so has several advantages. First, OntoNotes contains texts from several domains and genres (e.g., conversational telephone speech, weblogs, broad- cast), thus we not only work with newspaper articles. Second, OntoNotes includes part-of- speech tags, named entities and coreference chains, three annotation layers that allow us to streamline the corpus creation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Retrieving Pairs of People</head><p>We retrieve pairs of people within each sentence in OntoNotes following four steps: <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Frequencies of the top 20 most frequent verbs after retrieving pairs of people (Section 4.1). We discard verbs with frequency &lt;4, and randomly select up to 26 pairs per verb for a total of 1,048 pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Collect all instances of personal pronouns</head><p>(part-of-speech tag PRP) I, he and she. 2. Collect all named entities PERSON. 3. Keep one mention per coreference chain, giv- ing priority to named entities over pronouns. 4. Generate combinations of 2 elements from the union of the pronouns and named entities subject to the following constraints: at least (a) one is a PERSON named entity, and (b) one is the nsubj (nominal subject syntac- tic dependency) of a verb. The elements of the pair that satisfy restric- tions (4a) and (4b) need not be the same. Note that removing duplicate mentions (Step 3) does not reduce the number of relationships tar- geted, it simply avoids duplicate pairs. Also, the only syntactic constraint is that one person in the pair must be the nominal subject of a verb. Thus, we work with relationships between individuals from different clauses, and connected with a va- riety of syntactic paths (see Examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>The total number of pairs generated skipping Steps 3 and 4 would be 4,886. After removing du- plicate mentions (Step 3), the number is reduced to 3,481; restrictions (4a) and (4b) further reduce the number to 3,143 and 2,696 respectively. Exe- cuting all steps yields 2,364 pairs. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> presents verb frequencies for the top 20 most frequent verbs in the 2,364 pairs. In order to reduce the annotation effort and account for a vari- ety of verbs, we set to annotate 1,000 pairs. After trying several thresholds, we retrieved 1,048 pairs by selecting pairs from verbs that occur at least 4 times, and randomly selecting up to 26 pairs per verb (most verbs occur less than 26 times).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Annotating Dimensions of Interpersonal Relationships</head><p>After generating pairs, annotators determine val- ues for each dimension of interpersonal relation- ships. The annotation interface shows the sentence from which the pair was generated, and the pre- vious and next sentence to provide some context. The pair of people of interest were highlighted, but no additional information was shown (e.g., the verb of which one person is the subject).</p><p>Annotators assign a value to each dimension based on the relationship between the two individ- uals at the time the verbal event of which one of the individuals is the subject takes place. They were trained to take into account context (previ- ous and next sentences), and to interpret the text as they normally would. Therefore, they assign values using world knowledge that may not be ex- plicitly stated in the text. For example, two peo- ple talking on the phone would have a spatially distant relationship because (most likely) they are not next to each other while talking. Annotating the changes over time of the dimensions is outside the scope of this paper.</p><p>During the first batch of annotations, we discov- ered that for a given pair of people, dimensions sometimes cannot be determined because (a) there is not enough evidence in the text provided (i.e., sentence from which the pair was generated, pre- vious and next sentences) or (b) the pair is invalid and assigning dimensions is nonsensical. We use 0 label in the former case, and inv in the latter. For example, in the sentence <ref type="bibr">[He]</ref> y <ref type="bibr">[criticized]</ref> verb <ref type="bibr">[Ken Starr]</ref> x , the value for the dimension spatially near (vs. distant) was marked 0 as there is not enough information to determine whether He and Ken Starr are at the same location when criticized took place. The most frequent example of inv is when God is marked as a PERSON named entity in the gold annotations in OntoNotes.</p><p>In the rest of the paper, we refer to dimensions by the first descriptor in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and use 1 if the first descriptor of a dimension is true, and -1 if the second descriptor is true. For example label -1 applied to dimension temporary means that the realtionship is enduring.     <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Label distribution per dimension of interpersonal relationships. The missing portion of each pie chart corresponds to labels 0 and inv, which always amount to less than 5% each.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Annotation Examples</head><p>We present annotation examples from our cor- pus in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, including context if it is relevant. We acknowledge that some annotations are am- biguous, and discuss label distributions and inter- annotator agreement in Section 4.4.</p><p>Sentences (1) and (2) encode a COMMUNICA- TION relationships between two individuals, and both are cooperative, superficial, work oriented, active, unintimate, temporary, and concurrent. The values for two dimensions, however, are dif- ferent. Two counterparts (Sentence 1) are at the same level in the power structure (equal), but inter- viewer and interviewee are not (Sentence 2). Sim- ilarly, talking on the phone entails that the individ- uals are spatially distant (Sentence 1), but inter- viewing (most likely) means that they were spa- tially near (Sentence 2). One could argue that 0 would be a better label for spatially near in Sentence (2), but annotators interpreted that inter- viewed refers to an in-person interview.</p><p>Sentence (3) in context describes one person (Yu Youren) encouraging another one (I). Annota- tors indicate that this relationship, unlike the ones in Sentences (1) and (2), is intense (frequent inter- action), intimate (emotionally close), and endur- ing (lasting over a month). These values are not explicitly stated, but they are understood given the long-lasting impact Yu Youren had on I.</p><p>Finally, Sentence (4) exemplifies a competitive relationship. The context describes a struggling relationship between Dingxiang and Zhang Sheng. When the latter threw the former out, the rela-    <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">and Koch, 1977)</ref>.</p><p>tionship was superficial and unintimate, but (most likely) existed for longer than a month (enduring).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Corpus Analysis</head><p>Label Distribution. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the percent- age of label 1 (first descriptor) and -1 (second de- scriptor) per dimension in our corpus. The per- centage of Label 0 ranges from 0.86% (tempo- rary) to 4.3% (cooperative) depending on the di- mension, and the percentage of inv is 4.6% (not shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Importantly, annotators as- signed a useful value (either 1 or -1) to most pairs of people (&gt;90%) for all dimensions. The distributions of 1 and -1 clearly show that most dimensions are biased towards one label. For example, few relationships are pleasure oriented (14.4%) or enduring (14.5%). The exceptions are concurrent vs. nonconcurrent, with roughly the same percentages (46.4% and 47.1%), spatially near vs. distant (40.4% and 51.4%) and active vs. passive (58.4% and 35.3%). These distributions are not a representative sample of all interpersonal relationships, we would expect many pleasure ori- ented and intimate relationship if we work with personal diaries instead of OntoNotes. Inter-Dimension Correlations. While the dimen- sions we work with have a long tradition in social science (Section 2), to the best of our knowledge, they have not been extensively annotated in text before. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows inter-dimensional correla- tions for all pairs of dimensions in our corpus. Not surprisingly, some dimensions correlate with each other. For example, enduring relationships tend to also be intense (0.56) and intimate (0.61), and concurrent relationships tend to be active (0.74). The highest correlation is between concurrent and spatially near (0.89), indicating that if two people participate in a common event at the same time, usually they are at the same location (see coun- terexample in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, Sentence 1). Note, how- ever, that most correlations are low, and some di- mensions (e.g., cooperative, equal) have low cor- relations (&lt;0.30) with all dimensions. Inter-Annotator Agreement. The annotations were done by two graduate students. They started annotating small batches of pairs of people, and discussed disagreements with each other. After several iterations, they annotated independently 10% of all pairs of people generated. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> depicts the inter-annotator agreements obtained. Overall Cohen's kappa coefficient is 0.68, and the coefficients range between 0.59 to 0.74 depend- ing on the dimension. Note that kappa coefficients in the range 0.60-0.80 are considered substantial, and over 0.80 would be perfect <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Landis and Koch, 1977)</ref>. Given these high agreements, the rest of pairs were annotated once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>We conduct experiments using standard super- vised machine learning. Each pair of people be- come an instance, and we split instances into train- ing (80%) and test (20%). As a learning algorithm, we use SVM with RBF kernel as implemented in scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>We report results in the test set after tuning the SVM parameters (C and γ) using 10-fold cross- validation with the training set. More specifically, we train one classifier per dimension, and exper- iment with all instances but the ones annotated inv. Thus, each classifier predicts 3 labels: 1 (the first descriptor applies), -1 (the second descriptor applies), and 0 (neither descriptor applies).  <ref type="table">Verb   word, tag  Word form and part-of-speech tag of the verb  dep out  Outgoing syntactic dependency from verb  deps in  Flags indicating incoming syntactic dependencies to the verb  lex name  Name of the WordNet lexical file of the verb  token before</ref> Word form and part-of-speech tag of the token before the verb token after</p><p>Word form and part-of-speech tag of the token after the verb Person words, tags Concatenation of word forms and part-of-speech tags type</p><p>Flag indicating whether the person is a pronoun or named entity dep out</p><p>Outgoing syntactic dependency distance verb Number of tokens between the person and the verb first token</p><p>Word form and part-of-speech tag of the first token in the person last token</p><p>Word form and part-of-speech tag of the last token in the person token before</p><p>Word form and part-of-speech tag of the token before the person token after</p><p>Word form and part-of-speech tag of the token after the person Personx Persony direction Flag indicating whether x occurs before or after y type Flag indicating whether x and y are PERSON NEs, or either one is a pronoun <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Feature set used to determine dimensions of interpersonal relationships between pairs of people (x, y).

Results per label are heavily biased towards the most frequent label per dimension <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>), although it is the case that the models we experiment with predict both 1 and -1 for all dimensions. As stated above, none of them predict 0, but this limitation does not substantially penalize overall performance be- cause of the low frequency of this label.</p><p>The model obtains the same F-measures for 1 and -1 with concurrent dimension (0.76), and the labels of this dimension are virtually distributed uniformly (46.4% vs. 47.1%, <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. Similarly, F-measures for 1 and -1 with spatially near and active dimensions are similar (0.67 vs. 0.76 and 0.76 vs. 0.58), and the labels are distributed rela- tively evenly in our corpus (40.4% vs 51.4% and. 58.4% vs. 35.3%).</p><p>Finally, F-measures per label with other dimen- sion are biased towards the most frequent label. For example, only 15% of all pairs of people have an enduring relationship <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>), and the F- measure for 1 with temporary dimension is much higher (0.91) that for -1 (0.16).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented a set of nine dimensions of interpersonal relationships, including dimensions with a long tradition in social science and new ones. These dimensions allow us to differenti- ate core characteristics of the relationship between two individuals. For example, people that commu- nicate may be spatially near or spatially distant (asking questions in class vs. chatting online), and have a pleasure-oriented or work-oriented rela- tionship (somebody wishing good luck to a friend vs. interviewer and interviewee). Our annotations show that assigning values to dimensions can be done reliably (Cohen's kappa: 0.68), and that useful values (1 and -1 labels) are assigned to dimensions in most pairs of people (&gt;90%). Experimental results following a stan- dard supervised machine learning approach show that assigning values to dimensions can be auto- mated (0.72 overall F-measure), and that results per label and dimensions are biased towards the most frequent label.</p><p>We believe that extracting dimensions of inter- personal relationships complements previous ef- forts that extract relationships. Our future plans include studying values of dimensions for selected relationships (e.g., COWORKER), and investigat- ing changes on the dimensions of the relationship over time. The latter would allow us to, for exam-ple, analyze how the relationship between two in- dividuals changes over time, and determine which events make a relationship go from superficial to intense and vice versa.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Sentence</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
