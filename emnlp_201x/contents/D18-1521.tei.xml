				<p>Word embedding models have become a fundamental component in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, embeddings trained on human-generated corpora have been demonstrated to inherit strong gender stereotypes that reflect social constructs. To address this concern , in this paper, we propose a novel training procedure for learning gender-neutral word embeddings. Our approach aims to preserve gender information in certain dimensions of word vectors while compelling other dimensions to be free of gender influence. Based on the proposed method, we generate a Gender-Neutral variant of GloVe (GN-GloVe). Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that GN-GloVe successfully isolates gender information without sacrificing the functional-ity of the embedding model.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Word embedding models have been designed for representing the meaning of words in a vector space. These models have become a fundamen- tal NLP technique and have been widely used in various applications. However, prior stud- ies show that such models learned from human- generated corpora are often prone to exhibit so- cial biases, such as gender stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bolukbasi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Caliskan et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, the word "programmer" is neutral to gender by its definition, but an embedding model trained on a news corpus associates "programmer" closer with "male" than "female".</p><p>Such a bias substantially affects downstream applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhao et al. (2018)</ref> show that a coref- erence resolution system is sexist due to the word embedding component used in the system. This concerns the practitioners who use the embedding model to build gender-sensitive applications such as a resume filtering system or a job recommenda- tion system as the automated system may discrimi- nate candidates based on their gender, as reflected by their name. Besides, biased embeddings may implicitly affect downstream applications used in our daily lives. For example, when searching for "computer scientist" using a search engine, as this phrase is closer to male names than female names in the embedding space, a search algorithm us- ing an embedding model in the backbone tends to rank male scientists higher than females', hinder- ing women from being recognized and further ex- acerbating the gender inequality in the community.</p><p>To alleviate gender stereotype in word embed- dings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bolukbasi et al. (2016)</ref> propose a post- processing method that projects gender-neutral words to a subspace which is perpendicular to the gender dimension defined by a set of gender- definition words. 1 However, their approach has two limitations. First, the method is essentially a pipeline approach and requires the gender-neutral words to be identified by a classifier before em- ploying the projection. If the classifier makes a mistake, the error will be propagated and af- fect the performance of the model. Second, their method completely removes gender information from those words which are essential in some do- mains such as medicine and social science ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Back et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">McFadden et al., 1992)</ref>.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we propose a learning scheme, Gender-Neutral Global Vectors (GN-GloVe) for training word embedding mod- els with protected attributes (e.g., gender) based on GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). 2 GN-GloVe represents protected attributes in certain dimen- 1 Gender-definition words are the words associated with gender by definition (e,g., mother, waitress); the remainder are gender-neutral words. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The code and data are released at https://github. com/uclanlp/gn_glove sions while neutralizing the others during training. As the information of the protected attribute is re- stricted in certain dimensions, it can be removed from the embedding easily. By jointly identifying gender-neutral words while learning word vectors, GN-GloVe does not require a separate classifier to identify gender-neutral words; therefore, the er- ror propagation issue is eliminated. The proposed approach is generic and can be incorporated with other word embedding models and be applied in reducing other societal stereotypes.</p><p>Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1) To our best knowledge, GN-GloVe is the first method to learn word embeddings with protected attributes; 2) By capturing protected attributes in certain dimensions, our approach ameliorates the interpretability of word representations; 3) Qual- itative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that GN-GloVe effectively isolates the protected attributes and preserves the word proximity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Word Embeddings Word embeddings serve as a fundamental building block for a broad range of NLP applications (dos <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Santos and Gatti, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bahdanau et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zeng et al., 2015</ref>) and various approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mikolov et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Levy et al., 2015</ref>) have been proposed for training the word vectors. Im- provements have been made by leveraging se- mantic lexicons and morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Luong et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Faruqui et al., 2014</ref>), disambiguating mul- tiple senses <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Suster et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arora et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Upadhyay et al., 2017)</ref>, and modeling contextual- ized information by deep neural networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Peters et al., 2018)</ref>. However, none of these works at- tempts to tackle the problem of stereotypes exhib- ited in embeddings.</p><p>Stereotype Analysis Implicit stereotypes have been observed in applications such as on- line advertising systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sweeney, 2013)</ref>, web search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kay et al., 2015)</ref>, and online reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wallace and Paul, 2016</ref>). Besides, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhao et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rudinger et al. (2018)</ref> show that coreference resolution systems are gender biased.

A temporal analysis about word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Garg et al., 2018</ref>) captures changes in gender and ethnic stereotypes over time. Researchers attributed such problem partly to the biases in the datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhao et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yao and Huang, 2017)</ref> and word em- beddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Garg et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Caliskan et al., 2017</ref>) but did not provide constructive solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>In this paper, we take GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> as the base embedding model and gender as the protected attribute. It is worth noting that our approach is general and can be applied to other embedding models and attributes. Follow- ing GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), we construct a word-to-word co-occurrence matrix X, denoting the frequency of the j-th word appearing in the context of the i-th word as X i,j . w, ˜ w ∈ R d stand for the embeddings of a center and a context word, respectively, where d is the dimension.</p><p>In our embedding model, a word vector w con- sists of two parts w = [w (a) ; w (g) ]. w (a) ∈ R d−k and w (g) ∈ R k stand for neutralized and gendered components respectively, where k is the number of dimensions reserved for gender information. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Our proposed gender neutralizing scheme is to reserve the gender feature, known as "protected attribute" into w (g) . Therefore, the information encoded in w (a) is independent of gender influ- ence. We use v g ∈ R d−k to denote the direc- tion of gender in the embedding space. We cat- egorize all the vocabulary words into three sub- sets: male-definition Ω M , female-definition Ω F , and gender-neutral Ω N , based on their definition in WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Miller and Fellbaum, 1998</ref>).</p><p>Gender Neutral Word Embedding Our mini- mization objective is designed in accordance with above insights. It contains three components:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J = J G + λ d J D + λ e J E ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where λ d and λ e are hyper-parameters. The first component J G is originated from GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), which captures the word proximity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">J G = V i,j=1 f (X i,j ) w T i ˜ w j + b i + ˜ b j − log X i,j 2 .</formula><p>Here f (X i,j ) is a weighting function to reduce the influence of extremely large co-occurrence fre- quencies. b and˜band˜and˜b are the respective linear biases for w and˜wand˜ and˜w. The other two terms are aimed to restrict gen- der information in w (g) , such that w (a) is neutral. Given male-and female-definition seed words Ω M and Ω F , we consider two distant metrics and form two types of objective functions.</p><p>In J L1 D , we directly minimizing the negative dis- tances between words in the two groups:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">J L1 D = − w∈Ω M w (g) − w∈Ω F w (g) 1 .</formula><p>In J L2 D , we restrict the values of word vectors in [β 1 , β 2 ] and push w (g) into one of the extremes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">J L2 D = w∈Ω M β 1 e − w (g) 2 2 + w∈Ω F β 2 e − w (g) 2 2</formula><p>, where e ∈ R k is a vector of all ones. β 1 and β 2 can be arbitrary values, and we set them to be 1 and −1, respectively. Finally, for words in Ω N , the last term encour- ages their w (a) to be retained in the null space of the gender direction v g :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">J E = w∈Ω N v T g w (a) 2 ,</formula><p>where v g is estimating on the fly by averaging the differences between female words and their male counterparts in a predefined set,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v g = 1 |Ω | (wm,w f )∈Ω (w (a) m − w (a) f ),</formula><p>where Ω is a set of predefined gender word pairs. We use stochastic gradient descent to optimize Eq. (1). To reduce the computational complexity in training the wording embedding, we assume v g is a fixed vector (i.e., we do not derive gradient w.r.t v g in updating w (a) , ∀w ∈ Ω ) and estimate v g only at the beginning of each epoch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we conduct the following qualita- tive and quantitative studies: 1) We visualize the embedding space and show that GN-GloVe sepa- rates the protected gender attribute from other la- tent aspects; 2) We measure the ability of GN- GloVe to distinguish between gender-definition words and gender-stereotype words on a newly annotated dataset; 3) We evaluate GN-GloVe on standard word embedding benchmark datasets and show that it performs well in estimating word proximity; 4) We demonstrate that GN-Glove re- duces gender bias on a downstream application, coreference resolution.</p><p>We compare GN-GloVe with two embedding models, GloVe and Hard-GloVe. GloVe is a widely-used model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), and we apply the post-processing step introduced in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bolukbasi et al., 2016)</ref> to reduce gender bias in GloVe and name it after Hard-GloVe. All the em- beddings are trained on 2017 English Wikipedia dump with the default hyper-parameters decribed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). When training GN- GloVe, we constrain the value of each dimension within [−1, 1] to avoid numerical difficulty. We set λ d and λ e both to be 0.8. In our preliminary study on development data, we observe that the model is not sensitive to these parameters. Unless other stated, we use J L1 D in the GN-GloVe model.</p><p>Separate protected attribute First, we demon- strate that GN-GloVe preserves the gender asso- ciation (either definitional or stereotypical asso- ciations) in w (g)4 . To illustrate the distribution of gender information of different words, we plot <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a using w (g)</ref> for the x-axis and a random value for the y-axis to spread out words in the plot. As shown in the figure, the gender-definition words, e.g. "waiter" and "waitress", fall far away from each other in w (g) . In addition, words such as "housekeeper" and "doctor" are inclined to dif- ferent genders and their w (g) preserves such infor- mation. Next, we demonstrate that GN-GloVe reduces gender stereotype using a list of profession titles from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bolukbasi et al., 2016)</ref>. All these profes- sion titles are neutral to gender by definition. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c</ref>, we plot the cosine similar- ity between each word vector w (a) and the gen- der direction v g (i.e., w T vg wvg ). Result shows that words, such as "doctor" and "nurse", possess no gender association by definition, but their GloVe word vectors exhibit strong gender stereotype. In contrast, the gender projects of GN-GloVe word vectors w (a) are closer to zero. This demonstrates the gender information has been substantially di- minished from w (a) in the GN-GloVe embedding.</p><p>We further quantify the gender information ex- hibited in the embedding models. For each model, we project the word vectors of occupational words into the gender sub-space defined by "he-she" and compute their average size. A larger projection in- dicates an embedding model is more biased. Re- sults show that the average projection of GloVe is 0.080, the projection of Hard-GloVe is 0.019, and the projection of Gn-Glove is 0.052. Com- paring with GloVe, GN-GloVe reduces the bias by 35%. Although Hard-GloVe contains less gender information, we will show later GN-GloVe can tell difference between gender-stereotype and gender- definition words better.</p><p>Gender Relational Analogy To study the qual- ity of the gender information present in each model, we follow SemEval 2012 <ref type="bibr">Task2 (Jurgens et al., 2012)</ref> to create an analogy dataset, SemBias, with the goal to identify the correct analogy of "he -she" from four pairs of words. Each instance in the dataset consists of four word pairs: a gender- definition word pair (Definition; e.g., "waiter - waitress"), a gender-stereotype word pair (Stereo- typ; e.g., "doctor -nurse") and two other pairs of words that have similar meanings (None; e.g., "dog -cat", "cup -lid") <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . We consider 20 gender- stereotype word pairs and 22 gender-definition word pairs and use their Cartesian product to generate 440 instances. Among the 22 gender- definition word pairs, there are 2 word pairs that <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The pair is sampled from the list of word pairs with "SIMILAR: Coordinates" relation annotated in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jurgens et al., 2012</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Percentage of predictions for each cate- gory on gender relational analogy task.</p><p>are not used as a seed word during the training.</p><p>To test the generalization ability of the model, we generate a subset of data (SemBias (subset)) of 40 instances associated with these 2 pairs. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the percentage of times that each class of pair is on the top based on a word embed- ding model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mikolov et al., 2013c</ref>). GN-GloVe achieves 97.7% accuracy in identifying gender- definition word pairs as an analogy to "he -she". In contrast, GloVe and Hard-GloVe makes signif- icantly more mistakes. On the subset, GN-GloVe also achieves significantly better performance than Hard-Glove and GloVe, indicating that it can gen- eralize the gender pairs on the training set to iden- tify other gender-definition word pairs.</p><p>Word Similarity and Analogy In addition, we evaluate the word embeddings on the benchmark tasks to ensure their quality. The word similarity tasks measure how well a word embedding model captures the similarity between words comparing to human annotated rating scores. Embeddings are tested on multiple datasets: WS353-ALL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Finkelstein et al., 2001</ref>), RG-65 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, where the suffix "-L1" and "-L2" of GN-GloVe stand for the GN-GloVe using J L1 D and J L2 D , respectively. Compared with others, GN- GloVe achieves a higher accuracy in the similarity tasks and its analogy score slightly drops indicat- ing that GN-GloVe is capable of preserving prox- imity among words.</p><p>Coreference Resolution Finally, we investigate how the gender bias in word embeddings affects a downstream application, such as coreference res- olution. Coreference resolution aims at clustering the denotative noun phrases referring to the same entity in the given text. We evaluate our models on the Ontonotes 5.0 ( <ref type="bibr">Weischedel et al., 2012</ref>) bench- mark dataset and the WinoBias dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhao et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In particular, the WinoBias dataset is composed of pro-stereotype (PRO) and anti- stereotype (ANTI) subsets. The PRO subset con- sists of sentences where a gender pronoun refers to a profession, which is dominated by the same gen- der. Example sentences include "The CEO raised the salary of the receptionist because he is gen- erous." In this sentence, the pronoun "he" refers to "CEO" and this reference is consistent with so- cietal stereotype. The ANTI subset contains the same set of sentences, but the gender pronoun in each sentence is replaced by the opposite gender. For instance, the gender pronoun "he" is replaced by "she" in the aforementioned example. Despite the sentence is almost identical, the gender pro- noun now refers to a profession that is less repre- sented by the gender. Details about the dataset are in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhao et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Specifically, we conduct experiments on the Type 1 ver- sion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Embeddings</head><p>OntoNotes  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: F1 score (%) on the coreference system.</p><p>We train the end-to-end coreference resolution model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al., 2017</ref>) with different word em- beddings on OntoNote and report their perfor- mance in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. For the WinoBias dataset, we also report the average (Avg) and absolute dif- ference (Diff) of F1 scores on two subsets. A smaller Diff value indicates less bias in a system. Results show that GN-GloVe achieves compara- ble performance as Glove and Hard-GloVe on the OntoNotes dataset while distinctly reducing the bias on the WinoBias dataset. When only the w (a) potion of the embedding is used in representing words, GN-GloVe(w (a) ) further reduces the bias in coreference resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we introduced an algorithm for train- ing gender-neutral word embedding. Our method is general and can be applied in any language as long as a list of gender definitional words is pro- vided as seed words (e.g., gender pronouns). Fu- ture directions include extending the proposed ap- proach to model other properties of words such as sentiment and generalizing our analysis beyond binary gender.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Cosine similarity between the gender direction and the embeddings of gender-neutral words.
