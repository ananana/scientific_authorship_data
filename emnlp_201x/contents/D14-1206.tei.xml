				<p>Information in visually rich formats such as PDF and HTML is often conveyed by a combination of textual and visual features. In particular, genres such as marketing flyers and info-graphics often augment textual information by its color, size, positioning, etc. As a result, traditional text-based approaches to information extraction (IE) could underperform. In this study, we present a supervised machine learning approach to IE from on-line commercial real estate flyers. We evaluated the performance of SVM clas-sifiers on the task of identifying 12 types of named entities using a combination of textual and visual features. Results show that the addition of visual features such as color, size, and positioning significantly increased classifier performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Since the Message Understanding Conferences in the 1990s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Grishman and Sundheim, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chinchor and Robinson, 1997)</ref>, Information Extraction (IE) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) ap- proaches have been applied and evaluated on a va- riety of domains and textual genres. The majority of the work, however, focuses on the journalistic, scientific, and informal genres (newswires, scien- tific publications, blogs, tweets, and other social media texts) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)</ref> and deals with purely textual corpora. As a result, the fea- ture space of NER systems involves purely tex- tual features, typically word attributes and char- acteristics (orthography, morphology, dictionary lookup, etc.), their contexts and document features (surrounding word window, local syntax, docu- ment/corpus word frequencies, etc.) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, textual information is often presented in visually rich formats, e.g. HTML and PDF. In addition to text, these formats use a vari- ety of visually salient characteristics, (e.g. color, font size, positioning) to either highlight or aug- ment textual information. In some genres and do- mains, a textual representation of the data, exclud- ing visual features is often not enough to accu- rately identify named entities of interest or extract relevant information. Marketing materials, such as online flyers or HTML emails, often contain a plethora of visual features and text-based NER approaches lead to poor results. In this paper, we present a supervised approach that uses a combi- nation of textual and visual features to recognize named entities in online marketing materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Motivation and Problem Definition</head><p>A number of broker-based industries (e.g. com- mercial real estate, heavy equipment machinery, etc.) lack a centralized searchable database with industry offerings. In particular, the commercial real estate industry (unlike residential real estate) does not have a centralized database or an estab- lished source of information. Commercial real estate brokers often need to rely on networking, chance, and waste time with a variety of commer- cial real estate databases that often present out- dated information. While brokers do not often up- date third party inventory databases, they do create marketing materials (usually PDF flyers) that con- tain all relevant listing information. Virtually all commercial real estate offerings come with pub- licly available marketing material that contains all relevant listing information. Our goal is to harness this source of information (the marketing flyer) and use it to extract structured listing information. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of a commercial real estate flyer. The commercial real estate fly- ers are often distributed as PDF documents, links to HTML pages, or visually rich HTML-based emails. They typically contain all relevant listing information such as the address and neighborhood of the offering, the names and contact information of the brokers, the type of space offered (build- ing, land, unit(s) within a building), etc. Similar to other info-graphics, relevant information could be easily pinpointed by visual clues. For example, the listing street address in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (1629 N. Halsted St., upper left corner) can be quickly identified and distinguished from the brokerage firm street ad- dress (156 N. Jefferson St., upper right corner) due to its visual prominence (font color, size, position- ing).</p><p>In this study we explored a supervised machine learning approach to the task of identifying list- ing information from commercial real estate fly- ers. In particular, we focused on the recognition of 12 types of named entities as described in <ref type="table">Table  1</ref> below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Nadeau and Satoshi (2007) present a survey of NER and describe the feature space of NER re- search. While they mention multi-media NER in the context of video/text processing, all described features/approaches focus only on textual repre- sentation.</p></div>

Confidential</p><p>Any mentions of confidentiality. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Types and descriptions of named enti- ties relevant to extracting listing information from commercial real estate flyers.</p><p>The literature on Information Extraction from HTML resources is dominated by various ap- proaches based on wrapper induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kushmerick, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kushmerick, 2000</ref>). Wrapper induc- tions rely on common HTML structure (based on the HTML DOM) and formatting features to ex- tract structured information from similarly format- ted HTML pages. This approach, however, is not applicable to the genres of marketing materials (PDF and HTML) since they typically do not share any common structure that can be used to iden- tify relevant named entities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Laender et al. (2002)</ref> present a survey of data extraction techniques and tools from structured or semi-structured web re- sources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cai et al. (2003)</ref> present a vision-based segmen- tation algorithm of web pages that uses HTML layout features and attempts to partition the page at the semantic level. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Burget and Rudolfova, 2009</ref>) authors propose web-page block classifica- tion based on visual features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Yang and Zhang (2001)</ref> build a content tree of HTML documents based on visual consistency inferred semantics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burget (2007)</ref> proposes a layout based informa- tion extraction from HTML documents and states that this visual approach is more robust than tradi- tional DOM-based methods.</p><p>Changuel et al.(2009a) describe a system for automatically extracting author information from web-pages. They use spatial information based on the depth of the text node in the HTML DOM tree. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Changuel et al., 2009b</ref>) and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hu et al., 2006</ref>), the authors proposed a machine learning method for title extraction and utilize format information such as font size, position, and font weight. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhu et al., 2007</ref>) authors use layout information based on font size and weight for NER for auto- mated expense reimbursement.</p><p>While the idea of utilizing visual features based on HTML style has been previously suggested, this study tackles a non-trivial visually rich dataset that prevents the use of previously suggested sim- plistic approaches to computing HTML features (such as relying on the HTML DOM tree or sim- plistic HTML style rendering). In addition, we in- troduce the use of RGB color as a feature and nor- malize it approximating human perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Dataset and Method</head><p>The dataset consists of 800 randomly selected commercial real estate flyers spanning 315 US locations, 75 companies, and 730 brokers. The flyers were collected from various online sources and were originally generated using a variety of HTML and PDF creator tools. The collection rep- resents numerous flyer formats and layouts, com- mercial real estate property types (industrial, re- tail, office, land, etc.), and transactions (invest- ment, sale, lease).</p><p>All flyers were converted to a common format (HTML) <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . The HTML versions of all documents were then annotated by 2 annotators. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows an example of an annotated flyer. Annota- tion guidelines were developed and the 2 annota- tors were able to achieve an inter-annotator agree- ment of 91% 2 . The named entities with lowest inter-annotator agreement were entities describ- ing Space Size and Type because of the some- what complex rules for determining essential list- ing space information. A supervised machine learning approach was <ref type="bibr">1</ref> PDFs were converted to HTML using the PDFTO- HTML conversion program http://pdftohtml. sourceforge.net/.</p><p>2 The inter-annotator agreement was measured as F1-score using one of the annotator's named entities as the gold stan- dard set and the other as a comparison set. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: The HTML versions of the flyers were annotated by 2 annotators using a custom web- based annotation tool. then applied to the task of identifying the 12 named entities shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Flyers were con- verted to text using an HTML parser while pre- serving some of the white space formatting. The text was tokenized and the task was then modeled as a BIO classification task, classifiers identify the Beginning, the Inside, and Outside of the text seg- ments. We first used a traditional set of text-based features for the classification task.  As noted previously, human annotators were able to quickly spot named entities of interest solely because of their visual characteristics. For example, a text-only version of the flyer shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, stripped of all rich formatting, will make it quite difficult to distinguish the listing address (shown in prominent size, position, and color) from the brokerage company address, which is rarely prominent as it is not considered important information in the context of the flyer. Similarly, the essential size information for the listing shown on <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> appears prominently on the first page (square footage of the offered restaurant), while non-essential size information, such as the size of the adjacent parking lot or basement, tend to ap- pear in smaller font on subsequent flyer pages.</p><p>To account for such visual characteristics we at- tempted to also include visual features associated with text chunks. We used the computed HTML style attributes for each DOM element containing text. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> lists the computed visual features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Name Description Font Size</head><p>The computed font-size attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element, normalized to 7 basic sizes (xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Color</head><p>The computed color attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element.</p><p>The RGB values were normalized to a set of 100 basic colors. We converted the RGB values to the YUV color space, and then used Euclidian distance to find the most similar basic color approximating human perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Y Coordinate</head><p>The computed top attribute of the surrounding HTML DOM element, i.e. the y-coordinate in pixels. The pixel locations was normalized to 150 pixel increments (roughly 1/5th of the visible screen for the most common screen resolution.) <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: List of visual features used for the NER task. A sliding window of 5 preceding and 5 fol- lowing DOM elements were used for all features.</p><p>Computing the HTML style attributes is a com- plex task since they are typically defined by a combination of CSS files, in-lined HTML style attributes, and browser defaults. The complex- ities of style definition, inheritance, and over- writing are handled by browsers 3 . We used the Chrome browser to compute dynamically the style of each DOM element and output it as inline style attributes. To achieve this we program- matically inserted a javascript snippet that inlines the computed style and saves the new version of the HTML on the local file system utilizing the HTML5 saveAs interface 4 . Details on how we normalized the style attribute values for font size, RGB color, and Y coordinate are shown in <ref type="table">Table  3</ref>.</p><p>We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Vapnik, 2000</ref>) on the NER task using the LibSVM library ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chang and Lin, 2011</ref>). We chose SVMs as they have been shown to perform well on a variety of NER tasks, for example ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Takeuchi and Collier, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mayfield et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2008)</ref>. We used a linear kernel model with the default parameters. The multi-class problem was converted to binary problems using the one-vs- others scheme. 80% of the documents were used for training, and the remaining 20% for testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. We compared clas- sifier performance using only textual features (first 3 columns), versus performance using both textual and visual features (next 3 columns). Results were averaged over 2 runs of randomly selected train- ing/test documents with 80%/20% ratio. We used an exact measure which considers an answer to be correct only if both the entity boundaries and en- tity type are accurately predicted.</p><p>The addition of visual features significantly 5 increased the overall F1-score from 83 to 87%. As expected, performance gains are more signif- icant for named entities that are typically visu- ally salient and are otherwise difficult (or impossi- ble) to identify in a text-only version of the fly- ers. Named Entities referring to listing address information showed the most significant improve- ments. In particular, the F1-score for mentions of Neighborhoods (typically prominently shown on the first page of the flyers) improved by 19%; F1- score for mentions of the listing State improved by 9%; and Street, City, Zip by roughly 4% each, all produced poor results on our dataset and failed to accurately compute the pixel location of text elements.</p><p>4 https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver. js <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The difference is statistically significant with p value &lt; 0.0001% using Z-test on two proportions.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Results from applying SVM using the textual features described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>, as well as both the textual and visual features described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 2 and 3</ref>. t=textual features only, v+t=visual + textual features, P=Precision, R=Recall, F=F1- score, S=Significant Difference statistically significant. Visual clues are also typi- cally used when identifying relevant size informa- tion and, as expected, performance improved sig- nificantly by roughly 6%. The difference in per- formance for mentions used to describe confiden- tial information is not statistically significant 6 be- cause such mentions rarely occurred in the dataset. Similarly, performance differences for Company Phone, Broker Phone, Broker Email, and Space Type are not statistically significant. In all of these cases, visual features did not influence per- formance and text-based features proved adequate predictors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have shown that information extraction in cer- tain genres and domains spans different media - textual and visual. Ubiquitous online and dig- ital formats such as PDF and HTML often ex- ploit the interaction of textual and visual elements. Information is often augmented or conveyed by non-textual features such as positioning, font size, color, and images. However, traditionally, NER approaches rely exclusively on textual features and as a result could perform poorly in visually rich genres such as online marketing flyers or info- graphics. We have evaluated the performance gain on the task of NER from commercial real estate flyers by adding visual features to a set of tradi- tional text-based features. We used SVM classi- fiers for the task of identifying 12 types of named entities. Results show that overall visual features improved performance significantly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example of a commercial real estate flyer c Kudan Group Real Estate.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,81.10,66.19,200.07,257.79" type="bitmap" /></figure>
