				<p>The framing of an action influences how we perceive its actor. We introduce connotation frames of power and agency, a pragmatic formalism organized using frame semantic representations, to model how different levels of power and agency are implicitly projected on actors through their actions. We use the new power and agency frames to measure the subtle, but prevalent, gender bias in the portrayal of modern film characters and provide insights that deviate from the well-known Bechdel test. Our contributions include an extended lexicon of connotation frames along with a web interface that provides a comprehensive analysis through the lens of connotation frames.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A viewer's impression of a movie character is in- fluenced by how they are written and portrayed, which can in turn influence how people form stereotypes on gender norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Behm-Morawitz and Mastro, 2008)</ref>. A character's actions can be projected with varying levels of power and agency, depending on the specific verbs used. For instance, somebody who "accepts" things is implied to be a passive decision-maker (or of lower agency) than somebody who "assesses" things. While not ex- plicitly stated, these connotative meanings pro- jected by different verbs can influence the assump- tions the audience makes about the people being described. These assumptions can have negative consequences if they reinforce negative stereo- types ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Walton and Spencer, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>To formalize this implicit information about people projected by actions, we introduce power and agency connotation frames, two new types of The full example with additional nuanced discus- sion is available in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> in the appendix.</p><p>predicate-specific connotative relationships as an extension to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rashkin et al. (2016)</ref>'s connotation frame lexicon. For instance, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the verb "beckoning" implies that its theme (Irene) has less power than its agent (the man). In the third line, Irene displays strong agency when she "slices" in self-defense. In contrast, when the man "obeys", the man has low implied agency.</p><p>Using the new connotation lexicon, we present a quantitative study to reveal the subtle, but preva- lent gender 1 bias in modern films. Going beyond the surface level analysis such as screen time or number of female characters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Google, 2017)</ref>, our study aims for a more focused and precise anal- ysis of power differentials between fictional men and women.</p><p>In summary, our major contributions include the creation and release of a lexicon with two new connotative dimensions: power and agency and an AGENT THEME power(AG &lt; TH) VERB implore He implored the tribunal to show mercy.</p><p>The princess waited for her prince.</p><p>AGENT THEME agency(AG) = - VERB wait <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: The formal notation of the connotation frames of power and agency.

In particular, we find that high-agency women through the lens of connotation frames are rare in modern films. It is, in part, because some movies (e.g., Snow White) accidentally pass the Bechdel test and also because even movies with strong female characters are not entirely free from the deeply ingrained biases in social norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Connotation Frames of Power and Agency</head><p>We create two new connotation relations, power and agency (examples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>), as an expan- sion of the existing connotation frame lexicons. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Three AMT crowdworkers annotated the verbs with placeholders to avoid gender bias in the con- text (e.g., X rescued Y; an example task is shown in the appendix in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). We define the anno- tated constructs as follows:</p><p>Power Differentials Many verbs imply the au- thority levels of the agent and theme relative to one another. For example, if the agent "dom- inates" the theme (denoted as power(AG&gt;TH)), then the agent is implied to have a level of control over the theme. Alternatively, if the agent "hon- ors" the theme (denoted as power(AG&lt;TH)), the writer implies that the theme is more important or authoritative. We used AMT crowdsourcing to la- bel 1700 transitive verbs for power differentials. With three annotators per verb, the inter-annotator agreement is 0.34 (Krippendorff's α).</p><p>Agency The agency attributed to the agent of the verb denotes whether the action being described implies that the agent is powerful, decisive, and capable of pushing forward their own storyline. For example, a person who is described as "ex- periencing" things does not seem as active and de- cisive as someone who is described as "determin- ing" things. AMT workers labeled 2000 transi- tive verbs for implying high/moderate/low agency (inter-annotator agreement of 0.27). We denote high agency as agency(AG)=+, and low agency as agency(AG)=−.</p><p>Pairwise agreements on a hard constraint are 56% and 51% for power and agency, respec- tively. Despite this, agreements reach 96% and 94% when moderate labels are counted as agree- ing with either high or low labels, showing that an- notators rarely strongly disagree with one another. Some contributing factors in the lower KA scores include the subtlety of choosing between neutral  and positive/negative as well as the skews in the distributions of labels (i.e. more positive than neg- ative labels, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>). Note that a similar dif- ference between KA scores and soft percent agree- ment was found in our previous connotation frame work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rashkin et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Bias in Movie Scripts</head><p>We use 772 movie scripts from (Gorinski and La- pata, 2015) as a test bed to validate our new con- notation frames. Scripts have distinct structure, which allows us to easily parse narrations, dia- logues and character names.</p><p>We automatically extract 21K male/female characters, using a name-gender list <ref type="bibr">4</ref> along with gender specific lexicons (e.g., "actor"/"actresses", "duke"/"duchess") to automatically assign gender based on their first three narrations. To iden- tify verbs with characters as their agent, we de- pendency parse the narratives using the SpaCy <ref type="bibr">5</ref> parser. Power and agency label distributions in our corpus are consistent with the annotation distribu- tion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4)</ref>, and there is little variance across movies (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> in the appendix).</p><p>In our dataset, there are nearly twice as many men as there are women (34.6% women), in line with previous findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Smith et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Radford and Gallé (2015)</ref>. Women are also less present on screen and speak less in movies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Google, 2017)</ref>. We control for that disparity in all subsequent analyses by including the number of words for each character (standardized) as a co- variate. Findings in all the following sections hold when controlling for movie genre (as retrieved from IMDB.com), as well as when controlling for effects from individual movies. β gender agency(AG)=+ −0.951 M * * power(AG&gt;TH) −0.468 M * * agency(AG)=− 0.277 F * * power(AG&lt;TH) not sig. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Power and agency connotation frames for male and female narratives, controlled for length of narrative text. β represents the change in log- odds of a character being male/female were the corresponding frame to change by one unit. Sig- nificant results ( * * : p&lt;.001) are in bold. "Male" was coded as 0, "Female" as 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Bias in Narratives</head><p>Narratives describe what characters are doing. We investigate how they vary in terms of power and agency, using our connotation frames. We mea- sure how each standardized frame metric is asso- ciated with the gender of the character through a logistic regression, controlling for the total num- ber of words that the character said, and correcting for multiple comparisons using Holm's correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Holm, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>Listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, our results show that male characters are portrayed with higher level of agency compared to women. Men are also por- trayed to have more authority than women as they are more often the agent of powerful verbs.</p><p>This suggests that screenwriters tend to have fe- male characters contribute more to the aesthetic of the movie through low-agency verbs, rather than the plot, which is reminiscent of existing gender bias tests for movies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Yehl, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Bias in Character Expression</head><p>To further our validation of the new connota- tive dimensions, we look at how characters ex- press themselves in movies. Using our connota- tion frames and LIWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2016)</ref>, we compile metrics for every character's dialogue. As in subsection 3.1, metrics were stan- dardized for better β interpretability. LIWC re- sults that are not discussed below can be found in the appendix <ref type="table">(Tables 4 and 5)</ref>.</p><p>From <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, it seems male characters display more power and authority through their speech than their female counterparts do. Specifically, women are written to use more hedges (# Hedges) whereas men are written to use more imperative sentences (# Imperative Sent.), a finding that re-Frame/metric β gender agency(AG)=− 0.968 F * * agency(AG)=+ −2.177 M * * power(AG&gt;TH) −0.542 flects real-world dialogues ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Prabhakaran et al., 2014</ref>). The usage of imperatives tends to con- vey power and dominance according to the find- ings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bramsen et al. (2011)</ref>. Along with the fact that female characters tend to agree (assent) more than male characters, this corroborates the finding in subsection 3.1 that male characters are gener- ally given more power and agency. Furthermore, male characters use inhibitory language more (in- hib), which contains words pertaining to blocking or allowing, suggesting that these characters are in positions of power. Further evidence of power imbalances is found through function words. Women tend to use I and you pronouns more, whereas men use we and they pronouns more, echoing real life ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schwartz et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kacewicz et al. (2014)</ref> found an associa- tion between using "I" pronouns and being lower status, and conversely between "we" pronouns and being higher status. This corroborates the theory that women in movies are generally portrayed with a lower status than men.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M * * power(AG&lt;TH) 0.236 F * * # Imperative Sent. −0.232 M * * # Hedges 0.165 F * * I 0.835 F * * they −0.160 M * * we −0.361 M * * you 0.405 F * * assent 0.202 F * * space −1.136 M * * discrep 0.423 F * * inhib −0.171 M * *</formula><p>Men in movies tend to mention more physi- cal actions (space category) whereas women tend talk about what "could" be but isn't (discrep; e.g.,"should", "would"). This evokes more com- manding connotations for male characters and subordinate connotations for female ones, rein- forcing gender stereotypes.</p><p>These findings, rooted in previous research, confirm that our connotation frames capture exist-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Metric/Frame β P/F F dial. # Words 10.02 pass * * F dial. agency(AG)=+ −9.65 fail * * F dial. power(AG&gt;TH)</formula><p>2.05 pass * F narr. power(AG&gt;TH) −1.19 fail * <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Significant correlates of passing the Bechdel test.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Power, Agency and the Bechdel test</head><p>A movie passes the Bechdel test <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bechdel, 1986)</ref> if it (1) has two (named) female characters, (2) who talk to each other, (3) about something other than a man. While this is a low bar, a surprising number of movies fail at least one of the three criteria. In particular, as many as 42% of the movies in our dataset fail the test according to an online database of the Bechdel scores. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Beyond the Bechdel Test</head><p>We provide comparative insights between the analysis based on connotation frames and the Bechdel test. First, we aggregate our connota- tion frames, both on dialogue and narration, into movie-level averages per gender. Then, we add features capturing presence of female/male char- acters (e.g., # F/M words, # F/M characters). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the correlation between passing the Bechdel test and our movie-level connotation frame features using a multivariate logistic regres- sion.</p><p>As expected, a movie with more female speak- ing time is more likely to pass the Bechdel test since it mostly captures female representation. We also find that female characters using agent- empowering verbs, which tend to be more as- sertive, slightly increases the odds of passing the Bechdel test. Female speakers who use empower- ing verbs, regardless of the verb's agent, tend to go against the gender-norms of hedging and being less assertive (as we showed in subsection 3.2).</p><p>Unexpectedly, movies where women talk with high agency are much less likely to pass the Bechdel test. Perhaps these movies typically only show scenes of women interacting in a male-dominated setting. Similarly, the use of more agent-empowering verbs in female narra- tives decrease the odds of passing the Bechdel test. Chances of two powerful women talking to each other might be lower because movies are less likely to have a lot of powerful women. 7</p><p>Power and Agency of Princesses We further provide a qualitative analysis using Wikipedia plot summaries for movies that are not in our script dataset. Bechdel-passing movies with female pro- tagonists, such as Frozen <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> or <ref type="bibr">Cinderella (1950)</ref>, still perpetuate negative female stereo- types. In Frozen, Elsa is portrayed as the only high agency, high power woman, as seen below. 8 Anna and Cinderella, despite also being protago- nists, display significantly less power and agency. The Bechdel test is limited, either by being too inclusive of movies who portray women in non- authoritative, passive positions or by excluding movies that have strong women with agency, who just happen not to talk to each other about some- thing besides men. Our extensions to the connota- tion frame lexicon provide finer grained informa- tion about how women are portrayed through their expression and their actions, which can act com- plementary to measures of their presence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related work</head><p>There is much prior research focus on bias in so- cial media ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Garcia et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Prabhakaran et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ratkiewicz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yano et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Srivastava and Sahami, 2009)</ref>, complementing our investigation on movies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fast et al.
