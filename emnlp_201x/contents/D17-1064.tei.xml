			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a new sentence simplification task (Split-and-Rephrase) where the aim is to split a complex sentence into a meaning preserving sequence of shorter sentences. Like sentence simplification, splitting-and-rephrasing has the potential of benefiting both natural language processing and societal applications. Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP systems, it could be used as a preprocessing step which facilitates and improves the performance of parsers, semantic role labelers and machine translation systems. It should also be of use for people with reading disabilities because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter ones. This paper makes two contributions towards this new task. First, we create and make available a benchmark consisting of 1,066,115 tu-ples mapping a single complex sentence to a sequence of sentences expressing the same meaning. 1 Second, we propose five models (vanilla sequence-to-sequence to semantically-motivated models) to understand the difficulty of the proposed task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Several sentence rewriting operations have been extensively discussed in the literature: sen- tence compression, multi-sentence fusion, sen- tence paraphrasing and sentence simplification.</p><p>Sentence compression rewrites an input sen- tence into a shorter paraphrase <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Knight and Marcu, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cohn and Lapata, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Filippova and Strube, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pitler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Filippova et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Toutanova et al., 2016)</ref>. Sentence fusion consists of combining two or more sentences with over- lapping information content, preserving common information and deleting irrelevant details <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(McKeown et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Filippova, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thadani and McKeown, 2013)</ref>. Sentence paraphrasing aims to rewrite a sentence while preserving its mean- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dras, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barzilay and McKeown, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wubben et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mallinson et al., 2017)</ref>. Finally, sentence (or text) simplification aims to produce a text that is easier to understand <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Siddharthan et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wubben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Narayan and Gardent, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Xu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Narayan and Gardent, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zhang and Lapata, 2017)</ref>. Because the vocabulary used, the length of the sentences and the syntactic structures occurring in a text are all factors known to af- fect readability, simplification systems mostly fo- cus on modelling three main text rewriting opera- tions: simplifying paraphrasing, sentence splitting and deletion.</p><p>We propose a new sentence simplification task, which we dub Split-and-Rephrase, where the goal is to split a complex input sentence into shorter sentences while preserving meaning. In that task, the emphasis is on sentence splitting and rephras- ing. There is no deletion and no lexical or phrasal simplification but the systems must learn to split complex sentences into shorter ones and to make the syntactic transformations required by the split (e.g., turn a relative clause into a main clause). Ta- ble 1 summarises the similarities and differences between the five sentence rewriting tasks.</p><p>Like sentence simplification, splitting-and- rephrasing could benefit both natural language processing and societal applications. Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP systems, it could be used as a preprocess- ing step which facilitates and improves the per- formance of parsers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tomita, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McDonald and Nivre, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jelínek, 2014)</ref>, semantic role labelers <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Vickrey and Koller, 2008)</ref> and statistical machine transla- tion (SMT) systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chandrasekar et al., 1996</ref>). In addition, because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter ones, it should also be of use for people with reading disabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Inui et al., 2003</ref>) such as aphasia patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carroll et al., 1999</ref>), low-literacy readers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Watanabe et al., 2009)</ref>, language learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Siddharthan, 2002</ref>) and children <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Belder and Moens, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Contributions. We make two main contribu- tions towards the development of Split-and- Rephrase systems.</p><p>Our first contribution consists in creating and making available a benchmark for training and testing Split-and-Rephrase systems. This bench- mark (WEBSPLIT) differs from the corpora used to train sentence paraphrasing, simplification, compression or fusion models in three main ways.</p><p>First, it contains a high number of splits and rephrasings. This is because (i) each complex sen- tence is mapped to a rephrasing consisting of at least two sentences and (ii) as noted above, split- ting a sentence into two usually imposes a syntac- tic rephrasing (e.g., transforming a relative clause or a subordinate into a main clause).</p><p>Second, the corpus has a vocabulary of 3,311 word forms for a little over 1 million training items which reduces sparse data issues and facilitates learning. This is in stark contrast to the relatively small size corpora with very large vocabularies used for simplification (cf. Section 2).</p><p>Third, complex sentences and their rephrasings are systematically associated with a meaning rep- resentation which can be used to guide learn- ing. This allows for the learning of semantically- informed models (cf. Section 5).</p><p>Our second contribution is to provide five mod- els to understand the difficulty of the proposed Split-and-Rephrase task: (i) A basic encoder- decoder taking as input only the complex sen- tence; (ii) A hybrid probabilistic-SMT model tak- ing as input a deep semantic representation (Dis- course representation structures, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kamp 1981)</ref> of the complex sentence produced by Boxer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Curran et al., 2007)</ref>; (iii) A multi-source encoder- decoder taking as input both the complex sentence and the corresponding set of RDF (Resource De- scription Format) triples; (iv,v) Two partition-and- generate approaches which first, partition the se- mantics (set of RDF triples) of the complex sen- tence into smaller units and then generate a text for each RDF subset in that partition. One model is multi-source and takes the input complex sentence into account when generating while the other does not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>We briefly review previous work on sentence split- ting and rephrasing.</p><p>Sentence Splitting. Of the four sentence rewrit- ing tasks (paraphrasing, fusion, compression and simplification) mentioned above, only sentence simplification involves sentence splitting. Most simplification methods learn a statistical model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Coster and Kauchak, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wubben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Narayan and Gardent, 2014</ref>) from the par- allel dataset of complex-simplified sentences de- rived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhu et al. (2010)</ref> from Simple English Wikipedia 2 and the traditional one 3 .</p><p>For training Split-and-Rephrase models, this dataset is arguably ill suited as it consists of 108,016 complex and 114,924 simplified sen- tences thereby yielding an average number of sim- ple sentences per complex sentence of 1.06. In- deed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Narayan and Gardent (2014)</ref> report that only 6.1% of the complex sentences are in fact split in the corresponding simplification. A more detailed evaluation of the dataset by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Xu et al. (2015)</ref> fur- ther shows that (i) for a large number of pairs, the simplifications are in fact not simpler than the in- put sentence, (ii) automatic alignments resulted in incorrect complex-simplified pairs and (iii) mod- els trained on this dataset generalised poorly to other text genres. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Xu et al. (2015)</ref> therefore pro- pose a new dataset, Newsela, which consists of 1,130 news articles each rewritten in four different ways to match 5 different levels of simplicity. By pairing each sentence in that dataset with the cor- responding sentences from simpler levels (and ig- noring pairs of contiguous levels to avoid sentence pairs that are too similar to each other), it is possi- ble to create a corpus consisting of 96,414 distinct complex and 97,135 simplified sentences. Here again however, the proportion of splits is very low.</p><p>As we shall see in Section 3.3, the new dataset we propose differs from both the Newsela and the Wikipedia simplification corpus, in that it con- tains a high number of splits. In average, this new dataset associates 4.99 simple sentences with each complex sentence.</p><p>Rephrasing. Sentence compression, sentence fusion, sentence paraphrasing and sentence sim- plification all involve rephrasing.</p><p>Paraphrasing approaches include bootstrapping approaches which start from slotted templates (e.g.,"X is the author of Y") and seed (e.g.,"X = Jack Kerouac, Y = "On the Road"") to iteratively learn new templates from the seeds and new seeds from the new templates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Duclaye et al., 2003)</ref>; systems which extract paraphrase patterns from large monolingual cor- pora and use them to rewrite an input text <ref type="bibr">(Duboue and Chu-Carroll, 2006;</ref>; sta- tistical machine translation (SMT) based systems which learn paraphrases from monolingual paral- lel ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barzilay and McKeown, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zhao et al., 2008</ref>), comparable <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Quirk et al., 2004</ref>) or bilingual parallel ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005</ref>; Gan- itkevitch et al., 2011) corpora; and a recent neural machine translation (NMT) based system which learns paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mallinson et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In sentence simplification approaches, rephras- ing is performed either by a machine transla- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Coster and Kauchak, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wubben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Narayan and Gardent, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Xu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zhang and Lapata, 2017)</ref> or by a probabilistic model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Woodsend and Lapata, 2011</ref>). Other approaches include symbolic ap- proaches where hand-crafted rules are used e.g., to split coordinated and subordinated sentences into several, simpler clauses <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Siddharthan, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Canning, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Siddharthan, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Siddharthan, , 2011</ref>) and lexical rephrasing rules are induced from the Wikipedia simplification cor- pus <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014</ref>).</p><p>Most sentence compression approaches focus on deleting words (the words appearing in the compression are words occurring in the input) and therefore only perform limited paraphrasing. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pitler (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Toutanova et al. (2016)</ref> however, the ability to paraphrase is key for the development of abstractive summarisation systems since summaries written by humans of- ten rephrase the original content using paraphrases or synonyms or alternative syntactic constructions. Recent proposals by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rush et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bingel and Søgaard (2016)</ref> address this issue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rush et al. (2015)</ref> proposed a neural model for abstractive compression and summarisation, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bingel and Søgaard (2016)</ref> proposed a structured approach to text simplification which jointly predicts possible compressions and paraphrases.</p><p>None of these approaches requires that the in- put be split into shorter sentences so that both the corpora used, and the models learned, fail to ad- equately account for the various types of specific rephrasings occurring when a complex sentence is split into several shorter sentences.</p><p>Finally, sentence fusion does induce rephrasing as one sentence is produced out of several. How- ever, research in that field is still hampered by the small size of datasets for the task, and the difficulty of generating one <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Daume III and Marcu, 2004</ref>). Thus, the dataset of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thadani and McKeown (2013)</ref> only consists of 1,858 fusion instances of which 873 have two inputs, 569 have three and 416 have four. This is arguably not enough for learning a general Split-and-Rephrase model.</p><p>In sum, while work on sentence rewriting has made some contributions towards learning to split and/or to rephrase, the interaction between these two subtasks have never been extensively studied nor are there any corpora available that would sup- port the development of models that can both split and rephrase. In what follows, we introduce such a benchmark and present some baseline models which provide some interesting insights on how to address the Split-and-Rephrase problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>608</head><p>We derive a Split-and-Rephrase dataset from the WEBNLG corpus presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gardent et al. (2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The WEBNLG Dataset</head><p>In the WEBNLG dataset, each item consists of a set of RDF triples (M ) and one or more texts (T i ) verbalising those triples.</p><p>An RDF (Resource Description Format) triple is a triple of the form subject|property|object where the subject is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), the property is a binary relation and the object is either a URI or a literal value such as a string, a date or a number.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Creating the WEBSPLIT Dataset</head><p>To construct the Split-and-Rephrase dataset, we make use of the fact that the WEBNLG dataset (i) associates texts with sets of RDF triples and (ii) contains texts of different lengths and complexity corresponding to different subsets of RDF triples. The idea is the following. Given a WEBNLG MR- Text pair of the form (M, T ) where T is a sin- gle complex sentence, we search the WEBNLG dataset for a set {(M 1 , T 1 ), . . . , (M n , T n )} such that {M 1 , . . . , M n } is a partition of M and T 1 , . . . , T n forms a text with more than one sen- tence. To achieve this, we proceed in three main steps as follows.</p><p>Sentence segmentation We first preprocess all 13,308 distinct verbalisations contained in the WEBNLG corpus using the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) to segment each verbalisation T i into sentences.</p><p>Sentence segmentation allows us to associate each text T in the WEBNLG corpus with the num- ber of sentences it contains. This is needed to identify complex sentences with no split (the in- put to the Split-and-Rephrase task) and to know how many sentences are associated with a given set of RDF triples (e.g., 2 triples may be re- alised by a single sentence or by two). As the CoreNLP sentence segmentation often fails on complex/rare named entities thereby producing unwarranted splits, we verified the sentence seg- mentations produced by the CoreNLP sentence segmentation module for each WEBNLG verbali- sation and manually corrected the incorrect ones.</p><p>Pairing Using the semantic information given by WEBNLG RDF triples and the information about the number of sentences present in a WEBNLG text produced by the sentence seg- mentation step, we produce all items of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(M C , C), {(M 1 , T 1 ) . . . (M n , T n )}} such that:</formula><p>• C is a single sentence with semantics M C .</p><p>• T 1 . . . T n is a sequence of texts that contains at least two sentences.</p><p>• The disjoint union of the semantics M 1 . . . M n of the texts T 1 . . . T n is the same as the semantics M C of the complex sentence C. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M C = M 1 . . . M n .</formula><p>This pairing is made easy by the semantic in- formation contained in the WEBNLG corpus and includes two subprocesses depending on whether complex and split sentences come from the same WEBNLG entry or not.</p><p>Within entries. Given a set of RDF triples M C , a WEBNLG entry will usually contain several alter- native verbalisations for M C (e.g., T 1 1 and T 2 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> are two possible verbalisations of M 1 ). We first search for entries where one verbalisa- tion T C consists of a single sentence and another verbalisation T contains more than one sentence. For such cases, we create an entry of the form (M C , T C ), {(M C , T )}} such that, T C is a single sentence and T is a text consisting of more than one sentence. The second example item for WEB- SPLIT in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>   a WEBSPLIT item associating the complex sen- tence (T 1 1 ) with a text (T 2 1 ) made of three short sentences.</p><p>Across entries.</p><p>Next we create (M, C), {(M 1 , T 1 ) . . . (M n , T n )}} entries by searching for all WEBNLG texts C consisting of a single sentence. For each such text, we create all possible partitions of its semantics M C and for each partition, we search the WEBNLG corpus for matching entries i.e., for a set S of (M i , T i ) pairs such that (i) the disjoint union of the semantics M i in S is equal to M C and (ii) the resulting set of texts contains more than one sentence. The first example item for WEBSPLIT in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is a case in point. C(= T 1 1 ) is the single, complex sentence whose meaning is represented by the three triples M . T 2 , T 3 is the sequence of shorter texts C is mapped to. And the semantics M 2 and M 3 of these two texts forms a partition over M .</p><p>Ordering. For each item (M C , C), {(M 1 , T 1 ) . . . (M n , T n )}} produced in the preceding step, we determine an order on T 1 . . . T n as follows. We observed that the WEBNLG texts mostly 5 follow the order in which the RDF triples are presented. Since this order corresponds to a left-to-right depth-first traversal of the RDF tree, we use this order to order the sentences in the T i texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results</head><p>By applying the above procedure to the WEBNLG dataset, we create 1,100,166 pairs of the form (M C , T C ), {(M 1 , T 1 ) . . . (M n , T n )}} where T C is a complex sentence and T 1 . . . T n is a sequence of texts with semantics M 1 , . . . M n expressing the same content M C as T C . 1,945 of these pairs were of type "Within entries" and the rest were of type "Across entries". In total, there are 1,066,115 dis- tinct T C , T 1 . . . T n pairs with 5,546 distinct com- plex sentences. Complex sentences are associated with 192.23 rephrasings in average (min: 1, max: 76283, median: 16). The number of sentences in the rephrasings varies between 2 and 7 with an av- erage of 4.99. The vocabulary size is 3,311.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Problem Formulation</head><p>The Split-and-Rephrase task can be defined as fol- lows. Given a complex sentence C, the aim is to produce a simplified text T consisting of a se- quence of texts T 1 . . . T n such that T forms a text of at least two sentences and the meaning of C is preserved in T . In this paper, we proposed to ap- proach this problem in a supervised setting where we aim to maximise the likelihood of T given C and model parameters θ: P (T |C; θ). To exploit the different levels of information present in the WEBSPLIT benchmark, we break the problem in the following ways:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (T |C; θ) = M C P (T |C; MC ; θ)P (MC |C; θ) (1) = P (T |C; MC ; θ), if MC is known. (2) = M 1−n P (T |C; MC ; M1−n; θ)× P (M1−n|C; MC ; θ)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where, M C is the meaning representation of C and M 1−n is a set {M 1 , . . . , M n } which partitions M C .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Split-and-Rephrase Models</head><p>In this section, we propose five different models which aim to maximise P (T |C; θ) by exploiting different levels of information in the WEBSPLIT benchmark.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">A Probabilistic, Semantic-Based Approach</head><p>Narayan and Gardent (2014) describes a sen- tence simplification approach which combines a probabilistic model for splitting and deletion with a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) and a language model for rephrasing (re- ordering and substituting words). In particular, the splitting and deletion components exploit the deep meaning representation (a Discourse Representa- tion Structure, DRS) of a complex sentence pro- duced by Boxer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Curran et al., 2007</ref>). Based on this approach, we create a Split-and- Rephrase model (aka HYBRIDSIMPL) by (i) in- cluding only the splitting and the SMT models (we do not learn deletion) and (ii) training the model on the WEBSPLIT corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">A Basic Sequence-to-Sequence Approach</head><p>Sequence-to-sequence models (also referred to as encoder-decoder) have been successfully applied to various sentence rewriting tasks such as ma- chine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sutskever et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2014</ref>), abstractive summarisation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rush et al., 2015</ref>) and response generation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Shang et al., 2015)</ref>. They first use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to convert a source sequence to a dense, fixed-length vector representation (encoder). They then use another recurrent network (decoder) to convert that vector to a target sequence.</p><p>We use a three-layered encoder-decoder model with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory, (Hochre- iter and Schmidhuber, 1997)) units for the Split- and-Rephrase task. Our decoder also uses the local-p attention model with feed input as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luong et al., 2015)</ref>. It has been shown that the lo- cal attention model works better than the standard global attention model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al. (2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">A Multi-Source Sequence-to-Sequence Approach</head><p>In this model, we learn a multi-source model which takes into account not only the input com- plex sentence but also the associated set of RDF triples available in the WEBSPLIT dataset. That is, we maximise P (T |C; M C ; θ) (Eqn. 2) and learn a model to predict, given a complex sentence C and its semantics M C , a rephrasing of C.</p><p>As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gardent et al. (2017)</ref>, the shape of the input may impact the syntactic structure of the corresponding text. For instance, an input contain- ing a path (X|P 1 |Y )(Y |P 2 |Z) equating the object of a property P 1 with the subject of a property P 2 may favour a verbalisation containing a sub- ject relative ("x V 1 y who V 2 z"). Taking into account not only the sentence C that needs to be rephrased but also its semantics M C may therefore help learning.</p><p>We model P (T |C; M C ; θ) using a multi-source sequence-to-sequence neural framework (we re- fer to this model as MULTISEQ2SEQ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Partitioning and Generating</head><p>As the name suggests, the Split-and-Rephrase task can be seen as a task which consists of two sub- tasks: (i) splitting a complex sentence into sev- eral shorter sentences and (ii) rephrasing the in- put sentence to fit the new sentence distribution. We consider an approach which explicitly mod- els these two steps (Eqn. 3). A first model P (M 1 , . . . , M n |C; M C ; θ) learns to partition a set M C of RDF triples associated with a complex sen- tence C into a disjoint set {M 1 , . . . , M n } of sets of RDF triples. Next, we generate a rephrasing of C as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (T |C; M C ; M 1 , . . . , M n ; θ)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>≈ P (T |C; M 1 , . . . , M n ; θ)</p><p>= P (T 1 , . . . , T n |C; M 1 , . . . , M n ; θ) (6)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= n i P (T i |C; M i ; θ)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where, the approximation from Eqn. 4 to Eqn. 5 derives from the assumption that the generation of T is independent of M C given (C; M 1 , . . . , M n ).</p><p>We propose a pipeline model to learn parameters θ. We first learn to split and then learn to generate from each RDF subset generated by the split.</p><p>Learning to split. For the first step, we learn a probabilistic model which given a set of RDF triples M C predicts a partition M 1 . . . M n of this set. For a given M C , it returns the par- tition M 1 . . . M n with the highest probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P (M 1 , . . . , M n |M C ).</formula><p>We learn this split module using items (M C , C), {(M 1 , T 1 ) . . . (M n , T n )}} in the WEB- SPLIT dataset by simply computing the probabil- ity P (M 1 , . . . , M n |M C ). To make our model ro- bust to an unseen M C , we strip off named-entities and properties from each RDF triple and only keep the tree skeleton of M C . There are only 60 distinct RDF tree skeletons, 1,183 possible split patterns and 19.72 split candidates in average for each tree skeleton, in the WEBSPLIT dataset.</p><p>Learning to rephrase. We proposed two ways to estimate P (T i |C; M i ; θ): (i) we learn a multi- source encoder-decoder model which generates a text T i given a complex sentence C and a set of RDF triples M i ∈ M C ; and (ii) we approximate P (T i |C; M i ; θ) by P (T i |M i ; θ) and learn a sim- ple sequence-to-sequence model which, given M i , generates a text T i . Note that as described earlier, M i 's are linearised and tokenised before we input them to RNN encoders. We refer to the first model by SPLIT-MULTISEQ2SEQ and the second model by SPLIT-SEQ2SEQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experimental Setup and Results</head><p>This section describes our experimental setup and results. We also describe the implementation de- tails to facilitate the replication of our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Training, Validation and Test sets</head><p>To ensure that complex sentences in validation and test sets are not seen during training, we split the 5,546 distinct complex sentences in the WEB- SPLITdata into three subsets: Training set (4,438, 80%), Validation set (554, 10%) and Test set (554, 10%). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows, for each of the 5 models, a summary of the task and the size of the train- ing corpus. For the models that directly learn to map a complex sentence into a meaning pre- serving sequence of at least two sentences ( HY- BRIDSIMPL, SEQ2SEQ and MULTISEQ2SEQ), the training set consists of 886,857 C, T pairs with C a complex sentence and T , the corre- sponding text. In contrast, for the pipeline mod- els which first partition the input and then gen- erate from RDF data (SPLIT-MULTISEQ2SEQand SPLIT-SEQ2SEQ), the training corpus for learning to partition consists of 13,051 M C , M 1 . . . M n pairs while the training corpus for learning to gen- erate contains 53,470 M i , T i pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Implementation Details</head><p>For all our neural models, we train RNNs with three-layered LSTM units, 500 hidden states and a regularisation dropout with probability 0.8. All LSTM parameters were randomly initialised over a uniform distribution within [-0.05, 0.05]. We trained our models with stochastic gradient de- scent with an initial learning rate 0.5. Every time perplexity on the held out validation set in- creased since it was previously checked, then we multiply the current learning rate by 0.5. We performed mini-batch training with a batch size of 64 sentences for SEQ2SEQ and MUL- TISEQ2SEQ, and 32 for SPLIT-SEQ2SEQ and SPLIT-MULTISEQ2SEQ. As the vocabulary size of the WEBSPLIT data is small, we train both en- coder and decoder with full vocabulary. We ran- domly initialise word embeddings in the begin- ning and let the model train them during training. We train our models for 20 epochs and keep the best model on the held out set for the testing pur- poses. We used the system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zoph and Knight (2016)</ref> to train both simple sequence-to-sequence and multi-source sequence-to-sequence models 6 , and the system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Narayan and Gardent (2014)</ref> to train our HYBRIDSIMPL model. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Results</head><p>We evaluate all models using multi-reference BLEU-4 scores ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>) based on all the rephrasings present in the Split-and-Rephrase corpus for each complex input sentence. 8 As BLEU is a metric for n-grams precision estima- tion, it is not an optimal metric for the Split-and- Rephrase task (sentences even without any split could have a high BLEU score). We therefore also report on the average number of output simple sen- tences per complex sentence and the average num- ber of output words per output simple sentence. The first one measures the ability of a system to split a complex sentence into multiple simple sen- tences and the second one measures the ability of producing smaller simple sentences. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows the results. The high BLEU score for complex sentences (SOURCE) from the WEB- SPLIT corpus shows that using BLEU is not suffi- cient to evaluate splitting and rephrasing. Because the short sentences have many n-grams in com- mon with the source, the BLEU score for com- plex sentences is high but the texts are made of a single sentence and the average sentence length is high. HYBRIDSIMPL performs poorly -we con- jecture that this is linked to a decrease in seman- tic parsing quality (DRSs) resulting from com- plex named entities not being adequately recog- nised. The simple sequence-to-sequence model does not perform very well neither does the multi- source model trained on both complex sentences and their semantics. Typically, these two mod- els often produce non-meaning preserving outputs (see example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>) for input of longer length. In contrast, the two partition-and-generate mod- els outperform all other models by a wide mar-SOURCE Alan Shepard was born in New Hampshire and he served as the Chief of the Astronaut Office .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPLIT-SEQ2SEQ</head><p>Alan Shepard served as the Chief of the Astronaut Office . Alan Shepard 's birth place was New Hampshire . gin. This suggests that the ability to split is key to a good rephrasing: by first splitting the input semantics into smaller chunks, the two partition- and-generate models permit reducing a complex task (generating a sequence of sentences from a single complex sentence) to a series of simpler tasks (generating a short sentence from a seman- tic input). Unlike in neural machine translation set- ting, multi-source models in our setting do not perform very well. SEQ2SEQ and SPLIT- SEQ2SEQ outperform MULTISEQ2SEQ and SPLIT-MULTISEQ2SEQ respectively, despite using less input information than their counter- parts. The multi-source models used in machine translation have as a multi-source, two trans- lations of the same content ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zoph and Knight, 2016)</ref>. In our approach, the multi-source is a complex sentence and a set of RDF triples, e.g., (C; M C ) for MULTISEQ2SEQ and (C; M i ) for SPLIT-MULTISEQ2SEQ. We conjecture that the poor performance of multi-source models in our case is due either to the relatively small size of the training data or to a stronger mismatch between RDF and complex sentence than between two translations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows an example output for all 5 sys- tems highlighting the main differences. HYBRID- SIMPL's output mostly reuses the input words sug- gesting that the SMT system doing the rewriting has limited impact. Both the SEQ2SEQ and the MULTISEQ2SEQ models "hallucinate" new infor- mation ("served as a test pilot", "born on <ref type="bibr">Nov 18, 1983")</ref>. In contrast, the partition-and-generate models correctly render the meaning of the input sentence (SOURCE), perform interesting rephras- ings ("X was born in Y" → "X's birth place was Y") and split the input sentence into two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed a new sentence simplification task which we call "Split-and-Rephrase". We have constructed a new corpus for this task which is built from readily-available data used for NLG (Natural Language Generation) evaluation. Initial experiments indicate that the ability to split is a key factor in generating fluent and meaning pre- serving rephrasings because it permits reducing a complex generation task (generating a text consist- ing of at least two sentences) to a series of sim- pler tasks (generating short sentences). In future work, it would be interesting to see whether and if so how, sentence splitting can be learned in the absence of explicit semantic information in the in- put.</p><p>Another direction for future work concerns the exploitation of the extended WebNLG corpus. While the results presented in this paper use a ver- sion of the WebNLG corpus consisting of 13,308 MR-Text pairs, 7049 distinct MRs and 8 DBpedia categories, the current WebNLG corpus encom- passes 43,056 MR-Text pairs, 16,138 distinct MRs and 15 DBpedia categories. We plan to exploit this extended corpus to make available a corre- spondingly extended WEBSPLIT corpus, to learn optimised Split-and-Rephrase models and to ex- plore sentence fusion (converting a sequence of sentences into a single complex sentence).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example entries from the WEBNLG benchmark and their pairing to form entries in the WEBSPLIT benchmark.</figDesc></figure>
