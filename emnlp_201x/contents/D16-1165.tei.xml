				<p>We address the problem of answering new questions in community forums, by selecting suitable answers to already asked questions. We approach the task as an answer ranking problem, adopting a pairwise neural network architecture that selects which of two competing answers is better. We focus on the utility of the three types of similarities occurring in the triangle formed by the original question , the related question, and an answer to the related comment, which we call relevance, relatedness, and appropriateness. Our proposed neural network models the interactions among all input components using syntactic and semantic embeddings, lexical matching , and domain-specific features. It achieves state-of-the-art results, showing that the three similarities are important and need to be mod-eled together. Our experiments demonstrate that all feature types are relevant, but the most important ones are the lexical similarity features , the domain-specific features, and the syntactic and semantic embeddings.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, community Question Answering (cQA) forums, such as StackOverflow, Quora, Qatar Living, etc., have gained a lot of popularity as a source of knowledge and information. These forums typically organize their content in the form of multi- ple topic-oriented question-comment threads, where a question posed by a user is followed by a list of other users' comments, which intend to answer the question.</p><p>Many of such on-line forums are not moderated, which often results in (a) noisy and (b) redundant content, as users tend to deviate from the question and start asking new questions or engage in conver- sations, fights, etc.</p><p>Web forums try to solve problem (a) in various ways, most often by allowing users to up/down- vote answers according to their perceived useful- ness, which makes it easier to retrieve useful an- swers in the future. Unfortunately, this negatively penalizes recent comments, which might be the most relevant and updated ones. This is due to the time it takes for a comment to accumulate votes. Moreover, voting is prone to abuse by forum trolls <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mihaylov et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mihaylov and Nakov, 2016a</ref>).</p><p>Problem (b) is harder to solve, as it requires that users verify that their question has not been asked before, possibly in a slightly different way. This search can be hard, especially for less experienced users as most sites only offer basic search, e.g., a site search by Google. Yet, solving problem (b) automat- ically is important both for site owners, as they want to prevent question duplication as much as possible, and for users, as finding an answer to their ques- tions without posting means immediate satisfaction of their information needs.</p><p>In this paper, we address the general problem of finding good answers to a given new ques- tion (referred to as original question) in one such community-created forum. More specifically, we use a pairwise deep neural network to rank com- ments retrieved from different question-comment threads according to their relevance as answers to the original question being asked.</p><p>A key feature of our approach is that we inves- tigate the contribution of the edges in the trian- gle formed by the pairwise interactions between the original question, the related question, and the re- lated comments to rank comments in a unified fash- ion. Additionally, we use three different sets of fea- tures that capture such similarity: lexical, distributed (semantics/syntax), and domain-specific knowledge.</p><p>The experimental results show that addressing the answer ranking task directly, i.e., modelling only the similarity between the original question and the answer-candidate comments, yields very low results. The other two edges of the triangle are needed to obtain good results, i.e., the similarity be- tween the original question and the related question and the similarity between the related question and the related comments. Both aspects add significant and cumulative improvements to the overall perfor- mance. Finally, we show that the full network, in- cluding the three pairs of similarities, outperforms the state-of-the-art on a benchmark dataset.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec- tion 2 discusses the similarity triangle in answer ranking for cQA, Section 3 presents our pairwise neural network model for answering new questions in community forums, which integrates multiple lev- els of interaction, Section 4 describes the features we used, Section 5 presents our evaluation setup, the ex- periments and the results, Section 6 discusses some related work, and Section 7 wraps up the paper with a brief summary of the contributions and some pos- sible directions for future work.</p><p>2 The Similarity Triangle in cQA <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> presents an example illustrating the simi- larity triangle that we use when solving the answer ranking problem in cQA. In the figure, q stands for the new question, q is an existing related question, and c is a comment within the thread of question q .</p><p>The edge qc relates to the main cQA task ad- dressed in this paper, i.e., deciding whether a com- ment for a potentially related question is a good an- swer to the original question. We will say that the relation captures the relevance of c for q.</p><p>The edge qq represents the similarity between the original and the related questions. We will call this relation relatedness.</p></div>

With regards to your query below, a foreigner is valid to drive in Doha with the following conditions: Foreign driver with his country valid driving license allowed driving only for one week from entry date Foreign driver with international valid driving license allowed driving for 6 months from entry date Foreign driver with GCC driving license allowed driving for 3 months from entry". As an Aussie your driving licence should be transferable to a Qatar one with only the eyetest (temporary, then permanent once RP sorted). Finally, the edge q c represents the decision of whether c is a good answer for the question from its thread, q . We will call this relation appropriateness.</p><p>In this particular example, q and q are indeed re- lated, and c is a good answer for both q and q. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In the past, the approaches to cQA were focused on using information from the new question q, an existing related question q , and a comment c within the thread of q , to solve different cQA sub-tasks. For example, answer selection, which selects the most appropriate comment c within the thread q , was addressed in <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Task 3 (Nakov et al., 2015</ref>. Similarly, question-question similarity, which looks for the most related questions to a given question, was addressed by many authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jeon et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Duan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li and Manandhar, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">dos Santos et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we solve the cQA task problem 2 in a novel way by using the three types of similarities jointly. Our main hypothesis is that relevance, ap- propriateness, and relatedness are essential to find- ing the best answer in a community Question An- swering setting. Below we present experimental re- sults that support this hypothesis. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The essence of this triangle is also described in SemEval 2016 Task 3 to motivate a three-subtask setting for cQA . In that evaluation exercise, q c and qq are pre- sented as subtask A and subtask B, respectively. In this paper, we mainly use them as similarity relations to be modeled in the learning architecture to solve the answer ranking task. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We use the task setup and the datasets from SemEval-2016 Task 3, focusing on subtask C ( ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1587</head><p>As explained above, we tackle answer ranking as a three-way similarity problem, exploring similar- ity features that capture lexical, distributed (seman- tics and syntax), and domain-specific knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a pairwise neural network (NN) approach for the cQA task, which is inspired by our NN framework for machine translation eval- uation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guzmán et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The input of the NN consists of the original question q, two competing comments, c 1 and c 2 , and the questions from the threads of the two comments, q 1 and q 2 . The out- put of the network is a decision about which of the two comments is a better answer to q.</p><p>The main properties of our NN approach can be summarized as follows: (i) it works in a pairwise fashion, which is appropriate for the ranking nature of the cQA problem; (ii) it allows for an easy in- corporation of rich syntactic and semantic embed- ded representations of the input texts; (iii) it models non-linear relationships between all input elements (q, c 1 , c 2 , q 1 and q 2 ), which allows us to study the interactions and the impact of the three types of sim- ilarity (relevance, relatedness and appropriateness) when solving the answer ranking task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Architecture</head><p>Our full NN model for pairwise answer ranking is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. We have a binary classification task with input x = (q, q 1 , c 1 , q 2 , c 2 ), which should output 1 if c 1 is a better answer to the original ques- tion q than c 2 , and 0 otherwise. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In this setting, q 1 and q 2 are questions related to q, whose threads con- tain the comments c 1 and c 2 , respectively. They pro- vide useful information to link the two comments to the original question. On the one hand, they allow to predict whether the comments are good answers within their respective threads. On the other hand, they allow to infer whether the questions for which the comments were produced are closely related to the original question. The pair of comments can be- long to the same thread (i.e., q 1 ≡ q 2 ) or they can come from different threads.</p><p>f(q,q' 1 ,c 1 ,q' 2 ,c 2 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ψ(q,q' 1 ) ψ(q,c 1 ) h q1 h q2 h 12 v x c1</formula><p>x c2</p><p>x q q c1 c2 sentences embeddings pairwise nodes pairwise features output layer</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q'1 x q'2 q'2 x q'1 ψ(q' 1 ,c 1 ) ψ(q,q' 2 ) ψ(q,c 2 ) ψ(q' 2 ,c 2 )</formula><p>Figure 2: The overall architecture of our neural net- work model for pairwise answer ranking in commu- nity question answering.</p><p>The feed-forward neural network com- putes a sigmoid function f (q,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q 1 , c 1 , q 2 , c 2 ) = sig(w T v φ(q, q 1 , c 1 , q 2 , c 2 ) + b v )</formula><p>, where φ(.) transforms the input through the hidden layer, w v are the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer, and b v is a bias term. The function φ(.) is actually a concatenation of three subfunctions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ(q, q 1 , c 1 , q 2 , c 2 ) = [φ 1 (q, q 1 , c 1 ), φ 2 (q, q 2 , c 2 ), φ 1,2 (q 1 , c 1 , q 2 , c 2 )].</formula><p>We first map the question and the comments to a fixed-length vector [x q , x q 1 , x c 1 , x q 2 , x c 2 ] using syntactic and semantic embeddings. Then, we feed this vector as input to the neural network, which models several types of interactions, using different groups of nodes in the hidden layer. Overall, we make use of three different groups of nodes in the hidden layer.</p><p>The first two groups include the relevance nodes h q1 and h q2 . These groups of hidden nodes model how relevant comment c j is to the original question q given that it belongs to the thread of the related question q j . In these hidden nodes, we model com- plex non-linear interactions between the distributed representations of q, q j and c j . Intuitively, these nodes are designed to learn to distinguish a relevant comment by extracting features from the distributed representations of a comment and of the question it is supposed to answer.</p><p>The last group of nodes in the hidden layer is the similarity node h 12 . It measures the similarity be- tween c 1 and c 2 and their respective questions q 1 and q 2 . This node is designed to compute the non- linear interactions between the syntactic and seman- tic representations of comment-comment, comment- question and question-question pairs. Intuitively, this can help disambiguate when comments are very similar or were generated from the same or from very similar questions.</p><p>The model further allows to incorporate exter- nal sources of information in the form of skip arcs that go directly from the input to the output layer, skipping the hidden layer. These arcs rep- resent pairwise similarity feature vectors inspired by the edges of the triangle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. In <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 2</ref>, we indicate these pairwise external feature sets as: ψ(q, q 1 ), ψ(q, q 2 ) for relatedness; ψ(q 1 , c 1 ), ψ(q 2 , c 2 ) for appropriateness; and ψ(q, c 1 ), ψ(q, c 2 ) for relevance. When including the skip-arc features, the activation at the output is f (q,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">q 1 , c 1 , q 2 , c 2 ) = sig(w T v [φ(q, q 1 , c 1 , q 2 , c 2 ), ψ(q, q 1 ), ψ(q, q 2 ), ψ(q 1 , c 1 ), ψ(q 2 , c 2 ), ψ(q, c 1 ), ψ(q, c 2 )] + b v ).</formula><p>We use these feature vectors to encode ma- chine translation evaluation measures, components thereof, cQA task-specific features, etc. The next section gives more detail about these features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Features</head><p>We experiment with three kinds of features: (i) lexi- cal features that measure similarity at a word, word n-gram, and paraphrase level, (ii) distributed repre- sentations that measure similarity at a syntactic and semantic level, (iii) domain-specific knowledge fea- tures, which capture similarity using thread-level in- formation and other features that have proven valu- able to solve similar tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nicosia et al., 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Lexical similarity features</head><p>These types of features measure similarity at a sur- face level between the following pairs: (q,q 1 ), (q,q 2 ), (q 1 , c 1 ), (q 2 , c 2 ), (q 1 , c 1 ), and (q 2 , c 2 ). They are in- spired by our previous work on Machine Transla- tion Evaluation (MTE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guzmán et al., 2015)</ref>, and we previously found them useful for finding good answers in a question-comment thread <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guzmán et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guzmán et al., 2016b</ref>).</p><p>MTFEATS We use (as pairwise features) the fol- lowing six machine translation evaluation features: (i) BLEU: This is the most commonly used mea- sure for machine translation evaluation, which is based on n-gram overlap and length ratios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>). (ii) NIST: This measure is similar to BLEU, and is used at evaluation campaigns run by NIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Doddington, 2002</ref>). (iii) TER: Trans- lation error rate; it is based on the edit distance between a translation hypothesis and the reference ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Snover et al., 2006</ref>). (iv) METEOR: A complex measure, which matches the hypothesis and the ref- erence using synonyms and paraphrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lavie and Denkowski, 2009)</ref>. (v) Unigram PRECISION and RECALL.</p><p>BLEUCOMP Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guzmán et al., 2015)</ref>, we further use as features various components that are involved in the computation of BLEU: n-gram precisions, n-gram matches, total number of n- grams (n=1,2,3,4), lengths of the hypotheses and of the reference, length ratio between them, and BLEU's brevity penalty. Again, these are computed over the same six pairs of vectors as before.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Distributed representations</head><p>We use the following vector-based embeddings of all input components: q, c 1 , c 2 , q 1 , and q 2 . GOOGLE VEC We use the pre-trained, 300- dimensional embedding vectors from WORD2VEC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>). We compute a vector rep- resentation of the text by simply averaging over the embeddings of all words in the text.</p><p>QL VEC We train in-domain word embeddings using WORD2VEC on all available QatarLiving data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Domain-specific features</head><p>We extract various domain-specific features that use thread-level and other useful information known to capture relatedness and appropriateness.</p><p>SAME AUTHOR We have a thread-level meta- feature, which we apply to the pairs (q 1</p><note type="other">, c 1 ), (q 2 , c 2 ). It checks whether the person answering the question is also the one who asked it, i.e., do the related ques- tion and the comment have the same author. The idea is that the person asking a question is unlikely to answer his/her own question, but s/he could ask a clarification question or thank another person who has provided a useful answer earlier in the thread.</note><p>CQ RANK FEAT We further have two thread- level meta-features related to the rank of the com- ment in the thread, which we apply to the pairs (q 1 , c 1 ) and (q 2 , c 2 ): (i) reciprocal rank of the com- ment in the thread, i.e., 1/ρ, where ρ is the rank of the comment; (ii) percentile of the number of com- ments in the thread, calculated as follows: the first comment gets the score of 1.0, the second one gets 0.9, and so on. Note that in our dataset, there are exactly ten comments per thread.</p><p>QQ RANK FEAT We also have three features modeling the rank of the related question in the list of related questions for the original question, which we apply to the pairs (q, q 1 ) and (q, q 2 ). In total, use the following six features: (i) the re- ciprocal rank of q 1 or q 2 in the list of related ques- tions for q; (ii) the reciprocal ordinal rank 5 of q 1 or q 2 in the list of related questions for q; (iii) the per- centile of the q 1 or q 2 in the list of related questions for q, calculated as for the comments.</p><p>CQRANK FEAT. Finally, we have features for the rank of the comment in the list of 100 comments for the original question, which we apply to the pairs (q, c 1 ) and (q, c 2 ): (i) reciprocal rank of the comment in the list; (ii) percentile of the comment in the list. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The related questions are obtained using a query to a search engine (using words from the original question), with results limited to QatarLiving. However, some of the returned results pointed to the wrong (non-forum) sections of the website or to questions with less than ten comments, and these were skipped. Suppose that the surviving top ten related questions were at ranks 3, 7, 18, ... in the original list. Now, we can use these ranks ρ, or we can use instead the ordinal ranks r: 1, 2, 3, ...</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TASK FEAT.</head><p>We further have features that have been proven useful in the answer selection task from <ref type="bibr">SemEval 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Task 3 (Nakov et al., 2015</ref>. This includes some comment-specific features, which refer to c 1 and c 2 only, but which we apply twice, to generate features for the pairs (q 1 , c 1 ), (q 2 , c 2 ), (q 1 , c 1 ), and (q 2 , c 2 ): number of URLs/images/emails/phone numbers; number of occurrences of the string thank; 6 number of to- kens/sentences; average number of tokens; number of nouns/verbs/adjectives/adverbs/pronouns; num- ber of positive/negative smileys; number of sin- gle/double/triple exclamation/ interrogation sym- bols; number of interrogative sentences (based on parsing); number of words that are not in word2vec's Google News vocabulary. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> And also some question-comment pair fea- tures, which we apply to the pairs (q 1 , c 1 ), (q 2 , c 2 ), (q 1 , c 1 ), and (q 2 , c 2 ): (i) question to com- ment count ratio in terms of sentences/tokens/ nouns/verbs/adjectives/adverbs/pronouns; (ii) ques- tion to comment count ratio of words that are not in word2vec's Google News vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>We experimented with the data from SemEval- 2016 Task 3 on "Community Question Answering". More precisely, the problem addressed is subtask C (Question-External Comment Similarity), which is the primary cQA task. For a given new question (re- ferred to as the original question), the task provides the set of the first ten related questions (retrieved by a search engine), each associated with the first ten comments appearing in the question-comment thread. The goal then is to rank the total of 100 comments according to their appropriateness with respect to the original question.</p><p>In this framework, the retrieval part of the task is done as a pre-processing step, and the challenge is to learn to rank all good comments above all bad ones. All the data comes from the QatarLiving fo- rum, and the related questions are obtained using Google search with the original question's text lim- ited to the www.qatarliving.com domain.</p><p>The task offers a higher quality training dataset TRAIN-PART1, which includes 200 original ques- tions, 1,999 related questions and 19,990 comments, and a lower-quality TRAIN-PART2, which we did not use. Additionally, it provides a development set (DEV, with 50 original questions, 500 related questions and 5,000 related comments) and a TEST set (70 original questions, 700 related questions and 7,000 related comments). Apart from the class la- bels for subtask C, the datasets also offer class labels for subtask A (i.e., whether a comment is a good an- swer to the question in the thread) and subtask B (i.e., whether the related questions is relevant for the original question).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Setting</head><p>we use Theano ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bergstra et al., 2010</ref>) to train our model on TRAIN-PART1 with hidden layers of size 3 for 100 epochs with minibatches of size 30, regu- larization of 0.05, and a learning rate of 0.01, using stochastic gradient descent with adagrad <ref type="bibr">(Duchi et al., 2011</ref>). We normalize the input feature values to the [−1; 1] interval using minmax, and we initialize the NN weights by sampling from a uniform distri- bution as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bengio and Glorot, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate the model on DEV after each epoch, and ultimately we keep the model that achieves the highest accuracy; 8 in case of a tie, we prefer the pa- rameters from a later epoch. We selected the above parameter values on the DEV dataset using the full model, and we use them for all experiments in Sec- tion 5.3, where we evaluate on the TEST dataset.</p><p>Note that, we train the NN using all pairs of (Good, Bad) comments, in both orders, ignoring ties. At test time, we compute the full ranking of comments by scoring all possible pairs, and by then accumulating the scores at the comment level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluation and baselines</head><p>The results are calculated with the official scorer from the SemEval-2016 Task 3. We report three ranking-based measures that are commonly ac- cepted in the IR community: Mean average preci- sion (MAP), which is the official evaluation mea- sure of the task, average recall (AvgRec), and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).</p><p>For comparison purposes, we report the results for two baselines. One corresponds to a random order- ing of the comments, assuming zero knowledge of the task. The second one is a more realistic baseline, which keeps the question ranking from the search engine (Google search) and the chronological or- der of the comments within the thread of teh related question. Although this may be considered a very na¨ıvena¨ıve baseline, it is actually notably informed. The question ranking from Google search takes into ac- count the relevance of the entire thread (question and comments) to the original question. Moreover, there is a natural concentration of the best answers in the first comments of the threads. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the evaluation results on the TEST dataset for several variants of our pairwise neural network architecture. Regarding our network con- figurations, we present the results from simpler to more complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Main results</head><p>Relevance The "Relevance only" network con- tains only the relevance relations and features cor- responding to q, c 1 and c 2 . The rest of the com- ponents are deactivated in the network. This corre- sponds to solving the task without any information about the related questions and the appropriateness of the comments in their threads, i.e., just by com- paring the texts of the comments and of the original question. In some sense, this setup is largely less informed than the IR baseline. The results are very low, being only ∼7 MAP points higher than the ran- dom baseline.</p><p>Relevance + appropriateness Adding the appro- priateness interactions between c 1 and q 1 , and be- tween c 2 and q 2 improves MAP by ∼9 points. Al- though more informed, as some information from the related questions is taken indirectly, the results of this system are still below the IR baseline.</p><p>Relevance + relatedness Adding the relatedness interactions and features between q and q 1 , and q and q 2 , turns out to be crucial. When added to the "Rel- evance only" basic system, the MAP score jumps to 52.43, significantly above the IR baseline. This shows that question-question similarity plays an im- portant role in solving the cQA task.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Results on the answer ranking task of our full NN vs. variants using partial information.</p><p>Full Network Adding both appropriateness and relatedness interactions yields an improvement of another two MAP points absolute (to 54.51), which shows that appropriateness features encode infor- mation that is complementary to the information modeled by relevance and relatedness. Note that the results with the other evaluation metrics (Av- gRec and MRR) follow exactly the same pattern. In summary, we can conclude that in order to solve the community question answering problem, we need to (i) find the best related questions, and (ii) judge the relevance of individual comments with respect to the new question. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the results of an ablation study when removing some groups of features. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> More specif- ically, we drop lexical similarities, domain-specific features, and the complex semantic-syntactic inter- actions modeled in the hidden layer between the em- beddings and the domain-specific features. We can see that the lexical similarity features (which we modeled by MT evaluation metrics), have a large impact: excluding them from the network yields a decrease of over eight MAP points. This can be explained as the strong dependence that related- ness has over strict word matching. Since questions are relatively short, a better related question will be one that matches better the original question. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Note that here we only show the impact of groups of fea- tures, e.g., we do not consider experiments with different em- beddings such as GOOGLE VEC, QL VEC, and SYNTAX VEC, which all belong to the lexical similarity group of features. This is because in previous work (which was limited to subtask A), our ablation study has shown that all features in a group clearly contribute to the overall performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guzmán et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guzmán et al., 2016b</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Results of the ablation study. As expected, eliminating the domain-specific fea- tures also hurts the performance greatly: by six MAP points absolute. Eliminating the use of dis- tributed representation has a lesser impact: 3.3 MAP points absolute. This is in line with our previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guzmán et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Guzmán et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guzmán et al., 2016b</ref>) that semantic and syntactic embeddings are useful to make a fine-grained dis- tinction between comments (relevance, appropriate- ness), which are usually longer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Features in perspective</head><p>We have also found that there is an interaction be- tween features and similarity relations. For example, for relatedness, lexical similarity is 2.6 MAP points more informative 10 than distributed representations. In contrast, for relevance, distributed representations are 0.7 MAP points more informative than lexical similarities. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> also presents the results of a system that has the full set of features, but eliminates the hid- den layer from the neural network. This is equiva- lent to training a Maximum Entropy classifier with the complete set of features. This simplified sys- tem performs consistently worse than the full NN model (−2.32 MAP, −2.7 AvgRec, and −2.99 MRR points), which shows that using the hidden layer to model the non-linear interactions between informa- tion sources has a decent overall contribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Impact of the hidden layer</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Making appropriateness more useful</head><p>Since the SemEval-2016 Task 3 datasets also pro- vide labeled examples for the so called "subtask A" (q c; appropriateness) and "subtask B" (qq ; related- ness), one could use this supervision to help train the neural network for the primary cQA task. We observed that relatedness has proven quite informa- tive. However, the improvements observed from us- ing appropriateness were more modest.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Using appropriateness predictions.</p><p>We present here a stacked experiment in which an additional neural network trained to predict appro- priateness is used to inform the full network model. More concretely, we train a feed-forward pairwise neural network for subtask A, which is a simplifi- cation of the architecture from <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The input is reduced to three elements (q , c 1 , c 2 ), where q is the thread question and c 1 and c 2 are a pair of com- ments in the thread. The output consists of deciding whether c 1 is a better answer to q than c 2 . All the pairwise interactions between input components are included in the hidden layer, and we use the same features to train the network as the ones described in Section 4 (obviously, this time the input and the fea- tures are reduced to those involving q , c 1 and c 2 ). We used this exact setting in previous work for solv- ing subtask A ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Guzmán et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guzmán et al., 2016b)</ref>.</p><p>We used the network to classify all subtask A ex- amples in TRAIN-PART1, DEV and TEST, and we used the resulting scores at the comment level as skip-arc features for the full NN model: (a) alone, included in ψ(q 1 , c 1 ) and ψ(q 2 , c 2 ), and (b) multi- plied by each of the QQ Rank feat features, included in ψ(q, c 1 ) and ψ(q, c 2 ).</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we observe that using the pre-trained network to incorporate subtask A predictions as fea- tures yields another sizable improvement to a final MAP of 55.82 (the increase is smaller for AvgRec, and MRR is slightly hurt), which suggests that pre- training parts of the NN with labeled examples to perform a dedicated task, is a promising direction for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Results in perspective</head><p>Next, in order to put our results in perspective, we compare them to the state of the art for this prob- lem, represented by the systems that participated in SemEval-2016 Task 3, subtask C. The comparison is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, where we list the top-3 systems, as well as the average and the worst scores for the official runs of all participating teams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System</head><p>MAP AvgRec MRR Full Network + subtask A preds. 55.82 61.63 62.39 * 1st <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mihaylova et al., 2016)</ref> 55.41 60.66 61.48 Full Network 54.51 60.93 62.94 * 2nd <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Filice et al., 2016)</ref> 52.95 59.27 59.23 * 3rd <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mihaylov and Nakov, 2016b)</ref> 51  We can see that all systems in the competition per- formed over the IR baseline with MAP scores rang- ing from 43.20 to 55.41. We can further see that our full network with subtask A predictions achieves the best results with 55.82 MAP. The margin over the best SemEval system is small in terms of MAP but more noticeable in terms of AvgRec and MRR. Note that, even without the Subtask A predictions, our pairwise neural network still produces results that are on par with the state of the art (with improve- ments slightly over one point in both cases).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Recently, a variety of neural network models have been applied to community question answering tasks such as question-question similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">dos Santos et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lei et al., 2015)</ref> and answer selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Severyn and Moschitti, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wang and Nyberg, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Feng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filice et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barrón-Cedeño et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mohtarami et al., 2016</ref>). Most of these papers concentrate on constructing advanced neural network architectures in order to model the problem at hand better.</p><p>For instance, dos <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Santos et al. (2015)</ref> propose a neural network approach combining a convolutional neural network and a bag-of-words representation for modeling question-question similarity. Simi- larly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tan et al. (2015)</ref> adopt a neural attention mech- anism over bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to generate better answer representations given the questions.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Lei et al. (2015)</ref> use a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural models to map questions to semantic representations. The mod- els are pre-trained within an encoder-decoder frame- work (from body to title) in order to de-noise the long question body from irrelevant text.</p><p>The main objective of our work here is different: we focus on studying the impact of the different in- put components in a novel cQA setting of ranking answers for new questions, and we use a more stan- dard neural network.</p><p>The setting of cQA as a triangle of three inter- related subtasks, which we use here, has been re- cently proposed in SemEval-2016 Task 3 on Com- munity Question Answering ( . Above, we empirically compared our results to those of the best participating systems. Unfortunately, most of the systems that took part in the compe- tition, including the winning system of the SUper team ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mihaylova et al., 2016)</ref>, approached the task indirectly by solving subtask A at the thread level and then using these predictions together with the reciprocal rank of the related questions to produce a final ranking for subtask C.</p><p>One exception is the Kelp system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filice et al., 2016)</ref>, which was ranked second in the competition. Their approach is most similar to ours, as it also tries to combine information from different subtasks and from all input components. It does so in a modu- lar kernel function, including stacking from inde- pendent subtask A and B classifiers, and it applies SVMs to train a Good vs. Bad classifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filice et al., 2016)</ref>. In contrast, our approach here proceeds in a pairwise setting, it is lighter in terms of features engineering, and presents a direct way to combine the relations between the different subtasks in an in- tegrated neural network model. Finally, our model uses lexical features derived from machine translation evaluation. Some previous work also used MT model(s) as a feature(s) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berger et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Echihabi and Marcu, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jeon et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Soricut and Brill, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Riezler et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li and Manandhar, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Surdeanu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tran et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoogeveen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wu and Zhang, 2016)</ref>, e.g., a variation of IBM model 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown et al., 1993)</ref>, to compute the probability that the ques- tion is a "translation" of the candidate answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a neural-based approach to a novel problem in cQA, where given a new question, the task is to rank comments from related question- threads according to their relevance as answers to the original question. We explored the utility of three types of similarities between the original ques- tion, the related question, and the related comment.</p><p>We adopted a pairwise feed-forward neural net- work architecture, which takes as input the origi- nal question and two comments together with their corresponding related questions. This allowed us to study the impact and the interaction effects of the question-question relatedness and comment- to-related question appropriateness relations when solving the primary cQA relevance task. The large performance gains obtained from using relatedness features show that question-question similarity plays a crucial role in finding relevant comments (+30 MAP points). Yet, including appropriateness re- lations is needed to achieve state-of-the-art results (+3.3 MAP) on benchmark datasets.</p><p>We also studied the impact of several types of fea- tures, especially domain-specific features, but also lexical features and syntactic embeddings. We ob- served that lexical similarity MTE features prove the most important, followed by domain-specific features, and syntactic and semantic embeddings. Overall, they all showed to be necessary to achieve state-of-the-art results.</p><p>In future work, we plan to use the labels for sub- tasks A and B, which are provided in the datasets in order to pre-train the corresponding components of the full network for answer ranking. We further want to apply a similar network to other semantic similarity problems, such as textual entailment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The similarity triangle in cQA.</figDesc></figure>
