				<p>We present a method of using cohesion to improve discourse element identification for sentences in student essays. New features for each sentence are derived by considering its relations to global and local cohesion, which are created by means of cohesive resources and subtopic coverage. In our experiments, we obtain significant improvements on identifying all discourse elements, especially of +5% F 1 score on thesis and main idea. The analysis shows that global cohesion can better capture thesis statements.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Automatic discourse analysis of student essays can benefit many downstream applications such as essay rating, text organization assessment and writing instruction. In this paper we focus on iden- tifying discourse elements for sentences in persua- sive essays written by Chinese high school stu- dents. Discourse elements represent the contribu- tions that sentences can make to text organization. Typical discourse elements and their functions in persuasive writing are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Previous work mainly exploits the properties of a sentence itself or adjacent sentences for this task. In this work, we explore cohesion to express re- lations among sentences through the whole text. Cohesion can be defined as a set of resources link- ing within a text that organize the text together <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Halliday and Hasan, 1976)</ref>. It can be achieved through the use of reference, ellipsis, substitution, conjunction and lexical cohesion. Among them, lexical cohesion has been widely used for mod- eling local coherence and applied to related ap- plications ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barzilay and Lapata, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Galley et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hsueh et al., 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filippova and Strube, 2006</ref>). Since cohesion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Element Definition</head><p>Introduction (I) introduces the background and/or grabs readers' attention Prompt (P) restates or summarize the prompt Thesis (T) states the author's main claim on the issue for which he/she is arguing</p><p>Main idea (M) asserts foundational ideas or aspects that are related to the thesis Supporting idea (S) provides evidence to explain or support the thesis and main ideas Conclusion (C) concludes the whole essay or one of the main ideas</p><p>Other (O) doesn't fit into the above elements or makes no meaningful contribution <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Definitions of discourse elements.</p><p>is closely related to the structure of text <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Morris and Hirst, 1991)</ref>, it motivates us to explore similar techniques for discourse element identification. In addition, its ease of implementation is also attrac- tive. Other options for representing text structure such as full-text discourse parsers (Marcu, 2000) may be not available or don't have satisfied per- formance, especially for non-English languages. However, modeling local coherence alone is not adequate to distinguish discourse elements in per- suasive essays. For example, a main idea may be followed by a supporting idea sentence. The two sentences can be coherent but their discourse ele- ments are different. To deal with this, global cohe- sion should be exploited. Considering that in per- suasive writing, thesis, main ideas and conclusion, which are termed thesis statements by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burstein et al. (2001)</ref>, are expected to relate to each other ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Higgins et al., 2004</ref>). It is likely that cohesive re- lations exist among them through the whole text.</p><p>We make a focused contribution by investigat- ing global and local cohesive relations. We create sentence chains based on cohesive resources and examine whether the chains represent global co- hesion or local cohesion. Our hypothesis is that global cohesion can better capture thesis state-  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Basic statistics of the annotated corpora. Para and sent are short for paragraph and sentence.</p><p>ments and help distinguishing them from over- whelming supporting idea sentences. Experi- ments were conducted on essays written by Chi- nese high school students in the mother tongue.</p><p>The results confirm our hypothesis. Our method achieves significant improvements of +%5 F 1 score on thesis and main idea sentences by adding cohesion features. The features related to global cohesion are most discriminative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data Annotation</head><p>We mainly use the discourse elements defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burstein et al. (2003b)</ref> except for adding a prompt element. The discourse element definitions are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We asked two labelers from the college of liberal art of a university to conduct data annotation. Provided a detail manual with element definitions, explanations and examples, the label- ers assigned a discourse element to each sentence. We collected three corpora, two of which (C1 and C2) are prompt-directed and one (C3) is prompt-free. All essays were written by Chinese high school students in Chinese. The prompt- directed essays are samples of essays written by senior high school students when they were tak- ing a mock examination. The students were re- quired to write a pervasive essay related to a given prompt. The prompts of corpora C1 and C2 are different. The prompt-free essays in C3 were crawled from an online writing assistance website, where the essays were used as writing examples of persuasive essays written by high school stu- dents. The average essay lengths on three corpora are 795, 772 and 864 Chinese characters respec- tively. The other basic statistics of the annotated corpora are listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>During annotation, the labelers found cases of difficulties about ambiguous elements. For exam- ple, content about the prompt and the main thesis can be mentioned in the same sentence. In such cases, thesis statements have priority over other el- ements to be labeled, since identifying thesis state- ments is more important for some potential appli- cations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burstein et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>From each corpus, 100 essays were labeled by both annotators for computing agreements, and the others were labeled independently. The label agreements measured with <ref type="bibr">Kappa (Cohen et al., 1960</ref>) are high as shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. The disagree- ments were resolved by discussion. The distri- butions of discourse elements are also shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. We can see that they are imbalanced. The supporting idea sentences account for more than 53%, while the thesis statements account for only 34% in total. As a result, the distinc- tion between minority thesis statements from over- whelming supporting idea sentences is a major challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Discourse Element Identification</head><p>Identifying discourse elements in student essays can be seen as a functional segmentation of dis- course ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Webber et al., 2011)</ref>. In this work, we fo- cus on utilizing supervised feature-based machine learning models for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Learning Models</head><p>Discourse element identification can be casted as a classification problem that sentences are classified independently using a classifier, e.g. naive Bayes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burstein et al., 2001</ref>), decision tree ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burstein et al., 2003b)</ref> and Support Vector Ma- chines (SVMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Stab and Gurevych, 2014)</ref>. It can also be solved in a sequence labeling framework, which models the whole sentence sequence and captures the correlations among predictions. For example, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have be studied for similar task on argumentative zon- ing of scientific documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guo et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>We will evaluate different types of features us- ing two representative models respectively: the SVM model and the linear-chain CRF model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Basic Features</head><p>Before feature extraction, sentence splitting, word segmentation,POS and NE tagging are done us- ing a Chinese language processing toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Che et al., 2010</ref>). Most basic features are adapted from previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burstein et al., 2003a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stab and Gurevych, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Persing et al., 2010)</ref>. For each sentence, the following feature sets are extracted. Position features The relative position of its para- graph (first, last or body) in the essay and its rel- ative position (first, last or body) in the paragraph are modeled as a set of binary features. The index of the sentence is also used as a feature. Indicator features Cue words/phrases like "我认 为(in my opinion)" and "总之(in conclusion)" are used as indicators. Partial indicators are adapted from the ones used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Persing et al. (2010)</ref>. More Chinese specific indicators are then augmented manually. We use a binary feature denoting a ref- erence to the first person ("我(I)","我们(We)") in the sentence. We also use a binary feature to in- dicate whether the sentence contains a modal verb like "应该(should)" and "希望(hope)". Lexical features Binary features are modeled for all connectives and adverbs, which are identified based on POS tags. Structural features The number of words, the number of clauses in the sentence and the num- ber of sentences in the same paragraph are used as features. We also define binary features based on punctuation which indicate whether the sentence ends with a full stop, question mark, exclamation mark or no sentence-final punctuation. Topic and prompt features For each sentence, the cosine similarities to the essay title and to the prompt are used as features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Identification based on Cohesion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Cohesive Chains</head><p>We mainly exploit reference and lexical cohesion. Creating identity chains Reference refers to re- sources for referring to a participant whose iden- tity is recoverable ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schiffrin et al., 2008)</ref>. We fo- cus on person identities, because person names might be mentioned when describing facts. Firstly, we extract all nouns/entities with a POS/NE tag person as identities. Secondly, we conduct a sim- ple third-person pronoun resolution by selecting the nearest proper antecedent identity within the same paragraph. Finally, an identity and all its anaphora together form an identity chain.</p><p>Creating lexical chains Lexical cohesion is re- ferred to relations between text using lexical repetition, synonymy or near synonymy. We don't distinguish between systematic semantic relations and non-systematic semantic relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzlánovich et al., 2008</ref>) nor use a thesaurus <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hirst and St-Onge, 1998</ref>). Instead, we compute the relatedness of two words based on their dis- tributed representations, which are learned using the Word2Vec toolkit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. The data for learning word representations consists of student essays and textbooks crawled from the Web. The vocabulary size is about 490k.</p><p>We extract nouns, adjectives and verbs (exclud- ing auxiliary verbs) instead of using nouns only <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hirst and St-Onge, 1998</ref>) for constructing lexical chains . We firstly cluster words into clusters in a graph based manner. Each word corresponds to a node in a graph. If the relatedness of two words is larger than a threshold T , they are considered as related and linked by an edge. After constructing all edges in this way, every connected subgraph forms a word cluster. Through the essay, all oc- currences of the words from the same cluster form a lexical chain.</p><p>We discard identity and lexical chains that exist within single sentences, since they can't capture cohesive relations among sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Global and Local Sentence Chains</head><p>We organize sentences based on cohesive chains. Sentences that contain members from the same identity chain or lexical chain form a sentence chain. The sentence chains represent cohesive re- lations among sentences.</p><p>In persuasive writing, discourse elements are commonly linked globally. For example, main ideas are usually related to each other because they are about different aspects of the main the- sis, and thesis and conclusion should echo each other as well. Therefore, we attempt to explic- itly categorize sentence chains into local chains and global chains based on subtopic coverage. A local chain represents sentences that share co- hesive relations and gather locally within single subtopics. In contrast, a global chain represents sentences with cohesive relations distribute across multiple subtopics. Heuristically, we expect that thesis statements can be better captured by global chains, while sentences that state facts or provide evidences are associated to local chains. Although subtopics can be identified by existing text segmentation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hearst, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filippova and Strube, 2006</ref>), we observe that in stu- dent essays a subtopic boundary usually coincides with a paragraph boundary and almost all subtopic segments are within one paragraph and only a few of subtopics are within two or more paragraphs. Therefore, we simply assume that each paragraph corresponds to a subtopic. Based on the assump- tion, chain classification is approximated based on chain span over paragraphs. A sentence chain is classified as a global chain, if its members appear in at least N paragraphs, otherwise it is classified as a local chain. We set N = 3, which means a global chain would cover at least two subtopics considering most subtopics finish within two para- graphs. One sentence can be involved in multiple sentence chains. An illustration of global and local sentence chains is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Cohesion Features from Sentence Chains</head><p>We develop cohesion features for a sentence from the sentence chains that involve it. Such features are beyond the intrinsic properties of the sentence itself but describe relations to other sentences. Chain-type features We consider four combined types of sentence chains: global-identity, local- identity, global-lexical and local-lexical chains. The number of each type of chains that involve the sentence is used as a feature. Global-title feature If the sentence is in a global sentence chain and the corresponding cohesive chain contains a word in the title, a binary fea- ture global-title is set as true, otherwise set as false. Containing globally distributed title words is thought of as an indicator of thesis statements. Interaction features <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hasan (1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasan ( , 1985</ref> defined that an interaction between two chains takes place when multiple members of a chain relate in the same way to more than one members of another chain, which can be used to distinguish central tokens from peripheral tokens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hoey (1991)</ref> ex- plored similar interactions to assess the centrality of sentences. This indicates that chain interactions might be signals of important content.</p><p>Similarly, we say two sentence chains interact with each other, if they have more than one sen- tence in common. An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>. Moreover, if two chains are both global chain, we term it a global interaction, otherwise a local interaction. The shared sentences by two chains are named as global or local interaction sentences accordingly. Two binary features are derived: the sentence is or not a global-interaction sentence and it is or not a local-interaction sentence. Strength features We attempt to measure the overall strength of the sentence chains that involve the sentence. The features include the number of chains, the maximum and average number of cov- ered sentences and paragraphs over chains, among which the ones related to paragraphs can be seen as measuring the global cohesion strength.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Settings</head><p>We evaluated the effectiveness of Cohesion fea- tures by comparing with the baseline that uses the Basic features introduced in Section 3.2.</p><p>We adopted precision(P ), recall(R) and F 1- measure(F 1) as evaluation metrics. The thresh- old T used to determine whether two words are related was set to 0.8 empirically. Because sen- tences with the discourse element Other are few, we didn't evaluate the performance on it.</p><p>We conducted experiments on three corpora re- spectively using 5-fold cross-validation. We com- pared various SVM classifiers with different ker- nels implemented in the LibSVM toolkit (Chang and Lin, 2011) and the linear-chain CRF model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>). When using CRF, the pre- diction of previous sentence is considered for cur- rent sentence. In our experiments, CRF achieves significant superior performance than SVM both when using basic features alone and after adding cohesion features. This indicates that incorporat- ing correlations among sequential predictions are important for this task. Next, we only report the experimental results of using the CRF Model.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Experimental results on six discourse elements over three corpora using the CRF model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Element Features C1 C2 C3 P R F 1 P R F 1 P R F 1 avg. △ (F 1)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experimental Results</head><p>The experimental results on three corpora are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We tested statistical signifi- cance for F 1 scores and found that all improve- ments were significant with p &lt; 0.01 based on the pairwise t-test. We can see that adding cohe- sion features obtain improvements on all discourse elements over three corpora. Especially, the cohe- sion features contribute to large improvements of +5.1% and +5.4% average F 1 score on identifying thesis and main idea sentences. By analyzing the confusion matrix, we found that the improvements mainly come from more accurately distinguishing thesis and main idea sentences from introduction and supporting idea sentences.</p><p>We are interested in that which between the lo- cal and global cohesion contributes more to dis- tinguish thesis statements. To this end, we used Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Swets, 1988)</ref> to measure the discriminative power of individual features. Larger AUC of a feature indicates bet- ter discriminative performance. The experiment was done on the dataset mixing all sentences from three corpora. We divided sentences into thesis statements and non-thesis statements according to their true element labels. As the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Ta- ble 4</ref> show, global cohesion related features are of higher rank with regard to the discriminative power. Local cohesion relates more to non-thesis statements, though it is not so discriminative as global cohesion. The results indicate that sepa- rating global cohesion from local cohesion help the distinction between thesis statements and oth- ers. Features related to identity chains alone don't show much discriminative ability. But they in- crease the macro F 1 score by 0.9% in combina-  </p></div>
