			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we introduce a new distri-butional method for modeling predicate-argument thematic fit judgments. We use a syntax-based DSM to build a prototyp-ical representation of verb-specific roles: for every verb, we extract the most salient second order contexts for each of its roles (i.e. the most salient dimensions of typical role fillers), and then we compute thematic fit as a weighted overlap between the top features of candidate fillers and role prototypes. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms a baseline re-implementing a state-of-the-art system, and achieves better or comparable results to those reported in the literature for the other unsupervised systems. Moreover, it provides an explicit representation of the features characterizing verb-specific semantic roles.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Several psycholinguistic studies in the last two decades have brought extensive evidence that hu- mans activate a rich array of event knowledge dur- ing sentence processing: verbs (e.g. arrest) ac- tivate expectations about their typical arguments (e.g. cop, thief ) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McRae et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann and Kamide, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ferretti et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McRae et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hare et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Matsuki et al., 2011</ref>), and nouns activate other nouns typically co-occurring in the same events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kamide et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bicknell et al., 2010)</ref>. Subjects are able to determine the plausibility of a noun for a given argument role and quickly use this knowledge to anticipate upcoming linguistic input <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(McRae and Matsuki, 2009)</ref>. This phenomenon is referred to in the lit- erature as thematic fit. Thematic fit estimation has been extensively used in sentence comprehen- sion studies on constraint-based models, mainly as a predictor variable allowing to disambiguate be- tween possible structural analyses. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> More in gen- eral, thematic fit is considered as a key factor in a variety of studies concerned with structural ambi- guity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vandekerckhove et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Starting from the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Erk et al. (2010)</ref>, several distributional semantic methods have been proposed to compute the extent to which nouns fulfill the requirements of verb-specific thematic roles, and their performances have been evaluated against human-generated judgments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baroni and Lenci, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lenci, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sayeed and Demberg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sayeed et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Greenberg et al., 2015a,b)</ref>. Most research on thematic fit estima- tion has focused on count-based vector representa- tions (as distinguished from prediction-based vec- tors). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Indeed, in their comparison between high- dimensional explicit vectors and low-dimensional neural embeddings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al. (2014)</ref> found that thematic fit estimation is the only benchmark on which prediction models are lagging behind state- of-the-art performance. This is consistent with 's observation that "thematic fit modeling is particularly sensitive to linguistic detail and interpretability of the vector space".</p><p>The present work sets itself among the un- supervised approaches to thematic fit estima- tion. By relying on explicit and interpretable count-based vector representations, we propose a simple, cognitively-inspired, and efficient the- matic fit model using information extracted from dependency-parsed corpora. The key features of our proposal are a) prototypical representations of verb-specific thematic roles, based on feature weighting and filtering of second order contexts (i.e. contexts that are salient for many of the typ- ical fillers of a given verb-specific thematic role), and b) a similarity measure which computes the Weighted Overlap (W O) between prototypes and candidate fillers. <ref type="bibr">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Erk et al. (2010)</ref> were, at the best of our knowl- edge, the first authors to measure the correlation between human-elicited thematic fit ratings and the scores assigned by a syntax-based Distribu- tional Semantic Model (DSM). More specifically, their gold standard consisted of the human judg- ments collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McRae et al. (1998) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pad√≥ (2007)</ref>. The plausibility of each verb-filler pair was computed as the similarity between new can- didate nouns and previously attested exemplars for each specific verb-role pairing (as already pro- posed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Erk (2007)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Baroni and Lenci (2010) evaluated their Dis- tributional Memory (henceforth DM) 4 framework on the same datasets, adopting an approach to the task that has become dominant in the literature: for each verb role, they built a prototype vector by averaging the dependency-based vectors of its most typical fillers. The higher the similarity of a noun with a role prototype, the higher its plau- sibility as a filler for that role. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lenci (2011)</ref> has later extended the model to account for the dy- namic update of the expectations on an argument, depending on how another role is filled. By using the same DM tensor, this study tested an additive and a multiplicative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mitchell and Lapata, 2010)</ref> to compose and update the expectations on the patient filler of the subject-verb-object triples of the Bicknell dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bicknell et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The thematic fit models proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sayeed and Demberg (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sayeed et al. (2015)</ref> are similar to Baroni and Lenci's, but their DSMs were built by using the roles assigned by the SENNA semantic role labeler <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Collobert et al., 2011</ref>) to define the feature space. These authors argued that the prototype-based method with de- pendencies works well when applied to the agent and to the patient role (which are almost always syntactically realized as subjects and objects), but that it might be problematic to apply it to dif- ferent roles, such as instruments and locations, as the construction of the prototype would have to rely on prepositional complements as typical fillers, and the meaning of prepositions can be am- biguous. Comparing their results with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baroni and Lenci (2010)</ref>, the authors showed that their system outperforms the syntax-based model DepDM and almost matches the scores of the best performing TypeDM, which uses hand-crafted rules. More- over, they were the first to evaluate thematic role plausibility for roles other than agent and patient, as they computed the scores also for the instru- ments and for the locations of the Ferretti datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ferretti et al., 2001</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Greenberg et al. (2015a,b)</ref> further developed the TypeDM and the role-based models, investigat- ing the effects of verb polysemy on human the- matic fit judgments and introducing a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm into the proto- type creation process. Their goal was to cluster to- gether typical fillers into multiple prototypes, cor- responding to different verb senses, and their re- sults showed constant improvements of the perfor- mance of the DM-based model. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tilk et al. (2016)</ref> presented two neural network architectures for generating probability distributions over selectional preferences for each thematic role. Their models took advantage of su- pervised training on two role-labeled corpora to optimize the distributional representation for the- matic fit modeling, and managed to obtain signif- icant improvements over the other systems on al- most all the evaluation datasets. They also eval- uated their model on the task of composing and updating verb argument expectations, obtaining a performance comparable to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lenci (2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>As pointed out by , most works on unsupervised thematic fit estimation vary in the method adopted for constructing the prototypes. The semantic role prototype is usually a vector, obtained by averaging the most typical fillers, and plausibility of new fillers depends on their similar- ity to the prototype, assessed by means of vector cosine (the standard similarity measure for DSMs; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Turney and Pantel (2010)</ref>).</p><p>Its merits notwithstanding, we argue that this method is not optimal for characterizing roles. Distributional vectors are typically built as out-of-context representations, and they conflate different senses. By building the prototype as the centroid of a cluster of vectors and measuring then the the- matic fit with vector cosine, the plausibility score is inevitably affected by many contexts that are ir- relevant for the specific verb-argument combina- tion. 5 This is likely to be one of the main reasons behind the difficulties of modeling roles other than agent and patient with syntax-based DSMs. We claim that improving the prototype representation might lead to a better characterization of thematic roles, and to a better treatment of polysemy.</p><p>When a verb and an argument are composed, humans are intuitively able to select only the part of the potential meaning of the words that is rele- vant for the concept being expressed (e.g. in The player hit the ball, humans would certainly ex- clude from the meaning of ball semantic dimen- sions that are strictly related to its dancing sense). In other words, not all the features of the seman- tic representations are active, and the composition process makes some features more 'prominent', while moving others to the background. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Although we are not aware of experimen- tal works specifically dedicated to verb-argument composition, a similar idea has been supported in studies on conceptual combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hampton, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hampton, , 2007</ref>: when a head and a modifier are com- bined, their interaction affects the saliency of the features in the original concepts. For example, in racing car, the most salient properties would be those related to SPEED, whereas in family car SPACE properties would probably be more prominent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yeh and Barsalou (2006)</ref> used a prop- erty priming experiment to show how the concept features activated during language comprehension vary across the background situations described by the sentence they occur in. When concepts are combined in a sentence, the features that are rele- vant for the specific combination are activated and are then easier to verify for human subjects.</p><p>The same could be true for linguistically- derived properties of lexical meaning:  brought neuroimaging evidence of the early activation of word association areas during property generation tasks, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Santos et al. (2011)</ref> showed that word associates are often among the properties generated for a given concept. Such findings suggest that, while we combine concepts, both embodied simulations and word distributions influence property salience ( .</p><p>Our model makes the following assumptions:</p><p>‚Ä¢ the composition between a verb role repre- sentation and an argument shares the same cognitive mechanism underlying conceptual combinations;</p><p>‚Ä¢ at least part of semantic representations is derived from, and/or mirrored in, linguistic data. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Consistently, the process of selecting the relevant features of the concepts being composed corresponds to modify the salience of the dimensions of distributional vectors;</p><p>‚Ä¢ thematic fit computation is carried out on the basis of the activation and selection of salient features of a verb thematic role prototype and of the candidate argument filler vectors.</p><p>et al. (2016a,b,c) which has shown interesting re- sults in synonymy detection and similarity estima- tion. As we will show in the next sections, the new metric assigns high scores to candidate fillers shar- ing many salient contexts with the verb-specific role prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Typical Fillers</head><p>The first step of our method consists in identifying the typical fillers of a verb-specific role. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baroni and Lenci (2010)</ref>, we weighted the raw co- occurrences between verbs, syntactic relations and fillers in the TypeDM tensor of DM with Positive Local Mutual Information (PLMI; Evert <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2004)</ref>). Given the co-occurrence count O vrf of the verb v, a syntactic relation r and the filler f , we com- puted the expected count E vrf under the assump- tion of statistical independence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P LM I(v, r, f ) = log O v,r,f E v,r,f * O v,r,f<label>(1)</label></formula><p>From the ranked list of (v,r,f) tuples, for each slot, we selected as typical fillers the top k lexemes with the highest PLMI scores (see examples in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, Typical Fillers column). In our experiments, we report results for k = {10, 30, 50}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Role Prototype Vectors</head><p>To represent the typical fillers, the candidate fillers and the verb-specific role prototypes (which are obtained by summing their typical filler vectors), we built a syntax-based DSM. This includes rela- tion:word contexts, like sbj:dog, obj:apple, etc.. Contexts were weighted with Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Church and Hanks (1990)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bullinaria and Levy (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Levy et al. (2015)</ref>). Given a context c and a word w, the PPMI is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P P M I(w, c) = max(P M I(w, c), 0)<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">P M I(w, c) = log P (w, c) P (w)P (c) = log |w, c|D |w||c| (3)</formula><p>where w is the target word, c is the given context, P(w,c) is the probability of co-occurrence, and D is the collection of observed word-context pairs. 8</p><p>The context c of the prototype vector P repre- senting a thematic role has a value corresponding to the sum of the values of c for each of the k typ- ical fillers used to build P . The contexts of P are then sorted according to their weight. Desir- ably, the highest-ranking contexts for a role pro- totype will be those that are more strongly associ- ated with many of its typical fillers. Such second order contexts correspond to the most salient fea- tures of the verb-specific thematic role, as they are salient for many role fillers (some examples are reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, Top Second Order Contexts column).</p><p>In summary, we built centroid vectors for our verb-specific thematic roles by means of second order contexts, which are first order dependency- based contexts of the most typical fillers of a verb- specific role. Since we are interested only in the most salient contexts, we ranked the centroid con- texts according to their PPMI score, and we took the resulting rank as a distributional characteriza- tion of the thematic roles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Filtering the Contexts</head><p>Filtering the prototype dimensions according to syntactic criteria might be useful to improve our role representations. It is, indeed, reasonable to hypothesize that predicates co-occurring with the typical patients of a verb are more relevant for the characterization of its patient role than -let's say - prepositional complements, as they correspond to other actions that are typically performed on the same patients.</p><p>Imagine that apple, pizza, cake etc. are among the most salient fillers for the OBJ slot of to eat, and that OBJ-1:slice-v, OBJ-1:devour-v, SBJ:kid- n, INSTRUMENT:fork-n, LOCATION:table-n are some of the most salient contexts of the proto- type. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Things that are typically sliced and/or de- voured are more likely to be good fillers for the pa- tient role to eat than things that are simply located on a table or that are patients of actions performed by kids. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the performance of the system in three different set- tings, each of which selecting: formance we will not discuss it further. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Santus et al. (2016c)</ref> previously showed that their rank-based measure performs worse on PLMI-weighted vectors, as they are biased towards frequent contexts. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Our DSM also makes use of inverse syntactic dependen- cies: target SYN-1 context means that target is linked to con- text by the dependency relation SYN (e.g. meal OBJ-1 devour means that meal is OBJ of devour).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Computing the Thematic Fit</head><p>Our hypothesis is that fillers whose salience- ranked vector has a large overlap with the proto- type representation should have a high thematic fit. Such overlap should take into account not only the number of shared features, but also their respective ranks in the salience-ranked vectors. When the prototype has been computed and the candidate filler vector has also been sorted, we can measure the Weighted Overlap by adapting AP Syn (Santus et al., 2016a,b,c) to our needs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">W O(wx, wy) = ‚àÄf (x [1:N ] ‚à©y [1:N ] ) 1 avg(rx(f ), ry(f ))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where for every feature f in the intersection be- tween the top N features of the sorted vectors x, x <ref type="bibr">[1:N ]</ref> , and y, y <ref type="bibr">[1:N ]</ref> , we sum 1 divided by the av- erage rank of the shared feature in x and y, r x (f ) and r y (f ) (N is a tunable parameter). This measure assigns the maximum score to vectors sharing exactly the same dimensions, in the same salience ranking. The lower the rank of a shared context in the sorted vector, the smaller its contribution to the thematic fit score. If the feature set intersection is empty, the score will be 0.</p><p>Differently from cosine similarity, which con- flates multiple senses, measuring the Weighted Overlap between prototype and candidate filler can improve the estimation of the thematic fit by favoring the appropriate word senses: for ex- ample, for a verb-argument pair like embrace- v-communism-n, communism-n is likely to inter- sect and to increase the saliency (through the av- erage rank) only of the second-order features of embrace-v referring to its abstract sense.</p></div>

As a baseline, we use the thematic fit model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baroni and Lenci (2010)</ref>, with no ranking of the features of the prototypes and with vector cosine as a similarity metric. 11 Results are reported for 10, 30 and 50 fillers. For reference, we also report the results of state-of-the-art models, both the unsupervised ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baroni and Lenci, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sayeed and Demberg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Greenberg et al., 2015b</ref>) and the supervised ones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tilk et al., 2016</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> describes the performance of the best set- ting (weight: PPMI; N=2000). In the first three rows, the table shows the scores obtained by our system varying the types of dependency contexts (i.e. ALL, SO, PREP) and the number of fillers considered for the prototype (i.e. 10, 30 and 50). The other rows respectively show i) the scores ob- tained by calculating the vector cosine between the role prototype vector (i.e. the vector obtained by summing the most typical fillers, with no salience ranking of the dimensions) and the candidate filler vector and ii) the scores reported in the literature for the best unsupervised and supervised models. At a glance, our best scores always outperform the reimplementation of Baroni and Lenci, being mostly competitive with the state of the art models. More precisely, for agents and patients the per- formance is close to the reported scores for DM, when only predicates are used in the W O calcu- lation, as hypothesized in Section 3.3. The neural network of Tilk and colleagues retains a signifi- cant advantage on our models only for the McRae dataset. Our system, however, shows a remark- able improvements on the Ferretti's datasets, and specifically on Ferretti-Instruments, when only complements are used (see Section 3.3), outper- forming even the supervised and more complex model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tilk et al.

This is particularly interesting because -as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sayeed and Demberg (2014)</ref> - instruments and locations are difficult to model for a dependency-based system, given the ambiguity of prepositional phrases (e.g. with does not only encode instruments, but it can also encode other roles, such as in I ate a pizza with Mark). We think this is the main reason behind the different trend observed for the Instruments datasets with respect to the number of the fillers (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1)</ref>. Unlike all the other datasets, instrument prototypes built with more fillers tend to be more noisy and therefore to pull down both the vector cosine and W O performance (this is partially true also for locations, where the performances -for cosine and W O with a lower number of contexts -drop with more than 30 fillers: see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Systems based on semantic role labeling have an advantage in this sense, as they do not have to deal with prepositional ambiguity.</p><p>Our results show that, by weighting and filtering the features of the role prototype, dependency-based approaches can be successful in modeling roles other than agent and patient, eventually dealing also with the ambiguity of prepositional phrases.</p><p>Settings. Apart from the above-mentioned ex- ceptions, the best scores are obtained building the prototypes with a higher number of fillers, typically with 50, and calculating the W O only with a syntactically-filtered set of contexts. More specifically, Pad√≥ and McRae benefit from the calculation of W O using only second order subject-object predicates (i.e. SO), while Ferretti- Instruments and Ferretti-Locations benefit from the exclusive use of prepositional complements (i.e. PREP). On the other hand, the opposite set- ting (e.g. SO for Ferretti-Instruments and Ferretti- Locations and PREP for Pad√≥ and McRae) leads to much lower scores, whereas the full vectors (i.e. ALL) tend to have a stable-but-not-excellent per- formances on all datasets.</p><p>As briefly mentioned above, in our experiments, we tested both PPMI and PLMI as weighting mea- sures. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> only reports PPMI scores because it performs more regularly than PLMI, whose be- haviour is often unpredictable.</p><p>A parameter that has an impact on the perfor- mance of our system is the value of N , which is the number of second order contexts that are considered when calculating the W O. We have noticed that the performance of W O is directly related to the growth of N , and this can be noticed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, where W O is plotted for the different values of N with every combination of dataset and number of fillers. For space reasons, the plot only contains the performance for the best type of second order contexts for each dataset (i.e. SO for Pad√≥ and McRae and COMP for Ferretti- Locations and Ferretti-Instruments). As it can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the scores of W O tend to grow with the growth of N in all datasets. Interestingly, they are largely above the competitive baseline in most of the cases, the only exceptions being Pad√≥ (where a large N is necessary to outperform the baseline) and Ferretti-Locations with 10 fillers (prepositional ambiguity might have caused the introduction of noisy fillers among the top ones).</p><p>Agent &amp; Patient. In order to further evaluate our system, we have split Pad√≥ and McRae datasets into agent and patient subsets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> describes the performance of W O and vector cosine base- line while varying N and the number of fillers. The plot shows a clearly better performance of W O for the agent role (i.e. subject), especially when N is equal or over 1000 (note that the value of N has little impact in the agent subset of the McRae dataset). Such advantage, however, is re- duced for the patient role (i.e. object). This is particularly interesting because we do not observe large drops in performance for the vector cosine between agent and patient role (except for Pad√≥, k = 10). The drop is particularly noticeable in Pad√≥, a dataset which has several non-constraining verbs (especially for the patient role: a similar ob- servation was also made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tilk et al. (2016)</ref>). As the constraints on the typical fillers of such verbs are very loose, we hypothesize that it is more diffi- cult to find a set of salient features that are shared by many typical fillers. Therefore, estimations based on the whole vectors turn out to be more reliable. This can be confirmed by looking at the worst correlated words reported in Lexemes col- umn, in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Error Analysis</head><p>We performed an error analysis to verify -for the best settings of W O in each dataset -the corre- lation between vector cosine and W O scores (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>), and the peculiarities of the entries with the strongest and the weakest correlation (see Ta- ble 4).</p><p>We found that W O and vector cosine always have a high correlation (i.e. above 0.80), with the highest correlations reported for McRae and Ferretti-Instruments. Looking at <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> we can also observe that:</p><p>‚Ä¢ the average gold value of the 35 most (4.65) and least (4.56) correlated items does not substantially differ from the average gold value calculated on the full datasets (4.31), meaning that the distribution of likely and un- likely fillers among the best and worst corre- lated items is similar to the one in the datasets (i.e. no bias can be identified);</p><p>‚Ä¢ both measures have difficulties on the same test items (probably because of loose seman- tic constraints), but report their best perfor- mances on different pairs (see Overlap and Lexemes columns);</p><p>‚Ä¢ syntactically, vector cosine correlates better with objects, while W O is more balanced be- tween objects and subjects, often showing a preference for the latter (see the distribution in Syntax column).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced an unsupervised distributional method for modeling predicate- argument thematic fit judgments which works purely on syntactic information.  The method, inspired by cognitive and psy- cholinguistic findings, consists in: i) extracting and filtering the most salient second order contexts for each verb-specific role, i.e. the most salient semantic dimensions of typical verb-specific role fillers; and then ii) estimating the thematic fit as a weighted overlap between the top features of the candidate fillers and of the prototypes. Once tested on some popular datasets of thematic fit judgments, our method consistently outperforms a baseline re-implementing the thematic fit model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baroni and Lenci (2010)</ref> and proves to be competi- tive with state of the art models. It even registered the best performance on the Ferretti-Instruments dataset and it is the second best on the Ferretti- Locations, which were known to be particularly hard to model for dependency-based approaches.</p><p>Our method is simple, economic and efficient, it works purely on syntactic dependencies (so it does not require a role-labeled corpus) and achieves good results even with no supervised training. Finally, it offers linguistically and cognitively grounded insights on the process of prototype cre- ation and contextual feature salience, preparing the ground for further speculations and optimiza- tions. For example, future work might aim at iden- tifying strategies for tuning the parameter N to account for the different degrees of selectivity of each verb-specific role. Another possible exten- sion would be the inclusion of a mechanism for updating the role prototypes depending on how the other roles are filled, which would be the key for a more realistic and dynamic model of thematic fit expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lenci, 2011</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Results for Pad√≥, McRae and Ferretti, Instruments and Locations, with W O (respectively SO and PREP) computed on PPMI matrix, varying the number of fillers (i.e. 10, 30 and 50) and the value of N (i.e. 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000).

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Code: https://github.com/esantus/Thematic Fit 4 In this paper, we will make reference to two different models of DM: DepDM and TypeDM. DepDM counts the frequency of dependency links between words (e.g. read, obj, book), while TypeDM uses the variety of surface forms that express the link between words, rather than the link itself.</note>

(2016a). 6 An early proposal going in this direction is the predication theory by Kintsch (2001), which exploited Latent Semantic Analysis to select only the vector features that are appropriate for predicate-argument composition.</note>

			<note place="foot">We rely on syntax-based DSMs, using dependency relations to approximate verb-specific roles and to identify their most typical fillers: for agents/patients, we extract the most frequent subjects/objects, for instruments we use the prepositional complements introduced by with, and for locations those introduced by either on, at or in. Assuming that the linguistic features of distributional vectors correspond to the properties of conceptual composition processes, a candidate filler can be represented as a sorted distributional vector of the filler term, in which the most salient contexts occupy the top positions. Similarly, the abstract representation of a verb-specific role is a sorted prototype-vector, whose features derive from the sum of the most typical filler vectors for that verb-specific role. Differently from Baroni and Lenci, the core and novel aspect of our proposal, described in the following subsections, is that we do not simply measure the correlation between all the features of candidate and prototype vectors (as vector cosine would do on unsorted vectors), but rather we rank and filter the features, computing the weighted overlap with a rank-based similarity measure inspired by AP Syn, a recent proposal by Santus 7 See also the so-called &apos;strong version&apos; of the Distributional Hypothesis (Miller and Charles, 1991; Lenci, 2008).</note>
