<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>During the last decade, the adoption of natu- ral language processing (NLP) techniques for the study of political phenomena has gained consid- erable momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Grimmer and Stewart, 2013)</ref>, arguably because of both the availability of parlia- mentary proceedings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(van Aggelen et al., 2017)</ref>, electoral manifestos <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Volkens et al., 2011</ref>) and campaign debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Woolley and Peters, 2008)</ref>, and the interest of the computational social science (CSS) community in the potential of text mining methods for advancing political science research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lazer et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Previous work focused on the automatic de- tection of sentiment expressions in political news <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Young and Soroka, 2012)</ref>, the identification of ideological proportions  and the scaling on a left-right spectrum of politicians' speeches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Slapin and Proksch, 2008)</ref>. More re- cently, researchers looked at topic-centered ap- proaches to provide finer-grained analyses, includ- ing segmentation methods for topic-labeled man- ifestos ( , supporting manual coders in identifying coarse-grained political top- ics ( , as well as topic-based and cross-lingual political scaling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Glavaš et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Measuring Agreement. Automatically measur- ing the level of agreement in political documents ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gottipati et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Menini and Tonelli, 2016)</ref> has the potential of supporting political analyses such as the comparisons between campaign strate- gies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burton et al., 2015)</ref>, the study of promises kept and broken after elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Naurin, 2011)</ref>, the formation of coalitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Debus, 2009)</ref> and the interactions between government and opposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hix and Noury, 2016)</ref>. However, previous work relies on the availability of pre-defined topics, in- cluding supervised methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Galley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hillard et al., 2003)</ref>, approaches leveraging col- laboratively generated resources ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gottipati et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Awadallah et al., 2012</ref>) or pairwise agree- ment detection from political debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Menini and Tonelli, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our Contributions. a) New task: Given a collec- tion of political documents such as, e.g., electoral manifestos, we look at ways to perform an auto- matic, topic-based agreement-disagreement clas- sification. b) New approach: We first segment the texts into coarse-grained domains. Next, coarse domains are used to extract a fine-grained list of topic-based points of view which, in turn, are used to perform classification. We achieve this by de- veloping a novel approach for topic detection on the basis of key concept clustering techniques: this is shown to outperform not only LDA-based Topic Modeling -the de facto standard approach for this task in CSS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Grimmer and Stewart, 2013</ref>) -but also established unsupervised (k-means) and state- of-the-art graph-based clustering techniques. c) Experimental study and resources: We use man- ifestos from the Comparative Manifesto Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Volkens et al., 2011</ref>). As in previous works , we focus on a subset consisting of six U.S. manifestos (Republican and Democrat) from the 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections. We show that our method leads to promising results when measuring the topic-based agreement between the party manifestos, thus indicating the overall feasi- bility of the task. Additionally, we release all code and annotations related to this paper to foster fur- ther work from the research community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Overview</head><p>We present a new system for measuring the topic- based agreement of political manifestos. Our ap- proach consists of four main steps: i) macro- domain detection, e.g. foreign policy, economy, welfare, ii) key concept extraction, iii) topic de- tection as key concept clustering, e.g., energy con- sumption, new energy solution, petroleum depen- dence for the topic green economy, and iv) pair- wise, topic-based agreement detection.</p><p>The central component of our pipeline is a new approach for fine-grained topic detection in po- litical contents based on key concept clustering. This is because, among existing methods, super- vised approaches cannot be applied here due to the scarce availability of in-domain labeled data, as well as the already remarked high complexity of the annotation process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benoit et al., 2016)</ref>. More- over, the application of unsupervised topic detec- tion techniques like LDA has been shown during prototyping to produce low-quality topics that are rather coarse (cf. the results in Section 3).</p><p>Similar to LDA-based approaches, we view each topic as a cluster of words or phrases. How- ever, given that we are in a domain with topics built around rather specific lexical cues, we do not rely on the entire vocabulary of the documents. Instead, we build clusters that are made up of se- mantically similar key concepts extracted from the documents themselves, including both single and multiwords (i.e. keywords and keyphrases). In the next paragraph we present an overview of each component of our system. 1) Domain Detection. We are given as input sen- tences from a political manifesto. The first step of our work is to classify them into the seven macro- domains defined by the Manifesto Project, namely external relations, freedom and democracy, polit- ical system, economy, welfare and quality of life, fabric of society, social groups. To achieve this goal, we use ClassyMan, a system developed in a previous work , which predicts the domains and domain shifts between pairs of adjacent sentences.</p><p>2) Key concept Extraction. Next, for each do- main we process each sentence using Keyphrase Digger (KD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moretti et al., 2015)</ref>. KD is a rule- based (hence domain-agnostic) system for key concept extraction that combines statistical mea- sures with linguistic information, and which has shown competitive performance on the SemEval 2010 benchmark ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kim et al., 2010)</ref>. We set the tool to extract lemmatized key concepts up to three tokens. For each key concept, we compute its tf- idf, considering each domain as a different docu- ment. The result is a list of key concepts for each domain, with a score representing their relevance to the domain.</p><p>3) Key concept Clustering. Starting from the flat lists of key concepts extracted by KD, we adopt a recursive procedure to merge them into mean- ingful clusters. First, we build a distributional se- mantic vector for each key concept by averaging the embeddings of each word in the key concept (we use the GloVe embeddings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al. (2014)</ref> with 50 dimensions, pre-trained on Wikipedia). Next, we build a semantic graph rep- resentation where a) each node consists of a key concept, b) the weight of each edge is the cosine distance between their respective embedding vec- tors and c) edges are directed, pointing to the node of the key concept with the higher tf-idf. For ties, we create multiple edges. To direct the nodes we adopt tf-idf, since we want to weigh the key con- cepts according to the relevance for the macro- domain we are processing. This allows us to ob- tain well-defined groups within the domains.</p><p>To reduce the number of weak edges, we set a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> and we set an edge between two multi-word keyphrases if they have at least one word in common (e.g. ethnic mi- nority, black minority).</p><p>Finally, we obtain clusters of semantically re- lated key concepts from the graph as follows: a) we extract all groups of key concepts with an edge directed to the same node and create a first set of clusters. Then, b) clusters sharing at least 50% of the key concepts are merged. Next, c) the clusters purity is improved by removing the less relevant key concepts. These are identified as those key concepts whose cosine distance is more than 1.5 times the standard deviation from the centroid of the cluster. At the end of this process, we obtain for each domain a set of clusters or topics, made of semantically related key concepts. The number of clusters is determined dynamically during the process and does not need to be defined a priori.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Statement Extraction.</head><p>We use the clusters of key concepts to identify pairs of statements, re- lated to the same topic, from the Republican (R) and Democratic (D) manifestos. For each topic, we first collect the statements from D and R man- ifestos having among their key concepts one of the key concepts defining the topic and then we pair groups of three statements from D with groups of three statements from R. We use groups of three statements because it allows us i) to obtain a suffi- cient number of pairs to perform automatic classi- fication, and ii) to improve the quality of the man- ual annotations. We noticed during an initial eval- uation that annotators focus easier on groups of 3 sentences rather than larger groups and that, on the other hand, using less than 3 sentences decreases the chances to obtain at least two statements in agreement/disagreement within a pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Agreement Classification. The last step is the automatic classification of agreement and dis- agreement between Republicans and Democrats.</head><p>To classify pairs of statements, we rely on a su- pervised machine learning approach with the set of features used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Menini and Tonelli (2016)</ref>, in which a similar task is addressed. The classifica- tion relies on features related to surface informa- tion such as lexical overlap and negation, to the semantic content of the statements (e.g. sentiment) and to their relation (e.g. entailment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Topic Extraction</head><p>Having a set of manifestos annotated with coarse- grained domains -using ClassyMan, which achieved a micro F1-Score of 0.78 across the seven macro-topics in a 10-fold cross validation setting -the central step of our pipeline is to detect clusters of key concepts representing fine-grained topics in each macro domain. To do that, we adopt the method described above, that we call here Key Concept Clusters. We examine its performance in comparison with two types of baselines.</p><p>LDA Baselines. We first employ vanilla LDA, a common approach for topic detection in CSS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Grimmer and Stewart, 2013)</ref>, relying on the as- sumption that tokens often co-occurring together in a corpus belong to the same topic. For this task, we use the Mallet topic model package. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Given the fact that our method for key concept cluster- ing identifies on average 30 topics per domain, we create a corpus for each domain with all its sen- tences and we run LDA with 10,000 iterations to obtain 30 topics. We test LDA by considering all the tokens in the corpus (Vanilla LDA) and only the extracted key concepts (Key concept LDA).</p><p>Clustering Baselines. The second type of base- line adopts the same representation of key con- cepts used in our approach, i.e., we represent can- didate phrases by averaging the embeddings of their constituent words. We test two different clus- tering approaches to group them into topics: the first uses K-means (with 30 clusters). The second (Graph-based) builds a fully-connected semantic relatedness graph by measuring the cosine similar- ity between all pairs of key concepts: topic cluster- ing is then obtained by finding all maximal cliques in the graph using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.</p><p>Evaluation. In order to assess the overall quality of the topics produced by each approach, we adopt the word-intrusion post-hoc evaluation method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chang et al., 2009</ref>) using the platform presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lauscher et al. (2016)</ref>. For each approach, we randomly pick 100 topics and for each topic we keep two sets of key concepts, respectively the four and eight top-relevant elements of the clus- ter. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Then, we add to these four/eight words a new word from another topic (i.e. the intruder), and we shuffle the obtained five/nine words. Finally, we ask three political science experts to identify the intruder. The more the topics are coherent, the easier the intruder is detected. While this type of post-hoc evaluation is extremely time-consuming -no less than 45 minutes of work for annotator for each produced ranking, thus hindering the ex- perimental assessment of, for instance, the role of different numbers of topics for each baseline -it is necessary given the already remarked limits of ex- isting gold standards manually-created for the task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikhaylov et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">King et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Results. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, our system out- performs the other methods with an accuracy of 0.86 in the word-intrusion task with four key con-  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, varies a lot across the different methods. In particular, the agree- ment in the intrusion task with four key concepts is higher for clusters generated with our method (0.79), while it is very low using LDA (0.32). This confirms the findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chang et al. (2009)</ref> that LDA topics are often difficult to interpret. If we extend the evaluation to the first eight ele- ments of each cluster, we notice that the difference between the agreement with our pipeline (0.62) and LDA (0.46) decreases. This shows that, with key concept clusters, increasing the number of key concepts in a topic affects their interpretation, al- though there is still an improvement with respect to the other approaches.</p><p>Final Tuning. We next tune clustering to classify fine-grained topics as in agreement or disagree- ment. Tuning is performed as to maximize cluster- ing accuracy while obtaining a sufficient number of topics shared by both Democrats and Republi- cans. Since a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 in the clustering process leads to clusters that are too specific, often addressed only by one of the two parties, we reduce the threshold to 0.7, so that the topics are likely to be covered by both manifestos. In addition, we want to compare the agreement fo- cusing on small clusters, composed by a maximum of 10 key concepts. To obtain them, we iterate the clustering process over the key concepts of larger clusters, progressively increasing the cosine sim- ilarity threshold until there are no groups larger than 10 key concepts. We reach this goal with a threshold of 0.85. Using these settings, the accu- racy (Acc. @4) of the clusters decreases to 0.74, but we obtain clusters that allow us to extract a total of 351 pairs covering 87 fine-grained topics.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) eval- uation (Fleiss' kappa) in the word intrusion task. The table reports the IIA on the first 4 and 8 key concepts in the clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Agreement Classification</head><p>Data Annotation. The statements in the pairs have been annotated by three scholars of politi- cal science in terms of agreement, disagreement or none of the two. The annotation results in 158 pairs in disagreement, 135 in agreement and 58 neither in agreement nor in disagreement, with an inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of 0.64 (Fleiss' Kappa). Note that only in three cases the annota- tors claimed that the meaning of a sentence pair did not match with the topic detected with our ap- proach. This additional finding highlights again the quality of our method for topic detection based on key concept clustering.</p><p>Agreement Classification. Agreement classifica- tion is carried out using Support Vector Machine (SVM) tested in two configurations. In the first setting, we train and test the classifier with 10- fold cross validation over the manually annotated pairs from the political manifestos. In the second configuration, we explore instead a cross-domain approach: we train the SVM on the 1960 Elec- tions dataset from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Menini and Tonelli (2016)</ref> and use all the pairs in our gold standard of political manifestos as test set. This experiment is aimed at assessing the impact of training on comparable data are from the same domain (i.e., transcript of political speeches vs. manifestos).</p><p>The results of both configurations are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, where they are compared to a random baseline. The results show that the set of features used suits our task, classifying the data with an accuracy comparable to the performance of hu- man annotators, if we consider IAA as an upper bound for the task. We achieve nevertheless re- sults that are in a lower range than <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Menini and Tonelli (2016)</ref>, thus suggesting that agreement and disagreement is harder to detect in political mani-Macro-domain: External Relations japan, korea, missile, north korea, south korea, weapon north korea extremism, renounce terrorism, nuclear terrorism, proliferation, security, terrorism Macro-domain: Freedom and Democracy culture, freedom, ideology, religion, society, tolerance, tradition democracy, discrimination, first amendment rights, freedom, issue, law, rights of citizenship Macro-domain: Political System budget, budget act, cost, cut, deficit, shortfall, tax congressional republican, election, republican, republican platform, romney, vote Macro-domain: Economy alternative fuel, electricity, fuel, gas, transportation fuel bailout, credit, loan, mortgage, payment, savings Macro-domain: Welfare and Quality of Life ailment, chronic, disease, health, illness, obesity, treatment of disease global energy forum, industry, new energy solution, new global energy, solar energy generation Macro-domain: Fabric of Society crime, criminal, high-profile criminal conviction, prosecution religious freedom, religious, religious discrimination Macro-domain: Social Groups agricultural agricultural america, agricultural production, agriculture, farm, rural, rural america hispanic, latino, latino population  festos than in speeches. Finally the accuracy of the classifier in the cross-domain setting is lower than the one obtained with in-domain cross-validation, but still comparable with that of human annotators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented a system for support- ing automatic topic-bases analyses of agreement and disagreement in political manifestos. This ap- proach goes beyond established approaches for the task, which are either too coarse-grained or rely intensively on manual annotations. Our method can provide insights into agree- ment and disagreement between parties, covering several topics of internal and foreign policy. By examining the results, we find an overall cross- party agreement of 46% regarding the discussed issues. However, this agreement varies substan- tially if we consider the different macro-domains.</p><p>For example, while we notice a strong disagree- ment over the domain political system, especially for what concerns the responsibilities of previous administrations, other domains, such as external relations, present a more balanced ratio of agree- ment and disagreement between Republicans and Democrats. The possibility of measuring agree- ment at a finer level (topics) that is offered by our approach, shows, for example, that between 2004 and 2012 two opposite positions have been defined regarding the Middle East. On the contrary, there has been a general agreement on the role of the U.S. concerning the relations with Europe.</p><p>In the future, we hope that the pipeline pre- sented in this paper will support political science researchers in studying topics such as party po- larization through the analysis and comparison of electoral manifestos, parliamentary proceedings and campaign speeches. On the computational side, we will to extend our approach to cross- lingual data, in order to enable computer-assisted political analysis across different languages.</p></div>
