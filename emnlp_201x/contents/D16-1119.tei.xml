				<p>This paper presents a two-step procedure to extract positive meaning from verbal negation. We first generate potential positive interpretations manipulating syntactic dependencies. Then, we score them according to their likelihood. Manual annotations show that positive interpretations are ubiquitous and intuitive to humans. Experimental results show that dependencies are better suited than semantic roles for this task, and automation is possible.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Negation is a complex phenomenon present in all human languages, allowing for the uniquely human capacities of denial, contradiction, misrepresenta- tion, lying, and irony <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Horn and Wansing, 2015)</ref>. Despite negation always being marked-in the ab- sence of a negation cue, statements are positive- acquiring and understanding sentences that contain negation is more challenging than those that do not. Children acquire negation after learning to commu- nicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nordmeyer and Frank, 2013)</ref>, and adults take longer to process negated statements than positive ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clark and Chase, 1972)</ref>.</p><p>In any given language, humans communicate in positive terms most of the time, and use negation to express something unusual or an exception <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Horn, 1989)</ref>. Albeit most sentences are affirmative, nega- tion is ubiquitous <ref type="bibr">(Morante and Sporleder, 2012)</ref>: In scientific papers, 13.76% of statements contain a negation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Szarvas et al., 2008)</ref>; in product reviews, 19% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Councill et al., 2010)</ref>; and in Conan Doyle sto- ries, 22.23% <ref type="bibr">(Morante and Daelemans, 2012</ref>). In OntoNotes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hovy et al., 2006</ref>), 10.15% of state- ments contain a verb negated with not, n't or never.</p><p>From a theoretical point of view, it is accepted that negation conveys positive meaning <ref type="bibr">(Rooth, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huddleston and Pullum, 2002</ref>). For example, when reading (1) John didn't order the right parts, hu- mans intuitively understand that (1a) John ordered something, or more specifically, (1b) John ordered the wrong parts. Interpretation (1a) can be obtained after determining that n't does not negate verb order, but its THEME, i.e., the right parts. Interpretation (1b) can be obtained after determining that n't is ac- tually negating right, an adjective modifying parts.</p><p>Determining which words are intended to be negated-identifying the foci of negation, thereby revealing positive interpretations-is challenging. First, as exemplified in (1a, 1b), there is a granu- larity continuum yielding interpretations that entail each other, e.g., (1b) entails (1a). Second, a single negation often yields several positive interpretations, e.g., from (2) John doesn't eat meat, we can extract that (2a) John eats something other than meat and (2b) Some people eat meat, but not John.</p><p>This paper presents a methodology to extract pos- itive interpretations from verbal negation. The main contributions are: (1) deterministic procedure to generate potential interpretations by manipulating syntactic dependencies; (2) analysis showing that dependencies yield finer-grained interpretations and better results than previous work using semantic roles; (3) a corpus of negations and their positive interpretations; 1 and (4) experimental results with gold-standard and predicted linguistic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Terminology, Scope and Focus</head><p>Negation is well-understood in grammars, which de- tail the valid ways to form a negation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Quirk et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">van der Wouden, 1997</ref>). Negation can be ex- pressed by verbs (e.g., avoid running), nouns (e.g., the absence of evidence), adjectives (e.g., it is point- less), adverbs (e.g., I never tried Persian food be- fore), prepositions (e.g., you can exchange it with- out a problem), determiners (e.g., the new law has no direct implications), pronouns (e.g., nobody will keep election promises), and others. In this paper, we focus on verbal negation, i.e., when the negation mark-usually an adverb such as never and not-is grammatically associated with a verb. Positive Interpretations. In philosophy and lin- guistics, it is generally accepted that negation con- veys positive meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Horn, 1989)</ref>. This positive meaning ranges from implicatures, i.e., what is sug- gested in an utterance even though neither expressed nor strictly implied <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blackburn, 2008)</ref>, to entail- ments. Other terms used in the literature include im- plied meanings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mitkov, 2005)</ref>, implied alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rooth, 1985)</ref> and semantically similars <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agirre et al., 2013</ref>). We do not strictly fit into any of this ter- minology, we reveal positive interpretations as intu- itively done by humans when reading text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Scope and Focus</head><p>From a theoretical perspective, it is accepted that negation has scope and focus, and that the focus- not just the scope-yields positive interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Horn, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rooth, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taglicht, 1984)</ref>. Scope is "the part of the meaning that is negated" and fo- cus "the part of the scope that is most prominently or explicitly negated" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huddleston and Pullum, 2002</ref>).</p><p>Consider the following statement in the context of the recent refugee crisis: (2) Mr. Haile was not looking for heaven in Europe. By definition, scope refers to "all elements whose individual falsity would make the negated statement strictly true", and focus is "the element of the scope that is intended to be interpreted as false to make the overall negative true" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huddleston and Pullum, 2002</ref>). The falsity of any of the truth conditions below makes statement (2) true, thus the scope of the negation is (2a-2d): 2a. Somebody was looking for something some- where. <ref type="bibr">[verb looking]</ref> 2b. Mr. Haile was looking for something some- where.</p><p>[AGENT of looking, Mr. Haile] 2c. Somebody was looking for heaven somewhere.</p><p>[THEME of looking, heaven] 2d. Somebody was looking for something in Eu- rope.</p><p>[LOCATION of looking, in Europe] Determining the focus is almost always more challenging than the scope. The challenge relies on determining which of the truth conditions (2a-2d) is intended to be interpreted as false to make the negated statement true: all of them qualify, but some are more likely. A natural reading of statement <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> suggests that Mr. Haile was looking for something (a regular life, a job, etc.) in Europe, but not heaven. Determining that the focus is heaven, i.e., that every- thing in statement (2) is positive except the THEME of looking, is the key to reveal the intended positive interpretation. Note that scope on its own does not identify positive interpretations, and other foci yield unlikely positive interpretations, e.g., Mr. Haile was looking for heaven somewhere, but not in Europe.</p><p>It is worth noting that while scope is defined from a logical standpoint, in most negations there are several possible foci and corresponding posi- tive interpretations. For example, given (3) Most jobs now don't last for decades, the following are valid positive interpretations: (3a) Few jobs now last for decades, (3b) Most jobs in the past lasted for decades, and (3c) Most jobs now last for a few years. Granularity of Focus. The definition of focus does not provide guidelines about identifying the element of the scope that is the focus. The larger the focus, the more generic the corresponding positive inter- pretation; and the smaller the focus, the more spe- cific the corresponding positive interpretation. Let us consider statement (3) again. A possible focus is Most jobs, yielding the positive interpretation Some- thing now lasts for decades, but not most jobs. An- other possible focus is Most, yielding the interpreta- tion Few (not most) jobs now last for decades. We argue that the latter is preferable, as it yields a more specific interpretation and it entails the former: if some jobs last for decades, then something lasts for decades, but not the other way around.</p><p>We use the term coarse-grained focus to refer to foci that include all tokens belonging to an argument of a verb (e.g., Most Jobs above), and fine-grained focus to refer to foci that do not (e.g., Most above).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Previous Work</head><p>Within computational linguistics, approaches to pro- cess negation are shallow, or target scope and focus detection. Popular semantic representations such as semantic roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Palmer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baker et al., 1998</ref>) or AMR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banarescu et al., 2013</ref>) do not reveal the positive interpretations we target in this paper. Shallow approaches are usually application-specific. In sentiment and opinion analysis, negation has been reduced to marking as negated all words between a negation cue and the first punctuation mark ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pang et al., 2002</ref>), or within a five-word window of a nega- tion cue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hu and Liu, 2004</ref>). The examples through- out this paper show that these techniques are insuffi- cient to reveal implicit positive interpretations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Scope Annotations and Detection</head><p>Scope of negation detection has received a lot of attention, mostly using two corpora: BioScope in the medical domain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Szarvas et al., 2008)</ref> and CD- SCO <ref type="bibr">(Morante and Daelemans, 2012)</ref>. BioScope annotates negation cues and linguistic scopes exclu- sively in biomedical texts. CD-SCO annotates nega- tion cues, scopes, and negated events or properties in selected Conan Doyle stories.</p><p>There have been several supervised proposals to detect the scope of negation using BioScope and CD-SCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">( ¨ Ozgür and Radev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Øvrelid et al., 2010)</ref>. Automatic approaches are mature (Abu- Jbara and Radev, 2012): F-scores are 0.96 for nega- tion cue detection, and 0.89 for negation cue and scope detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Velldal et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al., 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fancellu et al. (2016)</ref> present the best results to date using CD-SCO, and analyze the main sources of er- rors. Outside BioScope and CD-SCO, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Reitan et al. (2015)</ref> present a negation scope detector for tweets, and show that it improves sentiment analysis. As shown in Section 2, scope detection is insufficient to reveal positive interpretations from negation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Focus Annotation and Detection</head><p>While focus of negation has been studied for decades in philosophy and linguistics (Section 2), corpora and automated tools are scarce. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blanco and Moldovan (2011)</ref> annotate focus of negation in the 3,993 negations marked with ARGM-NEG semantic role in PropBank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). Their an- notations, PB-FOC, were used in the *SEM-2012 Shared Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Morante and Blanco, 2012)</ref>. Their guidelines require annotators to choose as focus the semantic role that "is most prominently negated" or the verb. If several roles may be the focus, they prioritize "the one that yields the most meaningful implicit <ref type="bibr">[positive]</ref> information", but do not specify what most meaningful means. Their approach has 2 limitations. First, because they select one focus per negation, they only extract one positive inter- pretation per negation. Second, because they select as focus a semantic role, they only consider coarse- grained foci. Consider again statement (3) from Sec- tion 2.1. By design, their approach is limited to ex- tract a single interpretation even though interpreta- tions (3a-3c) are valid. Similarly, their approach is limited to select as focus Most jobs-all tokens be- longing to a semantic role-although Most yields a "more meaningful" interpretation: Something now lasts for decades (generic, worse) vs. Few jobs now last for decades (specific, better).</p><p>Blanco and Sarabi (2016) present a complimen- tary approach to extract and score several posi- tive interpretations from a single verbal negation. Their methodology is grounded on semantic roles and does not consider fine-grained foci. In this pa- per, we improve upon their work: we extract both coarse-and fine-grained interpretations, and also ex- tract several interpretations from one negation.</p><p>Anand and Martell (2012) reannotate PB-FOC and argue that positive interpretations arising from scalar implicatures and neg-raising predicates should be separated from those arising from focus detection. They argue that 27.4% of negations with a focus annotated in PB-FOC do not have one. In this paper, we are not concerned about annotating foci per se, but about extracting positive interpreta- tions from negation, as intuitively done by humans.</p><p>Automatic systems to detect the focus of negation yield modest results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blanco and Moldovan (2011)</ref> obtain an accuracy of 65.5 using supervised learn- ing and features derived from gold-standard linguis- tic information. With predicted linguistic informa- tion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rosenberg and Bergler (2012)</ref> report an F- measure of 58.4 using 4 linguistically sound heuris- tics, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zou et al. (2014)</ref> an F-measure of 65.62 using contextual discourse information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Blanco and Sarabi (2016)</ref> obtain Pearson correlation of 0.642 ranking coarse-grained interpretations. Unlike the work presented here, none of these systems extract fine-grained interpretations from a single negation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Corpus Creation</head><p>Our goal is to create a corpus of negations and their positive interpretations. We put a strong emphasis on automation and simplicity. First, we determin- istically generate potential positive interpretations from verbal negations by manipulating syntactic de- pendencies (Section 4.1). Second, we ask annota- tors to score potential positive interpretations (Sec- tion 4.2). Positive interpretations and their scores are later used to learn models to rank potential inter- pretations automatically (Section 6). Generating po- tential interpretations deterministically prior to scor- ing them proved very beneficial. After pilot experi- ments, it became clear that asking annotators to pro- pose positive interpretations complicates the annota- tion effort (lower agreements) as well as learning.</p><p>We decided to work on top of OntoNotes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hovy et al., 2006</ref>) 2 instead of plain text or other cor- pora for several reasons. First, OntoNotes includes gold linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, parse trees and semantic roles. Second, un- like BioScope, CD-SCO and PB-FOC (Section 3.2), OntoNotes includes sentences from several genres, e.g., newswire, broadcast news and conversations, magazines, the web. We transformed the parse trees in OntoNotes into syntactic dependencies us- ing Stanford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Manning et al., 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Manipulating Syntactic Dependencies to Generate Potential Positive Interpretations</head><p>OntoNotes contains 63,918 sentences. Annotating all positive interpretations from all negations is out- side the scope of this paper. Instead, we target se- lected representative negations. Selecting Negations. We first select all verbal nega- tions by retrieving all tokens whose syntactic head is a verb and dependency type neg. 3 Then, we discard negations from sentences that contain two negations, conditionals, commas or questions. Finally, we dis-card negations if the negated verb is to be or it does not have a subject (dependency nsubj or nsubjpass).</p><p>Converting Negated Statements into their posi- tive counterparts. We apply 3 steps inspired after the grammatical rules to form negation detailed by <ref type="bibr">Huddleston and Pullum (2002, Ch. 9</ref>):</p><p>1. Remove the negation mark by deleting the to- ken with syntactic dependency neg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Remove auxiliaries, expand contractions, and</head><p>fix third-person singular and past tense. For ex- ample (before: after), doesn't go: goes, didn't go: went, won't go: will go. We loop through the tokens whose head is the negated verb with dependency aux, and use a list of irregular verbs and grammar rules to convert to third- person singular and past tense. 3. Rewrite negatively-oriented polarity-sensitive items. For example (before: after), any- one: someone, any longer: still, yet: al- ready. at all: somewhat. We use the cor- respondences between negatively-oriented and positively-oriented polarity-sensitive items by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huddleston and Pullum, 2002</ref>, pp. 831). Selecting Relevant tokens. Verbal negation often occurs in multi-clause sentences. In order to iden- tify the relevant (syntactically negated) eventuality, we simplify the original statement by including only the negated verb and all tokens that are dependents of the verb, i.e., tokens reachable from the negated verb traversing dependencies. For example, from Individuals familiar with the Justice Department's policy said that Justice officials hadn't any knowl- edge of the IRS's actions in the last week, after get- ting the positive counterpart and selecting relevant tokens, we obtain Justice officials had some knowl- edge of the IRS's actions in the last week. Generating Interpretations. Given the simplified positive counterpart, generating all combinations of tokens as potential foci would result in 2 t poten- tial positive interpretations for t tokens. To avoid a brute-force approach that generates many nonsen- sical potential interpretations, we define a procedure grounded on syntactic dependencies.</p><p>The main idea is to run a modified breadth-first traversal of the dependency tree to select subtrees that are potential foci. We start the traversal from the negated verb and stop it at depth 3, selecting as potential foci the subtrees rooted at all tokens except  those whose syntactic dependency is aux, auxpass or punct (auxiliary, passive auxiliary and punctua- tion). Additionally, we discard potential foci that consist only of (1) the determiners the, a and an, or (2) a single token with part-of-speech tag TO, CC, UH, POS, XX, IN, WP or dependency relation prt. These rules were defined after manually observ- ing several examples and concluding that the cor- responding positive interpretation was useless. For example, from the negated statement And our credit standards haven't changed one iota, we avoid gener- ating the useless potential interpretation Our credit standards X changed one iota, but not have changed.</p><p>(focus would be have, with dependency aux). Sim- ilarly, from It is not supported by the text or his- tory of the Constitution, we avoid generating poten- tial interpretation It is supported by X text or his- tory of the Constitution, but not by the text or his- tory of the Constitution (focus would be the); and from You don't want to get yourself too upset about these things, potential interpretation You want X get yourself too upset about these things, but not to get (focus would be to, with part-of-speech tag TO).</p><p>Once potential foci are selected, we generate pos- itive interpretations by rewriting each focus with "someone/some people/something/etc." and ap- pending "but not text of focus" at the end. Addi- tionally, if the first token of the focus is a preposi- tion, we include it to improve readability, e.g., didn't leave [by noon]: left by sometime, but not by noon.</p><p>Note that potential interpretations obtained from foci that are direct syntactic dependents of the negated verb are coarse-grained interpretations, and the rest are fine-grained interpretations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> ex- emplifies the procedure step by step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Scoring Potential Positive Interpretations</head><p>After generating potential positive interpretations automatically, we asked annotators to score them. Annotators had access to the original negated sen- tence, the previous and next sentence as context, and one potential positive interpretation at a time. The interface asked Given the three sentences [pre- vious sentence, negated sentence and next sentence] above, do you think the statement [positive interpre- tation] below is true? Annotators were forced to an- swer with a score from 0 to 5, where 0 means ab- solutely disagree and 5 means absolutely agree. We did not provide descriptions for intermediate scores or use categorical labels. This simple guidelines were sufficient to reliably score plausible positive in- terpretations automatically generated (Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Corpus Analysis</head><p>The procedure described in Section 4.1 generates 9729 potential positive interpretations (5865 coarse- grained and 3864 fine-grained) from 1671 verbal negations. Out of all these potential positive inter- pretations, we annotate 1700 (1008 coarse-and 692 Negated statement, context if relevant to determining scores, and all positive interpretations Score 1 Context, previous statement:You're not giving me enough benefits. Negated Statement: You're not paying me for my overtime work. Context, next statement: Well I think the Walton family does take it personally. -Int. 1.1 <ref type="bibr">[coarse, root]</ref>: You're [some verb] me for my overtime work, but not paying. 4 -Int. 1.2 [coarse, nsubj]: [Some people]'re paying me for my overtime work, but not you. 0 -Int. 1.3 [coarse, dobj]: You're paying <ref type="bibr">[somebody]</ref> for my overtime work, but not me. 1 -Int. 1.4 <ref type="bibr">[coarse, prep]</ref>: You're paying me for <ref type="bibr">[something]</ref>, but not for my overtime work. 5 -Int. 1.5 [fine, poss]: You're paying me for [somebody's] overtime work, but not for my overtime work. 0 -Int. 1.6 [fine, nn]: You're paying me for my [some adjective] work, but not for my overtime work. 5 -Int. 1.7 [fine, pobj]: You're paying me for my overtime <ref type="bibr">[something]</ref> but not for my overtime work.   fine-grained). Overall, the mean score is 3.20, and the standard deviation is 1.66. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows basic statistics for potential foci, where dependency in- dicates the dependency from the potential focus to a token outside the potential focus. Most foci are nsubj, dobj and pobj, and the mean scores and stan- dard deviation are similar for most dependencies.</p><p>Annotation Quality. In order to ensure annotation quality, we calculated Pearson correlation. Kappa and other measures designed for categorical labels are ill-suited for our annotations, since not all dis- agreements between numeric scores are the same, e.g., 4 vs. 5 should be counted as higher agreement, than 1 vs. 5. Overall Pearson correlation was 0.75. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> presents 2 statements that contain verbal negation, the list of positive interpretations automat- ically generated and the annotated scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Annotation Examples</head><p>Example <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> is a simple negated clause, yet we generate 7 potential positive interpretations and 3 of them receive high scores (4 or 5). Given You're not paying me for my overtime work and the previous statement, it is reasonable to believe that the author is in an employee-employer relationship, and the employer is not fair to the employee. Interpretations 1.1, 1.4 and 1.6 are implicit positive interpretations intuitively understood by humans when reading the original negated statement. Namely, Interpretation 1.1: You (the employer) are nickel-and-diming me for my overtime work (focus is paying), Interpreta- tion 1.4: You (the employer) are paying me for some- thing (focus is my overtime work), and Interpretation 1.6: You (the employer) are paying me for my regu- lar work (focus is overtime). These interpretations show the benefits of fine-grained interpretations: In- terpretation 1.6 is a refinement of Interpretation 1.4, and the former is more desirable than the latter as it reveals more specific positive knowledge. The re- maining interpretations are legible, but do not make sense given the negated statement, e.g., interpreta- tion 1.2: Somebody (but not the employer) pays me for my overtime (focus is You).</p><p>Example <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> is also a simple negated clause, and 4 out of 5 interpretations receive high scores, captur- ing valid positive meaning.

Our approach has 2 ad- vantages with respect to those grounded on seman- tic roles (Blanco and Sarabi, 2016): (1) it generates both coarse-and fine-grained interpretations, and (2) learning to score interpretations is easier because state-of-the-art tools extract dependencies more re- liably than semantic roles.</p><p>To support claim (1), we compare the interpre- tations generated with our procedure and previous work using semantic roles. 96.12% of interpreta- tions generated using roles are also generated us- ing syntactic dependencies. Also, using dependen- cies allow us to generate 67.9% of additional (fine- grained) interpretations not obtainable with roles.</p><p>To support claim (2), we compare interpretations generated with gold and predicted linguistic infor- mation (roles or dependencies). The overlap with se- mantic roles is 70.1%, and with syntactic dependen- cies, 92.8%. Syntactic dependencies are thus better in a realistic scenario because they allow us to auto- matically generate (and score) most interpretations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Supervised Learning to Score Potential Positive Interpretations</head><p>We follow a standard supervised machine learning approach. The 1,700 potential positive interpreta- tions along with their scores become instances, and we divide them into training (80%) and test splits (20%) making sure that all interpretations generated from a sentence are assigned to either the training or test splits. Note that splitting instances randomly would not be sound: training with some interpreta- tions generated from a negation, and testing with the rest of interpretations generated from the same nega- tion would be an unfair evaluation. We train a Support Vector Machine for regression with RBF kernel using scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>), which in turn uses LIBSVM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chang and Lin, 2011)</ref>. SVM parameters (C and γ) were tuned using 10-fold cross-validation with the training set, and re- sults are calculated using the test set. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> presents the full feature set. Features are rel- atively simple and characterize the verbal negation from which a potential interpretation was generated, as well as the interpretation per se, i.e., the depen- dency subgraph chosen as potential focus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Feature Selection</head><p>Basic features account for the negation mark, the negation verb (word form and part-of-speech tag) and a binary flag indicating whether we are scoring a coarse-or fine-grained interpretation.</p><p>Path features are derived from the syntactic path</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Features</head><p>Gold Predicted neg mark -0.109 -0.077 basic 0.033 0.026 basic + path 0.474 0.482 basic + path + focus 0.530 0.560 between the subgraph selected as focus and the verb. We include the actual path (concatenation of de- pendencies and up/down symbols), and the modi- fied path using part-of-speech tags. Additionally, we also include the last dependency and part-of-speech tag, i.e., the ones closest to the verb in the path. Focus features characterize the dependency sub- graph chosen as focus to generate the potential inter- pretation. Specifically, we include the number of to- kens, word form and part-of-speech tags of the first and last tokens, and whether the focus occurs before or after the verb. We also include features derived form the head of the focus, which we define as the token whose syntactic head is outside the focus. We include the word form and part-of-speech of the fo- cus head, as well as its the dependency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Experiments and Results</head><p>We report results obtained with several combina- tions of features in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. We detail results ob- tained with features extracted from gold-standard and predicted linguistic annotations (part-of-speech tags and syntactic dependencies) as annotated in the gold and auto files from the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task release of <ref type="bibr">OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2011</ref>). All models are trained with gold-standard linguis- tic annotations, and tested with either gold-standard or predicted linguistic annotations. Testing with gold-standard POS tags and syn- tactic dependencies. Training with the word form of the negation mark is virtually useless, it yields a Pearson correlation of −0.109. Basic features (negation mark, verb and flag indicating coarse- or fine-grained interpretation) are also ineffective to score potential interpretations (Pearson: 0.033). Including features derived from the syntactic path yields higher correlation, 0.474, even though these features only capture the syntactic relationship be- tween the focus from which the interpretation was generated and the verb. Finally, adding focus features yields the best results (Pearson: 0.53, +11.8%). Testing with predicted POS tags and syntactic de- pendencies. We selected 20% of positive interpre- tations in our corpus as test instances, totalling 379 interpretations (Section 6). When executing the pro- cedure to generate potential interpretations (Section 4.1) with predicted linguistic information, however, we are unable to generate all of them due to incorrect and missing syntactic dependencies. Specifically, 352 of the 379 interpretations are generated (92.8%). While we do not generate 7.2% of instances, this percentage is substantially lower than previous work grounded on semantic roles (Section 5.2).</p><p>Pearson correlations with predicted linguistic in- formation are calculated using the 352 instances that were also generated with gold dependencies (and thus assigned a score during the manual annota- tions). Correlations are slightly higher and follow a similar trend than the correlations obtained with gold-standard linguistic information. These results should be taken with a grain of salt: the test in- stances are not exactly the same, and the 352 test instances in this scenario are presumably easier to score than the remainder 27, as dependencies were predicted correctly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>Humans intuitively extract positive meaning from negation when reading text. This paper presents an automated procedure to generate potential posi- tive interpretations from verbal negation, and score them according to their likelihood. Our procedure is grounded on syntactic dependencies, allowing us to extract fine-grained interpretations beyond semantic roles (67.9% additional interpretations). Addition- ally, because dependencies are extracted automati- cally more reliably than semantic roles, we gener- ate 92.8% of all potential interpretations when us- ing predicted linguistic information, as opposed to 70.1% with semantic roles.</p><p>On average, we generate 6.4 potential interpreta- tions per verbal negation (coarse-grained: 3.8, fine- grained: 2.6). Manual annotations show that po- tential interpretations are deemed likely. The mean score is 3.20 (out of 5.0), thus we extract a substan- tial amount of positive meaning.</p><p>The work presented in this paper is not tied to any existing semantic representation. While we rely heavily on syntactic dependencies, positive interpre- tations are generated in plain text, and they could be processed, along with the original negated state- ment, with any NLP pipeline.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>0 2 Negated</head><label>02</label><figDesc>Statement: Those concerns aren't expressed in public. -Int. 2.1 [coarse, root]: Those concerns are [some verb] in public, but not expressed. 5 -Int. 2.2 [coarse, nsubjpass]: [Some things] are expressed in public, but not Those concerns. 5 -Int. 2.3 [fine, nsubjpass]: Those [some noun] are expressed in public, but not Those concerns. 2 -Int. 2.4 [fine, det]: [Some] concerns are expressed in public but, not Those concerns. 4 -Int. 2.5 [coarse, prep]: Those concerns are expressed in [somewhere], but not in public. 5</figDesc></figure>
