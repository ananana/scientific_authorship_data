				<p>In an online community, new words come and go: today&apos;s haha may be replaced by tomor-row&apos;s lol. Changes in online writing are usually studied as a social process, with innovations diffusing through a network of individuals in a speech community. But unlike other types of innovation, language change is shaped and constrained by the grammatical system in which it takes part. To investigate the role of social and structural factors in language change, we undertake a large-scale analysis of the frequencies of nonstandard words in Red-dit. Dissemination across many linguistic contexts is a predictor of success: words that appear in more linguistic contexts grow faster and survive longer. Furthermore, social dissemination plays a less important role in explaining word growth and decline than previously hypothesized.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Stop trying to make "fetch" happen! It's not going to happen! -Regina George <ref type="bibr">(Mean Girls, 2005)</ref> With the fast-paced and ephemeral nature of on- line discourse, language change in online writing is both prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Androutsopoulos, 2011)</ref> and no- ticeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Squires, 2010)</ref>. In social media, new words emerge constantly to replace even basic ex- pressions such as laughter: today's haha is tomor- row's lol <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tagliamonte and Denis, 2008)</ref>. Why do some nonstandard words, like lol, succeed and spread to new contexts, while others, like fetch, fail to catch on? Can a word's growth be predicted from patterns of usage during its early days?</p><p>Language change can be treated like other so- cial innovations, such as the spread of hyper- links ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bakshy et al., 2011</ref>) or hashtags <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Romero et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Tsur and Rappoport, 2015)</ref>. A key aspect of the adoption of a new practice is its dis- semination: is it used by many people, and in many social contexts? High dissemination enables words to achieve greater exposure among social groups ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann et al., 2011</ref>), and may signal that the innovation is positively evaluated.</p><p>In addition to social constraints, language change is also shaped by grammatical con- straints <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(D'Arcy and Tagliamonte, 2015)</ref>. New words and phrases rarely change the rules of the game but must instead find their place in a compet- itive ecosystem with finely-differentiated linguis- tic roles, or "niches" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacWhinney, 1989)</ref>. Some words become valid in a broad range of linguis- tic contexts, while others remain bound to a small number of fixed expressions. We therefore posit a structural analogue to social dissemination, which we call linguistic dissemination.</p><p>We compare the fates of such words to deter- mine how linguistic and social dissemination each relate to word growth, focusing on the adoption of nonstandard words in the popular online commu- nity Reddit. The following hypotheses are evalu- ated:</p><p>• H1: Nonstandard words with higher ini- tial social dissemination are more likely to grow. Following the intuition that words re- quire a large social base to succeed, we hy- pothesize a positive correlation between so- cial dissemination and word growth.</p><p>• H2-weak: Nonstandard words with higher linguistic dissemination in the early phase of their history are more likely to grow. This follows from work in corpus linguis- tics showing that words and grammatical pat- terns with a higher diversity of collocations are more likely to be adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ito and Tagliamonte, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Partington, 1993</ref>).</p><p>• H2-strong: Nonstandard words with higher linguistic dissemination are more likely to grow, even after controlling for so- cial dissemination. This follows from the in- tuition that linguistic context and social con- text contribute differently to word growth.</p><p>To address H2, we develop a novel metric for characterizing linguistic dissemination, by com- paring the observed number of n-gram contexts to the number of contexts that would be predicted based on frequency alone. Our analysis of word growth and decline includes: (1) prediction of fre- quency change in growth words (as in prior work); (2) causal inference of the influence of dissemi- nation on probability of word growth; (3) binary prediction of future growth versus decline; and (4) survival analysis, to determine the factors that predict when a word's popularity begins to de- cline. All tests indicate that linguistic dissemi- nation plays an important role in explaining the growth and decline of nonstandard words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Lexical change online Language changes con- stantly, and one of the most notable forms of change is the adoption of new words <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Metcalf, 2004)</ref>, sometimes referred to as lexical entrench- ment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chesley and Baayen, 2010)</ref>. New nonstan- dard words may arise through the mutation of ex- isting forms by processes such as truncation (e.g, favorite to fave; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grieve et al., 2016)</ref> and blend- ing (e.g., web+log to weblog to blog; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cook and Stevenson, 2010)</ref>. The fast pace and intercon- nected nature of online communication is partic- ularly conducive to innovation, and social me- dia provides a "birds-eye view" on the process of change (Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mizil et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kershaw et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Tsur and Rappoport, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The most closely related work is a contempo- raneous study that explored the role of weak so- cial ties in the dissemination of linguistic innova- tions on Reddit, which also proposed the task of quantitatively predicting the success or failure of lexical innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tredici and Fernández, 2018)</ref>. One distinguishing feature of our work is the em- phasis on linguistic (rather than social) context in explaining these successes and failures. In addi- tion to predicting the binary distinction between success and failure, we also take on the more fine- grained task of predicting the length of time that each nonstandard word will survive.</p><p>Social dissemination Language changes as a re- sult of transmission across generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Labov, 2007)</ref> as well as diffusion across individuals and social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bucholtz, 1999)</ref>. Such diffusion can be quantified with social dissemination, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann et al. (2011)</ref> define as the count of social units (e.g., users) who have adopted a word, nor- malized by the expected count under a null model in which the word is used with equal frequency across the entire population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann et al. (2011)</ref> use dissemination of words across forum users and threads to predict the words' change in frequency in Usenet, finding a positive correlation between frequency change and both kinds of social dis- semination. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Garley and Hockenmaier (2012)</ref> use the same metric to predict the growth of English loanwords on German hip-hop forums, and find that social dissemination has less predic- tive power than expected. We seek to replicate these prior findings, and to extend them to the broader context of Reddit.</p><p>Linguistic dissemination In historical linguis- tics, the distribution of a new word or con- struction across lexical contexts can signal future growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Partington, 1993)</ref>. Furthermore, gram- matical and lexical factors can explain a speaker's choice of linguistic variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ito and Tagliamonte, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cacoullos and Walker, 2009</ref>) and can pro- vide more insight than social factors alone. Our study proposes a generalizable method of measur- ing the dissemination of a word across lexical con- texts with linguistic dissemination and compares social and linguistic dissemination as predictors of language change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Our study examines the adoption of words on so- cial media, and we focus on Reddit as a source of language change. Reddit is a social content shar- ing site separated into distinct sub-communities or "subreddits" that center around particular top- ics <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gilbert, 2013)</ref>. Reddit is a socially diverse and dynamic online platform, making it an ideal en- vironment for research on language change <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kershaw et al., 2016</ref>). Furthermore, because Reddit data is publicly available we expect that this study can be more readily replicated than a similar study on other platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, whose data is less easily obtained. We analyze a set of public monthly Reddit com- ments 1 posted between 1 June 2013 and 31 May 2016, totalling T = 36 months of data. This dataset has been analyzed in prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hessel et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tan and Lee, 2015)</ref> and has been noted to have some missing data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gaffney and Matias, 2018)</ref>, although this issue should not af- fect our analysis. To reduce noise in the data, we filter all comments generated by known bots and spam users 2 and filter all comments created in well-known non-English subreddits. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The final data collected is summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>We replace all references to subreddits and users (marked by the convention r/subreddit and u/user) with r/SUB and u/USER tokens, and all hy- perlinks with a URL token. We also reduce all re- peated character sequences to a maximum length of three (e.g., loooool to loool). The final vo- cabulary includes the top 100,000 words by fre- quency. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We replace all OOV words with UNK tokens, which comprise 3.95% of the total tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Finding growth words</head><p>Our work seeks to study the growth of nonstan- dard words, which we identify manually instead of relying on pre-determined lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tredici and Fernández, 2018)</ref>.To detect such words, we first compute the Spearman correlation coefficient be- tween the time steps {1...T } and each word w's frequency time series f (w)</p><p>(1:T ) (frequency normal- ized and log-transformed). The Spearman cor- relation coefficient captures monotonic, gradual growth that characterizes the adoption of nonstan-dard words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grieve et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kershaw et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The first set of words is filtered by a Spear- man correlation coefficient above the 85 th per- centile (N = 15, 017). From this set of words, one of the authors manually identified 1,120 words in set G ("growth") that are neither proper nouns (berniebot, killary, drumpf ) nor standard words (election, voting). 5 These words were removed because their growth may be due to exogenous in- fluence. A "standard" word is one that can plau- sibly be found in a newspaper article, which fol- lows from the common understanding of news- paper text as a more formal and standard regis- ter. Therefore, a "nonstandard" word is one that cannot plausibly be found in a newspaper arti- cle, a judgment often used by linguists to deter- mine what counts as slang <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dumas and Lighter, 1978)</ref>. In ambiguous cases, one of the authors in- spected a sample of comments that included the word. We validate this process by having both au- thors annotate the top 200 growth candidates for standard/proper versus nonstandard (binary), ob- taining inter-annotator agreement of κ=0.79.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Finding decline words</head><p>To determine what makes the growth words suc- cessful, we need a control group of "decline" words, which are briefly adopted and later aban- doned. Although these words may have been suc- cessful before the time period investigated, their decline phase makes them a useful comparison for the growth words. We find such words by fitting two parametric models to the frequency series.</p><p>Piecewise linear fit We fit a two-phase piece- wise linear regression on each word's frequency time series f (1:T ) , which splits the time series into f (1: ˆ t) and f ( ˆ t+1:T ) . The goal is to select a split pointˆtpointˆ pointˆt to minimize the sum of the squared error between observed frequency f and predicted fre- quencyˆfquencyˆ quencyˆf :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ f (m 1 , m 2 , b, t) = b + m 1 t t ≤ ˆ t b + m 1 ˆ t + m 2 (t − ˆ t) t &gt; ˆ t, (1)</formula><p>where b is the intercept, m 1 is the slope of the first phase, and m 2 is the slope of the second phase. Decline words D p ("piecewise decline") display  idk, lmao, shitpost, tbh, tho D l atty, eyebleach, iifym, obeasts, trashy Dp brojob, nparent, rekd, terpers, wot growth in the first phase (m 1 &gt; 0), decline in the second phase (m 2 &lt; 0), and a strong fit be- tween observed and predicted data, indicated by R 2 (f, ˆ f ) above the 85 th percentile (36.1%); this filtering yields 14,995 candidates.</p><p>Logistic fit To account for smoother growth- decline trajectories, we also fit the growth curve to a logistic distribution, which is a continuous unimodal distribution with support over the non- negative reals. We identify the set of candidates D l ("logistic decline") as words with a strong fit to this distribution, as indicated by R 2 above the 99 th percentile (82.4%), yielding 998 candidates. The logistic word set partially overlaps with the piece- wise set, because some words' frequency time se- ries show a strong fit to both the piecewise func- tion and the logistic distribution.</p><p>Combined set We combine the sets D p and D l to produce a set of decline word candidates (N = 15, 665). Next, we filter this combined set to ex- clude standard words and proper nouns, yielding a total of 530 decline words in set D. Each word is assigned a split pointˆtpointˆ pointˆt based on the estimated time of switch between the growth phase and the decline phase, which is the split pointˆtpointˆ pointˆt for piece- wise decline words and the center of the logistic distributionˆµdistributionˆ distributionˆµ for the logistic decline words.</p><p>Examples of both growth and decline words are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The growth words in- clude several acronyms (tbh, "to be honest"; lmao, "laughing my ass off"), while the decline words include clippings (atty, "atomizer"), respellings (rekd, "wrecked"; wot, "what") and compounds (nparent, "narcissistic parent").</p><p>We also provide a distribution of the words across word generation categories in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, in- cluding compounds and clippings in similar pro- portions to prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kulkarni and Wang, 2018</ref>  pect that this will be a significant confound in dif- ferentiating growth from decline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Predictors</head><p>We now outline the predictors used to measure the degree of social and linguistic dissemination in the growth and decline words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Social dissemination</head><p>We rely on the dissemination metric proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann et al. (2011)</ref> to measure the degree to which a word occupies a specific social niche (e.g., low dissemination implies limited niche). To com- pute user dissemination D U for word w at time t, we first compute the number of individual users who used word w at time t, written U (w)</p><p>t . We then compare this with the expectatioñ U (w) t under a model in which word frequency is identical across all users. The user dissemination is the log ratio,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log U (w) t ˜ U (w) t = log U (w) t − log˜Ulog˜ log˜U (w) t .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann et al. (2011)</ref>, the expected count˜Ucount˜ count˜U (w) t is computed as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">˜ U (w) t = u∈Ut (1 − e −f (w) t m (u) t ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where m (u) t equals the total number of words con- tributed by user u in month t, and U t is the set of all users active in month t. This corresponds to a model in which each token from a user has identical likelihood f (w) t of being word w. In this way, we compute dissemination for all users (D U ), subreddits (D S ) and threads (D T ) for each month t ∈ {1...T }.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Linguistic dissemination</head><p>Linguistic dissemination captures the diversity of linguistic contexts in which a word appears, as measured by unique n-gram counts. We compute the log count of unique trigram 6 contexts for all words (C 3 ) using all possible trigram positions: in the sentence "that's cool af haha", the term af ap- pears in three unique trigrams, that's cool af, cool af haha, af haha &lt;END&gt;.</p><p>The unique log number of trigram contexts is strongly correlated with log word frequency (ρ(C 3 , f ) = 0.904), as implied by <ref type="bibr">Heaps' law (Egghe, 2007)</ref>. We therefore adjust this statis- tic by comparing with its expected value˜Cvalue˜ value˜C 3 . At each timestep t, we fit a linear regression between log-frequency and log-unique n-gram counts, and then compute the residual between the observed log count of unique trigrams and its expectation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D L = C 3 t − ˜ C 3 t .</formula><p>The residual D L , or linguis- tic dissemination, identifies words with a higher or lower number of lexical contexts than expected.</p><p>Linguistic dissemination can separate words by grammatical category, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> where the mean D L values are computed for words across common part-of-speech categories. Part- of-speech tags were computed over the entire cor- pus using a Twitter-based tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gimpel et al., 2011)</ref>, and each word type was assigned the most likely POS tag to provide an approximate distribu- tion of tags over the vocabulary. Interjections have a lower median D L than other word categories due to the tendency of interjections to occur in limited lexical contexts. Conversely, verbs have a higher median D L due to the flexibility of verbs' argu- ments (e.g., subject and object may both be open- class nouns).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>The hypotheses about social and linguistic dissem- ination are tested under four analyses: correlation against frequency change in growth words; causal inference on probability of word growth; binary <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Pilot analysis with bigram contexts gave similar results.   prediction of word growth; and survival analysis of decline words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Correlational analysis</head><p>To test the relative importance of the linguistic and social context on word growth, we corre- late these metrics with frequency change (∆ ft = f t − f t−k ) across all growth words. This repli- cates the methodology in prior work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Garley and Hockenmaier (2012)</ref>, who analyzed different internet forums. Focus- ing on long-term change with k = 12 (one year) and k = 24 (two years), we compute the propor- tion of variance in frequency change explained by the covariates using a relative importance regres- sion <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kruskal, 1987)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The results of the regression are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. All predictors have relative impor- tance greater than zero, according to a bootstrap method to produce confidence intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tonidandel et al., 2009)</ref>. Frequency is the strongest predic- tor (f t−12 , f t−24 ), because words with low initial frequency often show the most frequency change. In both short-and long-term prediction, linguis- tic dissemination (D L t−12 , D L t−24 ) has a higher rel- ative importance than each of the social dissem- ination metrics. The social dissemination met- rics have less explanatory power, in comparison with the other predictors and in comparison to the prior results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Garley and Hockenmaier (2012)</ref>, who found 1.5% of variance explained by D U and 1.9% for D T at k = 24. Our results were robust to the exclusion of the predictor D L , meaning that a model with only the social dissemination met- rics as predictors resulted in a similar proportion of variance explained. The weakness of social dis- semination could be due to the fragmented nature of Reddit, compared to more intra-connected fo- rums. Since users and threads are spread across many different subreddits, and users may not visit multiple subreddits, a higher social dissemination for a particular word may not lead to immediate growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Causal analysis</head><p>While correlation can help explain the relationship between dissemination and frequency change, it only addresses the weak version of H2: it does not distinguish the causal impact of linguistic and so- cial dissemination. To test the strong version of H2, we turn to a causal analysis, in which the out- come is whether a nonstandard word grows or de- clines, the treatment is a single dissemination met- ric such as linguistic dissemination, and the co- variates are the remaining dissemination metrics. The goal of this analysis is to test the impact of each dissemination metric, while holding the oth- ers constant.</p><p>Causal inference typically uses a binary treat- ment/control distinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angrist et al., 1996</ref>), but in this case the treatment is continuous. We there- fore turn to an adapted model known as the aver- age dose response function to measure the causal impact of dissemination <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Imbens, 2000</ref>). To ex- plain the procedure for estimating the average dose response, we adopt the following terminol- ogy: Z for treatment variable, X for covariates, Y for outcome. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> 1. A linear model is fit to estimate the treatment from the covariates,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Z i | X i ∼ N (β X i , σ 2 ).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The output of this estimation procedure is a vector of weightsˆβweightsˆ weightsˆβ and a variancê σ 2 .</p><p>2. The generalized propensity score (GPS) R is the likelihood of observing the treatment given the covariates, P (Z i | X i ). It is com- puted from the parameters estimated in the <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Average dose response function implemented in the causaldrf package in R: https://cran.r-project. org/package=causaldrf previous step:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ˆ R i = 1 √ 2πˆσ2πˆσ 2 exp − (Z i − ˆ β X i ) 2 2ˆσ2ˆσ 2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>3. A logistic model is fit to predict the outcome Y i using the treatment Z i and the GPSˆRGPSˆ GPSˆR i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ˆ Y i = Logistic(ˆ α 0 + ˆ α 1 Z i + ˆ α 2 ˆ R i ). (6)</formula><p>This involves estimating the parameters {ˆα{ˆα 0 , ˆ α 1 , ˆ α 2 .} By incorporating the general- ized propensity scorê R i into this predictive model over the outcome, it is possible to iso- late the causal effect of the treatment from the other covariates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hirano and Imbens, 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The range of treatments is divided into levels</head><p>(quantiles). The average dose response for a given treatment level s z is the mean esti- mated outcome for all instances at that treat- ment level,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ˆ µ(s z ) = 1 |s z | z i ∈szˆY ∈szˆ ∈szˆY i .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The average dose response function is then plotted for all treatment levels.</p><p>Each dissemination metric is considered sepa- rately as a treatment. We consider all other dis- semination metrics and frequency as covariates: e.g., for treatment variable D L , the covariates are set to <ref type="bibr">[f, D U , D S , D T ]</ref>. We bootstrap the above process 100 times with different samples to pro- duce confidence intervals. To balance the outcome classes, we sample an equal number of growth and decline words for each bootstrap iteration.</p><p>The average dose response function curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref> show that linguistic dissemination (D L ) produces the most dramatic increase in word growth probability. For linguistic dissemination, the lowest treatment quantile (0%-10%) yields a growth probability below 40% (significantly less than chance), as compared to the highest treatment quantile (90-100%), which yields a growth prob- ability nearly at 70% (significantly greater than chance). This supports the strong form of H2, which states that linguistic dissemination is pre- dictive of growth, even after controlling for the fre- quency and the other dissemination metrics. Sub- reddit dissemination also shows a mild causal ef- fect on word growth, up to 60% in the highest treatment quantile. The other social dissemination metrics prove to have less effect on word growth.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Predictive analysis</head><p>We now turn to prediction to determine the utility of linguistic and social dissemination: using the first k months of data, can we predict whether a word will grow or decline in popularity? This is similar to previous work in predicting the success of lexical innovations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kooti et al., 2012</ref>), but our goal is to compare the relative predictive power of various dissemination metrics, rather than to max- imize accuracy.</p><p>We use logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation over four different feature sets: frequency-only (f), frequency plus linguistic dissemination (f+L), frequency plus social dissemination (f+S) and all features (f+L+S). Each fold is balanced for classes so that the baseline accuracy is 50%. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref> shows that linguistic dissemination provides more predictive power than social dissemination: the accuracy is consistently higher for the models with linguistic dissemination than for the frequency-only and social dissemination models. The accuracies converge as the training data size increases, which suggests that frequency is a useful predictor if provided sufficient historical trajectory.</p><p>Part-of-speech robustness check Considering the uneven distribution of linguistic dissemination across part-of-speech groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 1)</ref>, the pre- diction results may be explained by an imbalance of word categories between the growth and decline words. This issue is addressed through two robust- ness checks: within-group comparison and predic- tion.</p><p>First, we compare the distribution of linguistic dissemination values between growth and decline words, grouped by the most common POS tags (computed in § 4.2). Each decline word is matched with a growth word based on similar mean fre- quency in the first k = 12 months, and their mean linguistic dissemination values during that time period are compared, grouped within POS tag groups. The differences in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4</ref> show that across all POS tags, the growth words show a ten- dency toward higher linguistic dissemination with significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in the interjec- tions, adjectives and verbs.</p><p>Next, we add POS tags as additional features to the frequency-only model in the binary predic- tion task. The accuracy of a predictive model with access to frequency and POS features at k = 1 is 54.8%, which is substantially lower than the ac- curacy of the model with frequency and linguistic dissemination (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Thus, linguistic dis- semination thus contributes predictive power be- yond what is contributed by part-of-speech alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Survival analysis</head><p>Having investigated what separates growth from decline, we now focus on the factors that precede a decline word's "death" phase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Drouin and Dury, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Predicting the time until a word's decline can be framed as survival analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Klein and Moeschberger, 2005</ref>), in which a word is said to "survive" until the beginning of its decline phase at split pointˆtpointˆ pointˆt. In the Cox proportional hazards model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cox, 1972)</ref>, the hazard of death λ at each time t is modeled as a linear function of a vector of predictors,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">λ i (t) = λ 0 (t) exp(β · x i ),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where x i is the vector of predictors for word i, and β is the vector of coefficients. Each cell x i,j is set to the mean value of predictor j for word i over the training period t = {1...k} where k = 3. For words which begin to decline in popular- ity in our dataset, we treat the point of decline as the "death" date. The remaining words are viewed as censored instances: they may begin to decline in popularity at some point in the future, but this time is outside our frame of observation. We use frequency, social dissemination and lin- guistic dissemination as predictors in a Cox re- gression model. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The estimated coefficients from the regres- sion are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>. We find a nega- tive coefficient for linguistic dissemination (β = −0.330, p &lt; 0.001), which mirrors the results from § 5.2: higher D L indicates a lower haz- ard of word death, and therefore a higher likeli- hood of survival. We also find that higher sub- reddit dissemination has a weak but insignificant correlation with a lower likelihood of word death (β = −0.156, p &gt; 0.05). Both of these results <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Higher k values yield similar results. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Cox regression implemented in the lifelines package in Python: https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/ en/latest/.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Predictor β std. error Z p f -0.207 0.0492 -4.21 *** D L -0.330 0.0385 -8.56 *** D U 0.0053 0.0518 0.102 D S -0.156 0.0807 -1.928 D T</formula><p>0.0825 0.0662 1.25  lend additional support to the strong form of the hypothesis H2.</p><p>The predictive accuracy of survival analysis can be quantified by a concordance score. A score of 1.0 on heldout data indicates that the model per- fectly predicts the order of death times; a score of 0.5 indicates that the predictions are no bet- ter than a chance ordering. We perform 10-fold cross-validation of the survival analysis model, and plot the results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>. The model with access to linguistic dissemination (f+L) consis- tently achieves higher concordance than the base- line frequency-only model (f), (t = 4.29, p &lt; 0.001), and the model with all predictors f+L+S significantly outperforms the model with access only to frequency and social dissemination f+S (t = 4.64, p &lt; 0.001). The result is reinforced by testing the goodness-of-fit for each model with model deviance, or difference from the null model. The f+L model has lower deviance, i.e. better fit, than the null model (χ 2 = 93.3, p &lt; 0.01), and the f+L+S does not have a significantly lower de- viance than the f+L model (χ 2 = 4.6, p = 0.80), suggesting that adding social dissemination does not significantly improve model fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>All four analyses support H2: linguistic dissemi- nation was the strongest predictor of monthly fre- quency changes in growth words, the best differ- entiator of growth and decline words in causal and predictive tasks, and the most effective warning sign that a word is about to decline. Linguistic dissemination can be related to theories such as the FUDGE factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chesley and Baayen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cook, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Metcalf, 2004)</ref>, in which a word's growth depends on frequency (F), unobtrusiveness (U), diversity of users and situations (D), gener- ation of other forms and meanings (G), and en- durance (E). Linguistic dissemination provides an example of "diversity of situation."</p><p>The effectiveness of linguistic dissemination is exemplified in pairs of semantically similar growth and decline words. In the first k = 3 months of growth, the growth word kinda has a relatively high ratio of linguistic to frequency ( D L f = 0.270) as compared with the semanti- cally similar decline word sorta (0.055). This pat- tern holds for other pairs of semantically similar growth/decline words: fuckwit and fuckboy; lolno and lmao; yup and yas. While not exhaustive, such a trend suggests that the growth words were able to reach a wider range of lexical contexts and there- fore succeed where the decline words failed.</p><p>Regarding H1, we generally found a positive role for social dissemination as well, although these results were not consistent across all metrics and tests, particularly in the survival analysis. This matches the conclusion from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Garley and Hockenmaier (2012)</ref>, who argued that social dissemina- tion is less predictive of word adoption than Alt- mann et al. (2011) originally suggested. One pos- sible explanation is the inclusion of word cate- gories such as proper nouns in the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altmann et al. (2011)</ref>; the adoption of such terms may rely on social dynamics more than the adoption of nonstandard terms. The lower predictive power of thread and user dissemination is also interest- ing and suggests that subreddits are more socially salient in terms of exposing nonstandard words to potential adopters.</p><p>Limitations One limitation in the study was the exclusion of orthographic and morphological fea- tures such as affixation, which has been noted as a predictor of word growth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kershaw et al., 2016)</ref>. Future work should incorporate these fea- tures as additional predictors. Our study also omit- ted borrowings, unlike prior work in word adop- tion that has focused on borrowings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chesley and Baayen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Garley and Hockenmaier, 2012)</ref>. Our early language-filtering steps eliminated most non-English words from the vocabulary, although it would have been interesting to examine loan- word use in English-language posts. Finally, our study was limited by the focus on nonstandard words rather than memetic phrases (e.g., like a boss) which may show a similar correlation be- tween dissemination, growth and decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bybee, 2006</ref>).</p><p>Future work We approximate linguistic dis- semination using trigram counts, because they are easy to compute and they generalize across word categories. In future work, a more sophis- ticated approach might estimate linguistic dissem- ination with syntactic features such as appearance across different phrase heads <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kroch, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ito and Tagliamonte, 2003)</ref> or across nouns of dif- ferent semantic classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(D'Arcy and Tagliamonte, 2015)</ref>. Future work should also investigate more semantically-aware definitions of linguistic dis- semination. The existence of semantic "neigh- bors" occurring in similar contexts (e.g., the in- fluence of standard intensifier very on nonstan- dard intensifier af ) may prevent a new word from reaching widespread popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grieve, 2018)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>G</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
