				<p>Referring to entities in situated dialog is a col-laborative process, whereby interlocutors often expand, repair and/or replace referring expressions in an iterative process, converging on conceptual pacts of referring language use in doing so. Nevertheless, much work on ex-ophoric reference resolution (i.e. resolution of references to entities outside of a given text) follows a literary model, whereby individual referring expressions are interpreted as unique identifiers of their referents given the state of the dialog the referring expression is initiated. In this paper, we address this collaborative nature to improve dialogic reference resolution in two ways: First, we trained a words-as-classifiers logistic regression model of word semantics and incrementally adapt the model to idiosyncratic language between dyad partners during evaluation of the dialog. We then used these semantic models to learn the general referring ability of each word, which is independent of referent features. These methods facilitate accurate automatic reference resolution in situated dialog without annotation of referring expressions, even with little background data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A crucial part of dialog situated in a physical en- vironment is exophoric references, i.e. language used by the participants to make entities in the shared environment salient to each other for the purposes of communication ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Poesio and Vieira, 1998)</ref>. Several studies in exophoric reference res- olution have investigated how referential seman- tics can be learned automatically via the relation- ship of a referent's features to the language refer- ring to it (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shore and Skantze, 2017)</ref> or the state of the interaction a di- alog is situated in (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Prasov and Chai, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Iida † Deceased 2 July 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">. et al., 2010</ref>, inferring a relationship between e.g. the word red and the individual features it refers to, e.g. a particular range of hue values.</p><p>Speaker Utterance A it's the one to the left B the purple pinkish uh weird? A the pinkish one yeah it looks like an asteroid or something big B the very big? A yeah <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Collaborative reference in dialog situated in a reference communication task (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Krauss and Weinheimer, 1964</ref>).</p><p>Most works in exophoric reference resolution have assumed the identification of certain sub- sets of language known as referring expres- sions (REs) that have been either manually or automatically annotated (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schutte et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Meena et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zarrieß et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shore and Skantze, 2017)</ref>. However, discerning REs from non-referring language in dialog is not triv- ial. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates an interaction between two participants in a reference commu- nication task like that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Krauss and Weinheimer (1964)</ref>, whereby speaker A describes a particular referent which must be resolved by speaker B. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</p><p>While REs are idealized as contiguous, single noun phrases (NPs) such as the pinkish one, ref- erence in unrestricted, natural dialog is in fact a collaborative process to which both partners in a dyad contribute <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986)</ref>, and not all referring language (RL) is nominal, e.g. big in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Both participants contribute RL in a cumulative fashion, but often no complete nomi- nal RE is produced, e.g. the big pinkish asteroid to the left. Due to this, it is difficult to infer from syn- tax alone the referring ability (RA) of language, i.e. the overall ability of a subset of language to un- ambiguously refer to entities in discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ariel, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Reboul, 1997</ref>). In context (e.g. given the set of possible abstract shapes to choose from), it is easy to infer which words have the greatest RA, but without context this is more difficult. This makes recognizing "non-ideal" cases of RL diffi- cult, as the boundary between RL and non-RL is often fuzzy.</p><p>Moreover, participants in dialog tend to develop so-called conceptual pacts, which means that they converge on commonly-used RL for unique referents in dialog <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brennan and Clark, 1996)</ref>. As an example, they may repeatedly refer to a given entity as e.g. the asteroid even though asteroid may only rarely be used to refer to similar enti- ties in the general population. Thus, RL varies less within a given dialog than across dialogs, and vari- ation of RL has an inverse relationship with the length of the time two participants interact due to alignment of dialog participants' use of language <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Garrod and Anderson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brennan, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present two contributions to the automatic learning of referential semantics for reference resolution in situated dialog that address these problems: Firstly, we show the benefits of adapting models of RL semantics to a specific di- alog as it progresses to accommodate the dyad's idiosyncratic use of RL. Secondly, we present a method for deriving a gradient (non-binary) mea- sure of RA in situated dialog. Thus, instead of first identifying REs and then resolving which en- tity they refer to, we treat all language in the di- alog as being more or less referential, and use this gradual measure together with the referential semantics to derive which entity is being talked about. Our assumption is that while the exact referential semantics of words vary greatly across dyads, the general ability of a given word to suc- cessfully refer to entities varies little across dyads. Thus, it should be possible to statistically measure the ability of a set of language to refer to entities in general, irrespective of the language's seman- tic content (e.g. the exact hue understood as pink by a dyad). This knowledge, combined with dia- logic adaptation, facilitates accurate automatic ref- erence resolution in situated dialog without anno- tation of REs, even with little background data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Both behavioral studies on reference resolution and RL and computational models thereof have il- lustrated the context-sensitive nature of reference resolution and RL and the gradient nature of RA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Collaboration in Reference Resolution</head><p>Traditionally, reference resolution in dialog was analyzed using a literary model of reference, whereby individual REs are seen as unique iden- tifiers of a referent as in written discourse, i.e. each RE is assumed to be "atomic" in its ref- erence to a particular entity <ref type="bibr">(Clark and WilkesGibbs, 1986, 3)</ref>. However, shortcomings in this approach have long since been identified (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Olson, 1970)</ref>: REs often do not unambiguously iden- tify their referent when initiated but rather com- prise a larger process of collaborative reference resolution, whereby multiple dialog participants iteratively extend, repair and even replace REs ini- tiated by themselves or others <ref type="bibr">(Clark and WilkesGibbs, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heeman and Hirst, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, speaker A initiates the RE the one to the left and immediately expands it in an episodic manner <ref type="bibr">(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986, 4, 17)</ref>. Given a literary model of reference, they should have supplied exactly enough information to iden- tify the referent and no more (the big pinkish aster- oid to the left), adhering to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Grice's (1975)</ref> maxim of quantity. However, RL can undergo not only ex- pansion but also replacement: For color, speaker B proposes both purple and pinkish, but only pinkish is then accepted by A.</p><p>In contrast to a literary model of reference, a collaborative model represents reference resolu- tion as a process of iteratively presenting RL to the other participant(s) in a dialog, which is then either accepted as being sufficient to identify a ref- erent or rejected as insufficient <ref type="bibr">(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986, 9)</ref>. This more accurately models ref- erence observed in spoken dialog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Referring Language Syntax</head><p>Literary reference models fail to account not only for the collaborative nature of reference resolution but also for the syntactic structure of RL itself: Ideally, a reference is expressed linguistically as an NP, but this ideal does not hold in unrestricted dialog <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Since an RE cannot be defined as an atomic re- ferring unit, a model of RL should ideally be able to measure the RA of any given set of language rather than simply classifying language as (part of) an RE in a binary decision, such as by using hand- crafted rules (cf. Shore and Skantze, 2017) or ex- pert annotation (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Spanger et al., 2009;</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Modeling Referring Language</head><p>There have already been some efforts in auto- matic annotation of REs: For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schutte et al. (2011)</ref> algorithmically extracted RL as ut- terance(s) preceding a discrete event in a shared environment within a certain timeframe. However, one drawback to this method is that "the references must be contained in instructions that cause events involving the referents" and "it must be possible to automatically detect these events" ( <ref type="bibr">Schutte et al., 2011, 189</ref>). Thus, REs not referring to a detectable event cannot be detected in this manner. More- over, not all language extracted is that of REs: For example, in the instruction go through that door, only half of the tokens constitute RL (that door). This means that this method must either be sup- plemented with additional methods to extract RL or tolerate a high noise-to-signal ratio.</p><p>Other approaches use language structure to in- fer RL, namely in parsing said language using a combination of statistical or rule-based methods. However, both entail that a solution be special- ized for language specific to a given domain, such as for route-following instructions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Meena et al., 2012</ref>) or for a specific instructor-manipulator pair task (Shore and Skantze, 2017): <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Meena et al. (2012)</ref> used the highly-structured nature of route- following instructions to great effect, while Shore and Skantze (2017) used a phrase-structure parser pre-trained on out-of-domain data and supple- mented it with hand-crafted rules to extract NPs according to the literary ideal of RL.</p><p>Finally, many works simply ignore the distinc- tion between RL and non-RL and focus solely on learning reference resolution as a function of lan- guage and extra-linguistic knowledge such as en- tity features (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shore and Skantze, 2017)</ref>, discourse and action history (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Iida et al., 2010)</ref>, perception (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Matuszek et al., 2012</ref>) or gesture (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Matuszek et al., 2014)</ref>. Although these methods improve the resolution of what RL refers to, they do not resolve what lan- guage is RL. Moreover, none of these works ad- dress the strong dyadic and dialogic entrainment effects on RL which include the formation of CPs, reinforcing the use of RL specific to a given dialog even if it diverges from population RL use.</p></div>

A 7 it's the same the the little crab again The data used is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shore et al. (2018)</ref>, a set of |D| = 42 task-oriented dialogs (mean du- ration µ = 15:25 minutes, standard deviation SD = 1:13, total 647:35) in which one partici- pant is an instructor referring to specific pieces on a shared game board which the other participant, the manipulator, must then attempt to resolve by selecting without the aid of extra-linguistic cues (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1-2)</ref>: They sit at different locations and communicate solely through an audio chan- nel. Upon successful selection, the piece moves to a random free place on the board and the par- ticipants alternate roles. This dataset is some- what larger than that for similar tasks (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Iida et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Matuszek et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Malinowski and Fritz, 2014;</ref>. How- ever, unlike in many other works, participants were allowed to refer to pieces in any way they wish and both were allowed to speak freely.</p><p>Each dialog d ∈ D has |R| = 20 randomly- generated game pieces and is divided into individ- ual game</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">rounds d d ′ 1 . . . d ′ n , in each of which d ′ (R, ˆ</formula><p>r, T ) a single entity is pre-selected by the game as the entityˆrentityˆ entityˆr ∈ R which must be success- fully resolved for that round. Each dialog presents the same 20 referents aside from their changing position, so participants must also refer to pieces which have already been referenced before: After 40 rounds, all pieces are guaranteed to have been referred to and so every reference thereafter is a coreference (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2)</ref>.</p><p>Each entity r ∈ R has features representing shape, size, color and position during the given round. A sequence of tokens T was transcribed from the speech of both participants using Penn Treebank tokenization rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Marcus et al., 1993)</ref>. See the Supplementary Material for further infor- mation on the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Baseline</head><p>The reference resolution method used as a base- line was a words-as-classifiers (WaC) regres- sion model (cf. . In this framework, an individual logistic regression model p t (r) σ(w T t r + b t ) is trained for each to- ken type t, predicting the probability of a given entity r being the token's TRUE referentˆrreferentˆ referentˆr, given the feature vector r representing shape, size, color and position (see the Supplementary Material for details). For example, if trained successfully, the model for the token "red" should be sensitive to the entity's hue, but not to its size. Common non- descriptive words such as "the" should not be sen- sitive to any of the entity's properties, yielding an output of 0.5 for all entities. The score of a given entity r being the referent r = ˆ r of a set of RL to- kens T is defined as the normalized linear com- bination of the tokens' corresponding classifiers p t (r):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p ′ (r = ˆ r, T ) 1 n n t∈T p t (r)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>For training, language in each round (R, ˆ r, T ) is defined as a bag of words T referring to the ref- erentˆrerentˆ erentˆr. For each token t ∈ T , a training example is defined for the referentˆrreferentˆ referentˆr (with a target score of 1) as well as for each non-referent entity r ∈ R \ ˆ r (with a target score of 0). To address model bias, the training example forˆrforˆ forˆr is weighted by its com- plement set size, |R \ ˆ r| = 19. Initial experiments showed that lemmatization did not affect the performance on our dataset. Thus, each inflected lexical form is considered a unique word (i.e., vocabulary item). Unlike , no smoothing was used, in- stead ignoring words of fewer than α 3 oc- currences. The motivation for this is that a gen- eral out-of-vocabulary model is not expected to in- crease the performance, since it basically learns to ignore entity properties, similar to the models for common words such as "the". This was also con- firmed in our initial experiments.</p><p>Note that all language from both the instructor and the manipulator in each round is used. This is unlike , who only used language from (manually annotated) REs. As ar- gued above, REs cannot easily be identified in the type of dialog data we are addressing. This of course makes the task much more challenging, and the baseline performance can be expected to be lower than that reported in .</p><p>We did 42-fold cross-validation, in each fold us- ing 40 dialogs for training as background data, one for testing and one for use as random data to compare the effects of dialog-specific data to (see Section 5 below). Each round in the test di- alog is evaluated by the reciprocal rank (RR) of the referentˆrreferentˆ referentˆr in the set of entities R ordered by their combined score for all word classifiers in the round t∈T p t (r), and its mean (MRR) is then calculated. The cross-validation results for the baseline WaC model are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. As expected, this is indeed worse than e.g. 's reported mean rank of 2.16 when only us- ing speech features. The WaC model is neverthe- less a simple and effective representation of ref- erential semantics in domains where features for each individual referent can be easily represented (cf. . Still, it has two shortcomings: Firstly, it infers a static model of referential semantics which is good across di-alogs but is suboptimal for language within di- alogs due to effects of language alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Garrod and Anderson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brennan, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brennan and Clark, 1996)</ref>. Secondly, it encodes RA only indirectly: Given a large enough dataset, logistic regression for non-RL such as okay now I'm ready should have an even distribution between TRUE and FALSE classes, i.e. these classifiers should de- cide nothing. Conversely, strong RL such as red should entail strong relationships between certain features and decisions. However, due to the ef- fects of idiosyncrasy and alignment on dialogic language, understanding low-frequency words is crucial despite that they cannot be conditioned for as well as can be done for high-frequency ones.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Dialogic Model Adaptation</head><p>We evaluated the benefits of adapting reference resolution parameters to the language of individ- ual dialogs by initially conditioning WaC mod- els on the training set as background data and then adapting the model during evaluation by re- training using data from previous states in the di- alog being evaluated: The RR for the i th round (R, ˆ r, T ) i is calculated using a model trained on both background data and interaction data de- fined as the rounds observed thus far in the given dialog (R, ˆ r, T ) i ′ &lt;i . The parameters for the lo- gistic regression models representing individual words are optimized using quasi-Newton hybrid conjugate gradient descent from Weka v3.8.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dai and Yuan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Frank et al., 2016)</ref>. A ridge λ = 100 was used to avoid over-fitting of mod- els for low-frequency words, tuned using cross- validation over the dataset (le <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cessie and van Houwelingen, 1992)</ref>. The same cross-validation method determined an optimal interaction data weight of 3 relative to background data, i.e. an ob- servation in a given dialog is three times as rele- vant as one from the background data 2 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> compares the improvement of RR from adapting model parameters using dialog interac- tion data (Adt) to the Baseline as well as effects of adding data from a randomly-chosen round from another unseen dialog (RndAdt): The condition RndAdt is used to rule out the possi- bility that model fit improves simply due to more training data in general. We fit a linear mixed model with conditions Adt, RndAdt, Wgt and scaled Tokens as linear fixed effects and game <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Interaction data weight values tested were 1, 3, 5, 7, 10. round ordinality (ROUND) as a quadratic fixed effect: Wgt denotes weighting word classifiers by RA, which will be discussed in Section 6.</p><p>Tokens denotes the number of word tokens pro- duced by both speakers in the given round <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . DYAD (the pair of participants in a given dialog) was included as a random intercept with a random slope for Adt and Wgt. We selected the best- fitting model using backwards selection with log- likelihood ratio tests: Starting from the maximally complex model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barr et al., 2013)</ref>, we first simpli- fied the random structure and then removed fixed effects not contributing to fit. This showed that including RndAdt does not significantly improve fit (χ 2 = 0.00003, p = 0.99599), meaning model fit improves from data specific to the given dialog and not merely from more training data.</p><p>We refit the final model using maximum- likelihood estimation with Satterthwaite approx- imation to degrees of freedom (see the Supple- mentary Material for details). Despite that RR correlates with ROUND i even for the baseline method due to dialogic lexical alignment (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shore and Skantze, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shore et al., 2018)</ref>, there is a significant improvement in RR from Adt (B = 0.04882, t(40) = 7.65, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Since adding a small amount of data from a dialog significantly improves reference resolution for that dialog, dialogic reference resolution can be seen as a model adaptation problem, where in- domain data (that from the dialog being evaluated) is relatively sparse compared to out-of-domain data (that from other dialogs). This suggests that the effect of dyadic alignment on reference reso- lution is amplified: As ROUND i increases, not only is more data specific to the given dialog avail- able, but the data observed becomes more homo- geneous. Thus, the benefit of this method in- creases with time, as the ratio of interaction to background data increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Weighting by Referring Ability</head><p>While the method above facilitates the adaption of referential semantics models to dyad-specific lan- guage, not all language which is rare and/or ob- served in only one dyad has great RA: For exam- ple, in the dataset used, there were 19 observations of the word awesome but 15 of those were in a sin- gle dialog. Even when evaluating on that dialog, a classifier would be inferred from the 19 − 15 &gt; α remaining observations, and even adapting the word models with interaction data as done in Sec- tion 5 will only add noise since it only occurs as non-RL (e.g. awesome good work). Conversely, a word such as piece is semantically heavy in gen- eral English but is by itself a poor signifier of ref- erents given the task at hand. So, we evaluated the benefit of weighting word classifiers by their RA in order to mitigate the effects of such spurious ob- servations. To do this, we define the RA of a word t as the mean difference between the probability of the actual referentˆrreferentˆ referentˆr being TRUE p t (ˆ r) and the mean probability for all other entities R \ ˆ r for ev- ery occurrence of the word in the training data:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w t 1 n n d∈D (R,ˆ r,T )∈d p ′′ t (R, ˆ r, T ) p ′′ t (R, ˆ r, T ) p ′ t (ˆ r, T ) − 1 m m r∈R\ˆrr∈R\ˆr p ′ t (r, T ) p ′ t (r, T ) p t (r) |T | i=1 [T i = t]<label>(2)</label></formula><p>One alternative to this metric that we considered was the area under the receiver operating charac- teristic (ROC) curve (AUC). However, the metric above is more conservative in cases of word mod- els with few observations by penalizing their score due to the logistic ridge used, thus putting more "trust" in word models with more observations; The AUC does not account for this directly.</p><p>Although this metric is derived from referen- tial semantics learned for a specific domain, the WaC logistic regression model(s) encoding refer- ential semantics are simple and thus can easily be re-trained for other domains. It can also be derived from other models of referential semantics. Figure 4 compares the improvement of RR from weighting each classifier p t (r) by its RA w t (Wgt) to the Baseline and finally to that from com- bining adaptation from Section 5 with weight- ing (Adt,Wgt); Using the same linear mixed model described in Section 5, a significant im- provement in RR was found for Wgt over the baseline (B = 0.1314, t(39) = 11.79, p &lt; 0.001) although the effect weakens over time. However, this is likely not a weakness of the method but rather an effect of repeated reference on partici- pants' RL use: With repeated reference, the length of RL reduces <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986)</ref>, meaning that the mean RA of each word increases due to fewer tokens of weak RA being uttered. In- deed, a significant interaction between Round and Tokens was found in their effects on RA (see Supplementary Material). <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows a sig- nificant correlation of ROUND i and mean RA of all tokens for that round 1 n n t∈T i w t . Addition- ally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> shows a significant inverse relation- ship with token count |T i |. Since the referentˆrreferentˆ referentˆr is chosen at random by the game, the amount of ref- erences to an entity increases with round ordinal- ity, and so this corresponds with <ref type="bibr">Clark and WilkesGibbs (1986)</ref>.</p><p>A qualitative assessment shows that vocabu- lary items with the great RA are typically nouns strongly associated with the task at hand: The 31 words with greatest RA are all nouns referring to shapes. Despite this, however, great RA is not exclusive to nouns: In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, inside, a prepo- sition, is considered semantically lighter in gen- eral English than nouns are <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Froud, 2001</ref>), but has RA greater than the mean (µ = 0.2424, SD = 0.1266). On the other hand, the noun color has relatively little RA given the task at hand. Moreover, including Adt and Wgt using dialog interaction data (Adt,Wgt) shows significant im- provements over either alone: During model se- lection, including Wgt significantly improved fit  (χ 2 = 61.425, p &lt; 0.001). This means that both methods can be used together and complement each other: Weighting is particularly beneficial for shorter interactions, where little in-domain in- teraction data is present, while adaptation pro- vides greater benefit for longer interactions (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). In fact, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> shows that Wgt has better MRR using only 12 randomly-chosen di- alogs as background data than the Baseline does with 40, and adaptation and weighting to- gether (Adt,Wgt) has better MRR with only 7. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> illustrates the effects of the two condi- tions on reference resolution in the task used for evaluation: The baseline classifier has a rank of 10 for the referentˆrreferentˆ referentˆr out of |R| = 20 possible referents. In the baseline (A), the classifier for e.g. color has as much weight as e.g. rectangle al- though the former is not a useful signifier for the given task. When weighting by RA (B), however, the less-useful words contribute less to the total t∈T (p t (ˆ r) · w t ), improving rank to 5. Finally, when adapting the model with interaction data (C), models for semantically-heavy words like violet better fit the dyad's RL use, bringing rank to 1.</p><p>When both incrementally adapting semantic models with in-domain dialog data and weight- ing by RA, MRR for reference resolution was im- proved by 32.5% over the baseline (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Discussion</head><p>We have shown that it is possible to improve ref- erence resolution for situated dialog by incremen- tally adapting word semantic model parameters to a given dialog in order to accommodate idiosyn- cratic language use by dyad partners, and the ef- fect of the partners' own alignment makes this method even more beneficial over time. Addition- ally, we have defined a metric of word referring ability which is derived from a word's referen- tial semantics in situated dialog but holds across individual dialogs despite dyadic variation in RL use. We showed that this metric can be used to automatically determine the usefulness of a given word for reference resolution, meaning that RE annotation is not necessary. Both of these aspects are beneficial to natural language understanding (NLU) for situated dialog due to the difficulty of acquiring data domain-appropriate data. Model adaption using dialogic knowledge can be effective for improving NLU (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Riccardi and Gorin, 2000</ref>) despite that little work has been done in this regard specifically for reference resolution. Our experiments with model adaptation in Sec- tion 5 suggest that it may be beneficial to treat reference resolution in situated dialog as a model adaptation task, where a given dialog being evalu-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Condition</head><p>Rank SD Rank SEM Rank Baseline 2.8060</p><p>3  ated is considered "in-domain" data and all other dialogs considered "out-of-domain" data. More- over, due to the fact that dialog participants' use of RL converges over time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Garrod and Anderson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brennan, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brennan and Clark, 1996)</ref>, the task should adapt a pre-trained reference res- olution model not only for a given dialog but also to the given state of that dialog; On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Iida et al. (2010)</ref> incorporate intra-dialogic knowl- edge but do not adapt to inter-dialogic effects.</p><p>Lastly, weighting by RA w t as derived from lo- gistic word classifier scores p t (r) in Section 6 was shown to be effective and can be easily inferred from data. However, this inaccurately assumes inter-word independence, since it does not encode a word's context: For example, the RA of not was 0.0638, which is relatively low. While it is a poor signifier in itself, it reverses the polarity of the predicate it modifies. For example, in it's the baby blue K the light one not the dark one, the NP the dark one should in fact have negative RA: Entities with a low semantic score t∈the,dark,one p t (r) should in fact be preferred over those those with a high score. This could be addressed via structural prediction (e.g. conditional random fields or neu- ral networks) or even higher-order n-grams, but these methods cannot be easily utilized given the typically small size of situated dialog datasets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Example of repeated reference across rounds; the referent the participants have to collaboratively resolve is indicated here with a magenta square.</figDesc></figure>
