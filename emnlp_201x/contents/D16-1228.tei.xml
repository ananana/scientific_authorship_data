				<p>Current methods for automatically evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC) systems rely on gold-standard references. However, these methods suffer from penalizing grammatical edits that are correct but not in the gold standard. We show that reference-less grammaticality metrics correlate very strongly with human judgments and are competitive with the leading reference-based evaluation metrics. By interpolating both methods, we achieve state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments. Finally, we show that GEC metrics are much more reliable when they are calculated at the sentence level instead of the corpus level. We have set up a CodaLab site for benchmarking GEC output using a common dataset and different evaluation metrics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Grammatical error correction (GEC) has been evalu- ated by comparing the changes made by a system to the corrections made in gold-standard annotations. Following the recent shared tasks in this field (e.g., ), several papers have critiqued GEC metrics and proposed new methods. Existing met- rics depend on gold-standard corrections and there- fore have a notable weakness: systems are penalized for making corrections that do not appear in the ref- erences. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For example, the following output has low metric scores even though three appropriate correc- tions were made to the input:</p><p>These changes (in red) were not seen in the refer- ences and therefore the metrics GLEU and M 2 (de- scribed in §2) score this output worse than 75% of 15,000 other generated sentences.</p><p>While grammaticality-based, reference-less met- rics have been effective in estimating the quality of machine translation (MT) output, the utility of such metrics has not been investigated previously for GEC. We hypothesize that such methods can over- come this weakness in reference-based GEC met- rics. This paper has four contributions: 1) We de- velop three grammaticality metrics that are com- petitive with current reference-based measures and correlate very strongly with human judgments. 2) We achieve state-of-the-art performance when in- terpolating a leading reference-based metric with a grammaticality metric. 3) We identify an interest- ing result that the mean of sentence-level scores is substantially better for evaluating systems than the system-level score. 4) We release code for two grammaticality metrics and establish an online plat- form for evaluating GEC output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Prior work</head><p>To our knowledge, this is the first work to evalu- ate GEC without references. Within MT, this task is called quality estimation. MT output is evalu- ated by its fluency, or adherence to accepted con- ventions of grammaticality and style, and adequacy, which is the input's meaning conveyed in the output. Quality estimation targets fluency by estimating the amount of post-editing needed by the output. This has been the topic of recent shared tasks, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bojar et al. (2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Specia et al. (2010)</ref> evaluated the qual- ity of translations using sentence-level features from the output but not the references, predicting discrete and continuous scores. A strong baseline, QuEst, uses support vector regression trained over 17 fea- tures extracted from the output ( . Most closely related to our work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Parton et al. (2011)</ref> applied features from Educational Testing Service's e-rater R ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Attali and Burstein, 2006</ref>) to evaluate MT output with a ranking SVM, without references, and improved performance by including features derived from MT metrics (BLEU, TERp, and METEOR).</p><p>Within the GEC field, recent shared tasks have prompted the development and scrutiny of new met- rics for evaluating GEC systems. The Helping Our Own shared tasks evaluated systems using precision, recall, and F-score against annotated gold-standard corrections ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dale et al., 2012</ref>). The subsequent CoNLL Shared Tasks on GEC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ng et al., 2013;</ref>) were scored with the MaxMatch metric (M 2 ), which captures word-and phrase-level edits by calculating the F- score over an edit lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Felice and Briscoe (2015)</ref> identified shortcomings of M 2 and proposed I-measure to address these issues. I-measure computes the accuracy of a token-level alignment between the original, generated, and gold- standard sentences. These precision-and recall- based metrics measure fluency and adequacy by pe- nalizing inappropriate changes, which alter mean- ing or introduce other errors. Changes consistent with the annotations indicate improved fluency and no change in meaning.</p><p>Unlike these metrics, GLEU scores output by pe- nalizing n-grams found in the input and output but not the reference ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Napoles et al., 2015)</ref>. Like BLEU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>), GLEU captures both fluency and adequacy with n-gram overlap. Recent work has shown that GLEU has the strongest correlation with human judgments compared to the GEC metrics de- scribed above ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sakaguchi et al., 2016)</ref>. These GEC metrics are all defined at the corpus level, mean- ing that the statistics are accumulated over the en- tire output and then used to calculate a single system score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Explicitly evaluating grammaticality</head><p>GLEU, I-measure, and M 2 are calculated based on comparison to reference corrections. These Reference-Based Metrics (RBMs) credit corrections seen in the references and penalize systems for ig- noring errors and making bad changes (changing a span of text in an ungrammatical way or introduc- ing errors to grammatical text). However, RBMs make two strong assumptions: that the annotations in the references are correct and that they are com- plete. We argue that these assumptions are invalid and point to a deficit in current evaluation practices. In GEC, the agreement between raters can be low due to the challenging nature of the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bryant and Ng, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008)</ref>, indicating that annotations may not be correct or complete.</p><p>An exhaustive list of all possible corrections would be time-consuming, if not impossible. As a result, RBMs penalize output that has a valid correc- tion that is not present in the references or that ad- dresses an error not corrected in the references. The example in §1 has low GLEU and M 2 scores, even though the output addresses two errors (GLEU=0.43 and M 2 = 0.00, in the bottom half and quartile of 15k system outputs, respectively).</p><p>To address these concerns, we propose three met- rics to evaluate the grammaticality of output without comparing to the input or a gold-standard sentence (Grammaticality-Based Metrics, or GBMs). We ex- pect GBMs to score sentences, such as our example in §1, more highly. The first two metrics are scored by counting the errors found by existing grammat- ical error detection tools. The error count score is simply calculated: 1 − # errors # tokens . Two different tools are used to count errors: e-rater R 's grammatical error detection modules (ER) and Language Tool (Miłkowski, 2010) (LT). We choose these because, while e-rater R is a large-scale, robust tool that de- tects more errors than Language Tool, 2 it is propri- etary whereas Language Tool is publicly available and open sourced.</p><p>For our third method, we estimate a grammat- icality score with a linguistic feature-based model (LFM), which is our implementation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heilman et al. (2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The LFM score is a ridge regression over a variety of linguistic features related to gram- maticality, including the number of misspellings, language model scores, OOV counts, and PCFG and link grammar features. It has been shown to effec- tively assess the grammaticality of learner writing. LFM predicts a score for each sentence while ER and LT, like the RBMs, can be calculated with ei- ther sentence-or document-level statistics. To be consistent with LFM, for all metrics in this work we score each sentence individually and report the system score as the mean of the sentence scores. We discuss the effects of modifying metrics from a corpus-level to a sentence-level in §5.</p><p>Consistent with our hypothesis, ER and LT score the §1 example in the top quartile of outputs and LFM ranks it in the top half.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">A hybrid metric</head><p>The obvious deficit of GBMs is that they do not mea- sure the adequacy of generated sentences, so they could easily be manipulated with grammatical out- put that is unrelated to the input. An ideal GEC metric would measure both the grammaticality of a generated sentence and its meaning compared to the original sentence, and would not necessarily need references. The available data of scored system out- puts are insufficient for developing a new metric due to their limited size, thus we turn to interpolation to develop a sophisticated metric that jointly captures grammaticality and adequacy.</p><p>To harness the advantage of RBMs (adequacy) and GBMs (fluency), we build combined metrics, interpolating each RBM with each GBM. For a sen- tence of system output, the interpolated score (S I ) of the GBM score (S G ) and RBM score (S R ) is com- puted as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S I = (1 − λ)S G + λS R</formula><p>All values of S G and S R are in the interval <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>, ex- cept for I-measure, which falls between [−1, 1], and the distribution varies for each metric. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The system score is the average S I of all generated sentences.</p><p>0.10±0.30, ER 0.91±0.10, LFM 0.50±0.16, LT 1.00±0.01.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>To assess the proposed metrics, we apply the RBMs, GBMs, and interpolated metrics to score the out- put of 12 systems participating in the CoNLL-2014 Shared Task on GEC ( ). Recent works have evaluated RBMs by collecting human rankings of these system outputs and comparing them to the metric rankings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Grundkiewicz et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Napoles et al., 2015)</ref>. In this section, we compare each met- ric's ranking to the human ranking of <ref type="bibr">Grundkiewicz et al. (2015, Table 3c</ref>). We use 20 references for scoring with RBMs: 2 original references, 10 ref- erences collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bryant and Ng (2015)</ref>, and 8 references collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sakaguchi et al. (2016)</ref>. The motivations for using 20 references are twofold: the best GEC evaluation method uses these 20 ref- erences with the GLEU metric ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sakaguchi et al., 2016)</ref>, and work in machine translation shows that more references are better for evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Finch et al., 2004</ref>). Due to the low agreement discussed in §3, having more references can be beneficial for evalu- ating a system when there are multiple viable ways of correcting a sentence. Unlike previous GEC eval- uations, all metrics reported here use the mean of the sentence-level scores for each system. Results are presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The error-count metrics, ER and LT, have stronger correlation than all RBMs except for GLEU, which is the current state of the art. GLEU has the strongest correlation with the human ranking (ρ = 0.852, r = 0.838), fol- lowed closely by ER, which has slightly lower Pear- son correlation (r = 0.829) but equally as strong rank correlation, which is arguably more important when comparing different systems. I-measure and LFM have similar strength correlations, and M 2 is the lowest performing metric, even though its corre- lation is still strong (ρ = 0.648, r = 0.641).</p><p>Next we compare the interpolated scores with the human ranking, testing 101 different values of λ ranked by Spearman's rank coefficient (ρ) ranked by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ER LFM LT ER LFM LT no intrpl. 0.852 (0) 0.780 (0) 0.808 (0) no intrpl. 0.829 (0) 0.742 (0) 0.811 (0) GLEU 0.852 (1)</formula><p>0.885 (0.03) 0.874 (0.27) 0.857 (0.04) 0.838 (1) 0.867 (0.27) 0.845 (0.84) 0.867 (0.09) I-m.</p><p>0.769 (1) 0.874 (0.19) 0.863 (0.37) 0.852 (0.01) 0.753 (1) 0.837 (0.02) 0.791 (0.22) 0.828 (0.01) M 2 0.648 (1) 0.868 (0.01) 0.852 (0.05) 0.808 (0.00) 0.641 (1) 0.829 (0.00) 0.754 (0.04) 0.811 (0.00) <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Oracle correlations between interpolated metrics and the human rankings.

Correlations of interpo- lated metrics are the upper bound and the correla- tions of uninterpolated metrics (in the first column and first row) are the lower bound. Interpolating GLEU and IM with GBMs has stronger correlation than any uninterpolated metric (i.e. λ = 0 or 1), and the oracle interpolation of ER and GLEU mani- fests the strongest correlation with the human rank- ing (ρ = 0.885, r = 0.867). 5 M 2 has the weakest correlation of all uninterpolated metrics and, when combined with GBMs, three of the interpolated met- rics have λ = 0, meaning the interpolated score is equivalent to the GBM and M 2 does not contribute. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref> presents an example of how interpolation can help evaluation. The top two sentences ranked by GLEU have misspellings that were not corrected in the NUCLE references. Interpolating with a GBM rightly ranks the misspelled output below the cor- rected output.</p><p>Since these experiments use a large number of references <ref type="formula">(20)</ref>, we determine how different refer- ence sizes affect the interpolated metrics by system- atically increasing the number of references from 1 to 20 and randomly choosing n references to use as a gold standard when calculating the RBM scores, repeating 10 times for each value n ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The correlation is nearly as strong with 3 and 20 refer- ences (ρ = 0.884 v. 0.885), and interpolating with just 1 reference is nearly as good (0.878) and im- proves over any uninterpolated metric.</p><p>We acknowledge that using GBMs is in effect us- ing GEC systems to score other GEC systems. In- terestingly, we find that even if the GBMs are im- perfect, they still boost performance of the RBMs. GBMs have been trained to recognize errors in dif- ferent contexts and, conversely, can identify cor- rect grammatical constructions in diverse contexts, where the RBMs only recognize corrections made that appear in the gold standards, which are limited. Therefore GBMs can make a nice complement to shortcomings that RBMs may have.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Sentence-level evaluation</head><p>In the course of our experiments, we noticed that I-measure and GLEU have stronger correlations with the expert human ranking when using the  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Correlation with human ranking when using corpus- and sentence-level metrics. * indicates a significant difference from the corresponding sentence-level correlation (p &lt; 0.05). 7 mean sentence-level score <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>). 6 Most no- tably, I-measure does not correlate at all as a corpus- level metric but has a very strong correlation at the sentence-level (specifically, ρ improves from -0.055 to 0.769). This could be because corpus-level statis- tics equally distribute counts of correct annotations over all sentences, even those where the output ne- glects to make any necessary corrections. Sentence- level statistics would not average the correct counts over all sentences in this same way. As a result, a corpus-level statistic may over-estimate the qual- ity of system output. Deeper investigation into this phenomenon is needed to understand why the mean sentence-level scores do better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Summary</head><p>We have identified a shortcoming of reference-based metrics: they penalize changes made that do not ap- pear in the references, even if those changes are ac- ceptable. To address this problem, we developed metrics to explicitly measure grammaticality with- out relying on reference corrections and showed that the error-count metrics are competitive with the best reference-based metric. Furthermore, by interpolat- ing RBMs with GBMs, the system ranking has even stronger correlation with the human ranking. The ER metric, which was derived from counts of er- rors detected using e-rater R , is nearly as good as the state-of-the-art RBM (GLEU) and the interpo- lation of these metrics has the strongest reported correlation with the human ranking (ρ = 0.885, r = 0.867). However, since e-rater R is not widely available to researchers, we also tested a metric us- ing Language Tool, which does nearly as well when interpolated with GLEU (ρ = 0.857, r = 0.867).</p><p>Two important points should be noted: First, due to the small sample size (12 system outputs), none of the rankings significantly differ from one another except for the corpus-level I-measure. Secondly, GLEU and the other RBMs already have strong to very strong correlation with the human judgments, which makes it difficult for any combination of met- rics to perform substantially higher. The best unin- terpolated and interpolated metrics use an extremely large number of references <ref type="formula">(20)</ref>, however <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows that interpolating GLEU using just one ref- erence has stronger correlation than any uninterpo- lated metric. This supports the use of interpolation to improve GEC evaluation in any setting.</p><p>This work is the first exploration into applying fluency-based metrics to GEC evaluation. We be- lieve that, for future work, fluency measures could be further improved with other methods, such as us- ing existing GEC systems to detect errors, or even using an ensemble of systems to improve coverage (indeed, ensembles have been useful in the GEC task itself ( ). There is also recent work from the MT community, such as the use of confidence bounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Graham and Liu, 2016)</ref> or un- certainty measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beck et al., 2016)</ref>, which could be adopted by the GEC community.</p><p>Finally, in the course of our experiments, we de- termined that metrics calculated on the sentence- level is more reliable for evaluating GEC output, and we suggest that the GEC community adopt this mod- ification to better assess systems.</p><p>To facilitate GEC evaluation, we have set up an online platform 8 for benchmarking system output on the same set of sentences evaluated using different metrics and made the code for calculating LT and LFM available. 9</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The mean correlation of oracle interpolated GLEU and ER scores across different reference sizes, compared to the uninterpolated metrics.
