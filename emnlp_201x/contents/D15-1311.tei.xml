				<p>Social media is a rich source of rumours and corresponding community reactions. Rumours reflect different characteristics, some shared and some individual. We formulate the problem of classifying tweet level judgements of rumours as a supervised learning task. Both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation are considered , in which tweets from a rumour are classified on the basis of other annotated rumours. We demonstrate how multi-task learning helps achieve good results on rumours from the 2011 England riots.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>There is an increasing need to interpret and act upon rumours spreading quickly through social media, especially in circumstances where their ve- racity is hard to establish. For instance, during an earthquake in Chile rumours spread through Twit- ter that a volcano had become active and that there was a tsunami warning in Valparaiso ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mendoza et al., 2010)</ref>. Other examples, from the riots in Eng- land in 2011, were that rioters were going to attack Birmingham's children hospital and that animals had escaped from the zoo ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Procter et al., 2013)</ref>. Social scientists ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Procter et al., 2013</ref>) analysed manually a sample of tweets expressing different judgements towards rumours and categorised them manually in supporting, denying or questioning. The goal here is to carry out tweet-level judge- ment classification automatically, in order to assist in (near) real-time rumour monitoring by journal- ists and authorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Procter et al., 2013</ref>). In ad- dition, information about tweet-level judgements has been used as a first step for early rumour de- tection by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Zhao et al., 2015</ref> set of other already annotated rumours. Previous work on this problem either considered unrealis- tic settings ignoring temporal ordering and rumour identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Qazvinian et al., 2011</ref>) or proposed reg- ular expressions as a solution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhao et al., 2015)</ref>. We expect posts expressing similar opinions to ex- hibit many similar characteristics across different rumours. Based on the assumption of a common underlying linguistic signal, we build a transfer learning system that labels newly emerging ru- mours for which we have little or no annotated data. Results demonstrate that Gaussian Process- based multi task learning allows for significantly improved performance.</p><p>The novel contributions of this paper are: 1. Formulating the problem of classifying judge- ments of rumours in both supervised and unsuper- vised domain adaptation settings. 2. Showing how a multi-task learning approach outperforms single- task methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>In the context of rumour spread in social media, researchers have studied differences in informa-tion flows between content of varying credibility. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Procter et al. (2013)</ref> grouped source tweets and re-tweets into information flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lotan et al., 2011</ref>), then ranked these by flow size, as a proxy of significance. Information flows were then categorised manually. Along similar vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mendoza et al. (2010)</ref> found that users deal with true and false rumours differently: the former are affirmed more than 90% of the time, whereas the latter are challenged (questioned or denied) 50% of the time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Friggeri et al. (2014)</ref> analyzed a set rumours from the Snopes.com website that have been matched to Facebook public conversations. They concluded that false rumours are more likely to receive a comment with link to Snopes.com website. However, none of the above attempted to automatically classify rumours.</p><p>With respect to automatic methods for detect- ing misinformation and disinformation in social media, Ratkiewicz et al. (2011) detect political abuse (a kind of disinformation) spread through Twitter. The task is defined in purely information diffusion settings and is not necessarily related with the truthfulness of the piece of information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Castillo et al. (2013)</ref> proposed methods for identi- fying newsworthy information cascades on Twitter and then classifying these cascades as credible and not credible. The main difference from our task is that credibility classification is carried out over the entire information cascade, classified objects are not necessarily rumours and no explicit judgement classification was performed in their approach.</p><p>Early rumour identification is the focus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhao et al. (2015)</ref>, where regular expressions are used for finding questioning and denying tweets as a key pre-requisite step for rumour detection. Un- fortunately, when we applied these regular expres- sions on our dataset, they yielded only 16% recall for questioning and 14% recall for denying tweets. Consequently, this motivated us to seek a better approach to tweet-level classification.</p><p>The work most relevant to ours is due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Qazvinian et al. (2011)</ref>. Their method first carries out rumour retrieval, whereby tweets are classified into rumour related and non-rumour re- lated. Next, rumour-related tweets are classified into supporting and not-supporting. The classi- fier is trained by ignoring rumour identities, i.e., pooling together tweets from all rumours, and ig- noring the temporal dependencies between tweets. In contrast, we formulate the rumour classifica-</p></div>

Moreover, unlike Qazvinian et al. <ref type="formula">(2011)</ref>, we con- sider the multi-class classification problem and do not collaps questioning and denying tweets into a single class, since they differ significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>We evaluate our work on several rumours circu- lating on Twitter during the England riots in 2011 (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The dataset was analysed and an- notated manually as supporting, questioning, or denying a rumour, by a team of social scientists studying the role of social media during the riots ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Procter et al., 2013</ref>). The original dataset also included commenting tweets, but these have been removed from our experiments due to their small number (they constituted only 5% of the corpus).</p><p>As can be seen from the dataset overview in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, different rumours exhibit varying pro- portions of supporting, denying and questioning tweets, which was also observed in other studies of rumours ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mendoza et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Qazvinian et al., 2011</ref>). These variations in majority classes across rumours underscores the modeling challenge in tweet-level classification of rumour attitudes.</p><p>With respect to veracity, one rumour has been confirmed as true (Miss Selfridge's being on fire), one is unsubstantiated (police beat girl), and the remaining five are known to be false. Note, how- ever, that the focus here is not on classifying truth- fulness, but instead on identifying the attitude ex- pressed in each tweet towards the rumour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Problem formulation</head><p>Let R be a set of rumours, each of which consists of tweets discussing it, ∀ r∈R T r = {t r 1 , · · · , t r rn }. T = ∪ r∈R T r is the complete set of tweets from all rumours. Each tweet is classified as supporting, denying or questioning with respect to its rumour: y(t) ∈ {0, 1, 2}, where 0 denotes supporting, 1 means denying and 2 denotes questioning.</p><p>First, we consider the Leave One Out (LOO) setting, which means that for each rumour r ∈ R, we construct the test set equal to T r and the train- ing set equal to T \ T r . Therefore this is a very challenging and realistic scenario, where the test set contains an entirely unseen rumour, from those in the training set.</p><p>The second setting is Leave Part Out (LPO). In this formulation, a very small number of ini- tial tweets from the target rumour is added to the training set {t r 1 , · · · , t r r k }. This scenario becomes applicable typically soon after a rumour breaks out and journalists have started monitoring and analysing the related tweet stream. The experi- ments section investigates how the number of ini- tial training tweets influences classification perfor- mance on a fixed test set, namely:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{t r r l , · · · , t r rn }, l &gt; k.</formula><p>The tweet-level classification problem here as- sumes that tweets from the training set are already labelled with the rumour discussed and the atti- tude expressed towards that. This information can be acquired either via manual annotation as part of expert analysis, as is the case with our dataset, or automatically, e.g. using pattern-based rumour detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhao et al., 2015)</ref>. Afterwards, our method can be used to classify the attitudes ex- pressed in each new tweet from outside the train- ing set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Gaussian Processes for Classification</head><p>Gaussian Processes are a Bayesian non-parametric machine learning framework that has been shown to work well for a range of NLP problems, of- ten beating other state-of-the-art methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cohn and Specia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lampos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beck et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015)</ref>. We use Gaussian Processes as this probabilistic kernelised framework avoids the need for expensive cross- validation for hyperparameter selection. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The central concept of Gaussian Process Classification (GPC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rasmussen and Williams, 2005)</ref>) is a latent function f over inputs x: f (x) ∼ GP(m(x), k(x, x )), where m is the mean function, assumed to be 0 and k is the kernel function, specifying the degree to which the out- puts covary as a function of the inputs. We use a linear kernel, k(x, x ) = σ 2 x x . The latent func- tion is then mapped by the probit function Φ(f ) into the range <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>, such that the resulting value can be interpreted as p(y = 1|x).</p><p>The GPC posterior is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(f * |X, y, x * ) = p(f * |X, x * , f ) p(y|f )p(f ) p(y|X) df ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p(y|f ) = n j=1 Φ(f j ) y j (1−Φ(f j )) 1−y j is the</formula><p>Bernoulli likelihood of class y. After calculating the above posterior from the training data, this is used in prediction, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p(y * = 1|X, y, x * ) = Φ (f * ) p (f * |X, y, x * ) df * .</formula><p>The above integrals are intractable and approx- imation techniques are required to solve them. There exist various methods to deal with calculat- ing the posterior; here we use Expectation Prop- agation (EP; ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Minka and Lafferty, 2002)</ref>). In EP, the posterior is approximated by a fully factorised distribution, where each component is assumed to be an unnormalised Gaussian.</p><p>In order to conduct multi-class classification, we perform a one-vs-all classification for each la- bel and then assign the one with the highest like- lihood, amongst the three (supporting, denying, questioning). We choose this method due to inter- pretability of results, similar to recent work on oc- cupational class classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Intrinsic Coregionalization Model In the LPO setting initial labelled tweets from the target ru- mour are observed as well. In this case, we pro- pose to weight the importance of tweets from the reference rumours depending on how similar their characteristics are to the tweets from the target ru- mour available for training. To handle this with GPC, we use a multiple output model based on the Intrinsic Coregionalisation Model (ICM; <ref type="bibr">( ´ Alvarez et al., 2012)</ref>). It has already been applied suc- cessfully to NLP regression problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beck et al., 2014</ref>) and it can also be applied to classification ones. ICM parametrizes the kernel by a matrix which represents the extent of covariance between pairs of tasks. The complete kernel takes form of</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">k((x, d), (x , d )) = k data (x, x )B d,d ,</formula><p>where B is a square coregionalization matrix, d and d denote the tasks of the two inputs and k data is a kernel for comparing inputs x and x (here, lin- ear). We parametrize the coregionalization matrix B = κI + vv T , where v specifies the correlation between tasks and the vector κ controls extent of task independence.</p><p>Hyperparameter selection We tune hyperpa- rameters v, κ and σ 2 by maximizing evidence of the model p(y|X), thus having no need for a vali- dation set.</p><p>Methods We consider GPs in three different set- tings, varying in what data the model is trained on and what kernel it uses. The first setting (denoted GP) considers only target rumour data for train- ing. The second (GPPooled) additionally consid- ers tweets from reference rumours (i.e. other than the target rumour). The third setting is GPICM, where an ICM kernel is used to weight influence from tweets from reference rumours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Features</head><p>We conducted a series of preprocessing steps in or- der to address data sparsity. All words were low- ercased; stopwords removed; all emoticons were replaced with words 2 ; and stemming was per- formed. In addition, multiple occurrences of a character were replaced with a double occurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal et al., 2011</ref>), to correct for misspellings and lengthenings, e.g., looool. All punctuation was also removed, except for ., ! and ?, which we hypothesize to be important for expressing emo- tion. Lastly, usernames were removed as they tend to be rumour-specific, i.e., very few users com- ment on more than one rumour.</p><p>After preprocessing the text data, we use either the resulting bag of words (BOW) feature repre- sentation or replace all words with their Brown cluster ids (Brown), using 1000 clusters acquired from a large scale Twitter corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Owoputi et al., 2013)</ref>. In all cases, simple re-tweets are removed from the training set to prevent bias ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Llewellyn et al., 2014</ref>). method acc Majority 0.68 GPPooled Brown 0.72 GPPooled BOW 0.69 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Accuracy taken across all rumours in the LOO setting. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the mean accuracy in the LOO scenario following the GPPooled method, which pools all reference rumours together ignoring their task identities. ICM can not use correlations to tar- get rumour in this case and so can not be used. The majority baseline simply assigns the most frequent class from the training set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Experiments and Discussion</head><p>We can observe that methods perform on a level similar to majority vote, outperforming it only slightly. This indicates how difficult the LOO task is, when no annotated target rumour tweets are available. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows accuracy for a range of methods as the number of tweets about the target rumour used for training increases. Most notably, perfor- mance increases from 70% to around 80%, after only 10 annotated tweets from the target rumour become available, as compared to the results on unseen rumours from <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. However, as the amount of target rumour increases, performance does not increase further, which suggests that even only 10 human-annotated tweets are enough to achieve significant performance benefits. Note also how the use of reference rumours is very im- portant, as methods using only the target rumour obtain accuracy similar to the Majority vote clas- sifier (GP Brown and GP BOW).</p><p>The top performing methods are GPCIM and GPPooled, where use of Brown clusters consis- tently improves results for both methods over BOW, irrespective of the number of tweets about the target rumour annotated for training. More- over, GPICM is better than GPPooled both with Brown and BOW features and GPCIM with Brown is ultimately the best performing of all.</p><p>In order to analyse the importance of Brown clusters, Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rasmussen and Williams, 2005</ref>) for the best performing GPICM Brown in the LPO scenario. Only the case where the first 10 tweets are used for training is considered, since it already   performs very well. Using ARD, we learn a sepa- rate length-scale for each feature, thus establishing their importance. The weights learnt for differ- ent clusters are averaged over the 7 rumours and the top 5 Brown clusters for each label are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. We can see that clusters around the words fake and bullshit turn out to be important for the denying class, and true for both supporting and questioning classes. This reinforces our hy- pothesis that common linguistic cues can be found across multiple rumours. Note how punctuation proves important as well, since clusters ? and ! are also very prominent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>This paper investigated the problem of classifying judgements expressed in tweets about rumours.</p><p>First, we considered a setting where no training data from target rumour is available (LOO). With- out access to annotated examples of the target ru- mour the learning problem becomes very difficult. We showed that in the supervised domain adapta- tion setting (LPO) even annotating a small number of tweets helps to achieve better results. More- over, we demonstrated the benefits of a multi task learning approach, as well as that Brown cluster features are more useful for the task than simple bag of words.</p><p>Judgement estimation is undoubtedly of great value e.g. for marketing, politics and journalism, helping to target widely believed topics. Although the focus here is on classifying community reac- tions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Castillo et al. (2013)</ref> showed that commu- nity reaction is correlated with actual rumour ve- racity. Consequently our classification methods may prove useful in the broader and more chal- lenging task of annotating veracity.</p><p>An interesting direction for future work would be adding non-textual features. For example, the rumour diffusion pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lukasik et al., 2015)</ref> may be a useful cue for judgement classification.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Accuracy measures for different methods versus the size of the target rumour used for training in the LPO setting.
