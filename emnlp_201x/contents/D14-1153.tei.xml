				<p>When it is not possible to compare the suspicious document to the source document(s) plagiarism has been committed from, the evidence of plagiarism has to be looked for in-trinsically in the document itself. In this paper , we introduce a novel language-independent intrinsic plagiarism detection method which is based on a new text representation that we called n-gram classes. The proposed method was evaluated on three publicly available standard corpora. The obtained results are comparable to the ones obtained by the best state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Related Works</head><p>Intrinsic plagiarism detection is an essential alternative in situations where the plagiarism source does not have a digital version, e.g. an old book, or the plagiarized text was directly written by another author without copying from any source, e.g. the case of a student who asked someone else to write for him parts of his essay or thesis. Hence, the task of detecting plagiarism intrinsically is to identify, in the given suspicious document, the fragments that are not consistent with the rest of the text in terms of writing style.</p><p>The automatic analysis of the writing style is an important component of many NLP applica- tions. For some of them, when analyzing the style, a document is considered as a whole, which is the case of the authorship identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Stamatatos, 2009a</ref>) and the authorship verifica- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Koppel and Seidman, 2013)</ref>. For other ap- plications, a document is perceived as a set of fragments, for each of them the writing style needs to be analyzed individually. Examples of such applications include: paragraph authorship clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brooke and Hirst, 2012)</ref>, authorial segmentation of multi-author documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akiva and Koppel, 2013)</ref>, detection of stylistic incon- sistencies between consecutive paragraphs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Graham et al., 2005</ref>) and plagiarism direction identification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Grozea and Popescu, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>For intrinsic plagiarism detection, it is crucial to analyze the writing style at fragments level. However, the majority of methods tend to ana- lyze the whole document writing style as well. Indeed, intrinsic plagiarism detection puts to- gether, in one research problem, many difficul- ties that are not present, or present separately, in the aforementioned related problems. Its main difficulties are listed below.</p><p>In contrast to multi-author documents related problems, the number of authors in the suspi- cious documents is unknown, i.e., it might be one author if the document is plagiarism-free or many unknown authors if it contains plagiarism.</p><p>Unlike the authorship attribution and verifica- tion, where the examined text and the potential author text are separate (and hence their writing styles could be readily characterized and com- pared), these two parts are both merged in the same document with unknown boundaries. Fur- thermore, the plagiarized fragments in a suspi- cious document might stem from different au- thors, which renders the computational characte- rization of plagiarism difficult.</p><p>As opposed to the problem of authorship clus- tering, where the task is merely to attribute al- ready defined fragments of a given document to different authors, the segmentation is a crucial and inevitable task in a real scenario of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Indeed, a granular segmen- tation may lead to an undependable style analy- sis, and a coarse segmentation may prevent the identification of the short plagiarized texts.</p><p>Due to the aforementioned difficulties, intrin- sic plagiarism detection is still a challenging problem. This is evidenced by the still low per- formance scores of the majority of methods <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . To the best of our knowledge, just two methods, namely Stamatatos (2009b) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Oberreuter et al. (2011)</ref>, reached an f-measure greater than 0.30 on a standardized corpus. Other methods, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stein et al., 2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Tschuggnall and Specht, 2013)</ref>, obtained better performance scores. Nonetheless, they have been evaluated on only selected documents from the whole standar- dized evaluation corpus which makes their re- sults not comparable to the others.</p><p>Although the writing style analysis is an old research area and has been applied successfully to solve many problems, notably authorship at- tribution, it is obvious that its application to iden- tify the plagiarized fragments still needs to be investigated further. In this paper, we address this research problem by proposing a novel way of quantifying the writing style that we called n- gram classes. We show that our method, which is supervised classification-based, is able to discri- minate between the plagiarized and the original text fragments with a performance comparable to the best state-of-the-art methods despite it uses a small number of features when building the clas- sification model.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 presents our motivation. Sections 3 and 4 present the new features and the pro- posed method. Section 5 provides the evaluation results. Finally, Section 6 draws our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Motivation</head><p>The idea of our method is inspired by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Grozea and Popescu (2010)</ref>, in the context of plagiarism direction identification. They reported that the character 8-grams of a plagiarized text fragment are more frequent in the source docu- ment (because the author is the same) than in the plagiarized document. Thus, we believe that, it is possible to distinguish the plagiarized fragments from the original ones on the basis of the fre- quency of their character n-grams in the suspi- cious document. That is, if many of the character n-grams of a fragment are infrequent in the doc- ument, it would be probably a plagiarized frag- ment. However, if many of them are frequent, then the fragment is likely to be original.</p><p>On the other hand, according to the authorship attribution researches, character n-grams are a powerful tool for characterizing the writing style <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Stamatatos, 2009a)</ref>. Moreover, they have been used in one of the best intrinsic plagiarism detec- tion methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stamatatos, 2009b)</ref>.</p><p>Generally, in n-gram based methods the text is represented by a vector of n-grams with their frequencies. The shortcoming of this text repre- sentation is the increase of its size with the in- crease of the text or the n-gram length.</p><p>Our method proposes a novel way of using character n-grams 2 for text representation. The idea is to represent the fragments of the suspi- cious document in a reduced vector where each feature value is the frequency of a class of n- grams instead of a particular n-gram. Therefore, the dimension of any fragment vector is always equal to the number of classes rather than the number of n-grams. The class of an n-gram is determined according to its frequency level in the given document as we will show in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">N-gram Classes</head><p>Formally, we define an n-gram class as a number from 0 to m−1 such that the class labeled 0 involves the least frequent n-grams and the class labeled m−1 contains the most frequent n- grams in a document. If m &gt; 2, classes between 0 and m−1 will contain n-grams with intermediate frequency levels.</p><p>Concretely, to assign the n-grams of a given document to m classes, first, the document is represented by a 2 × l matrix (l is the total num- ber of n-grams), where the first row contains the n-grams ng i (i =1..l) and the second one contains their number of occurrences freq i (raw frequen- cy).</p><p>Let max_freq denotes the maximum frequen- cy, so: max_freq = argmax freq i ; i=1..l <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> Then, the class of a n-gram ng i is computed as follows:</p><p>Class ng i = Log base (freq i ); </p><p>By computing the base of the logarithm as shown in the equation (3), the most frequent n- grams (i.e. the n-grams with the maximum num- ber of occurrences) will be in the class m−1, and the least frequent n-grams (e.g. the ones that ap- pear only once) will be in the class 0, and the n- grams with intermediate levels of frequency will be in the classes between 0 and m−1. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates an example of computing the n-gram classes of a document. The chosen number of classes m in this example is 3. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Steps for computing the n-gram classes of a document. The number of classes in this ex- ample is 3 (class labels are from 0 to 2).</p><p>Note that, what we explained above is solely how to compute the class of each n-gram of a document. However, our purpose is to represent the document fragments using these classes. To this end, for each fragment, first, its n-grams are extracted. Then, each n-gram is replaced by its class obtained from the document model built previously. Finally, the proportion of each class in the fragment is computed. So, the fragment can be represented by a vector of m values, where the first value is the proportion of the class 0, the second value is the proportion of the class 1 and so on. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates these steps. For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that the frag- ment contains only 5 n-grams. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Proposed Method</head><p>Once the suspicious document has been seg- mented to fragments and these latter have been represented by a set of features, an important phase in the process of the intrinsic plagiarism detection is to decide whether a fragment is pla- giarized or original. This phase has been imple- mented in the literature methods using different techniques, notably clustering (Akiva, 2011), supervised classification (Meyer zu <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eissen et al., 2007)</ref>, distance functions with thresholds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stamatatos, 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Oberreuter et al., 2011</ref>) and density-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stein et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>In our supervised method, the classification model is trained with a small number of features which are the proportions of the n-gram classes described in the previous section.</p><p>In detail, our method is composed of the fol- lowing steps: 1. Segment each document d into fragments s i by using the sliding window technique. Let S de- notes the set of these fragments. 2. Build the n-gram class document model (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) without considering numerals. We choose to consider the frequency of a n-gram ng i as the number of its occurrence in d such that it is counted once per fragment. Therefore, the minimum value that could take a frequency is 1 if ng i appears only in one fragment, and its maximum value is |S| (the number of fragments in d) if ng i occurs in each fragment s i ∈ S. 3. Represent each fragment s i by a vector of m features f j , j ∈ {0,…, m−1}. So that, each f j is the proportion of the n-grams that belong to the class labeled j to the total number of n-grams in s i . 4. Combine into one dataset the fragment vectors obtained from all the training corpus docu- ments. Then, label each vector with its authen- ticity state, i.e. plagiarized, if the fragment pla- giarism percentage exceeds 50% and original otherwise. 5. Build a classifier using the training set pro- duced in the previous step. For this purpose, we trained and tested several classification algo- rithms implemented on WEKA software ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hall et al., 2009</ref>). The best results were obtained with the Naïve Bayes algorithm 3 . The aforementioned steps represent the train- ing phase of our method, which aims to construct the classifier. In practice, in order to detect the plagiarism in a given document, this classifier is directly applied to the document fragments after the step 3.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Datasets</head><p>We evaluated our method on 3 corpora: PAN- PC-09 4 and PAN-PC-11 5 which are the corpora used in the international competition of plagiar- ism detection in 2009 and 2011 respectively 6 , as well as InAra corpus <ref type="bibr">7</ref> , which is a publicly availa- ble collection of artificial suspicious documents in Arabic <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Bensalem et al., 2013)</ref>. The three document collections include XML annotations indicating the plagiarized segments positions.</p><p>For the evaluation on English and Spanish documents, the classifier has been trained on PAN-PC-11 test corpus and evaluated on this same corpus using 10-fold cross validation as well as PAN-PC-09 test corpus. For the evalua- tion on Arabic documents, the classifier has been trained and tested on InAra corpus using 10-fold cross validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results</head><p>As evaluation measures we used macro- averaged precision, recall, f-measure, granularity and plagdet as they were defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Potthast et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In order to choose the parameters of our me- thod, we trained the classifier using various train- ing sets generated by using the different combi- nations of the n-gram length n (from 1 to 10) and the number of classes m (from 2 to 10). We adopted the parameters that yielded the higher f- measure, namely n = 6 and m = 4.</p><p>With regard the sliding window parameters, we used three different options for the window size, which are 100, 200 and 400 words, with a step equal to the quarter of the window size. On- ly one option is applied to a given document de- pending on its length.</p><p>We deliberately use similar sliding window parameters as the method of Oberreuter et al. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> http://www.uni- weimar.de/en/media/chairs/webis/research/corpora/corpus- pan-pc-09/ 5 http://www.uni- weimar.de/en/media/chairs/webis/research/corpora/corpus- pan-pc-11/ <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We used only the corpora parts that are dedicated to the evaluation of the intrinsic approach. 7 http://sourceforge.net/projects/inaracorpus/ (2011) 8 in order to compare the two methods without being much affected by the segmentation strategy. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> compares the results of our method to the one of Oberreuter et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have shown that representing the text fragments of a given suspicious docu- ment by the proportion of character n-gram classes (the most frequent, the least frequent and intermediate levels) is a promising way for de- tecting plagiarism intrinsically.</p><p>The experiments described in this paper were performed on three corpora comprising docu- ments in English, Spanish and for the first time Arabic. We obtained comparable results to the best performing systems.</p><p>Our method best configuration is 6 as the n- grams length and only 4 as the number of classes (i.e. 4 features). As future work, it would be in- teresting to combine the most precise classes of different n-gram lengths in order to improve the precision. It would be important as well to try other segmentation strategies and post- processing techniques in order to improve the granularity. Another interesting experiment we plan to carry out in the future is to use the n- gram classes along with the traditional stylistic features such as the vocabulary richness, average sentence length, etc.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
