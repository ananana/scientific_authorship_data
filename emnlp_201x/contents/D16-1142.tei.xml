			<abstract>
				<p>Research accomplishment is usually measured by considering all citations with equal importance , thus ignoring the wide variety of purposes an article is being cited for. Here, we posit that measuring the intensity of a reference is crucial not only to perceive better understanding of research endeavor, but also to improve the quality of citation-based applications. To this end, we collect a rich annotated dataset with references labeled by the intensity , and propose a novel graph-based semi-supervised model, GraLap to label the intensity of references. Experiments with AAN datasets show a significant improvement compared to the baselines to achieve the true labels of the references (46% better correlation). Finally , we provide four applications to demonstrate how the knowledge of reference intensity leads to design better real-world applications .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With more than one hundred thousand new schol- arly articles being published each year, there is a rapid growth in the number of citations for the rel- evant scientific articles. In this context, we high- light the following interesting facts about the pro- cess of citing scientific articles: (i) the most com- monly cited paper by Gerard Salton, titled "A Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval" (alleged to have been published in 1975) does not actually ex- ist in reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dubin, 2004</ref>), (ii) the scientific authors read only 20% of the works they cite <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Simkin and Roychowdhury, 2003)</ref>, (iii) one third of the refer- ences in a paper are redundant and 40% are perfunc- tory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975)</ref>, (iv) 62.7% of the references could not be attributed a specific function (definition, tool etc.) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Teufel et al., 2006</ref>). Despite these facts, the existing bibliographic met- rics consider that all citations are equally significant.</p><p>In this paper, we would emphasize the fact that all the references of a paper are not equally influ- ential. For instance, we believe that for our current paper, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wan and Liu, 2014</ref>) is more influential refer- ence than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Garfield, 2006</ref>), although the former has received lower citations (9) than the latter (1650) so far <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Therefore the influence of a cited paper com- pletely depends upon the context of the citing paper, not the overall citation count of the cited paper. We further took the opinion of the original authors of few selective papers and realized that around 16% of the references in a paper are highly influential, and the rest are trivial <ref type="bibr">(Section 4)</ref>. This motivates us to design a prediction model, GraLap to automati- cally label the influence of a cited paper with respect to a citing paper. Here, we label paper-reference pairs rather than references alone, because a refer- ence that is influential for one citing paper may not be influential with equal extent for another citing pa- per.</p><p>We experiment with ACL Anthology Network (AAN) dataset and show that GraLap along with the novel feature set, quite efficiently, predicts the intensity of references of papers, which achieves (Pearson) correlation of 0.90 with the human anno- tations. Finally, we present four interesting appli-cations to show the efficacy of considering unequal intensity of references, compared to the uniform in- tensity.</p><p>The contributions of the paper are four-fold: (i) we acquire a rich annotated dataset where paper- reference pairs are labeled based on the influence scores (Section 4), which is perhaps the first gold- standard for this kind of task; (ii) we propose a graph-based label propagation model GraLap for semi-supervised learning which has tremendous po- tential for any task where the training set is less in number and labels are non-uniformly distributed (Section 3); (iii) we propose a diverse set of features (Section 3.3); most of them turn out to be quite ef- fective to fit into the prediction model and yield im- proved results (Section 5); (iv) we present four ap- plications to show how incorporating the reference intensity enhances the performance of several state- of-the-art systems (Section 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Defining Intensity of References</head><p>All the references of a paper usually do not carry equal intensity/strength with respect to the citing paper because some papers have influenced the re- search more than others. To pin down this intuition, here we discretize the reference intensity by numer- ical values within the range of 1 to 5, (5: most in- fluential, 1: least influential). The appropriate def- initions of different labels of reference intensity are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, which are also the basis of building the annotated dataset (see Section 4):</p><p>Note that "reference intensity" and "reference similarity" are two different aspects. It might hap- pen that two similar reference are used with differ- ent intensity levels in a citing paper -while one is just mentioned somewhere in the paper and other is used as a baseline. Here, we address the former problem as a semi-supervised learning problem with clues taken from content of the citing and cited pa- pers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Reference Intensity Prediction Model</head><p>In this section, we formally define the problem and introduce our prediction model.</p><p>• Label-1: The reference is related to the citing ar- ticle with very limited extent and can be removed without compromising the competence of the refer- ences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Garfield, 2006</ref>) for this paper).</p><p>• Label-2: The reference is little mentioned in the citing article and can be replaced by others without compromising the adequacy of the references (e.g., ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhu et al., 2015)</ref> for this paper).</p><p>• Label-3: The reference occurs separately in a sen- tence within the citing article and has no significant impact on the current problem (e.g., references to metrics, tools) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Porter, 1997)</ref> for this paper).</p><p>• Label-4: The reference is important and highly related to the citing article. It is usually mentioned several times in the article with long reference con- text (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Singh et al., 2015)</ref> for this paper).</p><p>• Label-5: The reference is extremely important and occurs (is emphasized) multiple times within the citing article. It generally points to the cited arti- cle from where the citing article borrows main ideas (and can be treated as a baseline) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wan and Liu, 2014</ref>) for this paper). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Definition</head><p>We are given a set of papers P = {P 1 , P 2 , ..., P M } and a sets of references R = {R 1 , R 2 , ..., R M }, where R i corresponds to the set of references (or cited papers) of P i . There is a set of papers P L ∈ P whose references R L ∈ R are already labeled by ∈ L = {1, ..., 5} (each reference is labeled with exactly one value). Our objective is to de- fine a predictive function f that labels the references R U ∈ {R \ R L } of the papers P U ∈ {P \ P L } whose reference intensities are unknown, i.e., f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(P, R, P L , R L , P U , R L ) −→ L.</formula><p>Since the size of the annotated (labeled) data is much smaller than unlabeled data (|P L | |P U |), we consider it as a semi-supervised learning prob- lem. Definition 1. (Semi-supervised Learning) Given a set of entries X and a set of possible labels Y L , let us assume that (x 1 , y 1 ), (x 2 , y 2 ),..., (x l , y l ) be the set of labeled data where x i is a data point and y i ∈ Y L is its corresponding label. We as- sume that at least one instance of each class label is present in the labeled dataset. Let (x l+1 , y l+1 ), (x l+2 , y l+2 ),..., (x l+n , y l+u ) be the unlabeled data points where Y U = {y l+1 , y l+2 , ...y l+u } are un- known. Each entry x ∈ X is represented by a set of features {f 1 , f 2 , ..., f D }. The problem is to deter- mine the unknown labels using X and Y L .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">GraLap: A Prediction Model</head><p>We propose GraLap, a variant of label propagation (LP) model proposed by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhu et al., 2003</ref>) where a node in the graph propagates its associated label to its neighbors based on the proximity. We intend to assign same label to the vertices which are closely connected. However unlike the traditional LP model where the original values of the labels continue to fade as the algorithm progresses, we systematically handle this problem in GraLap. Additionally, we follow a post-processing in order to handle "class- imbalance problem". Graph Creation. The algorithm starts with the creation of a fully connected weighted graph G = (X, E) where nodes are data points and the weight w ij of each edge e ij ∈ E is determined by the radial basis function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w ij = exp − D d=1 (x d i − x d j ) 2 σ 2 (1)</formula><p>The weight is controlled by a parameter σ. Later in this section, we shall discuss how σ is selected. Each node is allowed to propagate its label to its neighbors through edges (the more the edge weight, the easy to propagate). Transition Matrix. We create a probabilistic transi- tion matrix T |X|×|X| , where each entry T ij indicates the probability of jumping from j to i based on the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T ij = P (j → i) = w ij |X| k=1 w kj .</formula><p>Label Matrix. Here, we allow a soft label (in- terpreted as a distribution of labels) to be associ- ated with each node. We then define a label matrix Y |X|×|L| , where ith row indicates the label distribu- tion for node x i . Initially, Y contains only the values of the labeled data; others are zero. Label Propagation Algorithm. This algorithm works as follows:</p><p>After initializing Y and T , the algorithm starts by disseminating the label from one node to its neigh- bors (including self-loop) in one step (Step 3). Then we normalize each entry of Y by the sum of its cor- 1: Initialize T and Y 2: while (Y does not converge) do </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Y ← T Y 4:</formula><p>Normalize rows of Y , y ij = yij k y ik</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5:</head><p>Reassign original labels to X L responding row in order to maintain the interpreta- tion of label probability (Step 4). Step 5 is crucial; here we want the labeled sources X L to be persis- tent. During the iterations, the initial labeled nodes X L may fade away with other labels. Therefore we forcefully restore their actual label by setting y il = 1 (if x i ∈ X L is originally labeled as l), and other entries (∀ j =l y ij ) by zero. We keep on "pushing" the labels from the labeled data points which in turn pushes the class boundary through high density data points and settles in low density space. In this way, our approach intelligently uses the unlabeled data in the intermediate steps of the learning. Assigning Final Labels. Once Y U is computed, one may take the most likely label from the label distri- bution for each unlabeled data. However, this ap- proach does not guarantee the label proportion ob- served in the annotated data (which in this case is not well-separated as shown in Section 4). There- fore, we adopt a label-based normalization tech- nique. Assume that the label proportions in the la- beled data are c 1 , ..., c |L| (s.t. </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y ← ˆ T Y , wherê T = T ij / k T ik . Y is composed of Y L l×|L| and Y U u×|L| ,</formula><p>where Y U never changes because of the reassignment. We can splitˆTsplitˆ splitˆT at the boundary of labeled and unlabeled data as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ˆ F = ˆ T lî T lûlû T uî T uu Therefore, Y U ← ˆ T uu Y U + ˆ T ul Y L , which can lead to Y U = lim n→∞ˆTn→∞ˆ n→∞ˆT n uu Y 0 + [ n i=1ˆT i=1ˆ i=1ˆT (i−1) uu ] ˆ T ul Y L , where Y 0 is the shape of Y at iteration 0.

Selection of σ. Assuming a spatial representation of data points, we construct a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kruskal, 1956</ref>) with distance between two nodes measured by Euclidean distance. Initially, no nodes are connected. We keep on adding edges in increasing order of distance. We choose the distance (say, d f ) of the first edge which connects two components with different la- beled points in them. We consider d f as a heuristic to the minimum distance between two classes, and arbitrarily set σ = d 0 /3, following 3σ rule of nor- mal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pukelsheim, 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Features for Learning Model</head><p>We use a wide range of features that suitably rep- resent a paper-reference pair (P i , R ij ), indicating P i refers to P j through reference R ij . These features can be grouped into six general classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Context-based Features (CF)</head><p>The "reference context" of R ij in P i is defined by three-sentence window (sentence where R ij occurs and its immediate previous and next sentences). For multiple occurrences, we calculate its average score. We refer to "reference sentence" to indicate the sen- tence where R ij appears. (i) CF:Alone. It indicates whether R ij is mentioned alone in the reference context or together with other references.</p><p>(ii) CF:First. When R ij is grouped with others, this feature indicates whether it is mentioned first (e.g., " <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>" is first in "[2,4,6]").</p><p>Next four features are based on the occurrence of words in the corresponding lists created manually (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) to understand different aspects.</p><p>(iii) CF:Relevant. It indicates whether R ij is explic- itly mentioned as relevant in the reference context <ref type="table">(Rel in Table 1</ref>). (iv) CF:Recent. It tells whether the reference con- text indicates that R ij is new (Rec in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). (v) CF:Extreme. It implies that R ij is extreme in some way (Ext in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). (vi) CF:Comp. It indicates whether the reference context makes some kind of comparison with R ij (Comp in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Note we do not consider any sentiment-based fea- tures as suggested by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Zhu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Similarity-based Features (SF)</head><p>It is natural that the high degree of semantic simi- larity between the contents of P i and P j indicates the influence of P j in P i . We assume that although the full text of P i is given, we do not have access to the full text of P j (may be due to the subscription charge or the unavailability of the older papers). Therefore, we consider only the title of P j as a proxy of its full text. Then we calculate the cosine-similarity 2 between the title (T) of P j and (i) SF:TTitle. the ti- tle, (ii) SF:TAbs. the abstract, SF:TIntro. the in- troduction, (iv) SF:TConcl. the conclusion, and (v) SF:TRest. the rest of the sections (sections other than abstract, introduction and conclusion) of P i .</p><p>We further assume that the "reference context" (RC) of P j in P i might provide an alternate way of summarizing the usage of the reference. Therefore, we take the same similarity based approach men- tioned above, but replace the title of P j with its RC and obtain five more features: (vi) SF:RCTitle, (vii) SF:RCAbs, (viii) SF:RCIntro, (ix) SF:RCConcl and (x) SF:RCRest. If a reference appears multiple times in a citing paper, we consider the aggregation of all RCs together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Frequency-based Feature (FF)</head><p>The underlying assumption of these features is that a reference which occurs more frequently in a citing paper is more influential than a single oc- currence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Singh et al., 2015)</ref>. We count the fre- quency of R ij in (i) FF:Whole. the entire content, (ii) FF:Intro. the introduction, (iii) FF:Rel. the re- lated work, (iv) FF:Rest. the rest of the sections (as Rel pivotal, comparable, innovative, relevant, relevantly, inspiring, related, relatedly, similar, similarly, applicable, appropriate, pertinent, influential, influenced, original, originally, useful, suggested, interesting, inspired, likewise recent, recently, latest, later, late, latest, up-to-date, continuing, continued, upcoming, expected, update, renewed, extended Rec subsequent, subsequently, initial, initially, sudden, current, currently, future, unexpected, previous, previously, old, ongoing, imminent, anticipated, unprecedented, proposed, startling, preliminary, ensuing, repeated, reported, new, earlier, earliest, early, existing, further, revised, improved Ext greatly, awfully, drastically, intensely, acutely, almighty, exceptionally, excessively, exceedingly, tremendously, importantly significantly, notably, outstandingly Comp easy, easier, easiest, vague, vaguer, vaguest, weak, weaker, weakest, strong, stronger, strongest, bogus, unclear <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Manually curated lists of words collected from analyzing the reference contexts.

We also intro- duce (v) FF:Sec. to measure the fraction of different sections of P i where R ij occurs (assuming that ap- pearance of R ij in different sections is more influ- ential). These features are further normalized using the number of sentences in P i in order to avoid un- necessary bias on the size of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">Position-based Features (PF)</head><p>Position of a reference in a paper might be a pre- dictive clue to measure the influence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhu et al., 2015)</ref>. Intuitively, the earlier the reference appears in the paper, the more important it seems to us. For the first two features, we divide the entire paper into two parts equally based on the sentence count and then see whether R ij appears (i) PF:Begin. in the beginning or (ii) PF:End. in the end of P i . Impor- tantly, if R ij appears multiple times in P i , we con- sider the fraction of times it occurs in each part.</p><p>For the other two features, we take the entire pa- per, consider sentences as atomic units, and measure position of the sentences where R ij appears, includ- ing (iii) PF:Mean. mean position of appearance, (iv) PF:Std. standard deviation of different appearances. These features are normalized by the total length (number of sentences) of P i . , thus ranging from 0 (indicating beginning of P i ) to 1 (indicating the end of P i ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.5">Linguistic Features (LF)</head><p>The linguistic evidences around the context of R ij sometimes provide clues to understand the intrinsic influence of P j on P i . Here we consider word level and structural features.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dong and Schfer, 2011</ref>) use seven regular expression patterns of POS tags to capture syntactic information; then seven boolean features mark the presence of these patterns. We also utilize the same regular expressions as shown below <ref type="bibr">3</ref> with the examples (the empty parenthesis in each exam- ple indicates the presence of a reference token R ij in the corresponding sentence; while few examples are complete sentences, few are not):</p><p>• ".*\\(\\) VV <ref type="bibr">[DPZN]</ref>.*": Chen () showed that cohesion is held in the vast majority of cases for English-French.</p><p>• ".*(VHP|VHZ) VV.*": while Cherry and Lin () have shown it to be a strong feature for word alignment...</p><p>• ".*VH(D|G|N|P|Z) (RB )*VBN.*": Inducing features for tag- gers by clustering has been tried by several researchers ().</p><p>• ".*MD (RB )*VB(RB )* VVN.*": For example, the likelihood of those generative procedures can be accumulated to get the like- lihood of the phrase pair ().</p><p>• "[ IW.]*VB(D|P|Z) (RB )*VV <ref type="bibr">[ND]</ref>.*": Our experimental set-up is modeled after the human evaluation presented in ().</p><p>• "(RB )*PP (RB )*V.*": We use CRF () to perform this tagging.</p><p>• ".*VVG (NP )*(CC )*(NP ).*": Following (), we provide the an- notators with only short sentences: those with source sentences between 10 and 25 tokens long.</p><p>These are all considered as Boolean features. For each feature, we take all the possible evidences from all paper-reference pairs and prepare a vector. Then for each pair, we check the presence (absence) of tokens for the corresponding feature and mark the vector accordingly (which in turn produces a set of Boolean features).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.6">Miscellaneous Features (MS)</head><p>This group provides other factors to explain why is a paper being cited. (i) MS:GCount. To answer whether a highly-cited paper has more academic in- fluence on the citing paper than the one which is less cited, we measure the number of other papers (ex- cept P i ) citing P j .</p><p>(ii) MS:SelfC. To see the effect of self-citation, we check whether at least one author is common in both P i and P j . (iii) MG:Time. The fact that older papers are rarely cited, may not stipulate that these are less influential. Therefore, we measure the difference of the publica- tion years of P i and P j . (iv) MG:CoCite. It measures the co-citation counts of P i and P j defined by |R i ∩R j | |R i ∪R j | , which in turn an- swers the significance of reference-based similarity driving the academic influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Small, 1973)</ref>.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Witten and Frank, 2005)</ref>, we further make one step normalization and divide each feature by its maximum value in all the entires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Dataset and Annotation</head><p>We use the AAN dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Radev et al., 2009)</ref> which is an assemblage of papers included in ACL related venues. The texts are preprocessed where sentences, paragraphs and sections are properly separated us- ing different markers. The filtered dataset contains 12,843 papers (on average 6.21 references per paper) and 11,092 unique authors.</p><p>Next we use Parscit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Councill et al., 2008</ref>) to identify the reference contexts from the dataset and then extract the section headings from all the pa- pers. Then each section heading is mapped into one of the following broad categories using the method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Liakata et al., 2012</ref>): Abstract, Intro- duction, Related Work, Conclusion and Rest. Dataset Labeling. The hardest challenge in this task is that there is no publicly available dataset where references are annotated with the intensity value. Therefore, we constructed our own annotated dataset in two different ways. (i) Expert Annota- tion: we requested members of our research group <ref type="bibr">4</ref> to participate in this survey. To facilitate the labeling process, we designed a portal where all the papers present in our dataset are enlisted in a drop-down menu. Upon selecting a paper, its corresponding references were shown with five possible intensity values. The citing and cited papers are also linked to the original texts so that the annotators can read the original papers. A total of 20 researchers partic- ipated and they were asked to label as many paper- reference pairs as they could based on the definitions of the intensity provided in Section 2. The annota- tion process went on for one month. Out of total 1640 pairs annotated, 1270 pairs were taken such that each pair was annotated by at least two anno- tators, and the final intensity value of the pair was considered to be the average of the scores. The Pear- son correlation and Kendell's τ among the annota- tors are 0.787 and 0.712 respectively. (ii) Author Annotation: we believe that the authors of a paper are the best experts to judge the intensity of refer- ences present in the paper. With this intension, we launched a survey where we requested the authors whose papers are present in our dataset with signif- icant numbers. We designed a web portal in similar fashion mentioned earlier; but each author was only shown her own papers in the drop-down menu. Out of 35 requests, 22 authors responded and total 196 pairs are annotated. This time we made sure that each paper-reference pair was annotated by only one author. The percentages of labels in the overall an- notated dataset are as follows: 1: 9%, 2: 74%, 3: 9%, 4: 3%, 5: 4%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Results</head><p>In this section, we start with analyzing the impor- tance of the feature sets in predicting the reference   intensity, followed by the detailed results.

In order to determine which fea- tures highly determine the gold-standard labeling, we measure the Pearson correlation between vari- ous features and the ground-truth labels. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2(a)</ref> shows the average correlation for each feature group, and in each group the rank of features based on the correlation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref>(b). Frequency- based features (FF) turn out to be the best, among which FF:Rest is mostly correlated. This set of features is convenient and can be easily computed. Both CF and LF seem to be equally important. How- ever, P F tends to be less important in this task.  Results of Predictive Models. For the purpose of evaluation, we report the average results after 10- fold cross-validation. Here we consider five base- lines to compare with GraLap: (i) Uniform: as- sign 3 to all the references assuming equal inten- sity, (ii) SVR+W: recently proposed Support Vector Regression (SVR) with the feature set mentioned in (Wan and Liu, 2014), (iii) SVR+O: SVR model with our feature set, (iv) C4.5SSL: C4.5 semi- supervised algorithm with our feature set <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Quinlan, 1993)</ref>, and (v) GLM: the traditional graph-based LP model with our feature set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhu et al., 2003</ref>). Three metrics are used to compare the results of the com- peting models with the annotated labels: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson's correlation coeffi- cient (ρ), and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the performance of the competing models. We incrementally include each feature set into GraLap greedily on the basis of ranking shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2(a)</ref>. We observe that GraLap with only FF outperforms SVR+O with 41% improvement of ρ. As expected, the inclusion of PF into the model improves the model marginally. However, the over- all performance of GraLap is significantly higher than any of the baselines (p &lt; 0.01).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Applications of Reference Intensity</head><p>In this section, we provide four different applica- tions to show the use of measuring the intensity of references. To this end, we consider all the labeled entries for training and run GraLap to predict the intensity of rest of the paper-reference pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Discovering Influential Articles</head><p>Influential papers in a particular area are often dis- covered by considering equal weights to all the ci- tations of a paper. We anticipate that considering the reference intensity would perhaps return more meaningful results. To show this, Here we use the following measures individually to compute the in- fluence of a paper: (i) RawCite: total number of citations per paper, (ii) RawPR: we construct a ci- tation network (nodes: papers, links: citations), and measure PageRank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Page et al., 1998</ref>) of each node</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">n: P R(n) = 1−q N + q m∈M (n) P R(m)</formula><p>|L(m)| ; where, q, the damping factor, is set to 0.85, N is the to- tal number of nodes, M (n) is the set of nodes that have edges to n, and L(m) is the set of nodes that m has an edge to, (iii) InfCite: the weighted version of RawCite, measured by the sum of in- tensities of all citations of a paper, (iv) InfPR: the weighted version of RawPR: P R(n)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">= 1−q N + q m∈M (n) Inf (m→n)P R(m) a∈L(m)Inf (m→a)</formula><p>, where Inf indicates the influence of a reference. We rank all the arti- cles based on these four measures separately. Ta- ble 3(a) shows the Spearman's rank correlation be- tween pair-wise measures. As expected, (i) and (ii) have high correlation (same for (iii) and (iv)), whereas across two types of measures the correla- tion is less. Further, in order to know which mea-sure is more relevant, we conduct a subjective study where we select top ten papers from each measure and invite the experts (not authors) who annotated the dataset, to make a binary decision whether a rec- ommended paper is relevant. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . The average pair- wise inter-annotator's agreement (based on Cohen's kappa <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cohen, 1960)</ref>) is 0.71. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>(b) presents that out of 10 recommendations of InfPR, 7 (5) pa- pers are marked as influential by majority (all) of the annotators, which is followed by InfCite. These results indeed show the utility of measuring refer- ence intensity for discovering influential papers. Top three papers based on InfPR from the entire dataset are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Identifying Influential Authors</head><p>H-index, a measure of impact/influence of an author, considers each citation with equal weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hirsch, 2005</ref>). Here we incorporate the notion of reference intensity into it and define hif-index.</p><p>Definition 2. An author A with a set of papers P (A)</p><p>has an hif-index equals to h, if h is the largest value such that |{p ∈ P (A)|Inf (p) ≥ h}| ≥ h; where Inf (p) is the sum of intensities of all citations of p.</p><p>We consider 37 ACL fellows as the list of gold- standard influential authors. For comparative eval- uation, we consider the total number of papers (TotP), total number of citations (TotC) and av- erage citations per paper (AvgC) as three competing measures along with h-index and hif-index. We arrange all the authors in our dataset in de- creasing order of each measure. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3(a)</ref> shows the Spearman's rank correlation among the com- mon elements across pair-wise rankings. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3(b)</ref> shows the P recision@k for five competing mea- sures at identifying ACL fellows. We observe that hif-index performs significantly well with an overall precision of 0.54, followed by AvgC (0.37), h-index (0.35), TotC (0.32) and <ref type="bibr">TotP (0.34)</ref>. This result is an encouraging evidence that the reference- intensity could improve the identification of the influential authors. Top three authors based on hif-index are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Effect on Recommendation System</head><p>Here we show the effectiveness of reference- intensity by applying it to a real paper recommen- dation system. To this end, we consider FeRoSA 7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chakraborty et al., 2016</ref>), a new (probably the first) framework of faceted recommendation for scien- tific articles, where given a query it provides facet- wise recommendations with each facet representing the purpose of recommendation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chakraborty et al., 2016)</ref>. The methodology is based on random walk with restarts (RWR) initiated from a query paper. The model is built on AAN dataset and considers both the citation links and the content information to produce the most relevant results. Instead of us- ing the unweighted citation network, here we use the weighted network with each edge labeled by the in- tensity score. The final recommendation of FeRoSA is obtained by performing RWR with the transition probability proportional to the edge-weight (we call it Inf-FeRoSA). We observe that Inf-FeRoSA achieves an average precision of 0.81 at top 10 rec- ommendations, which is 14% higher then FeRoSA while considering the flat version and 12.34% higher than FeRoSA while considering the faceted version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Detecting Citation Stacking</head><p>Recently, Thomson Reuters began screening for journals that exchange large number of anomalous citations with other journals in a cartel-like arrange- ment, often known as "citation stacking" <ref type="bibr">(Jump, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hardcastle, 2015)</ref>. This sort of citation stack- ing is much more pernicious and difficult to detect.</p></div>

Since the AAN dataset does not have journal information, we use DBLP dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Singh et al., 2015</ref>) where the complete metadata information (along with reference contexts and ab- stract) is available, except the full content of the pa- per (559,338 papers and 681 journals; more details in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chakraborty et al., 2014)</ref>). From this dataset, we extract all the features mentioned in Section 3.3 except the ones that require full text, and run our model using the existing annotated dataset as train- ing instances. We measure the traditional impact factor (IF ) of the journals and impact factor after considering the reference intensity (IF if ). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure  4</ref>(a) shows that there are few journals whose IF if significantly deviates (3σ from the mean) from IF ; out of the suspected journals 70% suffer from the ef- fect of self-journal citations as well (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure  4</ref>(b)), example including Expert Systems with Appli- cations (current IF of 2.53). One of the future work directions would be to predict such journals as early as possible after their first appearance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Although the citation count based metrics are widely accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Garfield, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hirsch, 2010)</ref>, the belief that mere counting of citations is dubious has also been a subject of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chubin and Moitra, 1975)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Garfield, 1964)</ref> was the first who explained the rea- sons of citing a paper. <ref type="bibr">(Pham and Hoffmann, 2003</ref>) introduced a method for the rapid development of complex rule bases for classifying text segments.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dong and Schfer, 2011</ref>) focused on a less man- ual approach by learning domain-insensitive fea- tures from textual, physical, and syntactic aspects To address concerns about h-index, different alterna- tive measures are proposed <ref type="bibr">(Waltman and van Eck, 2012</ref>). However they too could benefit from filtering or weighting references with a model of influence. Several research have been proposed to weight ci- tations based on factors such as the prestige of the citing journal <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ding, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yan and Ding, 2010)</ref>, prestige of an author <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balaban, 2012)</ref>, frequency of citations in citing papers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hou et al., 2011</ref>). Re- cently, (Wan and Liu, 2014) proposed a SVR based approach to measure the intensity of citations. Our methodology differs from this approach in at lease four significant ways: (i) they used six very shallow level features; whereas we consider features from different dimensions, (ii) they labeled the dataset by the help of independent annotators; here we addi- tionally ask the authors of the citing papers to iden- tify the influential references which is very realistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gilbert, 1977)</ref>; (iii) they adopted SVR for labeling, which does not perform well for small training in- stances; here we propose GraLap , designed specif- ically for small training instances; (iv) four applica- tions of reference intensity mentioned here are com- pletely new and can trigger further to reassessing the existing bibliometrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We argued that the equal weight of all references might not be a good idea not only to gauge success of a research, but also to track follow-up work or rec- ommending research papers. The annotated dataset would have tremendous potential to be utilized for other research. Moreover, GraLap can be used for any semi-supervised learning problem. Each appli- cation mentioned here needs separate attention. In future, we shall look into more linguistic evidences to improve our model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Definitions of the intensity of references.</figDesc></figure>

Part-of-speech (POS) tags of the words in the reference sentence are used as features (Jochim and Schütze, 2012). (iii) LF:Tense. The main verb of the reference sen- tence is used as a feature (Teufel et al., 2006). (iv) LF:Modal. The presence of modal verbs (e.g., "can", "may") often indicates the strength of the claims. Hence, we check the presence of the modal verbs in the reference sentence. (v) LF:MainV. We use the main-verb of the refer- ence sentence as a direct feature in the model. (vi) LF:hasBut. We check the presence of conjunc- tion "but", which is another clue to show less confi- dence on the cited paper. (vii) LF:DepRel.
