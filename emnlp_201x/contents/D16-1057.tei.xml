				<p>A word&apos;s sentiment depends on the domain in which it is used. Computational social science research thus requires sentiment lexicons that are specific to the domains being studied. We combine domain-specific word embeddings with a label propagation framework to induce accurate domain-specific sentiment lexicons using small sets of seed words, achieving state-of-the-art performance competitive with approaches that rely on hand-curated resources. Using our framework we perform two large-scale empirical studies to quantify the extent to which sentiment varies across time and between communities. We induce and release historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English and community-specific sentiment lexicons for 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit. The historical lexicons show that more than 5% of sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity during the last 150 years, and the community-specific lexicons highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different communities.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Inducing domain-specific sentiment lexicons is cru- cial to computational social science (CSS) research.</p><p>Sentiment lexicons allow us to analyze key subjec- tive properties of texts like opinions and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Taboada et al., 2011</ref>). But lexical sentiment is hugely influenced by context. The word soft has a very different sentiment in an online sports commu- nity than it does in one dedicated to toy animals ( tation; now it is essentially synonymous with good ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). Without domain-specific lexicons, social scientific analyses can be misled by sentiment as- signments biased towards domain-general contexts, neglecting factors like genre, community-specific vernacular, or demographic variation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Deng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hovy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yang and Eisenstein, 2015)</ref>. Using experts or crowdsourcing to construct domain-specific sentiment lexicons is expensive and often time-consuming ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mohammad and Turney, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fast et al., 2016)</ref>, and is especially prob- lematic when non-standard language (as in histori- cal documents or obscure social media forums) pre- vents annotators from understanding the sociolin- guistic context of the data.</p><p>Web-scale sentiment lexicons can be automat- ically induced for large socially-diffuse domains, such as the internet-at-large ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al., 2010)</ref> or all of Twitter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tang et al., 2014</ref>). However, to study sentiment in domain-specific cases-financial documents, historical texts, or tight-knit social me-dia forums-such generic lexicons may be inaccu- rate, and even introduce harmful biases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Loughran and McDonald, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Researchers need a princi- pled and accurate framework for inducing lexicons that are specific to their domain of study.</p><p>To meet these needs, we introduce SENTPROP, a framework to learn accurate sentiment lexicons from small sets of seed words and domain-specific cor- pora. SENTPROP combines the well-known method of label propagation with advances in word em- beddings, and unlike previous approaches, is de- signed to be accurate even when using modestly- sized domain-specific corpora (∼10 7 tokens). Our framework also provides confidence scores along with the learned lexicons, which allows researchers to quantify uncertainty in a principled manner.</p><p>The key contributions of this work are:</p><p>1. A simple state-of-the-art sentiment induction al- gorithm, combining high-quality word vector embeddings with a label propagation approach. 2. A novel bootstrap-sampling framework for infer- ring confidence scores with the sentiment values. 3. Two large-scale studies that reveal how sentiment depends on both social and historical context. (a) We induce community-specific sentiment lexicons for the largest 250 "subreddit" commu- nities on the social-media forum Reddit, reveal- ing substantial variation in word sentiment be- tween communities.</p><p>(b) We induce historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English, revealing that &gt;5% of words switched polarity during this time.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze the domain-dependency of sentiment at a large-scale, across hundreds of years and hundreds of user-defined online communities. All of the inferred lexicons along with code for SENTPROP and all methods evaluated are made available in the SOCIALSENT package released with this paper. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The SOCIALSENT package provides a benchmark toolkit for inducing sentiment lexicons, including implementations of previously published algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rothe et al., 2016</ref>), which are not otherwise publicly available.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Our work builds upon a wealth of previous research on inducing sentiment lexicons, along two threads:</p><p>Corpus-based approaches use seed words and patterns in unlabeled corpora to induce domain- specific lexicons. These patterns may rely on syn- tactic structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jijkoun et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rooth et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thelen and Riloff, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Widdows and Dorow, 2002</ref>), which can be domain-specific and brittle (e.g., in social media lacking usual grammatical structures). Other models rely on general co-occurrence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Igo and Riloff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Riloff and Shepherd, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Turney and Littman, 2003)</ref>. Often corpus-based meth- ods exploit distant-supervision signals (e.g., review scores, emoticons) specific to certain domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asghar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bravo-Marquez et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Choi and Cardie, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Severyn and Moschitti, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Speriosu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tang et al., 2014</ref>). An effective corpus-based ap- proach that does not require distant-supervision- which we adapt here-is to construct lexical graphs using word co-occurrences and then to perform some form of label propagation over these graphs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al., 2010)</ref>. Re- cent work has also learned transformations of word- vector representations in order to induce sentiment lexicons ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rothe et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fast et al. (2016)</ref> com- bine word vectors with crowdsourcing to produce domain-independent topic lexicons.</p><p>Dictionary-based approaches use hand-curated lexical resources-usually WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>-in order to propagate sentiment from seed Domain Positive seed words Negative seed words Standard English good, lovely, excellent, fortunate, pleasant, delightful, perfect, loved, love, happy bad, horrible, poor, unfortunate, unpleasant, disgusting, evil, hated, hate, unhappy Finance successful, excellent, profit, beneficial, im- proving, improved, success, gains, positive negligent, loss, volatile, wrong, losses, dam- ages, bad, litigation, failure, down, negative Twitter love, loved, loves, awesome, nice, amazing, best, fantastic, correct, happy hate, hated, hates, terrible, nasty, awful, worst, horrible, wrong, sad  <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tai and Kao, 2013)</ref>. There is an implicit con- sensus that dictionary-based approaches will gener- ate higher-quality lexicons, due to their use of these clean, hand-curated resources; however, they are not applicable in domains lacking such a resource (e.g., most historical texts). Most previous work seeks to enrich or enlarge ex- isting lexicons ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Qiu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">San Vicente et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al., 2010)</ref>, emphasizing recall over precision. This recall-oriented approach is mo- tivated by the need for massive polarity lexicons in tasks like web-advertising ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al., 2010)</ref>. In contrast to these previous efforts, the goal of this work is to induce high-quality lexicons that are ac- curate to a specific social context.</p><p>Algorithmically, our approach is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al. (2010)</ref>. We extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al. (2010)</ref> by incorporating high-quality word vector embeddings, a new graph construction ap- proach, an alternative label propagation algorithm, and a bootstrapping method to obtain confidence values. Together these improvements, especially the high-quality word vectors, allow our corpus- based method to even outperform the state-of-the-art dictionary-based approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Framework</head><p>Our framework, SENTPROP, is designed to meet four key desiderata: 1. Resource-light: Accurate performance without massive corpora or hand-curated resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Interpretable:</head><p>Uses small seed sets of "paradigm" words to maintain interpretabil- ity and avoid ambiguity in sentiment values. 3. Robust: Bootstrap-sampled standard deviations provide a measure of confidence.</p><p>4. Out-of-the-box: Does not rely on signals that are specific to only certain domains. SENTPROP involves two steps: constructing a lexical graph from unlabeled corpora and propagat- ing sentiment labels over this graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Constructing a lexical graph</head><p>Lexical graphs are constructed from distributional word embeddings learned on unlabeled corpora.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributional word embeddings</head><p>The first step in our approach is to build high- quality semantic representations for words using a vector space model (VSM). We embed each word w i ∈ V as a vector w i that captures information about its co-occurrence statistics with other words <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Landauer and Dumais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Turney and Pantel, 2010)</ref>. This VSM approach has a long history in NLP and has been highly successful in recent appli- cations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Levy et al., 2015</ref> for a survey).</p><p>When recreating known lexicons, we used a num- ber of publicly available embeddings (Section 4).</p><p>In the cases where we learned embeddings our- selves, we employed an SVD-based method to con- struct the word-vectors. First, we construct a matrix M P P M I ∈ R |V|×|V| with entries given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M P P M I i,j = max logˆp logˆ logˆp(w i , w j ) ˆ p(w)ˆ p(w j ) , 0 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>wherê p denotes smoothed empirical probabilities of word (co-)occurrences within fixed-size sliding win- dows of text. 3 M P P M I i,j is equal to a smoothed vari- ant of the positive pointwise mutual information be- tween words w i and w j ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Levy et al., 2015)</ref>. Next, we compute M P P M I = UΣV , the truncated sin- gular value decomposition of M P P M I . The vector  embedding for word w i is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w SVD i = (U) i .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Excluding the singular value weights, Σ, has been shown known to dramatically improve embedding quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Turney and Pantel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bullinaria and Levy, 2012)</ref>. Following standard practices, we learn embeddings of dimension 300. We found that this SVD-based method signif- icantly outperformed word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) and GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) on pre- liminary experiments with the domain-specific data we used (see Section 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining the graph edges</head><p>Given a set of word embeddings, a weighted lex- ical graph is constructed by connecting each word with its nearest k neighbors within the semantic space (according to cosine-similarity). The weights of the edges are set as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E i,j = arccos − w i w j w i w j .<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Propagating polarities from a seed set</head><p>Once a weighted lexical graph is constructed, we propagate sentiment labels over this graph using a random walk method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zhou et al., 2004</ref>). A word's polarity score for a seed set is proportional to the probability of a random walk from the seed set hit- ting that word ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>). Let p ∈ R |V| be a vector of word-sentiment scores constructed using seed set S (e.g., ten nega- tive words); p is initialized to have 1 |V| in all entries. And let E be the matrix of edge weights given by equation (3). First, we construct a symmetric tran- sition matrix from E by computing</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T = D 1 2 ED 1 2 ,</formula><p>where D is a matrix with the column sums of E on the diagonal. Next, using T we iteratively update p until numerical convergence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p (t+1) = βTp (t) + (1 − β)s,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where s is a vector with values set to 1 |S| in the en- tries corresponding to the seed set S and zeros else- where. The β term controls the extent to which the algorithm favors local consistency (similar labels for neighbors) vs. global consistency (correct labels on seed words), with lower βs emphasizing the latter.</p><p>To obtain a final polarity score for a word w i , we run the walk using both positive and negative seed sets, obtaining positive (p P (w i )) and nega- tive (p N (w i )) label scores. We then combine these values into a positive-polarity score as ¯ p P (w i ) =</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p P (w i ) p P (w i )+p N (w i )</formula><p>and standardize the final scores to have zero mean and unit variance (within a corpus).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">SENTPROP variants</head><p>Many variants of the random walk approach and re- lated label propagation techniques exist in the lit- erature <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(San Vicente et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zhou et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zhu et al., 2003</ref>). For example, there are differ- ences in how to normalize the transition matrix in the random walks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zhou et al., 2004</ref>) and variants of label propagation, e.g. where the labeled seeds are clamped to the correct values ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002</ref>) or where only shortest-paths through the graph are used for propagation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We experimented with a number of these ap- proaches and found little difference in their perfor- mance. We opted to use the random walk method because it had a slight edge in terms of performance in preliminary experiments <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and because it pro- duces well-behaved distributions over label scores, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zhu and Ghahramani (2002)</ref>'s method and its variants produce extremely peaked distributions. We do note report in detail on all the label propa- gation variants here, but the SOCIALSENT package contains a full suite of these methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Bootstrap-sampling for robustness</head><p>Propagated sentiment scores are inevitably influ- enced by the seed set, and it is important for re- searchers to know the extent to which polarity values are simply the result of corpus artifacts that are cor- related with these seeds words. We address this issue by using a bootstrap-sampling approach to obtain confidence regions over our sentiment scores. We bootstrap by running our propagation over B ran- dom equally-sized subsets of the positive and neg- ative seed sets. Computing the standard deviation of the bootstrap-sampled polarity scores provides a measure of confidence and allows the researcher to evaluate the robustness of the assigned polarities. We set B = 50 and used 7 words per random subset (full seed sets are size 10; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Recreating known lexicons</head><p>We validate our approach by recreating known sen- timent lexicons in the three domains: Standard En- glish, Twitter, and Finance. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists the seed words used in each domain.</p><p>Standard English: To facilitate comparison with previous work, we focus on the well-known General Inquirer lexicon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stone et al., 1966</ref>). We also use the continuous valence (i.e., polarity) scores collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Warriner et al. (2013)</ref> in order to evaluate the fine-grained performance of our framework. We test our framework's performance using two different embeddings: off-the-shelf Google news embeddings constructed from 10 11 tokens 5 and embeddings we constructed from the 2000s decade of the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), which con- tains ∼2 × 10 7 words in each decade, from 1850 to 2000 <ref type="bibr">(Davies, 2010)</ref>. The COHA corpus allows us to test how the algorithms deal with this smaller historical corpus, which is important since we will use the COHA corpus to infer historical sentiment lexicons (Section 6).</p><p>Finance: Previous work found that general pur- pose sentiment lexicons performed very poorly on financial text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Loughran and McDonald, 2011</ref>), so a finance-specific sentiment lexicon (containing bi- nary labels) was hand-constructed for this domain (ibid.). To test against this lexicon, we constructed embeddings using a dataset of ∼2×10 7 tokens from financial 8K documents ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Twitter: Numerous works attempt to induce Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons using supervised approaches and features unique to that domain (e.g., follower graphs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Speriosu et al., 2011</ref>). Here, we emphasize that we can induce an accurate lexicon using a simple domain-independent and resource- light approach, with the implication that lexicons can easily be induced for related social media domains without resorting to complex supervised frameworks. We evaluate our approach using the test set from the 2015 SemEval task 10E competition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rosenthal et al., 2015)</ref>, and we use the embeddings constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rothe et al. (2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Baselines and state-of-the-art comparisons</head><p>We compare SENTPROP against standard baselines and state-of-the-art approaches. The PMI base- line of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Turney and Littman (2003)</ref> computes the pointwise mutual information between the seeds and the targets without using propagation. The base- line method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al. (2010)</ref> is simi- lar to our method but uses an alternative propa- gation approach and raw co-occurrence vectors in- stead of learned embeddings. Both these methods require raw corpora, so they function as baselines in cases where we do not use off-the-shelf embed- dings. We also compare against DENSIFIER, a state- of-the-art method that learns orthogonal transforma- tions of word vectors instead of propagating labels ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rothe et al., 2016)</ref>. Lastly, on standard English we compare against a state-of-the-art WordNet-based method, which performs label propagation over a WordNet-derived graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(San Vicente et al., 2014</ref>  outperforms, are omitted for brevity (e.g., using word-vector cosines in place of PMI in Turney and Littman (2003)'s framework). Code for all these variants is available in the SOCIALSENT package.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation setup</head><p>We evaluate the approaches according to (i) their binary classification accuracy (ignoring the neutral class, as is common in previous work), (ii) ternary classification performance (positive vs. neutral vs. negative) <ref type="bibr">7</ref> , and (iii) Kendall τ rank-correlation with continuous human-annotated polarity scores. For all methods in the ternary-classification con- dition, we use the class-mass normalization method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zhu et al., 2003)</ref> to label words as positive, neutral, or negative. This method assumes knowledge of the label distribution-i.e., how many positive/negative vs. neutral words there are-and simply assigns la- bels to best match this distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation results</head><p>Tables 2a-2d summarize the performance of our framework along with baselines and other state-of-We found that the baseline method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al. (2010)</ref>, which our method is closely related to, performed relatively poorly with these domain- specific corpora. This indicates that using high- quality word-vector embeddings can have a drastic impact on performance. However, it is worth noting that <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Velikovich et al. (2010)</ref>'s method was designed for high recall with massive corpora, so its poor per- formance in our regime is not surprising.</p><p>Lastly, we found that the choice of embedding method could have a drastic impact. Prelimi- nary experiments on the COHA data showed that using word2vec SGNS vectors (with default set- tings) instead of our SVD-based embeddings led to a &gt;40% performance drop for SENTPROP across all measures and a &gt;10% performance drop for DENSIFIER. It is possible that certain settings of word2vec could perform better, but previous work has shown that SVD-based methods have superior results on smaller datasets and rare-word similarity tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Levy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016)</ref>, so this result is not surprising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Inducing community-specific lexicons</head><p>As a first large-scale study, we investigate how sen- timent depends on the social context in which a word is used. It is well known that there is sub- stantial sociolinguistic variation between different communities, whether these communities are de- fined geographically <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Trudgill, 1974)</ref> or via under- lying sociocultural differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Labov, 2006</ref>). How- ever, no previous work has systematically investi- gated community-specific variation in word senti- ment at a large scale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yang and Eisenstein (2015)</ref> exploit social network structure in Twitter to infer a small number (1-10) of communities and analyzed sentiment variation via a supervised framework. Our analysis extends this line of work by analyzing the sentiment across hundreds of user-defined commu- nities using only unlabeled corpora and a small set of "paradigm" seed words (the Twitter seed words outlined in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>In our study, we induced sentiment lexicons for the top-250 (by comment-count) subreddits from the social media forum Reddit. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We used all the 2014 comment data to induce the lexicons, with words <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Subreddits are user-created topic-specific forums. lower cased and comments from bots and deleted users removed. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Sentiment was induced for the top- 5000 non-stop words in each subreddit (again, by comment-frequency).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Examining the lexicons</head><p>Analysis of the learned lexicons reveals the ex- tent to which sentiment can differ across com- munities. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> highlights some words with opposing sentiment in two communities: in r/TwoXChromosomes (r/TwoX), a community dedicated to female perspectives and gender issues, the words crazy and insane have negative polarity, which is not true in the r/sports community, and, vice-versa, words like soft are positive in r/TwoX but negative in r/sports.</p><p>To get a sense of how much sentiment differs across communities in general, we selected a ran- dom subset of 1000 community pairs and examined the correlation in their sentiment values for highly sentiment-bearing words ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). We see that the distribution is noticeably skewed, with many com- munity pairs having highly uncorrelated sentiment values. The 1000 random pairs were selected such that each member of the pair overlapped in at least half of their top-5000 word vocabulary. We then computed the correlation between the sentiments in these community-pairs. Since sentiment is noisy and relatively uninteresting for neutral words, we com- pute τ 25% , the Kendall-τ correlation over the top- 25% most sentiment bearing words shared between the two communities.</p><p>Analysis of individual pairs reveals some inter- esting insights about sentiment and inter-community dynamics. For example, we found that the sentiment correlation between r/TwoX and r/TheRedPill (τ 25% = 0.58), two communities that hold con- flicting views and often attack each other 10 , was actually higher than the sentiment correlation be- tween r/TwoX and r/sports (τ 25% = 0.41), two communities that are entirely unrelated. This re- sult suggests that conflicting communities may have more similar sentiment in their language compared to communities that are entirely unrelated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Inducing diachronic sentiment lexicons</head><p>Sentiment also depends on the historical time-period in which a word is used. To investigate this depen- dency, we use our framework to analyze how word polarities have shifted over the last 150 years. The phenomena of amelioration (words becoming more positive) and pejoration (words becoming more neg- ative) are well-discussed in the linguistic literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Traugott and Dasher, 2001</ref>); however, no compre- hensive polarity lexicons exist for historical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cook and Stevenson, 2010)</ref>. Such lexicons are cru- cial to the growing body of work on NLP analyses of historical text <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Piotrowski, 2012</ref>) which are inform- ing diachronic linguistics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016)</ref>, the digital humanities <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Muralidharan and Hearst, 2012)</ref>, and history <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hendrickx et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our work is inspired by the only previous work on automatically inducing historical sentiment lexi- cons, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cook and Stevenson (2010)</ref>; they use the PMI method and a full modern sentiment lexicon as their seed set, which relies on the assumption that all these words have not changed in sentiment. In con- trast, in addition to our different algorithm, we use a small seed set of words that were manually selected based on having strong and stable sentiment over the last 150 years <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>; confirmed via historical en- tries in the Oxford English Dictionary).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Examining the lexicons</head><p>We constructed lexicons from COHA, since it was carefully constructed to be genre balanced (e.g., compared to the Google N-Grams; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pechenick et al., 2015)</ref>. We built lexicons for all adjectives with counts above 100 in a given decade and also for the top-5000 non-stop words within each year. In both these cases we found that &gt;5% of sentiment-bearing (positive/negative) words completely switched po- larity during this 150-year time-period and &gt;25% of all words changed their sentiment label (includ- ing switches to/from neutral). <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The prevalence of  full polarity switches highlights the importance of historical sentiment lexicons for work on diachronic linguistics and cultural change. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6a</ref> shows an example amelioration de- tected by this method: the word lean lost its neg- ative connotations associated with "weakness" and instead became positively associated with concepts like "muscularity" and "fitness". <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6b</ref> shows an example pejoration, where pathetic, which used to be more synonymous with passionate, gained stronger negative associations with the concepts of "weakness" and "inadequacy" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Simpson et al., 1989)</ref>. In both these cases, semantic similarities computed using our learned historical word vectors were used to contextualize the shifts.</p><p>Some other well-known examples of sentiment changes captured by our framework include the se- mantic bleaching of sorry, which shifted from nega- tive and serious ("he was in a sorry state") to uses as a neutral discourse marker ("sorry about that") and worldly, which used to have negative conno- tations related to materialism and religious impu- rity ("sinful worldly pursuits") but now is frequently used to indicate sophistication ("a cultured, worldly woman") ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Simpson et al., 1989)</ref>. Our hope is that the full lexicons released with this work will spur further examinations of such historical shifts in sen- timent, while also facilitating CSS applications that require sentiment ratings for historical text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>SENTPROP allows researchers to easily induce ro- bust and accurate sentiment lexicons that are rel- aged over 1850-1880 to those averaged over <ref type="bibr">1970-2000.</ref> evant to their particular domain of study. Such lexicons are crucial to CSS research, as evidenced by our two studies showing that sentiment depends strongly on both social and historical context.</p><p>Our methodological comparisons show that sim- ply combining label propagation with high-quality word vector embeddings can achieve state-of-the- art performance competitive with methods that rely on hand-curated dictionaries, and the code pack- age released with this work contains a full bench- mark toolkit for this area, including implementations of several variants of SENTPROP. We hope these tools will facilitate future quantitative studies on the domain-dependency of sentiment.</p><p>Of course, the sentiment lexicons induced by SENTPROP are not perfect, which is reflected in the uncertainty associated with our bootstrap-sampled estimates. However, we believe that these user- constructed, domain-specific lexicons, which quan- tify uncertainty, provide a more principled founda- tion for CSS research compared to domain-general sentiment lexicons that contain unknown biases. In the future our method could also be integrated with supervised domain-adaption (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yang and Eisenstein, 2015)</ref> to further improve these domain- specific results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The sentiment of soft in different online communities.

DENSIFIER also performs extremely well, outperforming SENTPROP when off-the-shelf embeddings are used (Tables 2a and 2b). However, SENTPROP significantly outperforms all other approaches when using the domain-specific embeddings (Tables 2c and 2d). Overall our results show that SENTPROP-a relatively simple method, which combines high-quality word vectors embeddings with standard label propagation-can perform at a state-of-the-art level, even performing competitively with methods relying on hand-curated lexical graphs. Unlike previous published approaches, SENTPROP is able to maintain high accuracy even when modest-sized domainspecific corpora are used. In cases where very large corpora are available and where there is an abundance of training data, DENSIFIER performs extremely well, since it was designed for this sort of setting (Rothe et al., 2016).</note>
