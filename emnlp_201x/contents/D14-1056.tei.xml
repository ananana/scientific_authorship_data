				<p>Shell nouns, such as fact and problem, occur frequently in all kinds of texts. These nouns themselves are unspecific, and can only be interpreted together with the shell content. We propose a general approach to automatically identify shell content of shell nouns. Our approach exploits lexico-syntactic knowledge derived from the linguistics literature. We evaluate the approach on a variety of shell nouns with a variety of syntactic expectations, achieving accuracies in the range of 62% (base-line = 33%) to 83% (baseline = 74%) on crowd-annotated data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Shell nouns are abstract nouns, such as fact, issue, idea, and problem, which facilitate efficiency by avoiding repetition of long stretches of text. The shell metaphor comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schmid (2000)</ref>, and it captures the various functions of these nouns in a discourse: containment, signalling, pointing, and encapsulating. Shell nouns themselves are unspe- cific, and can only be interpreted together with their shell content, i.e., the propositional content they encapsulate in the given context. The process of identifying this content in the given context is referred to as shell noun resolution or interpreta- tion. Examples (1), (2), and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> show usages of the shell nouns fact and issue. The shell noun phrases are resolved to the postnominal that clause, the complement wh clause, and the immediately pre- ceding clause, respectively. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> (1) The fact that a major label hadn't been at liberty to exploit and repackage the material on CD meant that prices on the vintage LP market were soaring.</p><p>(2) The issue that this country and Congress must address is how to provide optimal care for all without limiting access for the many.</p><p>(3) Living expenses are much lower in rural India than in New York, but this fact is not fully captured if prices are converted with currency exchange rates.</p><p>Observe that the relation between shell noun phrases and their shell content is similar to the relation of abstract anaphora (or cataphora) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asher, 1993)</ref> with backward-or forward-looking abstract-object antecedents. For anaphoric shell noun examples, the shell content precedes the shell noun phrase, and for cataphoric shell noun examples the shell content follows the shell noun phrase. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Shell nouns as a group occur frequently in argu- mentative texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Schmid, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flowerdew, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Botley, 2006</ref>). They play an important role in or- ganizing a discourse and maintaining its coher- ence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Schmid, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flowerdew, 2003)</ref>, and re- solving them is an important component of var- ious computational linguistics tasks that rely on <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Note that the postnominal that-clause in (1) is not a rela- tive clause: the fact in question is not an argument of exploit and repackage.</p><p>2 All examples in this paper are from the New York Times corpus (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ LDC2008T19) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We use the terms cataphoric shell noun and anaphoric shell noun for lack of better alternatives. discourse structure. Accordingly, identifying shell content can be helpful in summarization, informa- tion retrieval, and ESL learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Flowerdew, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hinkel, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Despite their importance in discourse, under- standing of shell nouns from a computational lin- guistics perspective is only in the preliminary stage. Recently, we proposed an approach to anno- tate and resolve anaphoric cases of six typical shell nouns: fact, reason, issue, decision, question, and possibility ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kolhatkar et al., 2013b</ref>). This work drew on the observation that shell nouns following cataphoric constructions are easy to resolve. We manually developed rules to identify shell content for such cases. Later, we used these cataphoric ex- amples and their shell content as training data to resolve harder anaphoric examples.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a general algorithm to resolve cataphoric shell noun examples. Our long- term goal is to build an end-to-end shell-noun res- olution system. If we want to go beyond the six shell nouns from our previous work, and general- ize our approach to other shell nouns, first we need to develop an approach to resolve cataphoric shell noun examples. A number of challenges are asso- ciated with this seemingly easy task. The primary challenges is that this resolution is in many cru- cial respects a semantic phenomenon. To obtain the required semantic knowledge, we exploit the properties of shell nouns and their categorization described in the linguistics literature. We evalu- ate our method using crowdsourcing, and demon- strate how far one can get with simple, determin- istic shell content extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Shell-nounhood is a well-established concept in linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vendler, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ivanic, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asher, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Francis, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schmid, 2000</ref>, inter alia). However, understanding of shell nouns from a computational linguistics perspective is only in the preliminary stage.</p><p>Shell nouns take a number of semantic argu- ments. In this respect, they are similar to the gen- eral class of argument-taking nominals as given in the NomBank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Meyers et al., 2004</ref>). Simi- larly, there is a small body of literature that ad- dresses nominal semantic role labelling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gerber et al., 2009</ref>) and nominal subcategorization frames ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Preiss et al., 2007)</ref>. That said, the distinguishing property of shell nouns is that one of their seman- tic arguments is the shell content, but the literature in computational linguistics does not provide any method that is able to identify the shell content. The focus of our work is to rectify this.</p><p>Shell content represents complex and abstract objects. So traditional linguistic and psycholin- guistic principles used in pronominal anaphora resolution (see the survey by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Poesio et al. (2011)</ref>), such as gender and number agreement, are not ap- plicable in resolving shell nouns. That said, there is a line of literature on annotating and resolving personal and demonstrative pronouns, which typi- cally refer to similar kinds of non-nominal abstract entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Passonneau, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eckert and Strube, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Byron, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Müller, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hedberg et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Poesio and Artstein, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Navarretta, 2011, inter alia)</ref>. Also, there have been attempts at annotating the shell content of anaphoric occur- rences of shell nouns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Botley (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kolhatkar et al. (2013a)</ref>). However, none of these approaches attempt to annotate and resolve cat- aphoric examples such (1) and (2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Challenges</head><p>A number of challenges are associated with the task of resolving cataphoric shell noun examples, especially when it comes to developing a holistic approach for a variety of shell nouns.</p><p>First, each shell noun has idiosyncrasies. Dif- ferent shell nouns have different semantic and syn- tactic expectations, and hence they take different types of one or more semantic arguments: one in- troducing the shell content, and others expressing circumstantial information about the shell noun. For instance, fact typically takes a single factual clause as an argument, which is its shell content, as we saw in example (1), whereas reason expects two arguments: the cause and the effect, with the content introduced in the cause, as shown in exam- ple (4). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Similarly, decision takes an agent making the decision and the shell content is represented as an action or a proposition, as shown in (5). <ref type="bibr">5</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(4) One reason [that 60 percent of New York</head><p>City public-school children read below grade level] effect is [that many elementary schools don't have libraries] cause .</p><p>(5) I applaud loudly the decision of <ref type="bibr">[Greenburgh]</ref> agent to ban animal per- formances.</p><p>Second, the relation between a shell noun and its content is in many crucial respects a seman- tic phenomenon. For instance, resolving the shell noun reason to its shell content involves identify- ing a) that reason generally expects two semantic arguments: cause and effect, b) that the cause ar- gument (and not the effect argument) represents the shell content, and c) that a particular con- stituent in the given context represents the cause argument.</p><p>Third, at the conceptual level, once we know which semantic argument represents shell content, resolving examples such as (4) seems straightfor- ward using syntactic structure, i.e., by extracting the complement clause. But at the implementa- tion level, this is a non-trivial problem for two rea- sons. The first reason is that examples contain- ing shell nouns often follow syntactically complex constructions, including embedded clauses, coor- dination, and sentential complements. An auto- matic parser is not always accurate for such ex- amples. So the challenge is whether the avail- able tools in computational linguistics such as syn- tactic parsers and discourse parsers are able to provide us with the information that is necessary to resolve these difficult cases. The second rea- son is that the shell content can occur in many different constructions, such as apposition (e.g., parental ownership of children, a concept that allows . . . ), postnominal and complement clause constructions, as we saw in examples (1) and (2), and modifier constructions (e.g., the liberal trade policy that . . . ). Moreover, in some constructions, the content is indefinite (e.g., A bad idea does not harm until someone acts upon it.) or None be- cause the example is a non-shell noun usage (e.g., this week's issue of Sports Illustrated), and the challenge is to identify such cases.</p><p>Finally, whether the postnominal clause intro- duces the shell content or not is dependent on the context of the shell noun phrase. The reso- lution can be complicated by complex syntactic constructions. For instance, when the shell noun follows verbs such as expect, it becomes difficult for an automatic system to identify whether the postnominal or the complement clause is of the verb or of the shell noun (e.g., they did not expect the decision to reignite tension in Crown Heights vs. no one expected the decision to call an elec- tion). Similarly, shell noun phrases can be ob- jects of prepositions, and whether the postnomi- nal clause introduces the shell content or not is de- pendent on this preposition. For instance, for the pattern reason that, the postnominal that clause does not generally introduce the shell content, as we saw in (4); however, this does not hold when the shell noun phrase containing reason follows the preposition for, as shown in (6).</p><p>(6) Low tax rates give people an incentive to work, for the simple reason that they get to keep more of what they earn.</p></div>

Schmid points out that being a shell noun is a property of a specific usage of the noun rather than an inher- ent property of the word. He provides a list of 670 English nouns that tend to occur as shell nouns. A few frequently occurring ones are: problem, no- tion, concept, issue, fact, belief, decision, point, idea, event, possibility, reason, trouble, question, plan, theory, aim, and principle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Lexico-syntactic patterns</head><p>Precisely defining the notion of shell-nounhood is tricky. A necessary property of shell nouns is that they are capable of taking clausal arguments, primarily with two lexico-syntactic constructions: Noun + postnominal clause and Noun + be + com- plement clause <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vendler, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Biber et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schmid, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huddleston and Pullum, 2002</ref>). Schmid exploits these lexico-syntactic construc- tions to identify shell noun usages. In particular, he provides a number of typical lexico-syntactic patterns that are indicative of either anaphoric or cataphoric shell noun occurrences. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows these patterns with examples.</p><p>Cataphoric These patterns primarily follow two constructions.</p><p>N-be-clause In this construction, the shell noun phrase occurs as the subject in a subject- verb-clause construction, with the linking verb be, and the shell content embedded as a wh clause, that clause, or to-infinitive clause.

For these patterns the link between the shell noun and the content is much less straightforward: whether the post- nominal clause expresses the shell content or not is dependent on the shell noun and the syntac- tic structure under consideration. For instance, for the shell noun fact, the shell content is em- bedded in the postnominal that clause, as shown in (1), but this does not hold for the shell noun reason in example (4). The N-of pattern is dif- ferent from other patterns: it follows the con- struction N-prepositional phrase rather than N- clause, and since a prepositional phrase can take different kinds of embedded constituents such as a noun phrase, a sentential complement, and a verb phrase, the pattern offers flexibility in the syntactic type of the shell content.</p><p>Anaphoric For these patterns, the link between the shell noun and the content is created using linguistic elements such as the, this, that, other, same, and such.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Categorization of shell nouns</head><p>Schmid classifies shell nouns at three levels. At the most abstract level, he classifies shell nouns into six semantic classes: factual, linguistic, men- tal, modal, eventive, and circumstantial. Each se- mantic class indicates the type of experience the shell noun is intended to describe. For instance, the mental class describes ideas and cognitive states, whereas the linguistic class describes utter- ances, linguistic acts, and products thereof.</p><p>The next level of classification includes more- detailed semantic features. Each broad semantic class is sub-categorized into a number of groups. A group of an abstract class tries to capture the semantic features associated with the fine- grained differences between different usages of shell nouns in that class. For instance, groups associated with the mental class are: conceptual, creditive, dubiative, volitional, and emotive.</p><p>The third level of classification consists of fam- ilies. A family groups together shell nouns with similar semantic features. Schmid provides 79 dis- tinct families of 670 shell nouns. Each family is named after the primary noun in that family. <ref type="table">Tablea</ref> member of multiple families. The nouns sub- sumed in a family share semantic features. For instance, all nouns in the Idea family are mental and conceptual. They are mental because ideas are only accessible through thoughts, and concep- tual because they represent reflection or an appli- cation of a concept. Each family activates a se- mantic frame. The idea of these semantic frames is similar to that of frames in Frame semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fillmore, 1985)</ref> and in semantics of grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Talmy, 2000</ref>). In particular, Schmid follows Talmy's con- ception of frames. A semantic frame describes conceptual structures, its elements, and their in- terrelationships. For instance, the Reason family invokes the causal frame, which has cause and ef- fect as its elements with the attentional focus on the cause. According to Schmid, the nouns in a family also share a number of lexico-syntactic fea- tures. The patterns attribute in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows pro- totypical lexico-syntactic patterns, which attract the members of the family. Schmid defines attrac- tion as the degree to which a lexico-grammatical pattern attracts a certain noun. For instance, the patterns N-to and N-that attract the shell nouns in the Plan family, whereas the N-that pattern attracts the nouns in the Thing family. The pattern N-of is restricted to a smaller group of nouns such as con- cept, problem, and issue. <ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> With this exposition, the problem of shell noun resolution is identifying the appropriate seman- tic argument of the shell noun representing its shell content. This section describes our algorithm to resolve shell nouns following cataphoric pat- terns. The algorithm addresses the primary chal- lenge of idiosyncrasies of shell nouns by exploit- ing Schmid's semantic families (see Section 4.2). The input of the algorithm is a shell noun instance following a cataphoric pattern, and the output is its shell content or None if the shell content is not present in the given sentence. The algorithm fol- lows three steps. First, we parse the given sentence using the Stanford parser. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Second, we look for the noun phrase (NP), where the head of the NP is the shell noun to be resolved. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Finally, we extract the appropriate shell content, if it is present in the given sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Identifying potentially anaphoric shell-noun constructions</head><p>Before starting the actual resolution, first we iden- tify whether the shell content occurs in the given sentence or not. According to Schmid, the lexico- syntactic patterns signal the position of the shell content. For instance, if the pattern is of the form N-be-clause, the shell content is more likely to occur in the complement clause in the same sen- tence. That said, although on the surface level, the shell noun seems to follow a cataphoric pattern, it is possible that the shell content is not given in a postnominal or a complement clause, as shown in (7). Here, the shell noun and its content are linked via the pronoun it. For such constructions, the shell noun phrase and shell content do not occur in the same sentence. Shell content occurs in the preced- ing discourse, typically in the preceding sentence.</p><p>We identify such cases, and other cases where the shell content is not likely to occur in the postnom- inal or complements clauses, by looking for the patterns below in the given order, returning the shell content when it occurs in the given sentence.</p><p>Sub-be-N This pattern corresponds to the lexico-grammatical pattern in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1(a)</ref>. If this pattern is found, there are three main possibilities for the subject. First, if an existential there occurs at the subject position, we move to the next pat- tern. Second, if the subject is it (example <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>), this or that, we return None, assuming that the con- tent is not present in the given sentence. Finally, if the first two conditions are not satisfied, i.e., if the subject is neither a pronoun not an existential there, we assume that subject contains a valid shell content, and return it. An example is shown in <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Note that in such cases, unlike other patterns, the shell content is expressed as a noun phrase.</p><p>(8) Strict liability is the biggest issue when considering what athletes put in their bod- ies.</p><p>Apposition Another case where shell content does not typically occur in the postnominal or complement clause is the case of apposition. In- definite shell noun phrases often occur in apposi- tion constructions, as shown in (9).</p><p>(9) The LH lineup, according to Gale, will feature "cab-forward" design, a concept that particularly pleases him.</p><p>In this step, we check for this construction and re- turn the sentential, verbal, or nominal left sibling of the shell noun phrase.</p><p>Modifier For shell nouns such as issue, phe- nomenon, and policy, often the shell content is given in the modifier of the shell noun, as shown in (10).</p><p>(10) But in the 18th century, Leipzig's central location in German-speaking Europe and the liberal trade policy of the Saxon court fostered publishing.</p><p>We deal with such cases as follows. First, we extract the modifier phrases by concatenating the modifier words having noun, verb, or adjective part-of-speech tags. To exclude unlikely modi- fier phrases as shell content (e.g., good idea, big , we extract a list of modifiers for a num- ber of shell nouns and create a stoplist of modi- fiers. If any of the words in the modifier phrases is a pronoun or occurs in the stoplist, we move to the next pattern. If the modifier phrase passes the stoplist test, to distinguish between non-shell con- tent and shell content modifiers, we examine the hypernym paths of the words in the modifier phrase in WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>. If the synset abstraction.n.06 occurs in the path, we consider the modifier phrase to be valid shell content, as- suming that the shell content of shell nouns most typically represents an abstract entity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Resolving remaining instances</head><p>At this stage we are assuming that the shell con- tent occurs either in the postnominal clause or the complement clause.

This is one of the more reliable patterns for shell content extraction, as the be verb suggests the semantic identity between the shell noun and the complement clause.

This is the most common (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>) and tricki- est pattern in terms of resolution, and whether the shell content is given in the postnominal clause or not is dependent on the properties of the shell noun under consideration and the syntactic construction of the example. For instance, for the shell noun decision, the postnominal to-infinitive clause typi- cally represents shell content. But this did not hold for the shell noun reason, as shown in (11).</p><p>(11) The reason to resist becoming a partici- pant is obvious.</p><p>Here, Schmid's semantic families come in the picture. We wanted to examine a) the extent to which the previous steps help in resolution, and b) whether knowledge extracted from Schmid's fam- ilies add value to the resolution. So we employ two versions of this step.</p><p>Include Schmid's cues (+SC) This version exploits the knowledge encoded in Schmid's se- mantic families (Section 4.2), and extracts post- nominal clauses only if Schmid's pattern cues are satisfied. In particular, given a shell noun, we de- termine the families in which it occurs and list all possible patterns of these families as shell content cues. The postnominal clause is a valid shell con- tent only if it satisfies these cues. For instance, the shell noun reason occurs in only one family: Reason, with the allowed shell content patterns N- that and N-why. Schmid's patterns suggest that the postnominal to-infinitive clauses are not allowed as shell content for this shell noun, and thus this step will return None. This version helps correctly resolving examples such as (11) to None.</p><p>Exclude Schmid's cues (-SC) This version does not enforce Schmid's cues in extracting the postnominal clauses. For instance, the Problem family does not include N-that/wh/to/of patterns, but in this condition, we nonetheless allow these patterns in extracting the shell content of the nouns from this family.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Evaluation data</head><p>We claim that our algorithm is able to resolve a variety of shell nouns. That said, creating eval- uation data for all of Schmid's 670 English shell 505 nouns is extremely time-consuming, and is there- fore not pursued further in the current study. In- stead we create a sample of representative evalua- tion data to examine how well the algorithm works a) on a variety of shell nouns, b) for shell nouns within a family, c) for shell nouns across families with completely different semantic and syntactic expectations, and d) for a variety of shell patterns from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Selection of nouns</head><p>Recall that each shell noun has its idiosyncrasies. So in order to evaluate whether our algorithm is able to address these idiosyncrasies, the evalua- tion data must contain a variety of shell nouns with different semantic and syntactic expectations. To examine a), we consider the six families shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. These families span three abstract cat- egories: mental, eventive, and factual, and five distinct groups: conceptual, volitional, factual, causal, and attitudinal. Also, the families have considerably different syntactic expectations. For instance, the nouns in the Idea family can have their content in that or of clauses occurring in N- clause or N-be-clause constructions, whereas the Trouble and Problem families do not allow N- clause pattern. The shell content of the nouns in the Plan family is generally represented with to- infinitive clauses. To examine b) and c), we choose three nouns from each of the first four families from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. To add diversity, we also include two shell nouns from the Thing family and a shell noun from the Reason family. So we selected a total of 12 shell nouns for evaluation: idea, issue, concept, decision, plan, policy, problem, trouble, difficulty, reason, fact, and phenomenon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Selection of instances</head><p>Recall that the shell content varies based on the shell noun and the pattern it follows. Moreover, shell nouns have pattern preferences, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. To examine d), we need shell noun exam- ples following different patterns from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We consider the New York Times corpus as our base corpus, and from this corpus extract all sentences following the lexico-grammatical patterns in <ref type="table">Ta- ble 1</ref> for the twelve selected shell nouns. Then we arbitrarily pick 100 examples for each shell noun, making sure that the selection contains examples of each cataphoric pattern from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. These examples consist of 70% examples of each of the seven cataphoric patterns, and the remaining 30% of the examples are picked randomly from the dis- tribution of patterns for that shell noun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Crowdsourcing annotation</head><p>We designed a crowdsourcing experiment to ob- tain the annotated data for evaluation. We parse each sentence using the Stanford parser, and ex- tract all possible candidates, i.e., arguments of the shell noun from the parser's output. Since our ex- amples include embedding clauses and sentential complements, the parser is often inaccurate. For instance, in example (12), the parser attaches only the first clause of the coordination (that people were misled) to the shell noun fact.</p><p>(12) The fact that people were misled and in- formation was denied, that's the reason that you'd wind up suing.</p><p>To deal with such parsing errors, we consider the 30-best parses given by the parser. From these parses, we extract a list of eligible candidates. This list includes the arguments of the shell noun given in the appositional clauses, modifier phrases, post- nominal that, wh, or to-infinitive clauses, comple- ment clauses, objects of postnominal prepositions of the shell noun, and subject if the shell noun fol- lows subject-be-N construction. On average, there were three candidates per instance.</p><p>After extracting the candidates, we present the annotators with the sentence, with the shell noun highlighted, and the extracted candidates. We ask the annotators to choose the option that provides the correct interpretation of the highlighted shell noun. We also provide them the option None of the above, and ask them to select it if the shell con- tent is not present in the given sentence or the shell content is not listed in the list of candidates.</p><p>CrowdFlower We used CrowdFlower 11 as our crowdsourcing platform, which in turn uses vari- ous worker channels such as Amazon Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr">12</ref> . CrowdFlower offers a number of features. First, it provides a quiz mode which facilitates filtering out spammers by requiring an annotator to pass a certain number of test questions before starting the real annotation. Second, during an- notation, it randomly presents test questions with known answers to the annotators to keep them on their toes. Based on annotators' responses to the test questions, each annotator is assigned a trust  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Annotator agreement on shell content. Each column shows the percentage of instances on which at least n or fewer than n annotators agree on a single answer.</p><p>score: an annotator performing well on the test questions gets a high trust score. Finally, Crowd- Flower allows the user to select the permitted de- mographic areas and skills required.</p><p>Settings We asked for at least 5 annotations per instance by annotators from the English-speaking countries. The evaluation task contained a total of 1200 instances, 100 instances per shell noun. To maintain the annotation quality, we included 105 test questions, distributed among different an- swers. We paid 2.5 cents per instance and the an- notation task was completed in less than 24 hours.</p><p>Results <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the agreement of the crowd. In most cases, at least 3 out of 5 anno- tators agreed on a single answer. We took this an- swer as the gold standard in our evaluation, and discard the instances where fewer than three anno- tators agreed. The option None of the above was annotated for about 30% of the cases. We include these cases in the evaluation. In total we had 1,257 instances (1,152 instances where at least 3 annota- tors agreed + 105 test questions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Evaluation results</head><p>Baseline We evaluate our algorithm against crowd-annotated data using a lexico-syntactic clause (LSC) baseline. Given a sentence con- taining a shell instance and its parse tree, this baseline extracts the postnominal or complement clause from the parse tree depending only upon the lexico-syntactic pattern of the shell noun. For instance, for the N-that and N-be-to patterns, it ex-describes the purpose or the goal for the reason, but not the shell content itself. On the down side, adding Schmid's cues hurts the performance of more versatile nouns, which can take a variety of clauses. Although the A-SC results for the shell nouns plan, policy, problem, trouble, difficulty, and phenomenon are well above the baseline, the A+SC results are markedly be- low it. That is, Schmid's cues were deleterious. Our error analysis revealed that these nouns are versatile in terms of the clauses they take as shell content, and Schmid's cues restrict these clauses to be selected as shell content. For instance, the shell noun problem occurs in two semantic fami- lies with N-be-that/of and N-be-to as pattern cues <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>, and postnominal clauses are not allowed for this noun. Although these cues help in filtering some unwanted cases, we observed a large number of cases where the shell content is given in post- nominal clauses, as shown in <ref type="formula">(13)</ref>.</p><p>(13) I was trying to address the problem of un- reliable testimony by experts in capital cases.</p><p>Similarly, the Plan family does not allow the N- of pattern. This cue works well for the shell noun decision from the same family because often the postnominal of clause is the agent for this shell noun and not the shell content. However, it hurts the performance of the shell noun policy, as N- of is a common pattern for this shell noun (e.g., . . . officials in Rwanda have established a policy of refusing to protect refugees. . . ). Other failures of the algorithm are due to parsing errors and lack of inclusion of context information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a general method to re- solve shell nouns following cataphoric construc- tions. This is a first step towards end-to-end shell noun resolution. In particular, this method can be used to create training data for any given shell noun, which can later be used to resolve harder anaphoric cases of that noun using the method that we proposed earlier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kolhatkar et al., 2013b</ref>). The first goal of this work was to point out the difficulties associated with the resolution of cat- aphoric cases of shell nouns. The low resolution results of the LSC baseline demonstrate the diffi- culties of resolving such cases using syntax alone, suggesting the need for incorporating more lin- guistic knowledge in the resolution.</p><p>The second goal of this work was to examine to what extent knowledge derived from the linguis- tics literature helps in resolving shell nouns. We conclude that Schmid's pattern and clausal cues are useful for resolving nouns with strict syntac- tic expectations (e.g., fact, reason); however, these cues are defeasible: they miss a number of cases in our corpus. It is possible to improve on Schmid's cues using crowdsourcing annotation and by ex- ploiting lexico-syntactic patterns associated with different shell nouns from a variety of corpora.</p><p>One limitation of our approach is that in our res- olution framework, we do not consider the prob- lem of ambiguity of nouns that might not be used as shell nouns. The occurrence of nouns with the lexical patterns in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> does not always guaran- tee shell noun usage. For instance, in our data, we observed a number of instances of the noun issue with the publication sense (e.g., this week's issue of Sports Illustrated).</p><p>Our algorithm is able to deal with only a re- stricted number of shell noun usage constructions, but the shell content can be expressed in a variety of other constructions. A robust machine learning approach that incorporates context and deeper se- mantics of the sentence, along with Schmid's cues, could mitigate this limitation.</p><p>This work opens a number of new research di- rections. Our next planned task is clustering dif- ferent shell nouns based on the kind of comple- ments they take in different usages similar to verb clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Merlo and Stevenson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Frame: general eventive Nouns: problem, trouble, difficulty, dilemma, snag Patterns: N-be-to Problem family Semantic features: [factual], [attitudinal], [impeding] Frame: general factual Nouns: problem, trouble, difficulty, point, thing, snag, dilemma , . . .
