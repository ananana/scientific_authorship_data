				<p>The availability of large scale annotated corpora for coreference is essential to the development of the field. However, creating resources at the required scale via expert annotation would be too expensive. Crowdsourc-ing has been proposed as an alternative; but this approach has not been widely used for coreference. This paper addresses one crucial hurdle on the way to make this possible, by introducing a new model of annotation for aggregating crowdsourced anaphoric annotations. The model is evaluated along three dimensions: the accuracy of the inferred mention pairs, the quality of the post-hoc constructed silver chains, and the viability of using the silver chains as an alternative to the expert-annotated chains in training a state of the art coreference system. The results suggest that our model can extract from crowdsourced annotations coreference chains of comparable quality to those obtained with expert annotation .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of identifying and resolving anaphoric reference to discourse entities, known in NLP as coreference resolution, has long been considered a core aspect of language interpretation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Poesio et al., 2016b</ref>), also because of its role in applica- tions such as summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baldwin and Morton, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Steinberger et al., 2007)</ref>, information extraction ( <ref type="bibr">Humphreys et al.)</ref> or question answer- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Morton, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zheng, 2002</ref>).</p><p>In the 1990s the field made a paradigmatic turn towards corpus based approaches initiated by cam- paigns such as MUC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Grishman and Sundheim, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chinchor, 1998)</ref> and since then we have seen the development of a range of data-driven approaches, spurred by the development of ever larger and richer datasets. Nowadays, a vari- ety of datasets exist for several languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Poesio et al., 2016a</ref>). These include medium-scale mul- tilingual datasets such as ONTONOTES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pradhan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weischedel et al., 2011)</ref>, which led to the most recent evaluation campaigns, in par- ticular CONLL 2012 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pradhan et al., 2012)</ref>, and are used in most current research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Björkelund and Kuhn, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Martschat and Strube, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Clark and Manning, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al., 2017)</ref>. However, there are still many languages and domains for which no such resources are available, and even for English much larger corpora than ONTONOTES will eventually be required.</p><p>However, annotating data on the scale required to train state of the art systems using traditional expert annotation would be unaffordable. One alternative is to employ crowdsourcing, either via platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Crowdflower, or using Games-With-A-Purpose ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Poesio et al., 2017)</ref>. Studies such as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Snow et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Raykar et al., 2010)</ref> have shown that when a sufficiently large number of workers is em- ployed, expert-level quality can be achieved, at a fraction of the cost required to create such re- sources using traditional methods. The one ef- fort to create a large-scale coreference corpus en- tirely through crowdsourcing, the Phrase Detec- tives project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Poesio et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chamberlain, 2016)</ref>, employs the Phrase Detectives game with a purpose. The Phrase Detectives corpus consists of 843 docu- ments for a total of 1.2 million tokens and 392,741 markables; at present, 563 documents for a total of 360,000 tokens have been annotated. 1 A sec- ond coreference corpus created using crowdsourc- ing (in the context of a trivia game) also exists, the Quiz Bowl dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guha et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> However, such existing corpora are not widely used yet. One of the reasons for this is the lack of suitable aggregation methods for anaphora. Crowdsourced annotations require aggregation methods to select among the different interpreta- tions produced by the crowd. Standard practice for crowdsourced data analysis has seen a shift in recent years from simple majority vote to much more effective aggregation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Smyth et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Quoc Viet Hung et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sheshadri and Lease, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carpenter, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Passonneau and Carpenter, 2014</ref>). Probabilistic models of annotation, in particular, make it possi- ble to characterize the accuracy of the annotators and correct for their bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dawid and Skene, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Passonneau and Carpenter, 2014)</ref>, to account for item-level effects (e.g.: difficulty) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Whitehill et al., 2009)</ref>, and to employ different pooling strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carpenter, 2008)</ref>. However, existing models of annotation cannot be used for anaphora. Such methods assume that coders choose between a fixed set of general labels, the same labels across all annotated items. In anaphoric annotation, by contrast, coders relate markables to coreference chains which depend on the markables that are an- notated in that given document <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Passonneau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref> Contributions In this paper we propose a men- tion pair-based approach to aggregating crowd- sourced anaphoric annotations. Concretely, we in- troduce a new model of annotation capable of in- ferring the most likely mention pairs from crowd- annotated anaphoric relations. We then use these pairs to build the most likely coreference chains. This approach to building chains is evaluated on both crowdsourced and synthetic (via simulation) coreference datasets. The evaluations include as- sessing the accuracy of the inferred mention pairs; the quality of the chains; and the viability of us- ing these chains derived from mention pairs as an alternative to gold chains when training a state of the art coreference system. We conclude by also demonstrating the quality of the proposed model <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Another corpus creation project using crowdsourcing (and also games) for anaphoric annotation is the Groningen Meaning Bank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bos et al., 2017)</ref>. However, in the GMB crowdsourcing is not used to generate interpretations: play- ers correct automatically annotated interpretations rather than providing the annotations themselves. Another crucial differ- ence is that interpretations are not aggregated in the sense discussed below; rather, an expert adjudicates between the interpretations produced by players. in a standard annotation task. The implementation is available as supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A Mention-Pair Model of Annotation</head><p>Traditional models of annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dawid and Skene, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Smyth et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Raykar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al., 2013</ref>) are specified assuming the annotations are chosen among a general set of classes that is consistent across the annotated items. This is the case in a type of annotation closely related to anaphoric annotation, informa- tion status annotation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nissim et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Riester et al., 2010)</ref>. In this type of annotation, an annota- tor marks a mention as either discourse old (DO) - referring to an existing entity (coreference chain) -or as discourse-new (DN) -introducing a new coreference chain, but without specifying which coreference chain the mention belongs to, if any. We will refer below to categories such as DN and DO as (general) classes.</p><p>Traditional models of annotation can model this type of annotation, but not the task of anaphoric annotation proper. In standard annotation schemes for anaphora/coreference ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Poesio et al., 2016a</ref>) the annotator may mark a mention as referring to a discourse new entity as above; but in case the mention is identified as discourse-old, this en- tity, or coreference chain-the set of coreferring mentions-is also specified. The available corefer- ence chains differ from document to document.</p><p>Our proposal for a probabilistic model of this type of annotation is based on one of the most widely used models of coreference resolution: the mention pair model. In the mention pair model, the task of linking the mention to a coreference chain/entity is split in two parts: classifying men- tion pairs as coreferring or not, and subsequent clustering ( <ref type="bibr">Soon et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hoste, 2016)</ref>. The model we propose addresses the first part.</p><p>More formally, the crowdsourced data to be modeled consists of I mentions (indexed by i) annotated by a total of J coders (indexed by j). Each mention i has N i annotations (indexed by n), for a total of M i distinct labels (indexed by m). Each label m of mention i belongs to a class z i,m . The label of a mention could be the ID of the antecedent, in case that mention is anno- tated as belonging to the discourse old (general) class; or could be discourse new or another general class (e.g.: property, non referring). In these lat- ter cases, the labels coincide with the classes they belong to.</p><p>An important difficulty we had to address is la- bel sparsity. The solution we propose is to trans- form the mention-level annotations into a series of binary decisions with respect to each candidate la- bel. In the extended literature this is often referred to as the binary relevance method <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madjarov et al., 2012</ref>). We then model these (label-level) decisions as the result of the sensitivity (the true positive rate) and speci- ficity (the true negative rate) of the annotators which we assume are class dependent. This latter assumption allows inferring different levels of an- notator ability for each class (e.g.: capturing that DO labels are generally harder compared to DN).</p><p>The graphical model of our Mention Pair An- notations model (MPA) is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, while the generative process is given below:</p><p>• For every class h ∈ {1, 2, ..., K}:</p><p>-Draw class specific true label likelihood</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">π h ∼ Beta(a, b)</formula><p>• For every annotator j ∈ {1, 2, ..., J}:</p><p>-For every class h ∈ {1, 2, ..., K}:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">* Draw sensitivity α j,h ∼ Beta(d, e) * Draw specificity β j,h ∼ Beta(t, u)</formula><p>• For every mention i ∈ {1, 2, ..., I}:</p><p>-For every candidate label m ∈ {1, 2, ..., M i }:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">* Draw true label indicator c i,m ∼ Bern(π z i,m ) * For every position n ∈ {1, 2, ..., N i }: · If c i,m = 1 then draw decision y i,m,n ∼ Bern(α jj[i,m,n],z i,m ) 3 · Otherwise, draw decision y i,m,n ∼ Bern(1 − β jj[i,m,n],z i,m )</formula><p>The model addresses the first part of the men- tion pair framework: the posterior of the true label indicators is used to link each mention with the most likely label, obtaining the mention pairs. The coreference chains are then built by following the link structure from the inferred pairs.</p><p>Note that for a traditional annotation task with no distinction between generic classes and spe- cific labels the MPA model is equivalent to train- ing K binary Bayesian versions of the Dawid  and Skene (1979) model (one for each general class) on data processed using the binary relevance method. Note also that whereas traditional models of annotation assume one true class per annotated item, an implicit benefit of our approach is allow- ing for potentially multiple true classes, which can be useful to detect ambiguity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Poesio and Artstein, 2005</ref>), but we don't exploit that in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Parameter Estimation</head><p>We infer the parameters of the proposed model using Variational Inference (VI). Unlike Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches (e.g.: Gibbs Sampling, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo), VI is deterministic, fast, and benefits from a clear con- vergence criterion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blei et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically we approximate the intractable pos- terior p(θ|D) with a variational distribution q(θ) such that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the two distributions is minimized. It can be shown this minimization is equivalent to maxi- mizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L = E q [log p(π, α, β, c, y|a, b, d, e, t, u, z)] − E q [log q(π, α, β, c|λ, η, γ, µ, θ, , φ, ζ)]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We need a variational distribution q that is tractable under expectations. Following common practice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blei et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoffman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blei et al., 2017)</ref>, we choose q to be in the mean field variational family where each hidden variable is independent and governed by its own parameter. Elegant solutions have been derived for models whose complete conditionals are in the exponen- tial family ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blei and Jordan, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoffman et al., 2013</ref>). Concretely, we used the fact that the nat- ural parameters of the variational distributions are equal to the expected value of the natural parame- ters of the corresponding complete conditionals. The derivations are standard in the VI literature (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoffman et al., 2013)</ref>. (To save space, we only provide here the update formulas of the variational parameters; supplementary details are in the Appendix.)</p><p>Equations <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> give the variational update formulas for the class-level true label likelihood. We have q(π h |λ h , η h ) = Beta(λ h , η h ), where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">λ h = a + I,M i i,m I(z i,m = h)E q [I(c i,m = 1)] (2) η h = b + I,M i i,m I(z i,m = h)E q [I(c i,m = 0)] (3)</formula><p>In Equation <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref> we list the varia- tional update formulas for the class-level anno- tator sensitivity.

We have q(c i,m |φ i,m ) = Bern(φ i,m ), where ζ i,m = 1 − φ i,m and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">log φ i,m ∝ E q [log π z i,m ]+ + N i n=1 I(y i,m,n = 1)E q [log α jj[i,m,n],z i,m ]+ + I(y i,m,n = 0)E q [log(1 − α jj[i,m,n],z i,m )] (8) log ζ i,m ∝ E q [log(1 − π z i,m )]+ + N i n=1 I(y i,m,n = 0)E q [log β jj[i,m,n],z i,m ]+ + I(y i,m,n = 1)E q [log(1 − β jj[i,m,n],z i,m )]<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Finally, for the above formulas, we used the fact that E q [I(c i,m = 1)] = φ i,m . The other expectations can be easily calculated noting that for a distribution part of the exponential family, the first derivative of the log normalizer is equal to the expected value of the sufficient statistics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blei et al., 2003)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_8">. For example, E q [log π z i,m ] = Ψ(λ z i,m ) − Ψ(λ z i,m + η z i,m )</formula><p>, where Ψ(.) is the digamma function. Similar observations apply to the α and β related expectations.</p><p>The algorithm, known as Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blei et al., 2017)</ref>, involves iterating between Equations <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(4)</ref>, (5), (6), <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(8)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(9)</ref> until convergence. The ELBO expressed in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(1)</ref> is guaranteed to increase at every step. Convergence is achieved when the ELBO plateaus. Throughout the experi- ments we used non-informative, uniform priors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>We carried out a series of evaluations of increasing complexity of our MPA model. We first assess the accuracy of the inferred mention pairs. Second, we cluster the pairs into appropriate coreference chains and evaluate the quality of these chains. Third, we assess the viability of using silver chains as an alternative to the gold chains when training a state of the art coreference system. Finally, we conclude the evaluation with a performance check in a standard annotation task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Datasets</head><p>The largest coreference dataset with crowdsourced annotations is the Phrase Detectives corpus. A subset of this corpus is the Phrase Detectives 1.0 dataset ( , which also in- cludes gold annotations and can therefore be used to evaluate the accuracy of MPA at mention-pair and coreference chain inference, but is too small to train a state-of-the-art coreference system. To carry out this second type of evaluation we used the approach, common in the crowdsourcing liter- ature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carpenter, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Raykar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Felt et al., 2014</ref>), of generating sim- ulated datasets by corrupting the gold standard of an existing corpus. For this purpose, we use the CONLL-2012 dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pradhan et al., 2012)</ref>, at present the standard dataset for coreference reso- lution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Crowdsourced Data</head><p>The Phrase Detectives (PD) 1.0 dataset has been annotated using the Phrase Detectives game with a purpose. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The annotation scheme for PD is based on that for the ARRAU corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Poesio et al., 2018)</ref>. Players have to label predefined 5 mark- ables with one of the following categories: non- referring (e.g., for expletives), discourse-new, discourse-old (in which case an antecedent is also marked, the most recent mention belonging to the antecedent's coreference chain), or property (for appositions and copular structures). The PD 1.0 dataset is the portion of the corpus that contains, in addition to the annotations by the players, a gold label for each markable. The coreference chains are obtained using a simple clustering of the men- tion pairs. An important limitation of this corpus is its small size (around 6000 markables from 45 documents), making it unfit for the training and evaluation of state of the art supervised systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Synthetic Data</head><p>The CONLL-2012 dataset specifies gold chains, not mention pairs. So we need first to extract ap- propriate mention pairs from these chains. To do this, for each mention we select as gold label the closest mention from its gold chain (or discourse new if the mention is the first in its chain). Synthetic <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Uniform  2  Synthetic  Sparse  3  PD-inspired Uniform  4</ref> PD-inspired Sparse  The simulations are then generated by extract- ing from each gold label a number of 'crowd- sourced labels' produced by (simulated) annota- tors with varying degrees of ability. We consid- ered a range of simulated scenarios, all sharing the following settings:</p><p>• 10 distinct annotators per mention and 20 dis- tinct mentions per annotator. The annotators receive random mentions to annotate. 6</p><p>• Each annotator is assigned randomly a pro- file. The profiles indicate the sensitivity of the annotators with respect to discourse old and new. For example, the (DO 0.8, DN 0.9) profile indicates that, given a mention whose true class is DO, the annotator has 0.8 prob- ability of getting it right; and of 0.9 for DN. We considered both profiles reflecting the ac- tual profiles of players in Phrase Detectives (Chamberlain, 2016) and synthetic profiles.</p><p>• 5 choices for the annotators to choose from for each mention: the correct label, the DN    The range of options considered in the simulation is specified by two aspects: the sensitivity from the annotator profiles and the distribution of the errors they make. We use the following two profile types:</p><p>• • Phrase Detectives inspired profiles: from the PD annotators who annotated more than 10 DO and 10 DN mentions (thresholds set to have a minimum confidence) we extracted a total of 89 profiles. This gave us much more interesting sensitivity pairs compared to the ones from the synthetic profiles, i.e., contrast- ing class abilities -see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>We also considered a range of ways in which an- notators may make mistakes:</p><p>• Distribute the errors uniformly random given the remaining mass (1 -sensitivity)</p><p>• Distribute the errors in a sparse manner, i.e., assume that some errors will be more likely than others. This can be achieved by drawing randomly from a 4-dimensional (4 = number of errors) uniform Dirichlet for each mention.

We then assess the accuracy of the in- ferred mention pairs against the gold standard, i.e., the agreement with the gold mention pairs. In this task the proposed model is compared against a ma- jority vote baseline where each mention is paired with the most voted label. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The evaluation is conducted on the crowd- sourced annotated PD 1.0 dataset and on simulated data generated from the CONLL-2012 test set. The results, summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, indicate the men- tion pairs inferred by our model (MPA) obtain a much better level of agreement with the gold men- tion pairs, compared with the output of the ma- jority vote (MV) baseline. MV implicitly assumes equal expertise among the annotators, which has repeatedly been shown to be false in annotation practice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Poesio and Artstein, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Passonneau and Carpenter, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Plank et al., 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluation 2: Silver Chain Quality</head><p>After the mention pairs have been inferred using MPA, producing the coreference chains -we will henceforth refer to the coreference chains thus ob-  tained as silver coreference chains 8 -is a straight- forward clustering task: we simply follow the link structure from the pairs. In this Section we as- sess the quality of the silver chains using standard coreference metrics -in particular, the Extended Scorer introduced in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Poesio et al., 2018</ref>) which extends the official CONLL scorer to include in the evaluation system-predicted singletons and non re- ferring expressions, both of which are annotated in Phrase Detectives; when singletons and non- referring expressions are not considered, the Ex- tended Scorer is identical to the official scorer. As in the previous experiment, the evaluation is conducted on the crowdsourced annotated PD 1.0 dataset and on simulated data generated from the CONLL-2012 test set. We compare silver chains produced using our MPA model, using MV, and using the Stanford deterministic coreference sys- tem (Stanford) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., 2011</ref>). To run the latter on PD 1.0, we used the default annotators of the CoreNLP toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) to supply the information required by the coreference sys- 8 Our use of the term 'silver standard' should not be con- fused with the other common use of standard generated out of automatic annotations. tem and switched off the post-processing to output singleton clusters; for the CONLL-2012 data we set the dcoref.replicate.conll = true to run exactly the same method as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al. (2011)</ref>. On both datasets we evaluated on gold mentions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> summarizes the results on the crowd- sourced annotated PD 1.0 dataset. The silver chains obtained using our MPA model are of a far better quality than those of baseline alternatives such as MV and Stanford. Note also that even the simple MV baseline built from crowdsourced an- notations yields much better chains compared to a standard coreference system such as the Stanford system. This underlines the advantage of crowd- sourced annotations for coreference over automat- ically produced annotations. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> we present the scores of MPA and MV on cases of non refer- ring. In this case, as well, the probabilistic model substantially outperforms the MV baseline.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> we present the results obtained on simulated data from the CONLL-2012 test set. The results follow a similar trend to those observed us- ing actual annotations: a much better quality of the chains produced using the mention pairs in- ferred by our MPA model, across all the simulated  scenarios. Furthermore, the MV baseline achieves better chains compared to the Stanford system in 3 out of 4 simulation settings, again showcasing the potential of crowdsourced annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Training on Silver Chains</head><p>In this Section we assessed the viability of using the (silver) chains extracted from crowdsourcing as an alternative to gold chains when training a state of the art coreference system. Concretely, we train the best-performing current system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al. (2017)</ref> on chains produced using our MPA model, the MV baseline and the Stanford deter- ministic system (Lee et al., 2011) (used mainly for calibration, i.e., an alternative baseline that's not based on crowdsourced annotations). We also in- clude the results obtained using actual gold chains. The results are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>. Across all simulated scenarios, the silver chains produced by our MPA model obtain the closest performance to training on gold chains, and the best result is only 1 per- centage point less than the result with gold chains. Again, the MV chains lead to better performance than those obtained using a system (Stanford).</p><p>These results, once again, indicate the utility of crowdsourced annotations for coreference tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Traditional Crowdsourcing Tasks</head><p>In this Section we show that MPA is state of the art also on traditional crowdsourcing datasets, where annotations fall into general classes that are con- sistent across the annotated items. This evaluation was done on the datasets (WSD, RTE and TEMP) introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Snow et al. (2008)</ref> and widely used as benchmarks in the literature on annotation mod- els ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carpenter, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We compare the results against a majority vote baseline and two well-known state of the art mod- els: a Bayesian version of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dawid and Skene (1979)</ref> (DS) model and MACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hovy et al., 2013)</ref>. We implement DS ourselves using variational in- ference, while for MACE, we simply report the published results. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al. (2013)</ref> the as- sessment is done in terms of accuracy against the gold standard. The results, presented in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, indicate the proposed model achieves performance on par with the state of the art.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>To our knowledge, this is the first paper proposing a model of crowdsourced annotations for corefer- ence. We did draw inspiration however from ex- isting mention pair models of coreference and tra- ditional models of annotation.</p><p>The so-called mention pair model is one of the early machine learning approaches to coreference resolution, made popular by <ref type="bibr">Soon et al. (2001)</ref>. The model is based on a two step procedure: a classification step which identifies the coreferent mention pairs, followed by a clustering step which builds the coreference chains from the aforemen- tioned pairs. The diversity of mention pair mod- els comes from the distinct approaches taken for each of the two steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hoste, 2016)</ref>. Although we follow a similar two step procedure, there are also important differences. Our way of identifying the mention pairs is completely unsupervised, and relies entirely on the crowdsourced annotations. Furthermore, we pair every mention with only one label, reducing the second step of clustering men- tion pairs into appropriate coreference chains to a simple grouping task guided by a unique path which arises from the pairs.</p><p>All existing probabilistic models of annotation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dawid and Skene, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Smyth et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Raykar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hovy et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Passonneau and Carpenter, 2014</ref>) assume the annotations fall into a general set of classes that is consistent across the annotated items. This is clearly not the case in a coreference resolution task, a limitation we had to address. We first transformed the an- notations into a series of (per label) binary deci- sions, approach often referred to, in the multi-class classification literature, as the binary relevance method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madjarov et al., 2012</ref>). The transformation avoids modeling the sparse labels directly. We further exploited the fact that the annotations fall into a general set of classes and assumed the inter-label decisions are the result of the class-dependent ability of the an- notators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Crowdsourced annotations are an increasingly popular alternative to expert annotation. Even so, their viability for coreference annotation had not been explored so far. This paper is a first step to filling this gap. We introduced a men- tion pair-based approach to aggregating crowd-  <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Accuracy on standard crowdsourced data sourced anaphoric annotations and assessed the quality of the inferred pairs, of the post-hoc con- structed coreference chains, and the viability of using the inferred chains as an alternative to gold chains when training a state of the art corefer- ence system. Throughout the experiments, the model introduced was superior to baseline alter- natives such as majority vote and chains obtained automatically using a coreference system, across both genuinely crowdsourced and simulated coref- erence datasets. Furthermore, even the annotation- based baseline achieved results consistently better than those obtained by automatic coreference re- solvers, strengthening the case for using crowd- sourced annotations to create coreference datasets.</p><p>Whose vote should count more: Optimal integra- tion of labels from labelers of unknown expertise.
