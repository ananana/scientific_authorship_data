				<p>When interacting individuals entrain, they begin to speak more like each other. To support research on entrainment in cooperative multi-party dialogues, we have created a corpus where teams of three or four speakers play two rounds of a cooperative board game. We describe the experimental design and technical infrastructure used to collect our corpus, which consists of audio, video, transcriptions, and questionnaire data for 63 teams (47 hours of audio). We illustrate the use of our corpus as a novel resource for studying team entrain-ment by 1) developing and evaluating team-level acoustic-prosodic entrainment measures that extend existing dyad measures, and 2) investigating relationships between team en-trainment and participation dominance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Linguistic entrainment 1 refers to the convergence of (para)linguistic features across speakers during con- versation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brennan and Clark, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Porzel et al., 2006</ref>). Research has found that speakers entrain to both human and computer conversational partners, with the amount of entrainment often positively re- lated to conversational and task success. However, most prior work has focused on the study of entrain- ment during two-party dialogues, rather than during the multi-party conversations typical of teams.</p><p>To support the study of entrainment during multi- party cooperative dialogue, we have created a large- scale corpus (over 47 hours of recordings) of teams of three or four speakers playing a cooperative board game requiring conversation. The corpus consists of audio, video, transcriptions, and questionnaire data for 63 teams. The goal of the corpus is to provide a freely-available data resource for the development and evaluation of multi-party entrainment measures that can be 1) computed using language technolo- gies, 2) motivated and validated by the literature on teams, and 3) associated with measures of task and dialogue success.</p><p>In this paper, we first describe the experimental design and technical infrastructure used to create our corpus. We then present two case studies illustrat- ing the use of our corpus as a novel resource for studying team entrainment: quantifying acoustic- prosodic entrainment at the team-level rather than the dyad-level, and incorporating a construct from the teamwork literature into the study of entrain- ment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>The development of methods for automatically quantifying entrainment in text and speech data is an active research area, as entrainment has been shown to correlate with success measures or with social variables for a variety of phenomena, e.g., acoustic-prosodic, lexical, and syntactic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nenkova et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reitter and Moore, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mitchell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Levitan et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stoyanchev and Stent, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lopes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lubold and Pon-Barry, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sinha and Cassell, 2015)</ref>. Such research, in turn, requires corpora with certain properties. A high- quality spoken language corpus for studying entrain-ment would include transcriptions suitable for nat- ural language processing, audio recordings suitable for signal processing, and meta-data such as task success or speaker demographics.</p><p>While most research has focused on quantify- ing the amount of entrainment between pairs of speakers, recent work has started to develop mea- sures for quantifying entrainment between larger groups of speakers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Friedberg et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gonzales et al., 2010)</ref>. To date, however, mainly simple methods such as unweighted averaging have been used to move from pairs to groups, and the focus of prior work has been on text rather than speech (e.g., Wikipedia, computer-mediated discussions, lexical analysis of transcriptions). In this paper we both investigate group acoustic-prosodic entrainment and examine relationships between group entrainment and a fac- tor from the teamwork literature called participation equality / dominance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Paletz and Schunn, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Also, while freely available speech corpora have supported the study of entrainment in two-party di- alogues (e.g., Switchboard, Maptask, the Columbia Games Corpus, Let's Go), few community resources exist for the study of multi-party entrainment. Some multi-party resources are only text-based (e.g., the online Slashdot forum <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen et al., 2014</ref>), chat di- alogues ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Afantenos et al., 2015)</ref>). Those speech resources that do exist are often less than ideal as they were created for other purposes (e.g., Supreme Court arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beňuš et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2012)</ref>, the AMI meeting cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carletta et al., 2006</ref>)). Although not cre- ated to study entrainment, the KTH-Idiap Group- Interviewing corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Oertel et al., 2014</ref>) is perhaps most relevant as it was explicitly designed to sup- port research on group dynamics. However, the cor- pus contains only 5 hours of speech, and participants were PhD students so did not differ on variables such as age and social status.</p><p>The Teams corpus presented and used in this pa- per was designed to add several notable extensions to existing multi-party spoken dialogue resources. In particular, the Teams corpus was experimentally collected to constrain the team processes, tasks, and outcomes in ways that facilitate an investigation of team entrainment. First, the corpus consists of over 45 hours of cooperative task-oriented dialogues be- tween three or four speakers, where audio and video files were collected and transcribed using best prac- tices for computational processing. Second, the corpus was collected using an experimental manip- ulation informed by the organizational and social psychological literature on team processes in order to create high versus low-entrainment conditions. Third, since the social psychological literature sug- gests that team dynamics are more complex than an average of dyadic interactions, validated question- naires were used to collect relevant variables of in- terest to researchers on teams, and individual par- ticipants were recruited so that teams would exhibit diversity with respect to these variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Study</head><p>The Teams corpus was collected in a laboratory experiment. The laboratory setting enabled high- quality audio and video capture, while the experi- mental study allowed manipulations to vary entrain- ment and to collect measures of team processes. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Design</head><p>Our data collection was via an experiment with a 2 by 2 within-and-between subjects design. Teams of 3-4 participants spent 2-3 hours in our lab tak- ing self-report questionnaires and being audio and video-taped playing a cooperative board game. Two manipulations were designed to increase the like- lihood of task success and entrainment 3 . For the first manipulation, half the teams were given a teamwork training intervention in which participants were given specific advice based on a needs analy- sis of the team skills important to the game ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gregory et al., 2013)</ref>. Such mixed teamwork/taskwork train- ing has been shown to improve team process out- comes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Salas et al., 2008</ref>). The other half only had training on the rules of the game, which all teams received.</p><p>For the second manipulation, each team played two isomorphic versions of the game. The game was originally designed to be played multiple times, with each session unique depending on the random placement of specific board tiles and the order of deck cards. To maintain experimental control, two specific deck card orders and board tile patterns that had the same underlying opportunities and obstacles were created. 33 teams played one game first, and 30 teams played the other game first. In either case, by the second time, the team should have a better grasp of the game and appropriate strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Task</head><p>For the team task, we chose the cooperative board game Forbidden Island T M , where players take on the roles of adventurers seeking treasures on an is- land before it is flooded. We chose this game be- cause it both demands collaboration and is logisti- cally feasible for our experiment. The cooperative task-oriented nature of the game requires players to communicate to achieve their goals (e.g., discussing cards and strategies in real time, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>), lend- ing itself directly to eliciting entrainment. Further, the game gives each player a different role to achieve the team goals, as well as game-specific terminol- ogy, generalizing to real-world situations with team- work (e.g. aviation, health care). Logistically, For- bidden Island T M can be played equally well with three or four players. This feature allowed us to schedule teams of four participants, but still play the game even if only three showed up. A typical game is also short enough to be played twice within an ex- perimental session. Game rules were adapted to en- sure the game difficulty was suitable for novice play- ers (e.g., requiring three rather than four treasures be found before completing the game). As noted in Section 3.1, two isomorphic versions of the game were constructed so that the first and second games would appear visually different but the difficulty level would be identical between and within teams. This isomorphism was accomplished by maintain- ing the position of tiles and cards that determined order-of-play and game difficulty, while systemat- ically shifting the position of non-critical tiles and cards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Recruitment</head><p>Participants aged 18 years and older who are na- tive speakers of American English were recruited via electronic and hardcopy flyers and paid for their time. They were males and females of any ethnic- ity from a university and its surrounding community. To increase ethnicity, race, and age diversity (rare in corpora typically drawn only from student samples), we advertised in non-student locations in predomi- nantly ethnic minority neighborhoods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Procedure</head><p>As a team's participants arrived in the lab, each com- pleted a questionnaire to collect personality, demo- graphic, and other information such as experience with the game Forbidden Island T M . Participants were then taught how to play the game by watching a video and playing a tutorial game, then given a few minutes to ask specific questions. Teams in the inter- vention condition (the between-subjects manipula- tion of our experimental design) were given an extra 10 minutes before the first game to receive training about teamwork strategies such as team roles, com- munication needs, and how to coordinate their ac- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gregory et al., 2013)</ref>, as well as additional in- formation adapted for the Forbidden Island T M task itself. Then each team played the game twice for no more than 35 minutes per game. Teams were told that not completing a game in 35 minutes counted as a loss, and that winning scores for the rest of the games would be inversely related to game length (a timer was displayed on a computer monitor during each game). The intervention condition teams were also given an additional 5 minutes before the sec- ond game to discuss what went well and poorly with their team processes. Finally, both between and after the two games, all participants filled out question-naires regarding their team processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Data Capture</head><p>Game participants were located around a round ta- ble 48 inches in diameter in our game-playing lab, enabling comfortable participant access to the game board. Each participant sat in a particular location depending on their role in the game. The survey data were collected in a separate workstation lab using Qualtrics, a web-based, survey software tool.</p><p>To collect high-quality speech data with minimal cross-talk, audio was recorded using Sennheiser ME 3-ew close-talk microphones. Each microphone was connected to a Presonus AudioBox 1818VSL multi- channel audio interface sampling at 96k, 24 bits. Audio recordings were monitored using Reaper Dig- ital Audio Workstation v 4.76. Each game yielded one stereo recording with the synchronized speech from all speakers, along with 3 or 4 individual files (one per participant) representing the audio record- ing from each microphone. Reaper was used to ren- der .WAV files with a 48000 Hz sampling rate and a 16 bit PCM Wav bit depth.</p><p>To complement the speech, four wall-mounted Zoom Q4 cameras captured WVGA/30 .MOV video recordings. The audio streams recorded from the cameras are at the central room, not the individual, level. A master audio signal was used to synchronize the videos with each other and with the audio from the microphones. Note that the videos also provide backup audio streams (recording at 256kbps AAC) for the microphones. In addition, the videos provide information about the games that are not always ob- vious from the audio 4 , as well as non-verbal data for future analysis (e.g., of gesture or posture).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Teams Corpus</head><p>Our experiment ran from February through August 2015, yielding over 47 hours of recordings from 63 teams 5 (216 individuals).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Descriptive Statistics</head><p>The 216 participants in our experiment were on av- erage 25.3 years old (min=18, max=67, SD=11.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control</head><p>Intervention (n=31) (n=32) 3-per. 4-per. 3-per. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4-per.  # of teams  20  11  16  16  avg g1 time 26.6</ref> 28.0 26. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> 27.3 avg g2 time 18.0 17.7 18.2 19.7  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref> (multiple ethnicities were allowed). Thus, our re- cruitment yielded demographically diverse partici- pants in ways that are useful for team research. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the distribution of the teams in our corpus by experimental condition (control versus in- tervention) and team size (3 versus 4 person). For each of these groups of teams, the table also shows the average time they took in minutes to play games 1 and 2, respectively. A 3-way ANOVA shows a significant within-team effect for game, with first games taking significantly longer than second games (27.1 vs. 18.4 minutes, p &lt; .001). The average game length did not significantly differ by experi- mental condition (p &gt; .7) or by team size (p &gt; .3), and there were also no interaction effects.</p><p>Our team-level data provides preliminary evi- dence for the success of one of our experimental manipulations, as second games were significantly shorter than first games. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Audio Segmentation and Transcription</head><p>After the experiment was completed, our multi- ple audio track speech was manually segmented and transcribed using the Higgins Annotation Tool 7 . <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The time to complete a game is an easy to compute but a shallow (inverse) success measure. We are currently annotat- ing our data for game-specific and dialogue-based success mea- sures, and will also examine success in terms of team process measures computable from the questionnaires (Section 4.3).</p><p>7 http://www.speech.kth.se/hat/ Each audio track, which corresponds to each indi- vidual player, appears on a separate line in Higgins. A time stamp line applies to all of the (synchro- nized) audio tracks. To do transcription, each par- ticipant's speech is first segmented into inter-pausal units, pause-free chunks of speech from a single speaker ( ). The thresh- old used for pause length (i.e., silence) for our cor- pus is 200 milliseconds. Once speech is segmented in a specific audio track, a corresponding text line appears where the transcriber manually types in the text for the corresponding audio segment. Within each transcription, text segments may also be de- fined and assigned values. We are using segments to annotate non-lexical aspects such as laughs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Questionnaire Data</head><p>The pre-game questionnaire was used to collect in- dividual demographic information such as discussed in Section 4.1, and self-reported data related to per- sonality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">John et al., 1991)</ref>, cognitive styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Miron et al., 2004</ref>), and collective orientation ("the propen- sity to work in a collective manner in team set- tings" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Driskell et al., 2010)</ref>). The between and post- game questionnaires elicited perceptions of team processes such as cohesion, satisfaction, and po- tency/efficacy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wendt et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wageman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guzzo et al., 1993)</ref>. Such information was collected as a novel resource for studying multi- party entrainment, since team processes have been shown to be positively related to performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beal et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mullen and Copper, 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Public Release</head><p>The Teams corpus will be freely available for re- search purposes <ref type="bibr">8</ref> , with the first release coordinated with the publication of this paper. The team level contents of the first release will consist of 63 game 1 and 62 9 game 2 WAV files. The individual level contents of this release will consist of the demo- graphic responses for the 216 participants in XLSX format. Later corpus releases will include associ- ated audio segmentations and transcriptions in XML format, game-level video files, and personality and team process measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Case Studies Using the Teams Corpus</head><p>This section presents results from two case studies illustrating the use of the Teams corpus for novel re- search in multi-party dialogue entrainment. The first study proposes new team level measures that build on existing dyad-level measures of proximity and convergence, then uses these team measures to in- vestigate whether prior dyad-level acoustic-prosodic entrainment findings generalize to teams. The sec- ond study investigates relationships between team convergence and participation equality / dominance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Acoustic-Prosodic Team Entrainment</head><p>Speakers do not entrain on all linguistic features of conversations, and when they do entrain, they may entrain in different ways on different features. In this section we examine whether teams entrain on different acoustic-prosodic features during each of their two game conversations. Our current ap- proach to measuring team-level entrainment is based on averaging dyad-level measures. We build on two dyad measures, namely, proximity and conver- gence ( ). In a conver- sation, proximity measures feature similarity over the entire conversation, while convergence measures an increase in feature proximity over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Feature Extraction from Speaker Audio</head><p>We focus on the acoustic-prosodic dimensions of pitch, intensity, and voice quality, following previous work on dyad entrainment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lubold and Pon-Barry, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Borrie et al., 2015)</ref>. Pitch is related to the frequency of the sound wave. Intensity describes the rate of en- ergy flow. Jitter and shimmer are measures of vari- ations of frequency and energy, respectively, which are descriptive of voice quality. We use the Praat software ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boersma and Heuven, 2002</ref>) to extract the following 9 acoustic-prosodic features: minimum (min), maximum (max), mean and standard devi- ation (SD) of pitch; min, max, mean of intensity; local jitter 10 ; and local shimmer <ref type="bibr">11</ref> . Features are extracted separately for each speaker and for each game. Before feature extraction, each game-level audio file for each speaker is pre-processed to re- move silences (using a threshold of 1 second).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Measuring Team Proximity</head><p>Proximity quantifies the similarity of a feature value between conversational partners over their en- tire conversation. Intuitively, if a team has entrained on a feature in terms of proximity during a partic- ular game, speakers within the same team should be more similar (or equivalently, less different) to each other than to all the other speakers in the corpus who are not on their team and are playing the same game (i.e., game 1 or game 2). For each game we computed a team-level partner difference (T Dif f p ) and a team-level other difference (T Dif f o ). In Sec- tion 5.1.4 we report paired t-test analyses to infer entrainment within a game when T Dif f p is signifi- cantly smaller than T Dif f o .</p><p>The partner difference for a speaker in a dyad ( ) is the absolute difference between the feature value for a speaker and her partner. For each team, we averaged these absolute values for all members of the team:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T Dif f p = ∀i =j∈team (|speaker i − speaker j |) |team| * (|team| − 1)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The other difference for a speaker in a dyad ( ) is the mean of the absolute differences between the speaker's value for a feature and the values of each of the speakers in the corpus (for the same game number) with whom the speaker was not partnered (set X in Formula 2). For each team, we averaged these means for all the members of the team:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T Dif f o = ∀i∈team ( j |speaker i −X j | |X| ) |team|<label>(2)</label></formula><p>For proximity, all of the feature values were normal- ized within a game based on gender 12 using z-scores Feature Game1 Game2 Pitch-min 0.844 0.193 Pitch-max −1.092 0.022 Pitch-mean −1.297 −1.294 Pitch-sd −0.407 −1.652 Intensity-mean −4.469* −4.911* Intensity-min −2.653* −2.069* Intensity-max −3.625* −2.853* Shimmer-local −2.390* −2.782* Jitter-local −1.242 −2.702* </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(z = v ij −µ j σ j</formula><p>; v ij = value of speaker i in game j where j ∈ {1, 2}, µ j = gender mean in game j, and σ j = gender standard deviation in game j.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Measuring Team Convergence</head><p>Intuitively, there is evidence of convergence when speakers within a conversation become more similar to each other later in the conversation. While feature value differences are compared across teams to in- fer proximity entrainment, feature value differences within a single team are compared across time for convergence entrainment. Since differing time inter- vals have been examined in the dyad literature, we compared features extracted from the first versus last three, five, and seven minutes of each game, as well as from the two game halves. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Convergence was inferred via paired t-tests when the partner differ- ences (Equation 1) in the second time interval were significantly smaller than in the earlier time interval (e.g., the T Dif f p in the last 3 minutes of game 1 is smaller than T Dif f p in the first 3 minutes of game 1). To break the games into different time intervals for feature extraction, we used the raw audio files to extract the breaking points of the conversation and then mapped these points to each of the processed audio files where silence was removed.</p></div>

Com- parison of the significant game 1 results shows that teams entrained on pitch min, pitch max, shimmer, and jitter in at least one of the intervals. Both shim- mer and jitter converged for all choices of temporal units. For pitch, convergence was instead only seen using the first and last 3 minutes, which are the inter- vals farthest in the game from each other. The only feature that diverged during game 1 is pitch-mean. The rest of the features did not show significant team-level partner differences during game 1 for any temporal interval and thus exhibited maintenance, meaning that the team members neither converged nor diverged. During game 2, we observed mainte- nance for all features except for intensity-mean and intensity-min, which diverged. Together our results suggest that when teams in our corpus converged on a feature, they did so earlier in the experiment (namely, just during the first game, and sometimes just in the earliest part of the first game).</p><p>As a divergent validity check for convergence, for each of the 62 teams, we constructed artificial ver- sions of the real conversations between team mem- bers: For each member of the team, we randomly permuted the silence and speech intervals extracted by Praat. Ideally, we should not see evidence of convergence within these constructed conversations. Our results confirm that there was no significant en- trainment on either of the two constructed games, for all temporal comparison intervals and all features.</p><p>In summary, team acoustic-prosodic entrainment did not occur for all features. For the features that did show entrainment, results varied depending on whether proximity or convergence was examined, and by the time intervals compared. With respect to type of entrainment, when looking at the entire game 1, there was significant evidence of entrain- ment (proximity) on mean, min, max intensity, and shimmer. Although there was no significant prox- imity for min, max pitch and jitter, they did become more similar (converged) over time. With respect to time, team convergence was found for shimmer and jitter independently of temporal interval examined, but for pitch only when comparing the most distant temporal intervals in game 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Participation Equality / Dominance</head><p>Within psychology, equality of participation has been associated with successful team performance and decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mesmer-Magnus and DeChurch, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Stasser and Titus, 1987)</ref>). Within computational linguistics, balance of participation with respect to proposal of ideas was associated with more productive small group (online) conversa- tions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Niculae and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Extending this literature, we perform a novel in-  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Summary of hierarchical regression analysis for variables predicting entrainment on pitch-max. * p &lt; .05. n = 62. vestigation of the association between participation equality/dominance and team entrainment, focusing on the time interval showing the most significant convergence results in Section 5.1.4 (entrainment on pitch-max, pitch-min, jitter, and shimmer from the first to last 3 minutes of game 1).</p><p>Equation 3 defines the participation of player i in a team, where speech length i is the sum of the lengths of the speech intervals of player i:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">participation i = speech length i m∈team speech length m (3)</formula><p>Participation dominance in turn is the standard de- viation of the participation for all team members:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Dominance = σ(P articipation), P articipation = {participation i |i ∈ team} (4)</formula><p>Higher standard deviations indicate a greater range of participation from team members, and lower stan- dard deviations indicate more participation equality.</p><p>We performed a hierarchical regression analysis for each of the four acoustic-prosodic features noted above as the target entrainment variable. As in the convergence section, we measured entrainment as the average differences (T Dif f p ) of the team in the first interval minus the second interval. Larger pos- itive numbers are indicative of more entrainment. The independent variables we included in our anal- ysis are: team size, session length, average age of the team members, percentage of the female play- ers in each team, and participation dominance. The first four are covariates that have been found to be or are likely related to team communication and/or dynamics. We hypothesized that participation dom- inance would be related to entrainment above and beyond these other potential variables. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> presents the results with pitch-max for entrainment. (The other 3 entrainment variables did not show significant relationships with partici- pation.) The standardized βs indicate the effect size and direction of the individual variables on pitch- max, whereas the R 2 indicates the effect size of the model of all the variables together. Average age and percent female were not significantly related to en- trainment on pitch-max, so were excluded from the final analyses.</p><p>First, both team size and session length were en- tered as potential independent variables into the re- gression analysis with pitch-max as the dependent variable. This model (Model 1) was significant. Specifically, team size and session length were both significantly positively associated with entrainment on pitch-max. That is, as team size or session length increased, entrainment also increased.</p><p>Participation dominance was then entered to cre- ate Model 2, which included team size, session length, and participation dominance. The amount of variance explained for participation dominance was significant above and beyond the variables entered in Model 1, ∆R 2 = 0.08, ∆F (1, 58) = 6.307, p = 0.015. Specifically, there was a significant neg- ative association between participation dominance and entrainment on pitch-max, such that greater par- ticipation equality was related to greater entrain- ment. This suggests that the more each team mem- ber is given a chance to equally contribute, the more likely they are to entrain on their maximum pitch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Summary and Broader Implications</head><p>The long-term goal of our research is to use speech and language processing, informed by the team- work literature, to develop computational measures of conversational team entrainment that will be use- ful for predicting team success. We first described the design and contents of the Teams corpus, which is being made freely available for research pur- poses. Experimental manipulations, high-quality audio and video with time-aligned transcriptions, and self-reported team process data make the cor- pus a unique resource for studying multi-party dia- logue entrainment. We provided two examples il- lustrating the use of the Teams corpus to facilitate new directions in the study of entrainment: quantify- ing acoustic-prosodic entrainment at the team rather than the dyad-level, and incorporating the teamwork construct of participation dominance into the study of entrainment. Our current plans include contin- ued corpus development (recall Section 4.4), and us- ing more sophisticated methods than dyad averaging (e.g., using weighting based on team process mea- sures) to move from dyads to teams.</p><p>With respect to broader impact, our entrainment measures could be used to mine existing corpora for naturalistic successful and unsuccessful conver- sations, or to trigger online interventions by dia- logue systems participating in multi-party conversa- tions. After additional research understanding the important thresholds for entrainment, organizations could unobtrusively measure team effectiveness dur- ing entrainment, and intervene with training to aid teams with low entrainment. Similar interventions would be useful for conversational agents that mon- itor and facilitate group interactions (e.g., in edu- cation via computer-supported collaborative learn- ing). Our work could also support the development of data mining applications for corpora such as team meetings or discussions, from classrooms to board- rooms. Finally, our corpus could support natural lan- guage processing research regarding any other as- pect of teamwork (e.g., affect, conflict, topic mod- eling). In sum, the Teams Corpus should provide usable, multi-channel data for examining team pro- cesses for a range of purposes and research disci- plines.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Dialogue excerpt from a Forbidden Island T M game.

			<note place="foot" n="2"> A lab experiment involving a two-player game requiring spoken communication was similarly used to collect the Columbia Games Corpus of 12 spontaneous task-oriented dyadic conversations, which has been used in multiple studies of two-party entrainment (Levitan and Hirschberg, 2011; Levitan et al., 2012; Levitan et al., 2011). Our corpus is approximately 5 times larger, includes speech from teams rather than from dyads, and relatedly includes new types of team-related meta-data. Our corpus also contains both video and audio as our dialogues were face-to-face rather than restricted to voice. 3 As discussed in Section 2, prior research has often found positive relationships between success and entrainment.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We are currently using the videos to annotate game-specific measures of task success. 5 A power analysis for our experiment yielded a minimum target sample size of 52 teams.</note>
