				<p>Automatic extraction of temporal information is important for natural language understanding. It involves two basic tasks: (1) Understanding time expressions that are mentioned explicitly in text (e.g., February 27, 1998 or tomorrow), and (2) Understanding temporal information that is conveyed implicitly via relations. This paper introduces CogCompTime, a system that has these two important functionalities. It incorporates the most recent progress, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is publicly available. 1 We believe that this demo will provide valuable insight for temporal understanding and be useful for multiple time-aware applications.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Time is an important dimension when we describe the world because many facts are time-sensitive, e.g., one's place of residence, one's employment, or the progress of a conflict between countries. Consequently, many applications can benefit from temporal understanding in natural language, e.g., timeline construction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Minard et al., 2015)</ref>, clinical events analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jindal and Roth, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bethard et al., 2015)</ref>, question an- swering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Llorens et al., 2015)</ref>, and causality infer- ence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ning et al., 2018a</ref>).</p><p>Temporal understanding from natural language requires two basic components <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Verhagen et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Verhagen et al., , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">UzZaman et al., 2013</ref>). The first, also known as the Timex component, requires extract- ing explicit time expressions in text (i.e., "Timex") and normalize them to a standard format. In Ex- ample 1, the Timex is <ref type="bibr">February 27, 1998</ref> and its normalized form is '1998-02-27". Note that nor- malization may also require a reference time for Timexes like "tomorrow", for which we need to know the document creation time <ref type="bibr">(DCT)</ref>. In ad- dition to DATE, there are also other Timex types including TIME (e.g., 8 am), DURATION (e.g., 3 years), and SET (e.g., every Monday).</p><p>Timexes carry temporal information explicitly, but temporal information can also be conveyed im- plicitly via temporal relations (i.e., "TempRel"). In Example 2, there are two events: e1:exploded and e2:died. The text does not tell us when they happened, but we do know that there is a TempRel between them, i.e., e1:exploded happened before e2:died. The second basic component of tem- poral understanding is thus the TempRel compo- nent, which extracts TempRels automatically from text. While the Timex component provides abso- lute time anchors, the TempRel component pro- vides the relative order of events. These two to- gether provide a complete picture of the tempo- ral dimension of a story, so they are naturally the most important building blocks towards temporal understanding.</p><p>Example 1: Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed an economic cooperation plan on (t1: <ref type="bibr">February 27, 1998)</ref>. Example 2: A car (e1:exploded) in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball. More than 10 people have (e2:died), police said.</p><p>In this paper, we present CogCompTime (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), a tool with both the Timex and TempRel components, which are conceptually built on <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhao et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ning et al. (2017)</ref>, respec- tively. CogCompTime is a new implementation that integrates both components and also incor- porates the most recent advances in this area ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ning et al., 2018a</ref>,b,c). Two highlights are: First, CogCompTime achieves comparable perfor- mance to state-of-the-art Timex systems, but is almost two times faster than the second fastest, HeidelTime <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2010)</ref>. Second, CogCompTime improves the performance of the TempRel component by a large margin, from the literature's F 1 ≈ 50 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">UzZaman et al., 2013)</ref> to F 1 ≈ 70 (see details in Sec. 3). Given these two contributions, we believe that CogCompTime is a good demonstration of the state-of-the-art in temporal understanding. In addition, since CogCompTime is publicly available, it will pro- vide easy access to users working on time-aware applications, as well as valuable insight to re- searchers seeking further improvements.</p><p>We briefly review the literature and explain in detail the processing pipeline of CogCompTime in Sec. 2: the Timex component, the Event Ex- traction component, and the TempRel compo- nent. Following that, we provide a benchmark evaluation in Sec. 3 on the TempEval3 and the MATRES datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">UzZaman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ning et al., 2018c</ref>). Finally, we point out directions for future work and conclude this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System</head><p>The system pipeline of CogCompTime is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>: It takes raw text as input and uses CogCompNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Khashabi et al., 2018</ref>) to extract features such as lemmas, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and semantic role labelings (SRL). Then CogCompTime sequentially applies the Timex component, the event extraction component, and the TempRel component. Finally, both a graph visualization and a timeline visualization are pro- vided for the users. In the following, we will ex- plain these main modules in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Timex Component</head><p>Existing work on Timex extraction and normal- ization falls into two categories: rule-based and learning-based. Rule-based systems use regular expressions to extract Timex in text and then deter- ministic rules to normalize them (e.g., <ref type="bibr">HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012)</ref>). Learning-based systems use classification models to chunk out Timexes in text and normalize them based on grammar pars- ing (e.g., UWTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al., 2014</ref>) and Pars- ingTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angeli et al., 2012)</ref>). CogCompTime adopts a mixed strategy: we use machine learning in the Timex extraction step and rule parsing in the normalization step. This mixed strategy, while maintaining a state-of-the-art performance, signif- icantly improves the computational efficiency of the Timex component, as we show in Sec. 3.</p><p>Technically, the Timex extraction step can be formulated as a generic text chunking problem and the standard B(egin), I(nside), and O(utside) label- ing scheme can be used. CogCompTime proposes TemporalChunker, by retraining Illinois-Chunker ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Punyakanok and Roth, 2001</ref>) on top of the Timex chunk annotations provided by the TempEval3 workshop ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">UzZaman et al., 2013)</ref>. Here a ma- chine learning based extraction algorithm signif- icantly improves the computational efficiency by quickly sifting out impossible text chunks, as com- pared to regular expression matching, which has to check every substring of text against regular ex- pressions and is often slow. However, we do ad- mit that learning-based extraction handles corner cases not as well as rule-based systems because of the limited training examples.</p><p>After Timexes are extracted, we apply rules to normalize them. We think rule-based methods are generally more natural for normalization: On one hand, the desired formats of various types of Timexes are already defined as rules by corre- sponding annotation guidelines; on the other hand, the intermediate steps of how one Timex is nor- malized are not annotated in any existing datasets (it is inherently hard to do so), so learning-based methods usually have to introduce latent vari- ables and need more training instances as a result. Therefore, we have adopted a rule-based normal- ization method. However, we admit that an obvi- ous drawback is that the rule set needs to be re- designed for every single language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Event Extraction Component</head><p>Event extraction is closely related to how events are defined. Generally speaking, an event is con- sidered to be an action associated with the corre- sponding participants. In the context of tempo- ral understanding, events are usually represented by their head verb token, so unlike the generic chunking problem in Timex extraction, event ex- traction can be formulated as a classification prob- lem for each token. Specifically, CogCompTime only considers those main-axis events, so event extraction is simply a binary classification prob- lem (i.e., whether or not a token is a main-axis event or not). As defined by the MATRES annota- tion scheme ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ning et al., 2018c</ref>), main-axis events are those events that form the primary timeline of a story and approximately 60%-70% of the verbs are on the main-axis in MATRES. We extract lem- mas and POS tags within a fixed window, SRL, and prepositional phrase head, and train a sparse averaged perceptron for event extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">TempRel Component</head><p>Temporal relations can be generally modeled by a graph (called temporal graph), where the nodes represent events and Timexes, and the edges represent TempRels. With all the nodes ex- tracted (by previous steps), the TempRel com- ponent is to make predictions on the labels of those edges. In this paper, the label set for Event-Event TempRels is before, after, equal, and vague and for Event-Timex TempRels is equal and not-equal. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> State-of-the-art methods include, e.g., ClearTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bethard, 2013)</ref>, CAEVO <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chambers et al., 2014)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ning et al. (2017)</ref>. The TempRel task is known to be very difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ning et al. (2018c)</ref> attributes the difficulty partly to the low inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of exist- ing TempRel datasets and proposes a new Multi- Axis Temporal RElations dataset of Start-points (MATRES) with significantly improved IAA, so for the TempRel task, we have chosen MATRES as the benchmark in this paper. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We also incorporate the recent progress of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ning et al. (2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ning et al. ( , 2018a</ref>. The feature set used for TempRel is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>, which contains fea- tures derived individually from each node and jointly from a node pair. Since a node can be ei- ther an event or a Timex, an edge can also be ei- ther an Event-Event edge or an Event-Timex edge and the features have to vary a bit, as detailed by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. Note that for Event-Event edges, we incorporate features from TemProb, 4 which en- codes prior knowledge of typical temporal orders of events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ning et al., 2018b</ref>). With these fea- tures, we also adopt the constraint-driven learn- ing algorithm for TempRel classification proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ning et al. (2017)</ref> with sparse averaged per- ceptron. Then our TempRel component assigns local prediction scores (i.e., soft-max scores) to each edge and solves an integer linear program- ming (ILP) problem via Gurobi (Gurobi Optimiza- tion, 2015) to achieve globally consistent temporal graphs (please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ning et al. (2018a)</ref> for de- tails). CogCompTime is a unique package so far that incorporates all the recent progress. Since there are two types of nodes (i.e., event and Timex), and two types of TempRels (i.e., Event-Event and Event-Timex), we put the common features above and split specific feature sets below. Conjunctive features are not listed exhaustively here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Visualization</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, we highlight the extracted Timexes and events in the text. Specifically for Timexes, we also annotate their normalized val- ues along with their chunks. We provide two forms of visualization for the extracted TempRels. Since TempRels can be naturally modeled by a graph, a graph visualization is an obvious choice and we use d3 (https://d3js.org/) in CogCompTime. Additionally, we provide a more compact visualization to those graphs via timeline construction. Since a graph is only par- tially ordered (as opposed to a timeline which is fully ordered), we resort to the appearance order of events in timeline construction when the tem- poral order is vague according to its graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Benchmark Experiment</head><p>We used the dataset provided by the TempE- val3 workshop, with the original train/test split in our experiment: TimeBank and AQUAINT were for training (256 articles), and Platinum was for testing <ref type="bibr">(20 articles)</ref>. Note that we replaced the TempRel annotations in the original TempEval3 datasets by MATRES due to its higher IAA. In the Timex component, TemporalChunker by default takes 10% of the train set as the development set, and in other components, 5-fold cross-validation was used for parameter tuning. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> evaluates the Timex component of CogCompTime, comparing with state-of-the-art systems. The "normalization" and "end-to-end" columns were evaluated based on gold Timex extraction and system Timex extraction, respec- tively. The fact that CogCompTime had the best extraction F 1 and normalization accuracy but not the best end-to-end performance is due to our mixed strategy: Timexes extracted by our learning-based TemporalChunker sometimes can- not be normalized correctly by our rule-based nor- malizer. This phenomenon is relatively more se- vere in CogCompTime comparing to systems that are consistently rule-based or learning-based in both extraction and normalization. However, the computational efficiency is improved significantly by reducing the runtime of the second fastest, HeidelTime, by more than 50%. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the performance of the Event Extraction and TempRel components. We also copied the Timex extraction performance from Ta- ble 1. Note that CogCompTime only extracts those main-axis events as defined by MATRES. Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ning et al. (2018c)</ref> did not propose an event extraction method, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> is in fact the first reported performance of event extraction on MATRES and as we see, both the precision and recall are better than those numbers reported in TempEval3. Note that since CogCompTime works on different annotations, this does not indicate that our event extraction algorithm is better than those participants in TempEval3; instead, this indicates that the event extraction problem in MATRES is a better-defined machine learning task.</p><p>The performance of TempRel extraction is fur- ther evaluated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, both when the gold event and Timex extraction is used and when system ex- traction is used. As for Event-Event TempRels, we also introduce a new relaxed metric <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , where pre- dictions of before/after are not penalized when the gold label is vague. This is based on the definition</p></div>

The "extraction" and "normalization" columns are the two intermediate steps. "Normalization" was evaluated given gold extraction, while "end-to-end" means system extraction was used. Runtimes were evaluated under the same setup. † HeidelTime and SUTime have no clear-cut between extraction and normalization, so even if gold Timex chunks are fed in, their extraction step cannot be easily skipped. of vague in MATRES, i.e., to assign vague labels when either before or after is reasonable. We think this relaxed metric is more suitable when creating timelines from temporal graphs, where an order must be picked anyhow when two events have a vague relation. When system extraction was used, the TempRel performance saw a large drop. How- ever, the performance here, although it is perhaps still not sufficiently good for some applications, is already a significant step forward in temporal understanding. As a reference point, the best sys- tem in TempEval3, ClearTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bethard, 2013)</ref>, had P=34.08, R=28.40, F 1 =30.98 (using system ex- traction) and P=37.32, R=35.25, F 1 =36.26 (using gold extraction). Again, given the dataset differ- ence, these numbers are not directly comparable, but it indicates that the MATRES dataset used here probably has the TempRel task better defined and we hope this demo paper will be a good showcase of the new state-of-the-art.  TempRel components when gold/system extraction is used. The relaxed metric does not penalize the system if a be- fore/after prediction is made on a vague relation. Please also refer to the text about this metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Future Work</head><p>We plan to further improve CogCompTime in the following directions. First, the MATRES dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ning et al., 2018c</ref>) only considers verb events, but nominal events are also very common and important, so we plan to incorporate nominal event extraction and corresponding TempRel ex- traction. Second, CogCompTime currently does not incorporate an event coreference component.</p><p>Since coreference is important for bridging long- distance event pairs, it is a desirable feature. We can adopt existing event coreferencing techniques such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Peng et al. (2016)</ref> in the next step. Third, CogCompTime currently only works on the main- axis events as defined in MATRES. How to incor- porate other axes, e.g., intention axis, opinion axis, and hypothesis axis, requires further investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper presents CogCompTime, a new pack- age that, given raw text, (1) extracts time expres- sions (Timex) and normalizes them to a standard format, and (2) extracts events on the main time axis of a story and the temporal relations between events and Timexes. CogCompTime takes advan- tage of many recent advances and achieves state- of-the-art performance in both tasks. We think this demo will be interesting for a broad audience be- cause it is useful not only for identifying the short- comings of existing methods, but also for applica- tions that depend on the temporal understanding of natural language text.</p><p>U.S. Government.
