				<p>In this paper, we present a novel approach for identifying argumentative discourse structures in persuasive essays. The structure of argumentation consists of several components (i.e. claims and premises) that are connected with argumentative relations. We consider this task in two consecutive steps. First, we identify the components of arguments using multiclass classification. Second, we classify a pair of argument components as either support or non-support for identifying the structure of argumentative discourse. For both tasks, we evaluate several classifiers and propose novel feature sets including structural , lexical, syntactic and contextual features. In our experiments, we obtain a macro F1-score of 0.726 for identifying argument components and 0.722 for argumentative relations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Argumentation is a crucial aspect of writing skills acquisition. The ability of formulating persuasive arguments is not only the foundation for convinc- ing an audience of novel ideas but also plays a ma- jor role in general decision making and analyzing different stances. However, current writing sup- port is limited to feedback about spelling, gram- mar, or stylistic properties and there is currently no system that provides feedback about written argu- mentation. By integrating argumentation mining in writing environments, students will be able to inspect their texts for plausibility and to improve the quality of their argumentation.</p><p>An argument consists of several components. It includes a claim that is supported or attacked by at least one premise. The claim is the central compo- nent of an argument. It is a controversial statement that should not be accepted by the reader without additional support. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The premise underpins the validity of the claim. It is a reason given by an author for persuading readers of the claim. Argu- mentative relations model the discourse structure of arguments. They indicate which argument com- ponents are related and constitute the structure of argumentative discourse. For example, the argu- ment in the following paragraph contains four ar- gument components: one claim (in bold face) and three premises (underlined).</p><p>"(1) Museums and art galleries provide a better understanding about arts than Internet. (2) In most museums and art galleries, detailed descriptions in terms of the background, history and author are provided. (3) Seeing an artwork on- line is not the same as watching it with our own eyes, as (4) the picture online does not show the texture or three-di- mensional structure of the art, which is important to study."</p><p>In this example, the premises (2) and (3) sup- port the claim (1) whereas premise (4) is a support for premise <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. Thus, this example includes three argumentative support relations holding between the components (2,1), (3,1) and <ref type="bibr">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr">3)</ref> signaling that the source component is a justification of the target component. This illustrates two important proper- ties of argumentative discourse structures. First, argumentative relations are often implicit (not in- dicated by discourse markers; e.g. the relation holding between (2) and (1)). Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marcu and Echihabi (2002)</ref> found that only 26% of the ev- idence relations in the RST Discourse Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carlson et al., 2001</ref>) include discourse markers.</p><p>Second, in contrast to Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Mann and Thompson, 1987)</ref>, argumenta- tive relations also hold between non-adjacent sen- tences/clauses. For instance, in the corpus com- piled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stab and Gurevych (2014)</ref> only 37% of the premises appear adjacent to a claim. There- fore, existing approaches of discourse analysis, e.g. based on RST, do not meet the require- ments of argumentative discourse structure iden- tification, since they only consider discourse re- lations between adjacent sentences/clauses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Peldszus and Stede, 2013</ref>). In addition, there are no distinct argumentative relations included in com- mon approaches like RST or the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Prasad et al., 2008</ref>), since they are focused on identifying general discourse struc- tures (cp. section 2.2).</p><p>Most of the existing argumentation mining methods focus solely on the identification of ar- gument components. However, identifying argu- mentative discourse structures is an important task <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sergeant, 2013)</ref> in particular for providing feed- back about argumentation. First, argumentative discourse structures are essential for evaluating the quality of an argument, since it is not possible to examine how well a claim is justified without knowing which premises belong to it. Second, methods that recognize if a statement supports a given claim enable the collection of additional ev- idence from other sources. Third, the structure of argumentation is needed for recommending better arrangements of argument components and mean- ingful usage of discourse markers. Both foster ar- gument comprehension and recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Britt and Larson, 2003)</ref> and thus increase the argumentation quality. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently only one approach that aims at identi- fying argumentative discourse structures proposed by Mochales- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Palau and Moens (2009)</ref>. However, it relies on a manually created context-free gram- mar (CFG) and is tailored to the legal domain, which follows a standardized argumentation style. Therefore, it is likely that it will not achieve ac- ceptable accuracy when applied to more general texts in which discourse markers are missing or even misleadingly used (e.g. student texts).</p><p>In this work, we present a novel approach for identifying argumentative discourse structures which includes two consecutive steps. In the first step, we focus on the identification of argument components using a multiclass classification ap- proach. In the second step, we identify argumen- tative relations by classifying a pair of argument components as either support or non-support. In particular, the contributions of this work are the following: First, we introduce a novel approach for identifying argumentative discourse structures. Contrary to previous approaches, our approach is capable of identifying argumentative discourse structures even if discourse markers are missing or misleadingly used. Second, we present two novel feature sets for identifying argument components as well as argumentative relations. Third, we eval- uate several classifiers and feature groups for iden- tifying the best system for both tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Argumentation Mining</head><p>Previous research on argumentation mining spans several subtasks, including (1) the separation of argumentative from non-argumentative text units ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moens et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Florou et al., 2013)</ref>, (2) the classification of argument components or argumentation schemes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rooney et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mochales-Palau and Moens, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Teufel, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Feng and Hirst, 2011)</ref>, and (3) the identification of argumentation structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mochales-Palau and Moens, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wyner et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The separation of argumentative from non- argumentative text units is usually considered as a binary classification task and constitutes one of the first steps in an argumentation mining pipeline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moens et al. (2007)</ref> propose an approach for iden- tifying argumentative sentences in the Araucaria corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Reed et al., 2008)</ref>. The argument an- notations in Araucaria are based on a domain- independent argumentation theory proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Walton (1996)</ref>. In their experiments, they ob- tain the best accuracy (73.75%) using a combi- nation of word pairs, text statistics, verbs, and a list of keywords indicative for argumentative dis- course. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Florou et al. (2013)</ref> report a similar ap- proach. They classify text segments crawled with a focused crawler as either containing an argu- ment or not. Their approach is based on several discourse markers and features extracted from the tense and mood of verbs. They report an F1-score of 0.764 for their best performing system.</p><p>One of the first approaches focusing on the identification of argument components is Argu- mentative Zoning proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Teufel (1999)</ref>. The underlying assumption of this work is that argu-ment components extracted from a scientific arti- cle provide a good summary of its content. Each sentence is classified as one of seven rhetorical roles including claim, result or purpose. The ap- proach obtained an F1-score of 0.46 2 using struc- tural, lexical and syntactic features. <ref type="bibr">Rooney et al. (2013)</ref> also focus on the identification of ar- gument components but in contrast to the work of Teufel (1999) their scheme is not tailored to a par- ticular genre. In their experiments, they identify claims, premises and non-argumentative text units in the Araucaria corpus and report an overall ac- curacy of 65%. Feng and Hirst (2011) also use the Araucaria corpus for their experiments but fo- cus on the identification of argumentation schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Walton, 1996)</ref>, which are templates for forms of arguments (e.g. argument from example or argu- ment from consequence). Since their approach is based on features extracted from mutual informa- tion of claims and premises, it requires that the ar- gument components are reliably identified in ad- vance. In their experiments, they achieve an accu- racy between 62.9% and 97.9% depending on the particular scheme and the classification setup.</p><p>In contrast to all approaches mentioned above, the work presented in this paper focuses be- sides the separation of argumentative from non- argumentative text units and the classification of argument components on the extraction of the ar- gumentative discourse structure to identify which components of the argument belong together for achieving a more fine-grained and detailed analy- sis of argumentation. We are only aware of one ap- proach <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mochales-Palau and Moens, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wyner et al., 2010</ref>) that also focuses on the identifica- tion of argumentative discourse structures. How- ever, this approach is based on a manually created CFG that is tailored to documents from the legal domain, which follow a standardized argumenta- tion style. Therefore, it does not accommodate ill- formatted arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wyner et al., 2010)</ref>, which are likely in argumentative writing support. In ad- dition, the approach relies on discourse markers and is therefore not applicable for identifying im- plicit argumentative discourse structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Discourse Relations</head><p>Identifying argumentative discourse structures is closely related to discourse analysis. As illustrated in the initial example, the identification of argu- mentative relations postulates the identification of implicit as well as non-adjacent discourse rela- tions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marcu and Echihabi (2002)</ref> present the first approach focused on identifying implicit discourse relations. They exploit several discourse mark- ers (e.g. 'because' or 'but') for collecting large amounts of training data. For their experiments they remove the discourse markers and discover that word pair features are indicative for implicit discourse relations. Depending on the utilized cor- pus, they obtain accuracies between 64% and 75% for identifying a cause-explanation-evidence rela- tion (the most similar relation of their work com- pared to argumentative relations).</p><p>With the release of the PDTB, the identifica- tion of discourse relations gained a lot of interest in the research community. The PDTB includes implicit as well as explicit discourse relations of different types, and there are multiple approaches aiming at automatically identifying implicit rela- tions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pitler et al. (2009)</ref> experiment with polarity tags, verb classes, length of verb phrases, modal- ity, context and lexical features and found that word pairs with non-zero Information Gain yield best results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lin et al. (2009)</ref> show that beside lexical features, production rules collected from parse trees yield good results, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Louis et al. (2010)</ref> found that features based on named- entities do not perform as well as lexical features. However, current approaches to discourse analy- sis like the RST or the PDTB are designed to ana- lyze general discourse structures, and thus include a large set of generic discourse relations, whereas only a subset of those relations is relevant for ar- gumentative discourse analysis. For instance, the argumentation scheme proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peldszus and Stede (2013)</ref> includes three argumentative rela- tions (support, attack and counter-attack), whereas Stab and Gurevych (2014) propose a scheme in- cluding only two relations (support and attack). The difference between argumentative relations and those included in general tagsets like RST and PDTB is best illustrated by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Biran and Rambow (2011)</ref>, which is to the best of our knowl- edge the only work that focuses on the identifica- tion of argumentative relations. They argue that existing definitions of discourse relations are only relevant as a building block for identifying argu- mentative discourse and that existing approaches do not contain a single relation that corresponds to a distinct argumentative relation. Therefore, they consider a set of 12 discourse relations from the RST Discourse Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carlson et al., 2001</ref>) as a single argumentative relation in order to identify justifications for a given claim. They first extract a set of lexical indicators for each relation from the RST Discourse Treebank and create a word pair resource using the English Wikipedia. In their experiments, they use the extracted word pairs as features and obtain an F1-score of up to 0.51 using two different corpora. Although the approach con- siders non-adjacent relations, it is limited to the identification of relations between premises and claims and requires that claims are known in ad- vance. In addition, the combination of several general relations to a single argumentative relation might lead to consistency problems and to noisy corpora (e.g. not each instance of a contrast rela- tion is relevant for argumentative discourse).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>For our experiments, we use a corpus of per- suasive essays compiled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stab and Gurevych (2014)</ref>. This corpus contains annotations of ar- gument components at the clause-level as well as argumentative relations. In particular, it in- cludes annotations of major claims, claims and premises, which are connected with argumentative support and attack relations. Argumentative rela- tions are directed (there is a specified source and target component of each relation) and can hold between a premise and another premise, a premise and a (major-) claim, or a claim and a major claim. Except for the last one, an argumentative relation does not cross paragraph boundaries.</p><p>Three raters annotated the corpus with an inter- annotator agreement of α U = 0.72 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Krippendorff, 2004</ref>) for argument components and α = 0.81 for argumentative relations. In total, the corpus com- prises 90 essays including 1,673 sentences. Since it only contains a low number of attack relations, we focus in this work solely on the identification of argument components and argumentative sup- port relations. However, the proposed approach can also be applied to identify attack relations in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Identifying Argument Components</head><p>We consider the identification of argument com- ponents as a multiclass classification task. Each clause in the corpus is either classified as major claim, claim, premise or non-argumentative. So this task includes besides the classification of ar- gument components also the separation of argu- mentative and non-argumentative text units. We label each sentence that does not contain an ar- gument component as class 'none'. Since many argument components cover an entire sentence (30%), this is not an exclusive feature of this class. In total, the corpus contains 1,879 instances. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the class distribution among the instances. The corpus includes 90 major claims (each essay contains exactly one), 429 claims and 1,033 premises. This proportion between claims and premises is common in argumentation since claims are usually supported by several premises for establishing a stable standpoint.  For our experiments, we randomly split the data into a 80% training set and a 20% test set with the same class distribution and determine the best performing system using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set only. In our experiments, we use several classifiers (see section 4.2) from the Weka data mining software ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hall et al., 2009</ref>). For preprocessing the corpus, we use the Stanford POS-Tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>) and Parser (  included in the DKPro Framework ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gurevych et al., 2007)</ref>. After these steps, we use the DKPro-TC text classification framework ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Daxenberger et al., 2014</ref>) for extract- ing the features described in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Features</head><p>Structural features: We define structural features based on token statistics, the location and punc- tuations of the argument component and its cov- ering sentence. Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Biran and Rambow (2011)</ref> found that premises are longer on the average than other sentences, we add the number of tokens of the argument component and its covering sentence to our feature set. In addition, we define the num- ber of tokens preceding and following an argument component in the covering sentence, the token ra- tio between covering sentence and argument com- ponent, and a Boolean feature that indicates if the argument component covers all tokens of its cov- ering sentence as token statistics features.</p><p>For exploiting the structural properties of per- suasive essays, we define a set of location-based features. First, we define four Boolean features that indicate if the argument component is present in the introduction or conclusion of an essay and if it is present in the first or the last sentence of a paragraph. Second, we add the position of the covering sentence in the essay as a numeric fea- ture. Since major claims are always present in the introduction or conclusion of an essay and para- graphs frequently begin or conclude with a claim, we expect that these features are good indicators for classifying (major-) claims.</p><p>Further, we define structural features based on the punctuation: the number of punctuation marks of the covering sentence and the argument compo- nent, the punctuation marks preceding and follow- ing an argument component in its covering sen- tence and a Boolean feature that indicates if the sentence closes with a question mark.</p><p>Lexical features: We define n-grams, verbs, adverbs and modals as lexical features. We con- sider all n-grams of length 1-3 as a Boolean feature and extract them from the argument component in- cluding preceding tokens in the sentence that are not covered by another argument component. So, the n-gram features include discourse markers that indicate certain argument components but which are not included in the actual annotation of argu- ment components.</p><p>Verbs and adverbs play an important role for identifying argument components. For instance, certain verbs like 'believe', 'think' or 'agree' of- ten signal stance expressions which indicate the presence of a major claim and adverbs like 'also', 'often' or 'really' emphasize the importance of a premise. We model both verbs and adverbs as Boolean features.</p><p>Modal verbs like 'should' and 'could' are fre- quently used in argumentative discourse to signal the degree of certainty when expressing a claim. We use the POS tags generated during preprocess- ing to identify modals and define a Boolean fea- ture which indicates if an argument component contains a modal verb.</p><p>Syntactic features: To capture syntactic prop- erties of argument components, we define features extracted from parse trees. We adopt two features proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mochales-Palau and Moens, 2009)</ref>: the number of sub-clauses included in the covering sentence and the depth of the parse tree. In addi- tion, we extract production rules from the parse tree as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lin et al. (2009)</ref> to capture syntactic characteristics of an argument compo- nent. The production rules are collected for each function tag (e.g. VP, NN, S, etc.) in the sub- tree of an argument component. The feature set includes e.g. rules like V P → V BG, N P or P P → IN, N P . We model each production rule as a Boolean feature and set it to true if it appears in the subtree of an argument component.</p><p>Since premises often refer to previous events and claims are usually in present tense, we capture the tense of the main verb of an argument compo- nent as proposed by Mochales-Palau and Moens (2009) and define a feature that indicates if an ar- gument component is in the past or present tense.</p><p>Indicators: Discourse markers often indicate the components of an argument. For example, claims are frequently introduced with 'therefore', 'thus' or 'consequently', whereas premises con- tain markers like 'because', 'reason' or 'further- more'. We collected a list of discourse markers from the Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 Annotation Manual ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Prasad et al., 2007)</ref> and removed markers that do not indicate argumentative discourse (e.g. markers which indicate temporal discourse). In to- tal, we collected 55 discourse markers and model each as a Boolean feature set to true if the particu- lar marker precedes the argumentative component.</p><p>In addition, we define five Boolean features which denote a reference to the first person in the covering sentence of an argument component: 'I', 'me', 'my', 'mine', and 'myself'. An additional Boolean feature indicates if one of them is present in the covering sentence. We expect that those fea- tures are good indicators of the major claim, since it is often introduced with expressions referring to the personal stance of the author.</p><p>Contextual features: The context plays a ma- jor role for identifying argument components. For instance, a premise can only be classified as such, if there is a corresponding claim. Therefore, we define the following features each extracted from the sentence preceding and following the covering sentence of an argument component: the number of punctuations, the number of tokens, the number of sub-clauses and a Boolean feature indicating the presence of modal verbs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results and Analysis</head><p>For identifying the best performing system, we conducted several experiments on the training set using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. We de- termine the evaluation scores by accumulating the confusion matrices of each fold into one confusion matrix, since it is the less biased method for evalu- ating cross-validation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Forman and Scholz, 2010)</ref>. In a comparison of several classifiers (Sup- port Vector Machine, Na¨ıveNa¨ıve Bayes, C4.5 Decision Tree and Random Forest), we found that each of the classifiers significantly outperforms a majority baseline <ref type="bibr">(McNemar Test (McNemar, 1947</ref>) with p = 0.05) and that a Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieves the best results using 100 top fea- tures ranked by Information Gain. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> It achieves an accuracy of 77.3% on the test set and outperforms the majority baseline with respect to overall accu- racy as well as F1-score <ref type="table">(table 2)</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Results of an SVM for argument com- ponent classification on the test set compared to a majority baseline and human performance.</p><p>The upper bound for this task constitutes the human performance which we determine by com- paring each annotator to the gold standard. Since the boundaries of an argument component in the gold standard can differ from the boundaries iden- tified by a human annotator (the annotation task included the identification of argument component boundaries), we label each argument component of the gold standard with the class of the maximum overlapping annotation of a human annotator for determining the human performance. We obtain a challenging upper bound of 87.7% (accuracy) by averaging the scores of all three annotators on the test set <ref type="table">(table 2)</ref>. So, our system achieves 88.1% of human performance (accuracy).</p><p>Feature influence: In subsequent experiments, we evaluate each of the defined feature groups on the entire data set using 10-fold cross-validation to find out which features perform best for identify- ing argument components. As assumed, structural features perform well for distinguishing claims and premises in persuasive essays. They also yield high results for separating argumentative from non-argumentative text units <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(table 3)</ref>.  Interestingly, the defined indicators are not useful for separating argumentative from non- argumentative text units though they are helpful for classifying argument components. A reason for this could be that not each occurrence of an indicator distinctly signals argument components, since their sense is often ambiguous <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Prasad et al., 2008)</ref>. For example 'since' indicates temporal properties as well as justifications, whereas 'be- cause' also indicates causal links. Syntactic fea- tures also contribute to the identification of argu- ment components. They achieve an F1-score of 0.292 for claims and 0.654 for premises and also contribute to the separation of argumentative from non-argumentative text units. Contextual features do not perform well. However, they increase the accuracy by 0.7% in combination with other fea- tures. Nevertheless, this difference is not signifi- cant (p = 0.05).</p><p>Error analysis: The system performs well for separating argumentative and non-argumentative text units as well as for identifying premises. However, the identification of claims and major claims yields lower performance. The confusion matrix (table 4) reveals that the most common er- ror is between claims and premises. In total, 193 claims are incorrectly classified as premise. In a manual assessment, we observed that many of these errors occur if the claim is present in the first paragraph sentence and exhibits preceding indica- tors like 'first(ly)' or 'second(ly)' which are also frequently used to enumerate premises. In these cases, the author introduces the claim of the argu- ment as support for the major claim and thus its characteristic is similar to a premise. To prevent this type of error, it might help to define features representing the location of indicators or to disam- biguate the function of indicators.  We also observed, that some of the misclassified claims cover an entire sentence and don't include indicators. For example, it is even difficult for hu- mans to classify the sentences 'Competition helps in improvement and evolution' as a claim without knowing the intention of the author. For prevent- ing these errors, it might help to include more so- phisticated contextual features.</p></div>

Since this re- sults in a heavily skewed class distribution, we ex- tract all possible combinations of argument com- ponents from each paragraph of an essay. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> So, we omit argumentative relations between claims and major claims which are the only relations in the corpus that cross paragraph boundaries, but ob- tain a better distribution between true (support) and false (non-support) instances. In total, we ob- tain 6,330 pairs, of which 15.6% are support and 84.4% are non-support relations <ref type="table">(table 5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support</head><p>Non-support 989 (15.6%) 5341 (84.4%) <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Class distribution of argument component pairs Equivalent to the identification of argument components, we randomly split the data in a 80% training and a 20% test set and determine the best performing system using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. We use the same preprocessing pipeline as described in section 4 and DKPro-TC for extracting the features described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Features</head><p>Structural features: We define structural fea- tures for each pair based on the source and tar- get components, and on the mutual information of both. Three numeric features are based on token statistics. Two features represent the number of tokens of the source and target components and the third one represents the absolute difference in the number of tokens. Three additional numeric features count the number of punctuation marks of the source and target components as well as the absolute difference between both. We extract both types of features solely from the clause an- notated as argument component and do not con- sider the covering sentence. In addition, we de- fine nine structural features based on the position of both argument components: two of them repre- sent the position of the covering sentences in the essay, four Boolean features indicate if the argu- ment components are present in the first or last sentence of a paragraph, one Boolean feature for representing if the target component occurs before the source component, the sentence distance be- tween the covering sentences, and a Boolean fea- ture which indicates if both argument components are in the same sentence.</p><p>Lexical features: We define lexical features based on word pairs, first words and modals. It has been shown in previous work that word pairs are effective for identifying implicit discourse re- lations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marcu and Echihabi, 2002</ref>). We define each pair of words between the source and target components as a Boolean feature and investigate word pairs containing stop words as well as stop word filtered word pairs.</p><p>In addition, we adopt the first word features proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pitler et al. (2009)</ref>. We extract the first word either from the argument component or from non-annotated tokens preceding the ar- gument component in the covering sentence if present. So, the first word of an argument com- ponent is either the first word of the sentence con- taining the argument component, the first word following a preceding argument component in the same sentence or the first word of the actual ar- gument component if it commences the sentence or directly follows another argument component.</p><p>So, we ensure that the first word of an argument component includes important discourse markers which are not included in the annotation. We de- fine each first word of the source and target com- ponents as a Boolean feature and also add the pairs of first words to our feature set.</p><p>Further, we define a Boolean feature for the source as well as for the target component that indicates if they contain a modal verb and a nu- merical feature that counts the number of common terms of the two argument components.</p><p>Syntactic features: For capturing syntactic properties, we extract production rules from the source and target components. Equivalent to the features extracted for the argument component classification (section 4.1), we model each rule as a Boolean feature which is true if the correspond- ing argument component includes the rule.</p><p>Indicators: We use the same list of discourse markers introduced above (section 4.1) as indi- cator features. For each indicator we define a Boolean feature for the source as well as for the target component of the pair and set it to true if it is present in the argument component or in its preceding tokens.</p><p>Predicted type: The argumentative type (major claim, claim or premise) of the source and target components is a strong indicator for identifying ar- gumentative relations. For example, there are no argumentative relations from claims to premises. Thus, if the type of the argument component is reliably identified many potential pairs can be ex- cluded. Therefore, we define two features that rep- resent the argumentative type of the source and tar- get components identified in the first experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results and Analysis</head><p>The comparison of several classifiers reveals that an SVM achieves the best results. In our exper- iments, all classifiers except the C4.5 Decision Tree significantly outperform a majority baseline which classifies all pairs as non-support (p = 0.05). We also conducted several experiments using word pair features only and found in con- trast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pitler et al. (2009)</ref> that limiting the num- ber of word pairs decreases the performance. In particular, we compared the top 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000 word pairs ranked by Informa- tion Gain, non-zero Information Gain word pairs and non-filtered word pairs. The results show that non-filtered word pairs perform best (macro F1-score of 0.68). Our experiments also reveal that filtering stop words containing word pairs de- creases the macro F1-score to 0.60. We obtain the best results using an SVM without any feature se- lection method. Due to the class imbalance, the SVM only slightly outperforms the accuracy of a majority baseline on the test set (table 6). How- ever, the macro F1-score is more appropriate for evaluating the performance if the data is imbal- anced since it assigns equal weight to the classes and not to the instances. The SVM achieves a macro F1-score of 0.722 and also outperforms the baseline with respect to the majority class.  We determined the upper bound constituted by the human performance by comparing the annota- tions of all three annotators to the gold standard. The scores in table 6 are the average scores of all three annotators. Our system achieves 90.5% of human performance (accuracy).</p><p>Feature influence: A comparison of the de- fined feature groups using 10-fold cross-validation on the entire data set shows that lexical features perform best. They achieve an F1-score of 0.427 for support and 0.911 for non-support pairs (ta- ble 7). The syntactic features also perform well followed by the indicators. It turned out that struc- tural features are not effective for identifying argu- mentative relations though they are the most effec- tive features for identifying argument components (cp. section 4.2). However, when omitted from the entire feature set the performance significantly decreases by 0.018 macro F1-score (p = 0.05).</p><p>Interestingly, the predicted types from our first experiment are not effective at all. Although the argumentative type of the target component ex- hibits the highest Information Gain in each fold compared to all other features, the predicted type does not yield a significant difference when com- bined with all other features (p = 0.05). It only improves the macro F1-score by 0.001 when in-cluded in the entire feature set.   Error analysis: For identifying frequent er- ror patterns, we manually investigated the mis- takes of the classifier. Although our system identi- fies 97.5% of the non-support pairs from claim to premise correctly, there are still some false posi- tives that could be prevented if the argument com- ponents had been classified more accurately. For instance, there are 18 non-support relations from claim to another claim, 32 from claim to premise, 5 from major claim to premise and 4 from major claim to claim among the false positives. How- ever, the larger amount of errors is due to not iden- tified support relations (false negatives). We found that some errors might be related to missing con- textual information and unresolved coreferences. For instance, it might help to replace 'It' with 'Ex- ercising' for classifying the pair 'It helps relieve tension and stress' → 'Exercising improves self- esteem and confidence' as support relation or to in- clude contextual information for the premise 'This can have detrimental effects on health' support- ing the claim 'There are some serious problems springing from modern technology'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>In our experiments, we have investigated the clas- sification of argument components as well as the identification of argumentative relations for recog- nizing argumentative discourse structures in per- suasive essays. Both tasks are closely related and we assume that sharing mutual information be- tween both tasks might be a promising direction for future research. On the one hand, knowing the type of argument components is a strong indica- tor for identifying argumentative relations and on the other hand, it is likely that information about the argumentative structure facilitates the identi- fication of argument components. However, our experiments revealed that the current accuracy for identifying argument components is not sufficient for increasing the performance of argumentative relation identification. Nevertheless, we obtain almost human performance when including the types of argument components of the gold stan- dard (macro F1-score &gt;0.85) in our argument re- lation identification experiment and when includ- ing the number of incoming and outgoing support relations for each argument component in our first experiment (macro F1-score &gt;0.9). Therefore, it can be assumed, that if the identification of argu- ment components can be improved, the identifica- tion of argumentative relations will achieve better results and vice versa.</p><p>The results also show that the distinction be- tween claims and premises is the major challenge for identifying argument components. It turned out that structural features are the most effective ones for this task. However, some of those features are unique to persuasive essays, and it is an open question if there are general structural properties of arguments which can be exploited for separat- ing claims from premises.</p><p>Our experiments show that discourse markers yield only low accuracies. Using only our defined indicator features, we obtain an F1-score of 0.265 for identifying claims, whereas Mochales-Palau and Moens (2009) achieve 0.673 for the same task in legal documents using a CFG. This confirms our initial assumption that approaches relying on dis- course markers are not applicable for identifying argumentative discourse structures in documents which do not follow a standardized form. In ad- dition, it shows that discourse markers are either frequently missing or misleadingly used in student texts and that there is a need for argumentative writing support systems that assist students in em- ploying discourse markers correctly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We presented a novel approach for identifying ar- gumentative discourse structures in persuasive es- says. Previous approaches on argument recog- nition suffer from several limitations: Existing approaches focus either solely on the identifica- tion of argument components or rely on manu- ally created rules which are not able to identify implicit argumentative discourse structures. Our approach is the first step towards computational argument analysis in the educational domain and enables the identification of implicit argumenta- tive discourse structures. The presented approach achieves 88.1% of human performance for identi-fying argument components and 90.5% for identi- fying argumentative relations.</p><p>For future work, we plan to extend our stud- ies to larger corpora, to integrate our classifiers in writing environments, and to investigate their ef- fectiveness for supporting students.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Feature</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
