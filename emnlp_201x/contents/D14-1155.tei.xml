				<p>In this paper, we explore the use of keyboard strokes as a means to access the real-time writing process of online authors, analogously to prosody in speech analysis, in the context of deception detection. We show that differences in keystroke patterns like editing maneuvers and duration of pauses can help distinguish between truthful and deceptive writing. Empirical results show that incorporating keystroke-based features lead to improved performance in deception detection in two different domains: online reviews and essays.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Due to the practical importance of detecting deceit, in- terest in it is ancient, appearing in papyrus dated back to <ref type="bibr">900 B.C. (Trovillo, 1939)</ref>. In more recent years, sev- eral studies have shown that the deceiver often exhibits behavior that belies the content of communication, thus providing cues of deception to an observer. These in- clude linguistic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Newman et al. (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hancock et al. (2004)</ref>) as well as paralinguistic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ekman et al. (1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">DePaulo et al. (2003)</ref>) cues. Recognizing deception, however, remains a hard task for humans, who perform only marginally better than chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bond and DePaulo, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ott et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>Recent studies suggest that computers can be sur- prisingly effective in this task, albeit in limited domains such as product reviews. Prior research has employed lexico-syntactic patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ott et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Feng et al., 2012)</ref> as well as online user behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fei et al., 2013;</ref>. In this paper, we study the effect of keystroke patterns for deception detection in digital communications, which might be helpful in un- derstanding the psychology of deception and help to- ward trustful online communities. This allows us to in- vestigate differences in the writing and revisional pro- cesses of truthful and fake writers. Our work thus shares intuition with HCI research linking keystroke analysis to cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Vizer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Epp et al., 2011</ref>) and psychology research connecting cog- nitive differences to deception <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ekman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vrij et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Recent research has shown that lying generally im- poses a cognitive burden (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">McCornack (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vrij et al. (2006)</ref>) which increases in real-time scenar- ios <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ekman, 2003)</ref>. Cognitive burden has been known to produce differences in keytroke features <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Vizer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Epp et al., 2011</ref>). Previous research has not, however, directly investigated any quantitative connec- tion between keystroke patterns and deceptive writing.</p><p>In this paper, we posit that cognitive burdens in deception may lead to measurable characteristics in keystroke patterns. Our contributions are as follows:</p><p>(1) introducing keystroke logs as an extended linguis- tic signal capturing the real-time writing process (anal- ogous to prosody in speech analysis) by measuring the writing rate, pauses and revision rate. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> showing their empirical value in deception detection, (3) provid- ing novel domain-specific insights into deceptive writ- ing, and (4) releasing a new corpus of deception writ- ings in new domains. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Prior research has focused mainly on using keystroke traits as a behvioral biometric. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Forsen et al. (1977)</ref> first demonstrated that users can be distinguished by the way they type their names. Subsequent work showed that typing patterns are unique to individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Leggett and Williams, 1988)</ref>, and can be used for authentica- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cho et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bergadano et al., 2002</ref>) and in- trusion detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Killourhy and Maxion, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Keystroke pauses have been linked to linguistic pat- terns in discourse (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Matsuhashi (1981)</ref>, van <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hell et al. (2008)</ref>) and regarded as indications of cognitive bur- den (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Johansson (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zulkifli (2013)</ref>). In this pa- per, we present the first empirical study that quantita- tively measures the deception cues in real-time writing process as manifested in keystroke logs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Collection</head><p>As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gokhman et al. (2012)</ref>, the crowd- sourcing approach to soliciting deceptive content sim- ulates the real world of online deceptive content cre- ators. We collected the data via Amazon Mechanical Turk. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Turkers were led to a separate website where keylogging was enabled, and asked to write truthful and deceptive texts (≥ 100 words) on one of three top-  ics: restaurant review, gay marriage and gun control. Each Turker was required to agree to their typing be- ing logged. Since copy/paste operations defeat our pur- pose of studying keystrokes in the typing process, they were disabled. This restriction also acts as a hindrance to plagiarism. All texts were reviewed manually, and those not meeting the requirements (due to the being too short, plagiarized content, etc.) were disregarded. Writing task design: The task was designed such that each Turker wrote a pair of texts, one truthful and one deceptive, on the same topic. For restaurant re- views, they were asked to write a truthful review of a restaurant they liked, and a deceptive review of a restaurant they have never been to or did not like. For the other two topics -'gun control' and 'gay marriage' -we asked their opinion: support, neutral, or against. Then, they were asked to write a truthful and a decep- tive essay articulating, respectively, their actual opin- ion and its opposite. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The tasks further were divided into two 'flows': writing the truthful text before the de- ceptive one, and vice versa. Each Turker was assigned only one flow, and was not allowed to participate in the other. After completing this, each Turker was asked to copy their own typing, i.e., re-type the two texts. Finally, in order to get an idea of the cognitive bur- den associated with truthful and deceptive writing, we asked the Turkers which task was easier for them. Of the 196 participants, 152 answered "truthful", 40 an- swered "deceptive" and only 4 opted for "not sure". What are logged: We deployed a keylogger to cap- ture the mouse and keyboard events in the "text area". The events KeyUp, KeyDown and MouseUp, along with the keycode and timestamp were logged. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For the three topics restaurant review, gay marriage and gun control we obtained 1000, 800 and 800 texts, respectively.</p><p>In the remainder of this paper, k dn and k up denote the KeyDown and KeyUp events for a key k. For any <ref type="bibr">3</ref> To prevent a change in opinion depending on task avail- ability, Turkers were redirected to other tasks if their opinion was neutral, or if we had enough essays of their opinion. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Printable (e.g., alphanumeric characters) as well as non- printable keystrokes like (e.g., 'Backspace'), are logged.   event e, its timespan, i.e., the time interval between the beginning and end of e, is denoted by δ(e).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Feature Design</head><p>Keystroke logging enables the study of two types of in- formation that go beyond conventional linguistic anal- ysis. First, it captures editing processes (e.g., deletions, insertions made by changing cursor position, etc.). Second, it reveals the temporal aspect of text generation (e.g., duration, latency). Our exploration of these fea- tures and their application in deception detection is mo- tivated by the similarities between text and speech gen- eration. Editing patterns, for instance, can be viewed as attempts to veil incoherence in deceptive writing and temporal patterns like latency or pause can be treated as analogous to disfluency.</p><p>Different people, of course, have varying typing skills, and some may type faster than others. In or- der to control for this variation, we normalize all event timespans δ(e) with respect to the corresponding event timespan in the copy task:</p><p>δ(e) = δ(e)/δ(e copy ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Editing Patterns</head><p>In this work, we treat keys that are used only for edit- ing as different from others. Text editing is done by employing a small subset of available keys: deletion keys ('Backspace' and 'Delete'), arrow keys (←, →, ↑ and ↓) and by using the mouse for text selection (i.e., the 'MouseUp' event). The three types of editing keystrokes are collectively denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E 3 = |DEL| , |MSELECT| , |ARROW|| where</formula><p>(i) |DEL| = number of deletion keystrokes (ii) |MSELECT| = number of 'MouseUp' events, and (iii) |ARROW| = number of arrow keystrokes The editing differences between truthful and deceptive writing across all three topics are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Temporal Aspects</head><p>Each event is logged with a keycode and a timestamp. In order to study the temporal aspects of digital writ- ing, we calculate the timespan of different linguistic  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: SVM classifier performance for truthful vs. de- ceptive writing. Statistically significant improvements over the baseline are marked * (p &lt; 0.05) and § (p &lt; 0.1). E3 = |DEL| , |MSELECT| , |ARROW|| denotes the editing keystrokes, and T6 is the set of normalized timespans of documents, words (plus preceding keystroke), all keystrokes, spaces, non-whitespace keystrokes and inter-word intervals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T6 = { δ(D), δ(k), δ(SP), δ(¬SP), δ(¬W), δ(kprv + W)}</formula><p>units such as words, sentences and even entire docu- ments. Further, we separately inspect the timespans of different parts of speech, function words and con- tent words. In addition to event timespans, intervals between successive events (e.g., inter-word and inter- sentence pauses) and pauses preceding or succeeding and event (e.g., time interval before and after a function word) are measured as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Results</head><p>This section describes our experimental setup and presents insights based on the obtained results. All classification experiments use 5-fold cross validation with 80/20 division for training and testing. In addition to experimenting on the entire dataset, we also sepa- rately analyze the texts written first (of the two texts in each 'flow'). This additional step is taken in order to eliminate the possibility of a text being primed by its preceding text.</p><p>Deception cues in keystroke patterns: To empiri- cally check whether keystroke features can help distin- guish between truthful and deceptive writing, we de- sign binary SVM classifiers. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Unigrams with tf-idf encoding is used as the baseline. The average baseline accuracy across all topics is 82.58% when considering both texts of a flow, and 83.62% when considering only the first text of each flow. The better performance in the latter possibly indicates that the second text of a flow exhibits some amount of lexical priming with the first. The high accuracy of the baseline is not surprising. Previous work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ott et al. (2011)</ref> reported similar per- <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We use the LIBLINEAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fan et al., 2008)</ref>  <ref type="table">our  best  when  one  if  get  quality  other  when  well  even  get  were  your  on  service  it's  fresh  by  been  quality  not  me  their  dishes  my  has  not  the  one  also  with  i've  had  go  friendly  on  hat  we  great  they  of  had  an  we  other  is  our  friendly  very  at  are  has  love  which  really  at  service  from  but  wait  great  dishes  favorite  an  really  or  very  go  you  re  about  is  but  would  will  which  been  just  here   Table 2</ref>: <ref type="bibr">Top 20</ref> words in restaurant reviews with greatest timespan difference between deceptive and truthful writing.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">package. δ(W) δ(kprv + W) D &gt; T T &gt; D D &gt; T T &gt; D</formula><p>formance of unigram models. The focus of our work is to explore the completely new feature space of ty- pographic patterns in deception detection. We draw motivation from parallels between the text generation and speech generation processes. Prosodic concepts such as speed, disfluency and coherence can be real- ized in typographic behavior by analyzing timestamp of keystrokes, pauses and editing patterns, respectively. Based on the differences in the temporal aspects of keystrokes, we extract six timespan features to improve this baseline. This set, denoted by T 6 , comprises of (i) δ(D) = timespan of entire document (ii) δ(k prv +W) = average timespan of word plus pre- ceding keystroke (iii) δ(k) = average keystroke timespan (iv) δ(SP) = average timespan of spaces (v) δ(¬SP) = average timespan of non whitesp- ace keystrokes (vi) δ(¬W) = average interval between words. The improvements attained by adding T 6 to the base- line are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Adding the edit patterns (E 3 ) (cf. § 4.1) further improves the performance (with the exception of two cases) by 0.7-3.5%.</p><p>Writing speed, pauses and revisions: To study the temporal aspect of language units across all topics, we first consider all texts, and then restrict to only the first of each 'flow'. The timespan measurements are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, showing the average duration of typing documents, sentences, words and individual keystrokes. The timespans are measured as the inter- val between the first and the last keystrokes. The sen- tence timespan, for instance, does not include the gap between a sentence end and the first keystroke marking the beginning of the next.</p><p>The sentence timespans for "gay marriage" and "gun control" are lower in truthful writing, even though the document timespans are higher. This difference implies that the writer is spending a longer period of time to think before commencing the next sentence, but once started, the actual typing proceeds rapidly. Apart from restaurant reviews, truthful writers have typed slower. This may be due to exercising better care while expressing their honest opinion.</p><p>For restaurant reviews, the document, sentence and word timespans are significantly higher in deceptive writing. This, however, is not the case for documents and words in the other two topics. We conjecture that this is because deception is harder to write for prod- uct reviews, due to their dependence on factual details. Gun control and gay marriage, on the other hand, are topics well discussed in media, and it is possible that the writers are aware of the arguments that go against their personal belief. The frequency of revisional oc- currences (i.e., keys used for editing) shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, too, supports the thought that writing fake reviews may be harder than adopting a fake stance on well-known issues. Deceptive reviews exhibit a higher number of revisions than truthful ones, but essays show the oppo- site trend. Our findings align with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ott et al., 2011</ref>) which showed that deception cues are do- main dependent. Writing speed variations over word categories: Next, we investigate whether there is any quantitative difference in the writing rate over different words with respect to the deceptive and truthful intent of the author. In an attempt to understand this, we analyze words which show the highest timespan difference between deceptive and truthful writings. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> presents words in the restaurant review topic for which deceptive writers took a lot longer than truthful writers, and vice versa. Some word cat- egories exhibit common trends across all three top- ics. Highly subjective words, for instance (e.g., "love", "best", "great") are words over which truthful writers spent more time.</p><p>Deceptive and truthful texts differ in the typing rate of first-and second-person pronouns. Deceptive re- views reveal more time spent in using 2 nd -person pro- nouns, as shown by "you" and "your". This finding throws some light on how people perceive text cues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Toma and Hancock (2012)</ref> showed that readers per- form poorly at deception detection because they rely on unrelated text cues such as 2 nd -person pronouns. Our analysis indicates that people associate the use of 2 nd - person pronouns more with deception not only while reading, but while writing as well.</p><p>Deceptive reviews also exhibit longer time spans for 1 st -person pronouns (e.g., "we", "me"), which have been known to be useful in deception detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Newman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ott et al., 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Newman et al. (2003)</ref> attributed the less frequent usage of 1 st -person pronouns to psychological distancing. The longer time taken by deceptive writers in our data is a possible sign of increased cognitive burden when the writer is unable to maintain the psychological distance. Deceptive re- viewers also paused a lot more around relative clauses, e.g., "if", "when", and "which".</p><p>In essays, however, the difference in timespans of 1 st -person and 2 nd -person pronouns as well as the timespan difference in relative clauses were insignifi- cant (&lt; 50 ms).</p><p>A broader picture of the temporal difference in using different types of words is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, which shows deceptive reviewers spending less time on ad- verbs as compared to truthful writers, but more time on nouns, verbs, adjectives, function words and content words. They also exhibited significantly longer pauses before nouns, verbs and function words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we investigated the use of typographic style in deception detection and presented distinct tem- poral and revisional aspects of keystroke patterns that improve the characterization of deceptive writing. Our study provides novel empirically supported insights into the writing and editing processes of truthful and deceptive writers. It also presents the first application of keylogger data used to distinguish between true and fake texts, and opens up a new range of questions to better understand what affects these different keystroke patterns and what they exhibit. It also suggests new possibilities for making use of keystroke information as an extended linguistic signal to accompany writings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Number of keystrokes corresponding to the three types of edit patterns (E3): (a) use of arrow keys, (b) deletion (Delete and Backspace) and (c) text selection with mouse.</figDesc></figure>
