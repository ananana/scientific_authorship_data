				<p>Vulgar words are employed in language use for several different functions, ranging from expressing aggression to signaling group identity or the informality of the communication. This versatility of usage of a restricted set of words is challenging for downstream applications and has yet to be studied quantitatively or using natural language processing techniques. We introduce a novel data set of 7,800 tweets from users with known demographic traits where all instances of vulgar words are annotated with one of the six categories of vulgar word use. Using this data set, we present the first analysis of the pragmatic aspects of vulgarity and how they relate to social factors. We build a model able to predict the category of a vulgar word based on the immediate context it appears in with 67.4 macro F1 across six classes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of modeling the type of vulgar word use in context by using this information to achieve state-of-the-art performance in hate speech detection on a benchmark data set.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Vulgarity is a common element of conversa- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jay, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mehl et al., 2007)</ref> and is used even more frequently in social networks such as Twit- ter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wang et al., 2014</ref>). Understanding the moti- vation behind the choice to be vulgar and the way in which vulgarity is manifested in naturally oc- curring environments is of interdisciplinary inter- est. Pragmatic functions that dictate patterns of vulgarity usages may interact with speaker cul- tural background and demographics. This makes them appealing-and challenging-to model in NLP applications</p><p>Yet, to date, there has been no empirical study on the type of vulgar word usage. Research in linguistics and psychology has identified several  types of usage for vulgar words <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andersson and Trudgill, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pinker, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang, 2013</ref>). These range from use as an intensifier for an opinion or emotion, to offend others, or simply as a way of speaking or to signal the level of (in)formality in a conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pinker, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows exam- ple tweets with the six general functions of vulgar word usage.</p><p>We notice that in one of the examples, the vul- gar word ass is used to verbally abuse another user, while the same word can also be employed to em- phasize a feeling ('good ass day') or to express an emotion ('pain in the ass'). Hence, explicitly mod- eling vulgar words use is expected to positively impact the performance of practical tasks such as hate speech detection or the way in which profan- ity filtering is performed.</p><p>The goal of our study is to present a comprehen- sive and multi-faceted analysis of the types of vul- gar word usage. To this end, this paper presents: 1. The first data set of written utterances that con- tain vulgar words, where each vulgar word is labeled for one of six functions of use 1 2. A quantitative analysis of vulgar word usage across different user demographic traits 3. A machine learning approach to predicting one of six types of vulgar word usage from context 4. Experiments demonstrating that modeling the type of vulgar word usage in context can im-prove predictive performance of the hate speech prediction task on a benchmark data set Our novel data set contains 7,800 tweets with 8,524 vulgar word labels annotated for one of six functions by seven annotators. We find that the way in which vulgarity is used interacts with user demographic variables such as age or political ide- ology. We then build a model for predicting the usage type of each vulgar word in the tweet using the tweet context. Finally, we explicitly model the vulgar word usage type in the task of hate speech detection to discriminate between hate speech and tweets including profanity, demonstrating an im- provement in predictive accuracy of 3.7 F1. This demonstrates that using insights into vulgar word usage developed in linguistics and psychology, we can achieve quantitative improvements on down- stream NLP applications and inform the way mod- els are built and tailored to the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Vulgar language and its uses and pragmatic func- tions have been studied in several linguistic and psychological studies and the phenomenon has many names. In this paper, we will use vulgarity, profanity, and swear/curse words interchangeably.</p><p>Vulgar words were found to be very versatile, with a vulgar word being able to perform dif- ferent interpersonal functions according to differ- ent contexts. Four types of usage are identified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andersson and Trudgill (1990)</ref>, including abu- sive (intended to harm the hearer), expletive (used to express emotions; not directed towards oth- ers), humorous (looks like abusive swearing, but has the opposite function) and auxiliary (swear- ing as a way of speaking, often or always non- emphatic). The five functions of swear words sug- gested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pinker (2007)</ref> are: dysphemistic (con- veying negative sentiment), idiomatic (signaling informality or simply used as a manner of speak- ing), abusive (intending to offend or harm), em- phatic (intending to stress a claim or intensify emotive content) and cathartic (communicating pain). Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang (2013)</ref> identifies four prag- matic roles for profanity with a considerable de- gree of overlap with Pinker: emoting, emphasiz- ing, aggressing, and group identity signaling.</p><p>For the scope of this study, we aim to cover all the functions identified by past research that can be identified from text with restricted content and context such as tweets. Thus, we dropped the cathartic function from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pinker (2007)</ref>, which is an instantaneous reaction more specific to speech to relieve the effect of physical pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stephens et al., 2009)</ref>. This would thus be very rarely -if ever -expressed through social media and would be very hard to annotate with textual content alone while lacking the broader context of its utterance. We also considered the abuse and aggression func- tions as equivalent across categorizations, as they imply a face-threatening act <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown and Levinson, 1987)</ref>. We considered the auxiliary and idiomatic categories as equivalent across classes, but main- tained signaling group identity as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang (2013)</ref>. We also created a non-vulgar classification in case the vulgar word is used in a non-vulgar context (e.g., a name that doubles as a vulgar term).</p><p>Due to their affective impact, vulgar words are often used as strange synonyms by substituting each other in context or idioms, even when they have no affinity in syntax or meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Quang, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pinker, 2007</ref>) (e.g., for God's sake -for fuck's sake; 'I don't give a damn/fuck/shit). This heavily contributes to vulgar word volatility across different functions and higher ambiguity in con- text. However, this type of usage can allow com- putational approaches that model the immediate context around a word to generalize across words to functions. To date, there has been no research on quantitatively modeling the function of vulgar words in context.</p><p>The overall frequency of usage of vulgar words has been quantitatively studied in social media and online communities. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wang et al. (2014)</ref> estimates that vulgar posts constitute up- wards of 1.15% of tweets and examines vulgar to- ken frequency and how it varies with time, geo- location, and gender. An analysis of profanity across gender and age also appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gauthier et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>In fact, gender is the most studied sociode- mographic factor in relation to the use of pro- fanity. Many studies have shown that male- identifying users employ vulgar terms more fre- quently than female-identifying users (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Selnow, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wang et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jay and Janschewitz (2008)</ref> demonstrate that profanity is moderated by pragmatic or contextual factors that go beyond gender, including occupa- tion, social status, and even the nature of the re- lationship between interlocutors -though this last point, proves difficult to explore via Twitter where the identity of the audience is at least partially ob- fuscated. Other social factors such as age, religios- ity or social status have also been shown to vary with vulgar frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McEnery, 2004)</ref>, as has political ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sylwester and Purver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc-Pietro et al., 2017)</ref>. It is thus likely that sociodemographic factors also influence the func- tions with which vulgar words are used.</p><p>This study expands the scope of this type of re- search, by going beyond simple frequency of us- age to pragmatic functions of vulgar words and how they are used differently by different sociode- mographic groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>We use social media as our data source as this con- tains a high level of expression of thoughts, opin- ions and emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Java et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kouloumpis et al., 2011</ref>) and represents a platform for observ- ing written interactions and conversations between users ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ritter et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Social media and Twitter in particular provide vast volumes of text which are more informal and less curated compared to other domains such as newswire. An additional advantage of Twitter data is that it allows us to study the sociodemographic context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Identifying Vulgar Tweets</head><p>We use the corpus of tweets utilized to construct the Vulgar Twitter corpus introduced in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cachola et al., 2018)</ref>. Every tweet in this corpus contains at least one vulgar term. We then annotate each instance of a vulgar token for type of use. Note that we use the full dataset of 7,800 tweets which contains 1K more tweets 2 than the released version of the Vulgar Twitter corpus.</p><p>The Vulgar Twitter corpus was constructed by identifying tweets containing vulgarity through use of the vulgarity lexicon available at www. noswearing.com. A total of 82 tokens were removed from this list as they were deemed not to be unambiguously vulgar after manual inspec- tion. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Regular expressions were utilized to iden- tify common intentional spelling variations (e.g., vowel reduplication such as fuuuuuck or self- censorship such as a$$ ).</p><p>For the complete description of the composition and construction of the Vulgar Twitter corpus, we refer the interested reader to the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cachola et al., 2018</ref>).</p></div>

The tweets are compiled from up to 3,200 most recent tweets (per Twitter Developer API) of 4,132 twitter users who provided sociodemographic information via self-report in an online survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc-Pietro et al., 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Annotation</head><p>We have collected annotations via Amazon Me- chanical Turk (MTurk) for vulgar word usage type for 8,524 instances of vulgar words across the 7,800 tweets present in the Vulgar Twitter corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cachola et al., 2018</ref>). The task guidelines follow previous research from linguistics and psychology described in Sec- tion 2. For generality, we use a union of the differ- ent classes proposed and grouped classes where it was possible. The final guidelines include six dif- ferent functions of vulgar words described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Ta- ble 2</ref>.</p><p>For quality control, we asserted the following qualifications on MTurk: locale=US, approval rate &gt;90%, number of HITs approved &gt;100. Fur- ther, we removed all ratings from users that have a Cohen's Kappa of lower than 0.2 when com- pared to the majority rating of the other six an- notations resulting in the removal of 8,430 ratings (14% of the total number) from 150 out of 663 users. These users were banned and annotations were recollected until 7 ratings were obtained for all instances.</p><p>We measured inter-annotator agreement using Krippendorf's Alpha as this can handle cases where each item was labeled by different groups of users. The overall Krippendorfs Alpha is 0.506 despite there being a large number of classes (6). This alpha value (0.506) is regarded as a moderate level of agreement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref>. To reduce uncertainty, we aggregate our labels across seven different annotators. In cases where no ma- jority class emerged from the seven annotations (10.6% of the instances), the tie was broken by one of the authors of the paper, who have significant training and experience in linguistic annotation.</p><p>The distribution of the final vulgar word type is presented in the last column from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="table">Ta- ble 3</ref> shows the confusion matrix between ag- gregated function (row) and individual annota- tions (column); each cell is normalized by the row sum. Some patterns in disagreements include: (1) Vulgar words used to signal group identity are sometimes confused with aggression as annotat- ing these may require additional social context about the user (e.g. if they are female, African- American, etc.) or about social relationships (e.g. "lmao yeah cause a bitch can't sing"). (2) Emo- tion confused with auxiliary usage in idioms or where there is a lack on context about what is <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">bitchy  35  1.547  3  5  2  3  2  0  dicks  33  1.442  7  2  0  6  2  2  bastard  26  1.307  18  3  1  7  1  3  fuck  4  1.272  246 345  190  75  0  0  pussy  21  1.256  17  3  2  33  1  7  ass  5  1.250  116  45  222 352  7  5  hell  2  1.220  16  242  602  71  0  238  dick  9  1.208  36  4  5  87  0  67</ref>   </p><note type="other">Word Rank Entropy Agr Emo Emp Aux Sig Non</note><note type="other">bitch 7 1.194 296 23 20 60 110 3 shit 1 1.170 59 555 200 488 1 1</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis</head><p>We start with a quantitative analysis of our data. First, we examine the extent to which the same vulgar word is used for different functions. Then, we identify if sociodemographic factors impact the functions with which vulgar words are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Vulgar Word Analysis</head><p>To quantitatively measure which vulgar words are most used with different functions, we first com- pute its distribution over the six functions in our entire data set. Then, we compute the entropy as a measure of how evenly distributed the distribu- tion over functions of each word is. To avoid un- certainly associated computing statistics over dis- tributions with low counts, we keep only words that appear more than 10 times in our data set (43 words) after collapsing variants of the same word (e.g. fuck -f*ck -fuuuck).</p><p>The average entropy of all vulgar words is µ = 0.835 (σ = 0.36), with 0 being the minimum en- tropy (i.e., all words are used with one function) and 1.791 being the maximum entropy (i.e., all words are used with the same frequency with all six functions). The words with the highest entropy are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>The table shows that four of the most frequent five words are in the top ten words by entropy, with all of them having significant numbers of oc- currences in at least three vulgar functions. Actu- ally, the average entropy of words used at least 100 times in our data set (15 words) is 0.930 compared to 0.835 for words used at least 10 times.</p><p>We see that all words in the table are used signif- icantly with three or more functions. On average, in the entire data set, each word is used at least once with µ = 4.00 functions (σ = 1.34).</p><p>This highlights both the challenges in modeling vulgar word functions and the opportunity of using the function to improve practical applications.</p><p>In contrast, <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows the vulgar words which are most likely to be used with each of the six functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Demographic Analysis</head><p>Sociodemographic factors may impact the distri- bution with which each function of vulgar words is used. To measure this, we compute for each user a normalized distribution over the functions of vulgar words used in our data set. Then, we compute Pearson correlation where the dependent variable is the fraction of each vulgar word func- tion and the independent variables are the user so- ciodemographic trait values. Following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schwartz and et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc-Pietro et al., 2017)</ref>, for all analyses we consider gender and age basic traits and control for potential data skew by introducing both variables as controls in partial correlation. When studying age and gen- der, we use the other trait as the control. Since we are running 36 tests at once without pre-stated hy- potheses, we correct the correlations for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Results of these analyses are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>The results show several vulgar word functions are specific of age. Younger users of Twitter are more likely to use vulgar words to signal group identity and to express emotion. Older age is more likely to be related to use of words that are vul- gar with non-vulgar functions. These correlations show that there are differences in how younger generations are using vulgar words, even if tweets were posted in the same time interval, signaling a diachronic change in usage.</p><p>The analysis shows that the only significant cor- relation with the other five demographic variables is between both political ideology and faith and us- ing vulgar words for emphasis and in non-vulgar functions. Liberals are more likely to use vul- gar words for emphasis and less likely to use them with non-vulgar functions. Previous research   showed that liberals are more likely to use more vulgarity overall in social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sylwester and Purver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc-Pietro et al., 2017)</ref> and are perceived by others to use more frequently than they do vulgar words <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carpenter et al., 2016)</ref>, but this analysis shows this is especially due to vulgar word use to emphasise. The results are reversed for faith, which is known to be strongly correlated to conservative political ideology. Controlling for faith and political ideology with partial correlation does not alter the significance of this result.</p><note type="other">Aggression Express Emotion Emphasis Auxiliary Signal Group Identity Non-Vulgar</note><p>Intriguingly, all other traits (gender, education and income) are not significantly correlated with an increased usage in any of the functions.</p><p>The vulgar word functions of aggression and auxiliary usage, which are more standard and tra- ditional usages of vulgar words, do not show any significant differences with any sociodemographic trait.</p></div>

Tweet Content -We derive a tweet-level repre- sentation of the entire content of the tweet by av- eraging vector representations of its constituent words. We utilize 200-dimensional GloVe embed- dings pre-trained on 2B tweets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). Sentiment Content -We include two features which represent the number of positive and neg- ative valence words in the tweet, normalized by tweet length. For this feature group, we utilize the opinion lexicon introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hu and Liu (2004)</ref>. Part of Speech Context -We encode the part of speech of the target word, the previous word and the next word as one-hot vectors as we expect syn- tactic information to be an indicator of different functions in context. We extract parts of speech using the Twitter version of the Stanford POS tag- ger which demonstrated good results on tagging tweets and uses the finer grained Penn Treebank tagset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Derczynski et al., 2013)</ref>. Brown Clusters -Finally, we include two one-hot feature groups which indicate the Brown Cluster ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al., 1992</ref>) membership of word immedi- ately before and immediately after the vulgar term.   <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Performance statistics for our baseline, predictive model with all features and with ablat- ing each feature group. Precision, Recall and F1 score are macro-averaged across the six classes.</p><p>Brown Clusters are obtained by hierarchical clus- tering tokens based on contexts in which they im- mediately co-occur. We use the precomputed clus- ter representations as seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Turian et al. (2010)</ref>. We also experimented with Twitter-specific clus- ters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Owoputi et al., 2012</ref>), but found they did not perform as well on our development set. Additionally, we experimented with a personal pronoun indicator feature in a three word window around the target, a one-hot lexical feature en- coding the target vulgar item, and NRC emotion scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mohammad and Turney, 2013)</ref>, but found there to be no improvement in performance as a re- sult. We did not experiment with using the demo- graphic variables as features as these are generally unavailable for use in predictive systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Experimental Results</head><p>We split our data into a training set of 6,883 tweets and a testing set of 1,087 tweets, and held out a set of 554 tweets as a validation set on which to test different hyperparameter settings.</p><p>Performance statistics for our predictive model are presented in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, as well as ablation exper- iments for each feature group.</p><p>Our predictive model vastly outperforms the most frequent baseline, which uniformly selects the most frequent class overall (emphasis) and scores very low due to the very even distribution over functions. Our best model achieves a macro- averaged F1 score of 67.4 across the six classes.</p><p>In the ablation experiments, we see by remov- ing one feature group at a time, which feature type adds most predictive value over others. Withhold- ing the intention distribution feature group from the model shows the greatest loss in performance (12.1 macro F1). This is somewhat expected, as this feature gives a prior distribution over func- tions for the target word based on training data and, as most words are rarely used with some functions, allows the model to downweigh them. However, even with no word function prior, the predictive performance is still relatively high (55.3 macro F1 across six classes), showing that only the content and context is substantially predictive for the function of a vulgar word Removing tweet content features or part-of- speech context introduce a similar drop in predic- tive performance, showing that the overall tweet content and the local syntactic context of the men- tion play complimentary roles in inference. The sentiment feature groups are the least informative, yielding an negligible increase in performance of only 0.1 macro F1.</p><p>The predictive model's F1 scores by class is as follows: Aggression -65.6, Emotion -62.4, Em- phasis -76.4, Signal Group Identity -56.5, Auxil- iary -62.2, Not Vulgar -81.4.</p><p>The highest predictive performance is obtained for vulgar words used in a non vulgar context, which is due to the different tweet content of these tweets and the restricted sets of words which are usually used as non-vulgar. The emphasis func- tions is the second most accurately predictable us- ing our model, due to the very distinctive syntactic patterns of usage of this function (usually as an ad- jective). The least predictable function is signaling group identity. We observed that this function is usually used as part of larger conversational con- text and often relies on a shared social context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Hate Speech Prediction</head><p>Finally, we aim to show that modeling the func- tion of vulgar words explicitly has practical impli- cations by using this in a downstream application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Task</head><p>Automatic hate-speech detection on social media is the task defined as generally identifying abu- sive speech targeting specific group characteris- tics, such as ethnic origin, religion, gender, or sexual orientation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Warner and Hirschberg, 2012</ref>) with a clear intention to incite harm, or to promote hatred ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang and Luo, 2018)</ref>. Several data sets and approaches to automatic hate speech detection have been recently proposed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Djuric et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burnap and Williams, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Waseem and Hovy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nobata et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davidson et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The task of predicting hate-speech is challeng- ing for natural language processing using lexical information as it aims to predict the intention of the message and several words used in conveying hate speech can have other common uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Davidson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Malmasi and Zampieri, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Hate speech is very often confused with offen- sive language, as highlighted in the error analy- ses of past hate speech detection papers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davidson et al., 2017)</ref>. Quantitative analysis of the machine learning models suggest that obscene words are very informative for both the hate speech and of- fensive classes of tweets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Malmasi and Zampieri, 2018)</ref>, hinting that the functions of vulgar words usage are a major source of ambiguity.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the function a vulgar word has in context will benefit the hate speech prediction task, by differentiating between aggression and other usages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Experiments</head><p>Data. We use the dataset introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davidson et al. (2017)</ref> as this is publicly available, contains tweets collected using vulgar words and explicitly differentiates between offensive tweets and tweets containing hate speech. The three classes in this data set are hate speech, offensive, and neither.</p><p>Another public dataset on tweets, introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Waseem and Hovy (2016)</ref>, focuses on specific forms of hate speech (sexist and racist), but is col- lected with a restricted set of keywords, has low coverage of vulgar words and does not explicitly distinguish between hate speech and other offen- sive language. Other datasets for this task are not publicly available e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nobata et al. (2016)</ref>. Setup.</p><p>In order to directly measure the im- pact on predicting performance introduced by ex- plicitly modeling the function of the vulgar word in the tweet, we follow the same methodology to identify hate speech as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davidson et al. (2017)</ref>, as implemented through the openly available code provided by the authors. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We thus train three one-vs-all logistic regression classifiers with L2 regularization as implemented in scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>  Metrics. We run the model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davidson et al. (2017)</ref> using the provided code on 10-fold cross validation and report the average F1 score for each class as well as the macro-averaged F1 score across all ten folds. Using the available code, we could not reproduce exactly results presented in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Davidson et al. (2017)</ref> paper. For predicting the function of the vulgar words from context, we use our best predictive model described in Sec- tion 5. We also re-scale our six function features by multiplying them with a large exponent in order to make them significant in model training.</p><p>Results. As presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref>, the addition of the six vulgar function features improves the F1 score for each of three classes to up to 6.1 F1 for the hate speech class, which had the lowest per- formance. This results in an improvement of the macro-F1 score for the entire classification task of 3.7 in F1. This demonstrates the importance of the proposed vulgar function modeling task in detect- ing hate speech.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>This paper presents the first empirical study on the pragmatic functions of vulgar words. We created a novel, freely available data set of 7,800 vulgar tweets having 8,524 instances of vulgar words la- beled for one of six functions by seven annota- tors and expert adjudication. We quantitatively showed, leveraging research in linguistics and psy- chology, that vulgar words are frequently used with different functions and, in the first quanti- tative analysis on this topic, uncovered that vul- gar words are used with different functions by younger users to signal group identity and for ex- pressing emotions. We have built the first machine learning model for predicting vulgar word function from con- text, achieving a performance of 67.4 macro F1, demonstrating the practical feasibility of this task. We showed the usefulness of this task, by integrat- ing predicted vulgar word function in the down- stream task of hate speech detection, achieving an improvement of 3.7 in F1 on a benchmark data set. This study showed that modeling pragmatic function is of practical importance. Future work will use this linguistic information to inform more complex machine learning models, e.g., deep neu- ral networks, in an attempt to increase predictive gains. As two of the most used functions of vulgar words relate to expressing sentiment or emotions, we will also explore collecting sentiment annota- tions for joint sentiment and vulgar word function inference and use this to improve the task of senti- ment analysis using multi-task methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the author's intent or target (e.g. "Stop cryin..

			<note place="foot" n="2"> These tweets are excluded due to low sentiment agreement in Cachola et al. (2018). 3 These terms were largely anatomical words or general verbs like penis, vagina, and blow, but some identity descriptors like gay, queer, and lesbian were also excluded after manual review of a large sampling of uses revealed they were not overwhelmingly employed as slurs.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> Users were asked to identify their gender as Male, Female, or via an open field. Users who did not respond as either Female or Male were excluded from data collection as there was not a sufficient population to be confident that data would be representative.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> In preliminary experiments, we attempted to utilize a BiLSTM to encode tweet context, but it did significantly worse than the logistic regression model, possibly due to many parameters and classes compared to the size of the training data.</note>
