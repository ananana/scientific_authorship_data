			<abstract>
				<p>When processing a text, humans and machines must disambiguate between different uses of the pronoun it, including non-referential, nominal anaphoric or clause anaphoric ones. In this paper, we use eye-tracking data to learn how humans perform this disambiguation. We use this knowledge to improve the automatic classification of it. We show that by using gaze data and a POS-tagger we are able to significantly outperform a common baseline and classify between three categories of it with an accuracy comparable to that of linguistic-based approaches. In addition, the discriminatory power of specific gaze features informs the way humans process the pronoun, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored using data from a natural reading task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Anaphora resolution is both one of the most im- portant and one of the least developed tasks in Nat- ural Language Processing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. A particularly difficult case for anaphora resolution systems is the pronoun it, as it may refer to a spe- cific noun phrase or an entire clause, or it may even refer to nothing at all, as in sentences 1 -3 below 1 .</p><p>1. "I couldnt say exactly, sir, but it wasnt tea- time by a long way." (Pleonastic it (non- referential)).</p><p>2. Now, as to this quarrel. When was the first time you heard of it? (Nominal anaphoric) <ref type="bibr">3</ref>. You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so? (Clause anaphoric 2 .)</p><p>This phenomenon is not specific only to En- glish; pronouns that can be used both referentially and non-referentially exist in a variety of language groups such as the pronoun <ref type="bibr">'het' in Dutch, 'det' in Danish, 'ello' in Spanish, 'il' in French, etc.</ref> In NLP, there has been active research in the area of automatic classification of it during the past four decades but the issue is far from being solved (Section 2). According to corpus statistics, the pronoun it is by far the most frequently used pronoun in the English language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2009)</ref>, and as recently as 2016, incorrect classification of different cases of it and their antecedents is high- lighted as one of the major reasons for the failure of question-answering systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al., 2016</ref>). In the state of the art, the best approaches to clas- sifying it achieve between 2% and 15% improve- ment over a majority baseline when assigning ex- amples of the pronoun to more than two classes.</p><p>In contrast with the extensive research in NLP, very little is known about the way humans ap- proach the disambiguation of it. To the best of our knowledge, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Foraker and McElree (2007)</ref> is the only study on this subject that uses online mea- sures of reading. It proves empirically that the pronoun it is resolved more slowly and less accu- rately than gendered pronouns due to its ambigu- ity. So far there have been no studies investigating the subject using natural reading data as opposed to artificially created controlled sentences.</p><p>In this paper we approach these two problems as one and hypothesise that obtaining information on the way humans disambiguate the pronoun can improve its automatic classification.</p><p>We propose a new method for classifying the pronoun it that does not rely on linguistic pro- cessing. Instead, the model leverages knowledge about the way in which humans disambiguate the pronoun based on eye tracking data. We show that by using gaze data and a POS tagger we are able to achieve classification accuracy of three types of it that is comparable to the performance of linguistic-based approaches and that outperforms a common baseline with a statistically significant difference. In addition, ex- amining the discriminatory power of specific gaze features provides valuable information about the human processing of the pronoun. We make our data, code and annotation available at https: //github.com/victoria-ianeva/ It-Classification.</p><p>The GECO eye-tracking corpus is available at http: //expsy.ugent.be/downloads/geco/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Gaze data in NLP While eye-movement data has been traditionally used to gain understanding of the cognitive processing of text, it was recently applied to a number of technical tasks such as part-of-speech tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barrett et al., 2016</ref>), de- tection of multi-word expressions <ref type="bibr">(Rohanian et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yaneva et al., 2017</ref>), sentence compression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Klerke et al., 2016)</ref>, complex-word identification <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Stajner et al., 2017)</ref>, and sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr">(Rotsztejn, 2018</ref>). Eye movements were also shown to carry valuable information about the reader and were used to detect specific conditions affecting reading such as autism ( <ref type="bibr">Yaneva et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">Yaneva et al., , 2016</ref> and dyslexia ( <ref type="bibr">Rello and Ballesteros, 2015)</ref>. The motivation behind these approaches is two-fold. First, eye tracking is already making its way into everyday use with interfaces and devices that fea- ture eye-tracking navigation (e.g. Windows Eye Control 3 ). Second, linguistic annotation by gaze is faster than traditional annotation techniques, does not require trained annotators, and provides a language-independent approach that can be ap- plied to under-resourced languages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barrett et al., 2016)</ref>. This is particularly interesting for the case of non-referential pronouns, as the phenomenon exists in different languages.</p><p>Classification of it The majority of the machine learning approaches to classifying the pronoun it in different languages are based on linguistic features capturing token, syntactic and semantic context. Different papers report varying majority baseline metrics (between 50% and 75%) depend- ing on the annotated corpora, and an improvement over the majority baselines of between 2% and 15% for classification of more than two classes of it ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Loáiciga et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Uryupina et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Müller, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boyd et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoste et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Evans, 2001</ref>). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Loáiciga et al. (2017)</ref> train a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify three classes of it in the ParCor corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Guillou et al., 2014</ref>) and com- pare its performance to a feature-based maximum entropy classifier. The RNN achieves accuracy of 62% compared to a majority baseline of 54% and is significantly outperformed by the linguistic- feature classifier which obtained 68.7% accuracy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al. (2016)</ref> compare several statistical mod- els and report 75% accuracy for four-class classi- fication over a majority baseline of around 62% using linguistic features and a stochastic adaptive gradient algorithm. They also report that exper- imenting with word embeddings did not lead to more accurate classification. So far, approaches using linguistic features still represent the state of the art in the classification of it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Corpus: The eye-tracking data was extracted from the GECO corpus (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cop et al. (2016)</ref> for full corpus specifications) which is the largest and most recent eye-tracking corpus for English at present. The text of the corpus is a novel by Agatha Christie entitled "The Mysterious Affair at Styles", the English version of which contains 54,364 tokens and 5,012 unique types. The entire novel was read by 14 native English undergradu- ates from the University of Southampton using an eye-tracker with a sampling rate of 1 kHz.</p><p>Annotation scheme: A total of 1,052 instances of it were found in the corpus <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Each of the in- stances of it was annotated by two annotators and assigned to one of three categories: Pleonastic, Nominal anaphoric and Clause anaphoric, fol- lowing the scheme used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al. (2016)</ref>. The annotators were free to view as much of the pre- vious text as necessary to decide on a label. The inter-annotator agreement for the three categories was κ = 0.636, p &lt; 0.0005, indicating substantial agreement between the annotators. This number corresponds to a percentage agreement of 77.47% for the three categories and is comparable to the Annotat. 1 Annotat. 2 Final Pleonastic 339 (33%) 406 (38%) 272 (33%) Nom. anaph. 492 (46%) 527 (50%) 453 (56%) Clause anaph. 221 (21%) 119 (11%) 89 (11%)  81% agreement reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al. (2016)</ref>. We perceived adjudication between cases of disagree- ment (237 instances) to be extremely arbitrary, so those cases were excluded rather than resolved. Examples of such arbitrary cases include:</p><p>• "Sit down here on the grass, do. It's ever so much nicer." (nominal vs. clause anaphoric)</p><p>• It's a jolly good life taking it all round...if it weren't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!" (pleonastic vs. clause anaphoric)</p><p>The distribution of each class of the retained data by annotator is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We make the full annotations of both annotators available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Overview In order to test the extent to which gaze data can help the classification of different cases of it, we trained and compared three separate classifiers. The first classifier is based on gaze fea- tures, the second one is based on linguistic features and finally, we trained a combined classifier using both gaze and linguistic features. We compared the performance of these classifiers to a majority baseline of 55.7 and to another baseline obtained by using the tokens surrounding the pronoun (pre- vious and next word) as features (60.4). We also experimented with adding word embeddings 6 for the surrounding tokens as features. While the full exploration of word embeddings for the classifica- tion of it remains outside of the scope of this work, it would be interesting to explore whether the em- beddings add value to the models by encoding in- formation that was not otherwise captured.  Gaze features We use the gaze features as pro- vided in GECO and we average the data from all 14 readers per token. We extract gaze data for each case of it, as well as for the preceding and follow- ing word. The full list of gaze features used in the experiments can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. Different eye-tracking measures (usually di- vided into early and late) are indicative of different aspects of cognitive processing. Early gaze mea- sures such as First Fixation Duration give infor- mation about the early stages of lexical access and syntactic processing, while late measures such as Total Reading Time or Number of Fixations give information about processes such as textual in- tegration and disambiguation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rayner et al. (2012)</ref> for a review). In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, the distinction between Early, Medium and Late gaze features is mainly based on the run during which the fixa- tions were made (i.e. whether the eyes were pass- ing through the text for the first, second or third time). For each run we report count measures, percentage measures (as part of the trial) and du- ration measures (in milliseconds). Additional late features reported include Last Fixation Duration and Last Fixation Run (the run during which the last fixation in a given region occurred), Total Reading Time (in msec and %), and Trial Fixation Count (the overall number of fix- ations within the trial). Go Past Time refers to the summation of all fixation durations on the cur- rent word during the first pass. Spillover refers to the duration of the first fixation made on the next word after leaving the current word in the first run. Finally, a word is considered skipped if no fixa- tion occurred during the first run (Skip). A com- plete legend explaining each feature can be found within the corpus metadata.</p><p>An ablation study on the contributions of indi- vidual groups of gaze features towards the classi- fication of it is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Linguistic features We implemented a set of features originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Evans (2001)</ref> and subsequently used extensively in the studies pre- sented in Section 2. In terms of features and cat- egories of it, the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Evans (2001)</ref> is the most fine-grained one we could find, classifying 7 categories of it with 69% accuracy. The set of features from Evans (2001) is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  3</ref>. These features synthesize information based on corpus studies of the pronoun it and thus aim to capture positional, part-of-speech and proximity information, as well as specific patterns of usage. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Evans (2001)</ref> notes that pleonastic pronouns rarely appear immediately after a prepo- sitional word and that complementisers or adjec- tives often follow pleonastic instances. Another  pattern that distinguishes the pleonastic use of it is associated with certain sequences of elements such as 'adjective + noun phrase' and 'comple- mentiser + noun phrase' <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Evans, 2001</ref>). Therefore, the linguistic features proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Evans (2001)</ref> and used in our experiments make possible the uti- lization of corpus-based knowledge for the auto- matic classification of it.</p><p>Classification We use simple logistic regression as implemented in WEKA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hall et al., 2009</ref>) with 10-fold cross validation and a random seed pa- rameter 20. Since logistic regression is an inter- pretable method, we are able to assess the perfor- mance of individual features and gain insight into the psycholinguistic processing of the pronoun. We experimented with gaze features for the in- dividual words but as gaze data is inherently very noisy, we found that smoothing the features by adding the ones that correspond to the pronoun and the next word stabilized the results. Adding the gaze features for the previous word signifi- cantly reduced the performance but using them separately in a model with the added It + Next fea- tures maximised our results. For the role of indi- vidual features in the models see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>In order to account for class imbalance we com- pute and report a weighted F1 score, as opposed to the harmonic mean between precision and recall. First, the F1 for each class is weighted by multi-plying it by the number of instances in the class. Then the F1 scores for all classes are summed up and divided by the total number of instances. The resulting weighted F1 score is lower than the tradi- tionally reported mean F1 score, but it represents the effects of class imbalance more accurately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results and Discussion</head><p>The results from the classification experiments presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> have implications for lan- guage processing by both humans and machines.</p><p>From the NLP perspective, the potential of gaze data to not only improve but also, to a certain ex- tent, substitute text processing approaches is an exciting new frontier. Our results show that the gaze-based classifier performs on par with the one using linguistic features and both of them perform significantly better 7 than the baseline of 60.4. An improvement of 13% over the majority baseline is achieved when combining the two but this differ- ence is not a significant improvement over the in- dividual best classifiers. A possible reason for this is that the gaze data and linguistic features encode similar information about the disambiguation of it and adding them together leads to overlap instead of complementation. In all three classifiers, the clause-anaphoric class was consistently predicted with lowest accuracy <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 5)</ref>, which is not sur- prising given that it only accounts for 11% of the retained data. In line with the observation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al. (2016)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Section 2)</ref>, the embeddings do not show a stable contribution. In our case, this is likely related to the small amount of data, to which we add 300 dimensions per word.</p><p>Overall, the improvement achieved by the clas- sifiers is comparable with the current state-of-the- art (Section 2). It is important to note that this is the first study to use text from the domain of liter- ature and that this may have influenced the extrac- tion of the linguistic features. At the same time, literature can be regarded as a more challenging domain than the declarative texts used in previous research, owing to the creative use of language.</p><p>From a psycholinguistic perspective, we pro- vide evidence that, indeed, the three classes of it are processed differently. We observe that medium and late gaze features related to disambiguation are more discriminative than the early ones. For <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">NomAnaph ClauseAnaph Pleon  395  2  56  NomAnaph  53  11  25  ClauseAnaph  93</ref> 3 176 Pleon example, measures such as first fixation duration were not included in any of the models, while re- visits as late as the third run (the third time the eyes pass over the region of interest) occurred in these regions and provided a strong signal. Particularly useful features were the durations of the second and last fixations, as well as the information about the run (pass) during which they occur. The significance of these features in the best classifiers somewhat contradicts the ablation study presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. According to that table, early processing features for the preceding and next words are expected to outperform the late ones. A possible explanation for this are predictability and spillover effects, as the pronoun it is both highly predictable and easy to skip, because of its high frequency and shortness. Indeed, the gaze features from the it-region itself are not as useful as the ones from the surrounding words.</p><p>The results from this study showed that: i) gaze features encode information about the way hu- mans disambiguate the pronoun it, ii) that this in- formation partially overlaps with the information carried by linguistic features, and that iii) gaze can be used for automatic classification of the pronoun with accuracy comparable to that of linguistic- based approaches. In our future work we will at- tempt to identify specific patterns of cognitive pro- cessing for the individual classes, as well as ex- plore factors related to the readers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We presented the first study on the use of gaze data for disambiguating categories of it, exploring a wide range of gaze and linguistic features. The model based on gaze features and part-of-speech information achieved accuracy similar to that of the linguistic-based model and state-of-the-art sys- tems, without the need for text processing. Late gaze features emerged as the most discriminative ones, with disambiguation effort indicators as late as third pass revisits.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>Table 1 : Annotation categories</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Prev.
