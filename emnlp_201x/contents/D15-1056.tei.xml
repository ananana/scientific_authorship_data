				<p>Semi-supervised bootstrapping techniques for relationship extraction from text iteratively expand a set of initial seed relationships while limiting the semantic drift. We research bootstrapping for relationship extraction using word embeddings to find similar relationships. Experimental results show that relying on word embeddings achieves a better performance on the task of extracting four types of relationships from a collection of newswire documents when compared with a baseline using TF-IDF to find similar relationships.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Relationship Extraction (RE) transforms unstruc- tured text into relational triples, each represent- ing a relationship between two named-entities. A bootstrapping system for RE starts with a collec- tion of documents and a few seed instances. The system scans the document collection, collecting occurrence contexts for the seed instances. Then, based on these contexts, the system generates ex- traction patterns. The documents are scanned again using the patterns to match new relation- ship instances. These newly extracted instances are then added to the seed set, and the process is repeated until a certain stop criteria is met.</p><p>The objective of bootstrapping is thus to expand the seed set with new relationship instances, while limiting the semantic drift, i.e. the progressive de- viation of the semantics for the extracted relation- ships from the semantics of the seed relationships.</p><p>State-of-the-art approaches rely on word vec- tor representations with TF-IDF weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Salton and Buckley, 1988)</ref>. However expanding the seed set by relying on TF-IDF representations to find similar instances has limitations, since the similar- ity between any two relationship instance vectors of TF-IDF weights is only positive when the in- stances share at least one term. For instance, the phrases was founded by and is the co-founder of do not have any common words, but they have the same semantics. Stemming techniques can aid in these cases, but only for variations of the same root word <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Porter, 1980)</ref>. We propose to address this challenge with an approach based on word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Mikolov et al., 2013a)</ref>. By relying on word embeddings, the similarity of two phrases can be captured even if no common words exist. The word embed- dings for co-founder and founded should be sim- ilar, since these words tend to occur in the same contexts. Word embeddings can nonetheless also introduce semantic drift. When using word em- beddings, phrases like studied history at can, for instance, have a high similarity with phrases like history professor at. In our approach, we control the semantic drift by ranking the extracted rela- tionship instances, and by scoring the generated extraction patterns.</p><p>We implemented these ideas in BREDS, a boot- strapping system for RE based on word embed- dings. BREDS was evaluated with a collection of 1.2 million sentences from news articles. The ex- perimental results show that our method outper- forms a baseline bootstrapping system based on the ideas of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agichtein and Gravano (2000)</ref> which relies on TF-IDF representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Bootstrapping Relationship Extractors</head><p>Brin (1999) developed DIPRE, the first system to apply bootstrapping for RE, which represents the occurrences of seeds as three contexts of strings: words before the first entity (BEF), words between the two entities (BET), and words after the second entity (AFT). DIPRE generates extraction patterns by grouping contexts based on string matching, and controls semantic drift by limiting the number of instances a pattern can extract. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agichtein and Gravano (2000)</ref> developed Snowball, which is inspired on DIPRE's method of collecting three contexts for each occurrence, but computing a TF-IDF representation for each context. The seed contexts are clustered with a single-pass algorithm based on the cosine similar- ity between contexts using the three vector repre- sentations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1) Sim(S n , S j ) = α · cos(BEF i , BEF j ) + β · cos(BET i , BET j ) + γ · cos(AF T i , AF T j )</formula><p>In the formula, the parameters α, β and γ weight each vector. An extraction pattern is represented by the centroid of the vectors that form a cluster. The patterns are used to scan the text again, and for each segment of text where any pair of enti- ties with the same semantic types as the seeds co- occur, three vectors are generated. If the similarity from the context vectors towards an extraction pat- tern is greater than a threshold τ sim , the instance is extracted. Snowball scores the patterns and ranks the ex- tracted instances to control the semantic drift. A pattern is scored based on the instances that it ex- tracted, which can be included in three sets: P , N , and U . If an extracted instance contains an entity e 1 , which is part of a seed, and if the asso- ciated entity e 2 in the instance is the same as in in the seed, then the extraction is considered pos- itive (included in set P ). If the relationship con- tradicts a relationship in the seed set (i.e., e 2 does not match), then the extraction is considered neg- ative (included in a set N ). If the relationship is not part of the seed set, the extraction is consid- ered unknown (included in a set U ). A score is assigned to each pattern p according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(2) Conf ρ (p) = |P | |P |+W ngt · |N |+W unk · |U |</formula><p>W ngt and W unk are weights associated to the neg- ative and unknown extractions, respectively. The confidence of an instance is calculated based on the similarity scores towards the patterns that ex- tracted it, weighted by the pattern's confidence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Conf ι (i) = 1 − |ξ| j=0 (1 − Conf ρ (ξ j ) × Sim(C i , ξ j )) (3)</formula><p>where, ξ is the set of patterns that extracted i, and C i is the textual context where i occurred. In- stances with a confidence above a threshold τ t are used as seeds in the next iteration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Bootstrapping Relationship Extractors with Word Embeddings</head><p>BREDS follows the architecture of Snowball, having the same processing phases: find seed matches, generating extraction patterns, finding relationship instances, and detecting semantic drift. It differs, however, in that it attempts to find similar relationships using word embeddings, in- stead of relying on TF-IDF representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Find Seed Matches</head><p>BREDS scans the document collection and, if both entities of a seed instance co-occur in a text seg- ment within a sentence, then that segment is con- sidered and BREDS extracts the three textual con- texts as in Snowball: BEF, BET, and AFT.</p><p>In the BET context, BREDS tries to identify a relational pattern based on a shallow heuristic originally proposed in <ref type="bibr">ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011</ref>). The pattern limits a relation context to a verb (e.g., invented), a verb followed by a preposition (e.g., located in), or a verb followed by nouns, adjec- tives, or adverbs ending in a preposition (e.g., has atomic weight of). These patterns will nonetheless only consider verb mediated relationships. If no verbs exist between two entities, BREDS extracts all the words between the two entities, to build the representations for the BET context.</p><p>Each context is transformed into a single vec- tor by a simple compositional function that starts by removing stop-words and adjectives and then sums the word embedding vectors of each indi- vidual word. Representing small phrases by sum- ming each individual word's embedding results in good representations for the semantics in small phrases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mikolov et al., 2013b)</ref>.</p><p>A relationship instance i is represented by three embedding vectors: V BEF , V BET , and V AF T . Considering the sentence:</p><p>The tech company Soundcloud is based in Berlin, capital of Germany.</p><p>BREDS generates the relationship instance with:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V BEF = E("tech") + E("company") V BET = E("is") + E("based") V AF T = E("capital")</formula><p>where, E(x) is the word embedding for word x. BREDS also tries to identify the passive voice using part-of-speech (PoS) tags, which can help to detect the correct order of the entities in a rela- tional triple. BREDS identifies the presence of the passive voice by considering any form of the verb to be, followed by a verb in the past tense or the past participle, and ending in the word by.</p><p>For instance, the seed &lt;Google, owns, DoubleClick&gt; states that the organisation Google owns the organisation DoubleClick. Using this seed, if BREDS detects a pattern like agreed to be acquired by it will swap the order of the entities when producing a relational triple, out- putting the triple &lt;ORG 2 , owns, ORG 1 &gt;, instead of the triple &lt;ORG 1 , owns, ORG 2 &gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Extraction Patterns Generation</head><p>As Snowball, BREDS generates extraction pat- terns by applying a single-pass clustering algo- rithm to the relationship instances gathered in the previous step. Each resulting cluster contains a set of relationship instances, represented by their three context vectors.</p><p>Algorithm 1 describes the clustering approach taken by BREDS, which takes as input a list of relationship instances and assigns the first instance to a new empty cluster. Next, it iterates through the list of instances, computing the similarity between an instance i n and every cluster Cl j . The instance i n is assigned to the first cluster whose similarity is higher or equal to a threshold τ sim . If all the clusters have a similarity lower than a threshold τ sim , a new cluster C m is created, containing the instance i n .</p><p>The similarity function Sim(i n , Cl j ), between an instance i n and a cluster Cl j , returns the max- imum of the similarities between an instance i n and any of the instances in a cluster Cl j , if the majority of the similarity scores is higher than a threshold τ sim . A value of zero is returned oth- erwise. The similarity between two instances is computed according to <ref type="bibr">Formula (1)</ref>. As a result, clustering in Algorithm 1 differs from the original Snowball method, which instead computes simi- larities towards cluster centroids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Find Relationship Instances</head><p>After the generation of extraction patterns, BREDS finds relationship instances with Algo- rithm 2. It scans the documents once again, col- lecting all segments of text containing entity pairs Algorithm 1: Single-Pass Clustering.</p><p>Input: Instances = {i 1 , i 2 , i 3 , ..., i n } Output: P atterns = {} Cl 1 = {i 1 } P atterns = {Cl 1 } for i n ∈ Instances do for Cl j ∈ P atterns do if Sim(i n , Cl j ) &gt;= τ sim then Cl j = Cl j ∪ {i n } else Cl m = {i n } P atterns = P atterns ∪ {Cl m } whose semantic types are the same as those in the seed instances. For each segment, an instance i is generated as described in Section 3.1, and the similarity towards all previously generated extrac- tion patterns (i.e., clusters) is computed. If the similarity between i and a pattern Cl j is equal or above τ sim , then i is considered a candidate instance, and the confidence score of the pattern is updated, according to Formula (2). The pat- tern which has the highest similarity (pattern best ) is associated with i, along with the correspond- ing similarity score (sim best ). This information is kept in a history of Candidates. Note that the histories of Candidates and P atterns are kept through all the bootstrap iterations, and new pat- terns or instances can be added, or the scores of existing patterns or instances can change. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Semantic Drift Detection</head><p>As Snowball, BREDS ranks the candidate in- stances at the end of each iteration, based on the scores computed with Formula (3). Instances with a score equal or above the threshold τ t are added to the seed set, for use in the next iteration of the bootstrapping algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>In our evaluation we used a set of 5.5 million news articles from AFP and APW <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Parker et al., 2011</ref>). Our pre-processing pipeline is based on the models provided by the NLTK toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bird et al., 2009)</ref>: sentence segmentation 1 , tokenisa- tion 2 , PoS-tagging 3 and named-entity recognition (NER). The NER module in NLTK is a wrapper over the Stanford NER toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>We performed weak entity-linking by matching entity names in sentences with FreebaseEasy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bast et al., 2014</ref>). FreebaseEasy is a processed version of Freebase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollacker et al., 2008</ref>), which con- tains a unique meaningful name for every entity, together with canonical binary relations. For our experiments, we selected only the sentences con- taining at least two entities linked to FreebaseEasy, which corresponded to 1.2 million sentences.</p><p>With the full articles set, we computed word embeddings with the skip-gram model 4 using the word2vec 5 implementation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mikolov et. al. (2013a)</ref>. The TF-IDF representations used by Snowball were calculated over the same articles set. We adopted a previously proposed framework for the evaluation of large-scale RE systems by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bronzi et al. (2012)</ref>, to estimate precision and re- call, using FreebaseEasy as the knowledge base.</p><p>We considered entity pairs no further away than 6 tokens, and a window of 2 tokens for the BEF and AFT contexts, ignoring the remaining of the sentence. We discarded the clusters with only one relationship instances, and ran a maximum of 4 bootstrapping iterations. The W unk and W ngt pa- rameters were set to 0.1 and 2, respectively, based on the results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Yu et al. (2003)</ref>.</p><p>We compared BREDS against Snowball in four relationship types, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. For each re- lationship type we considered several bootstrap-  We bootstrapped each relationship with two context weighting configurations in Formula (1):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship Seeds</head><formula xml:id="formula_4">• Conf 1 : α = 0.0, β = 1.0, γ = 0.0 • Conf 2 : α = 0.2, β = 0.6, γ = 0.2</formula><p>where Conf 1 only considers the BET context and Conf 2 uses the three contexts, while giving more importance to the BET context. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows, for each relationship type, the best F 1 score and the corresponding precision and recall, for all combinations of τ sim and τ t val- ues, and considering only extracted relationship instances with confidence scores equal or above 0.5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2a</ref> shows the results for the BREDS sys- tem, while <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2b</ref> shows the results for Snow- ball (ReVerb), a modified Snowball in which a re- lational pattern based on ReVerb is used to select the words for the BET context. Finally, <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2c</ref> shows the results for Snowball, implemented as described in the original paper.</p><p>Overall, BREDS achieves better F 1 scores than both versions of Snowball. The F 1 score of BREDS is higher, mainly as a consequence of much higher recall scores, which we believe to be due to the relaxed semantic matching caused by using the word embeddings. For some relation- ship types, the recall more than doubles when us- ing word embeddings instead of TF-IDF. For the acquired relationship, when considering Conf 1 , the precision of BREDS drops compared with the other versions of Snowball, but without affecting the F 1 score, since the higher recall compensates for the small loss in precision.</p><p>Regarding the context weighting configura- tions, Conf 2 produces a lower recall when com- pared to Conf 1 . This might be caused by the sparsity of both BEF and AFT, which contain many different words that do not contribute to capture the relationship between the two enti- ties. Although, sometimes, the phrase or word that indicates a relationship occurs on the BEF or AFT contexts, it is more often the case that these phrases or words occur in the BET context.</p><p>The performance results of Snowball (Clas- sic) and Snowball (ReVerb) suggest that selecting words based on a relational pattern to represent the BET context, instead of using all the words, works better for TF-IDF representations.</p><p>The results also show that word embeddings can generate more extraction patterns. For in- stance, for the founder-of relationship, BREDS learns patterns based on words such as founder, co- founder, co-founders or founded, while Snowball only learns patterns that have the word founder, like CEO and founder or founder and chairman.</p><p>The implementations of BREDS and Snowball, as described in this paper, are available on-line 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This paper reports on a novel bootstrapping sys- tem for relation extraction based on word em- beddings. In our experiments, bootstrapped RE achieved better results when using word embed- dings to find similar relationships than with simi- larities between TF-IDF weighted vectors.</p><p>We have identified two main sources of errors: NER problems and incorrect relational patterns extraction due to the use of a shallow heuristic that only captures local relationships.</p><p>In future work, more robust entity-linking ap- proaches, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hoffart et al. (2011)</ref>, could be included in our pre-processing pipeline. This could alleviate NER errors and enable exper- imentation with other relationship types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gabbard et al. (2011)</ref> have shown that co- reference resolution can increase bootstrapping RE performance, and the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Durrett and Klein (2014)</ref> could also be included in our pre- processing pipeline.</p><p>Finally, we could explore richer compositional functions, combining word embeddings with syn- tactic dependencies (SD) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yu et al., 2014</ref>). The shortest path between two entities in an SD tree supports the extraction of local and long-distance relationships ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bunescu and Mooney, 2005</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Relationship types and used seeds.
