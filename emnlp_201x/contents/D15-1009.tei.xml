				<p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the relationship between an indi-vidual&apos;s personal traits and his/her brand preferences. In our analysis, we included a large number of character traits such as personality, personal values and individual needs. These trait features were obtained from both a psychometric survey and automated social media analytics. We also included an extensive set of brand names from diverse product categories. From this analysis, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal traits to infer an individual&apos;s brand preferences (2) whether the trait features automatically inferred from social media are good proxies for the ground truth character traits in brand preference prediction.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Brand preference analysis is an important topic in marketing. To induce a desired brand choice, a marketer must understand the main factors that in- fluence a consumer's brand preferences. This task is not easy since many factors may play a role in determining one's brand preferences such as a consumer's individual characteristics and prefer- ences as well as the properties of a brand (e.g., its perceived quality). Among consumer related factors, demographics such as age, gender and in- come have been studied extensively in marketing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Evans, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Elliott, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lin, 2002)</ref>. In this study, we focus on analyzing a set of con- sumer characteristics, which have received less attention but with these features, potentially we can build more precise and more accurate brand preference prediction models. Especially, we fo- cus on three types of personal traits: personality, personal values, and individual needs. Personal- ity is a combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character; Per- sonal values reflect what are important to different individuals and what motivate them in their deci- sion making. Moreover, all people have certain needs that they want to satisfy. Thus, analyzing a comprehensive set of personal traits may help us understand the way we react to a particular brand.</p><p>Previously, the relationship between personal traits and brand preference/purchase decisions has drawn limited interest in marketing research due to the difficulty in obtaining consumer traits on a large scale. Among these efforts, Westfall found that differences exist between the personalities of the owners of convertible cars and those of stan- dard &amp; compact cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Westfall, 1962)</ref>. Similarly, the congruence of personal and brand personal- ity was suggested to be a predictor of consumers' brand preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jamal and Goode, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dikcius et al., 2013</ref>). However, Shank &amp; Lang- meyer found personal traits less useful in building a strategic marketing tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Shank and Langmeyer, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Given limited and sometimes conflicting results in previous research, in this study, we want to sys- tematically investigate the relationship between a comprehensive set of personal traits and brand preferences. Specifically, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal traits to predict consumer's brand preferences? <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> whether it is feasible to use automatically inferred personal traits to build brand preference prediction systems that are scalable?</p><p>Our study offers several significant contribu- tions to the field of brand preference analysis:</p><p>1. It is the first study that includes a comprehen- sive set of personal traits in brand preference analysis. Our current investigation includes personality (5 general categories and 30 sub-facets), personal values (5 dimensions) and individual needs (12 dimensions). In con- trast, previous work typically only included a small number of personal traits (e.g., just 5 personality traits in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hirsh et al., 2012)</ref>).</p><p>2. It is the first study that uses personal traits obtained from both psychometric evaluation and social media analytics. The traits scores derived from psychometric tests are more ac- curate, which allow us to focus on the re- lationship between personal traits and brand preferences without the distractions from the mistakes introduced by an automated trait in- ference system. However, since psychomet- ric tests require users to answer a large num- ber of survey questions, without sufficient in- centives, it is difficult to perform psychomet- ric evaluation for a large number of people. In contrast, automatically derived trait fea- tures based on social media analytics require no user effort, and can be applied to millions of social media users.</p><p>3. Our study involves diverse brand categories such as luxury car brands, retail brands, fast food brands, and household product brands (e.g., shampoo brands). With this data, we can investigate whether the relationship be- tween personal traits and brand preferences varies across multiple product categories.</p><p>Since the current study focuses on a compre- hensive set of consumer characteristics and pref- erences which does not include many important brand properties such as perceived quality, risk, price and market presence, the main goal of our in- vestigation is not to build a highly accurate brand preference prediction system. Instead, we want to first establish the feasibility of using derived trait features in building large-scale brand preference prediction systems. In the following, we first sum- marize some prior work, then describe the details of our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Predicting brand preference is a hard problem. A large number of factors may influence customers' choices. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the factors that have been explored in previous research. Due to the scope, so far, there isn't any prior investigation that is capable of incorporating all the factors in a single model. Our study is one of the most com- prehensive analyses so far. We not only investi- gate the influence of a large number of personal traits but also combine them with other known consumer-related features such as demographics and personal interests. We however have not in- cluded any brand-related properties such as per- ceived quality, risk and market presence because we do not have access to these data.</p></div>

Also, there is a large-body of work trying to predict brand pref- erences based on one's social media posts. Most of these work, however is performed in the con- text of sentiment analysis. In sentiment analy- sis, the main focus was to infer the sentiment associated with a post that mentions a particular brand/product. For example, Kim et al. collected 600,000 tweets that contain smartphone-related keywords and then performed sentiment analysis to infer whether a user's attitude toward a par- ticular mobile phone is positive or negative ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kim et al., 2012</ref>). Similarly, Mostafa analyzed the sentiment associated with 3,500+ tweets, which showed a generally positive consumer sentiment towards several famous brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mostafa, 2013)</ref>. In contrast, our trait-based analysis is more gen- eral since it does not require users to explicitly ex- press their opinions about a specific brand. For ex- ample, to infer whether an individual likes BMW or not, with sentiment analysis, a user has to ex-plicitly express his opinion towards BMW (e.g. Driving BMW is exciting!). In contrast, with our system, if we know that he likes to seek excite- ment (excitement, a needs dimension) and enjoys luxury products (Hedonism, a values dimension), we can guess he may like BMW although he has never explicitly mentioned BMW in his social me- dia posts before. This difference is important since among the millions of products on social media, only a small number of products have been explic- itly rated/mentioned by a particular user.</p><p>In summary, brand preferences may be influ- enced by many consumer and brand-related fac- tors. Previous research has not paid sufficient at- tention to the influence of personal traits. In ad- dition, most previous studies used psychometric surveys which are impractical in mass marketing since it is unlikely that a large number of cus- tomers would take the time to answer lengthy sur- vey questions. In this study, we focus on inves- tigating the feasibility of using automatically in- ferred personal traits in large-scale brand prefer- ence prediction. Next, we describe the dataset we collected to support this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Collection</head><p>To investigate how personal traits are related to an individual's brand preferences, we collected two datasets. In the first dataset, in addition to brand preferences, we also used standard psychometric tests to obtain clean and accurate personal trait measures. With this dataset, we can build and evaluate brand preference prediction models that use accurate personal traits. In contrast, the second dataset is used to build and evaluate brand prefer- ence prediction models that use trait features auto- matically inferred from social media. By compar- ing the models built from both datasets, we can answer questions such as: (1) whether personal traits are useful in predicting brand preferences (2) whether the traits automatically inferred from so- cial media are useful in predicting brand prefer- ences.</p><p>To collect these datasets, we designed two Ama- zon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 1 tasks. All the MTurk participants are from the US since people outside the US may be unfamiliar with some of the brands. In the following, we describe the details of each MTurk task.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 http://mturk.com/ Category Brand Beverage (2) Coca-Cola,</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Task 1: PTBP Survey</head><p>To collect the first dataset, we conducted a Per- sonal Traits &amp; Brand Preferences (PTBP) survey. Our trait survey includes five parts designed to measure three types of personal traits: personal- ity, values and needs plus demographics and per- sonal interests. Specifically, since the Big-Five model of personality is the most popular model of personality traits among personality psycholo- gists, we adopted a standard survey for Big 5 per- sonality. Here to limit the time MTurkers need to spend on the survey, instead of the full 300-item personality test, we used the shorter 50-item IPIP survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Goldberg, 1993)</ref> which will score a user along 5 general personality dimensions: open- ness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeable- ness and neuroticism. However, with the shorter survey, we can not obtain the scores for 30 ad- ditional personality facets. Similarly, we used the standard 21-item PVQ survey to obtain the values defined in Schwartz's theory of basic val- ues <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schwartz, 2003)</ref>. We also used the 35-item BNS survey to obtain the needs defined in Ford's needs model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ford, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Yang and Li, 2013</ref>). In addition, we also included survey questions about a user's demographics (e.g., gender, age, marital status, education and income) and personal inter- ests (e.g,, automobile, sports, movies, travel) since they were used in some previous studies on brand preference ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pennacchiotti and Gurumurthy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lin, 2002)</ref>. Finally for each user, we collected her preferences for 22 brands in six categories. We have chosen well-known brands from diverse groups ranging from mobile phones to retail stores and fast food restaurants. The brands within each category are often competitors. For each brand in each category, we asked users to rate their prefer- ences using a 5-point scale: Love, Like, Neutral, Dislike and Hate. A user can choose "n/a" if she has no knowledge of a particular brand. In total, we have collected the data from 1,207 MTurkers.</p><p>To ensure the quality of the data collected from MTurk, we also included several validation ques-tions. The validation questions are pairs of ques- tions that are paraphrases of each other. If the an- swers to a pair of validation questions are signif- icantly different, the user data are excluded from our analysis. Our final dataset has 1,017 valid re- sponses. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> lists all the brands used in our study. All the measures used in our PTBP survey are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Task 2: TAE Survey</head><p>The data collected in the Text Analytics Evalu- ation (TAE) survey are used to study the corre- lation between the trait features inferred from a person's social media posts (e.g., tweets) and his brand preferences. Before the TAE survey, the participants were first asked to verify whether they had a Twitter account, if so, provide us their Twit- ter IDs. The users also agreed that we could access their tweets after the survey. Since our automated trait inference system relies on linguistic cues de- rived from a person's Twitter posts, to ensure we can have a stable and reliable reading of one's personal traits from his tweets, only active Twit- ter users with over 50 tweets (excluding retweets) can participate this survey. Since the majority of MTurkers are not active Twitter users, to increase the size of our data, in addition to MTurk, we also directly invited random Twitter users to participate in our TAE survey.</p><p>In addition to Twitter IDs, we also asked par- ticipants to provide their preferences for the same 22 brands as those used in the PTBP survey. Simi- larly, to filter out data by people who do not follow instructions, we also added two validation ques- tions. In total, in the TAE survey, we have col- lected data from 659 participants, out of which 608 are valid. (550 valid ones are from MTurk, and 109 are from direct Twitter invitation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data Preparation</head><p>To obtain the trait scores for each user based on his answers in the PTBP survey, we first computed the raw trait scores based on the original survey guide- lines. Since different surveys used different scales, we normalized the trait scores by using their rank percentile (e.g., top 1%, top 5%). As a result, all the normalized personal trait scores are between 0 and 1.</p><p>Moreover, for each of the 20 topics of interest, we created a binary variable, indicating whether a participant is interested in a specific topic. In addition, each demographics feature such as age, education, income, was first mapped to an integer and then normalized into a number between 0 and 1.</p><p>To derive the trait scores for a user in the TAE survey, we crawled all the tweets in his Twitter account. Since personal traits are inferred from the text authored by a user, we discarded all the retweets. Due to the restrictions of the Twit- ter API, we can only crawl a maximum of 3,200 tweets for each user 2 .</p><p>Recent research in psycholinguistics has shown it is possible to automatically infer personal traits from one's linguistic footprints such as tweets and blogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yarkoni, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Yang and Li, 2013</ref>). Here, we used a similar ap- proach. Specifically, given input text authored by a user (e.g., tweets), our system computed the word counts of different psychologically-meaningful word categories defined in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pennebaker et al., 2001</ref>). The LIWC counts were then used to build prediction models to correlate one's word usage with his ground truth personal traits ob- tained via a prior psychometric survey. Then the built models were used to automatically infer a user's personal traits. Based on a preliminary eval- uation with 250 participants, more than 80 per- cent of them, scores for traits that were inferred for all three models correlated significantly with survey-based scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation coef- ficient between 0.05 and 0.8). Specifically, scores that were derived by our system correlated with survey-based scores for 80.8% of participants' Big Five scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation coefficients between 0.05 and 0.75), for 86.6% of participants' Needs scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation coefficient between 0.05 and 0.8), and for 98.21% of partic- ipants' Values scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation co- efficients between 0.05 and 0.55). Moreover, the participants also rated on a five-point scale how well each derived characteristic matched their per- ceptions of themselves, and their ratings suggest that the inferred characteristics largely matched their self-perceptions. Specifically, means of all ratings were above 3 ("somewhat") out of 5 ("per- fect"): 3.4 (with a std. of</p><note type="other">1.14) for Big Five, 3.39 (with a std. of 1.34) for Needs, and 3.13 (with a std. of 1.17) for Values.</note><p>In addition to personal traits, we also included topics of interest in the TAE dataset. They were automatically inferred from tweets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ( <ref type="bibr">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>. Since we need a large Twitter dataset to mine a list of general topics of interest, our current tweet col- lection is not sufficient. Therefore, we use a sep- arate and much larger Twitter dataset from 10,000 randomly selected Twitter users. For each user, we crawled his tweets and then aggregated them into a big document, one for each Twitter user. As a re- sult, we have 10,000 documents in our dataset. We then built an LDA topic model using this dataset. From the LDA inference results, we can infer a user's topics of interest. Basically, for a given user u, LDA outputs a per user topic distribution Θ u , which is a T -dimensional vector where T is the number of topics. The value θ u,i is an indication of how likely Topic i is mentioned in user u's tweets. The higher θ u,i is, the more likely that user u is interested in topic i. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows some of the topics automatically learned by LDA.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">table 5</ref> shows all the features from the TAE survey, including those automati- cally inferred from tweets. For personality, fol- lowing the same procedure defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yarkoni, 2010)</ref>, in addition to the Big five personality di- mensions, our system is able to automatically ex- tract 30 additional personality facets for the TAE dataset.</p></div>

Simi- larly, people who have negative opinions are those who gave a hate or dislike rating. People who gave a neutral rating are in the neutral category. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> shows the number of instances in each of the three categories for each brand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Classification</head><p>In this experiment, we want to investigate whether it is possible to differentiate people who have (Pos- itive, Negative, or Neutral) opinions towards dif- ferent brands. For each brand, we built three- way classifiers using different classification algo- rithms including AdaBoost ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Freund and Schapire, 1996)</ref>, Decision Tree (C4.5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Quinlan, 1993)</ref>, Lo- gistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest <ref type="bibr">(Breiman, 2001)</ref>, and SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Platt, 1999)</ref>. In addi- tion, for SVM, we have tested different kernels in- cluding polynomial kernel, pearson VII function- based universal kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( ¨ Ustün et al., 2006</ref>), and the radial basis function kernel. They are all imple- mented in the Weka machine learning toolkit (Hall <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Cola  519  190  115  363  73  67  Pepsi  360  315  153  261  132  110   BMW  382  85  113  280  34  183  Cadillac  239  162  144  212  61  226  Lexus  361  80  119  255  44  200   Chipotle  443  95  103  298  46  114  McDonald's  304  383  143  270  152</ref>    <ref type="bibr">, 2009</ref>). Since our current goal is not to build the best brand preference prediction system, but to show the feasibility of building brand preference prediction systems that are scalable to millions of users, we ran all our classifiers using the default parameter settings from Weka (E.g. for Random Forest, we used 10 trees. The umber of features was set to log2(number of all features)+1.). We expect in the future, by optimizing model parame- ters, we can further improve the prediction power of each model. The baseline classifiers classify every data in- stance into the majority class. Among all the classifiers we tested, we found that overall Naive Bayes has the best performance on both the PTBP and the TAE datasets. In the following, we report the average F-scores and AUC across 22 different brands using Naive Bayes with 10-fold cross val- idations. We created models that use all the user features and also those that use only trait features.  Overall, all the classifiers performed signifi- cantly better than the baselines (p&lt;0.05). More- over, the models using all the features performed similarly to those using only trait features. The differences are not statistically significant. In ad- dition, comparing the models trained on the PTBP data with those on the TAE dataset, their perfor- mances are very similar, although the exact num- bers are not directly comparable since they are from two different datasets.</p><note type="other">Brands PTBP Survey TAE Survey Positive Negative Neutral Positive Negative Neutral Coca-</note><p>To break down the results by product category, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref>, we list the per-brand classification re- sults using only the trait features. The numbers in the parentheses show the F-score percentage in- crease from the baselines. In general, models with trait features did much better than the baselines on both datasets. But their effectiveness varied from one brand to another. For example, the trait fea- tures were very effective in predicting user prefer- ences for Cadillac (50.8% increase on the PTBP dataset and 68.5% increase on the TAE dataset). In contrast, there was barely any improvement for Target. After inspecting the data, it seems this may be caused by the distribution of the data. For instance, the Target TAE data was very skewed. There were 430 people who had positive opinions about Target versus 18 people who had negative opinions. Since the baseline predicts "all people like Target", which resulted in a pretty high F- score (0.781), any further improvement over this baseline became more difficult.  In summary, for the task of differentiating peo- ple who have positive, negative, or neutral opin- ions towards different brands, automatically in- ferred traits can be a good proxy for the clean data derived from psychometric surveys. Models based on the trait features inferred from social media can perform similarly to those using a much larger set of clean features. This result is encouraging since it implies that it is possible to build large-scale brand preference prediction systems that do not re- quire costly psychometric surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Top Features</head><p>In this study, we want to find out what are the most significant features that can be used to differenti- ate a brand's likers from dislikers. The feature se- lection was conducted using logistic regression in SPSS 3 . Due to the page limit, we cannot list all the significant features for all the 22 brands. Here we only show the most important features in predict- ing people who like and dislike luxury car brands based on the PTBP dataset <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">(Table 9</ref>). Based on the regression analysis, all the features are sig- nificantly associated with brand preferences ( p&lt; 0.05). In this table, personal trait features are high- lighted and followed by their types: P (Personali- ties), V (Values), and N (Needs). "+" or "-" means the features contribute positively or negatively to the model. As shown in the table, more than half of all the top features are trait features. For ex- ample, the No. one trait feature to differentiate BMW likers from dislikers is ideal, a trait associ- ated with people who have a desire for perfection. For Cadillac, the top trait is hedonism, which is often associated with people who pursue pleasure and sensuous gratification in life. For Lexus, the most useful feature is self-expression, a trait often associated with people who have a desire to assert their own identifies. Other interesting findings in- clude that females are less likely to be a fan of a luxury car brand than males. This is true across all three luxury car brands. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BMW Cadillac Lexus ideal (N) + have children(no) -sports + love (N) + television + self expression (N) + conscientiousness (P) + hedonism (V) + television + gender(female) -home garden -self enhancement (V) + us news + gender(female) -fashion style + health + conservation (V) + theater - hedonism (V) -self enhancement (V) -agreeableness (P) + challenge (N) -science + openness to change (V) - conservation (V) -love (N) -curiosity (N) + self enhancement (V) + theater -gender(female) -</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiment 2</head><p>In the previous section, we demonstrated that given a particular brand such as Pepsi, it is possi- ble to automatically differentiate the people who have positive, negative or neutral opinions. In <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>: Overall preference rank</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Rank Correlation</head><p>To predict the rank of a product in each category, we trained a multi-class classifier to estimate how likely a user will like a brand. For example, for smart phone brands, since we have four compet- ing brands, we train a 4-way classifier to estimate the likelihood a person likes iPhone, HTC, Nokia and Sony. We then output the preference rank based on the estimated likelihood. Higher likeli- hood means a stronger preference. We also built two types of models, one used all the user features, the other used traits only. We applied them to both the PTBP and the TAE datasets.</p><p>Since our model and the ground truth both pro- duce a ranked list for each product category, here we used rank correlation analysis to evaluate the quality of the predicted ranks. For each user and each product category, we computed the Spear- man's rank correlation coefficient ρ. If the coef- ficient ρ is 1, there is a perfect positive correlation between the predict rank and the ground truth (i.e. both produce identical ranks). If ρ is -1, there is a perfect negative correlation between the predicted rank and the ground truth (i.e., the rank predicted by the system is exactly the opposite of the ground truth). If ρ is 0 , then the predicted rank and the ground truth are randomly related. For each prod- uct category, we report the average ρ across all the users.  We use the overall rank data in <ref type="table">Table 10</ref> as our baseline. Specifically, for each product category, the baseline always ranks all its brands based on the average ranks defined in <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>. For each user and each product category, we compute the ρ between the user's ground truth rank in the survey and the rank produced by the baseline. We com- pute the average ρ across all the users and all the product categories to represent the baseline perfor- mance. For the PTBP data, the average ρ for the baseline is 0.193. For the TAE data, the average ρ is 0.060.</p><p>There are several main findings from these re- sults. First, for all the product categories, the predicted ranks are all significantly and positively correlated with the ground truth (p &lt; 0.05). Also, our models perform significantly better than the non-personalized ranks produced by the baseline. This result is important because it shows that there is a stable and statistically significant agreement between the predicted ranks and the ground truth and the personalized models with additional trait features perform significantly better than the non- personalized baseline system (on PTBP, the aver- age ρ of the model with personal traits is 0.305 versus 0.193 of the baseline. It is 0.403 versus 0.060 on the TAE dataset). Second, the perfor- mance on the TAE dataset is better than that on the PTBP dataset (e.g., the average ρ is 0.403 on TAE versus 0.305 on PTBP when only trait fea- tures were used). This may be due to the fact that in the TAE dataset, in addition to the Big 5 person- ality features, we also automatically extracted 30 personality sub-facets from tweets using the pro- cedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yarkoni, 2010)</ref>. These finer- grained personality features are not available in the PTBP dataset. This result is encouraging since it suggests that using automatically inferred traits can predict brand preferences as well as if not bet- ter than the clean trait features that can be obtained only through costly psychometric evaluations. Fi- nally, for our models, since the overall correlation coefficients ρ are between 0.3 and 0.4, the strength of these correlations is moderate. Thus, it may not be sufficient to build an accurate brand pref- erence prediction system with only user features. Other features especially brand-related features as well as features that capture the compatibility of a brand and a user are needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Top Features</head><p>We used multinomial logistic regression to find the most significant predicting features for each brand category. We show the feature ranks by signifi- cance for survey data in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 12</ref> and 13. Almost all of the top 10 features for each brand are signif- icantly correlated with the ranks. Again, the per- sonal traits features are highlighted and followed by their types: P (Personalities), V (Values), and N (Needs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Direction</head><p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive analy- sis of the relationship between personal traits and brand preferences. Our study includes a large number of personal traits including personality, personal values and individual needs. We collect two datasets: one contains clean user features ob- tained from psychometric surveys; The other in- cludes noisy users features derived automatically from social media posts. We investigate the in- fluence of personal traits in two scenarios: (1) in differentiating people who have positive, negative, or neutral opinion about a brand, (2) in ranking  openness to change (V) cautiousness (P) openness (P) love (N) cooperation (P) achievement striving (P) immoderation (P) intellect (P) altruism (P) sympathy (P) self consciousness (P) anger (P) hedonism (V) morality (P) assertiveness (P) all tweet count harmony (N) cautiousness (P) activity level (P) activity level (P) depression (P) trust (P) vulnerability (P) dutifulness (P) cautiousness (P) immoderation (P) immoderation (P) liberty (N) openness (P) a user's preference of competing brands within a product category. Our findings demonstrated that it is possible to use personal traits in predicting a user's brand preferences. Moreover, we have also shown that automatically inferred user fea- tures are good proxies for the clean trait features that can be acquired only from costly psychome- tric surveys. This work may have significant im- pact on the field of brand preference analysis since this suggests that it is possible for businesses to build scalable marketing tools to identify and tar- get potential customers on social media.</p><p>Brand preference prediction is a hard problem. So far, we have focused primarily on user features. To further improve the prediction accuracy, in the future, we will extend our current study by incor- porating new features such as the properties of a brand as well social influence from people in one's social network. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Average Rank for Each Brand</head><p>For each user, we rank all the brands in each prod- uct category based on his preferences in the sur- vey (e.g., 1 means most preferred brand). We ag- gregate the ranks from all the users and show the overall brand preference ranks for both datasets. As shown in table 10, the overall brand preference ranks for the PTBP and TAE surveys are highly correlated. Half of the product categories have ex- act the same preference ranks for all the products; The other half has only one slightly mis-matched rank in each product category. This suggests that the population participated in the PTBP and TAE survey has very similar brand preference distribu- tions. In the future, it maybe interesting to inves- tigate how this rank is related to different brands' market share. </p></div>			</div>
