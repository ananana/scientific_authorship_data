				<p>We present SetExpander, the term set expansion system based NLP Architect by Intel AI Lab. SetExpander is a corpus-based system for expanding a seed set of terms into a more complete set of terms that belong to the same semantic class. It implements an iterative end-to-end workflow and enables users to easily select a seed set of terms, expand it, view the expanded set, validate it, re-expand the validated set and store it, thus simplifying the extraction of domain-specific fine-grained semantic classes. SetExpander has been used successfully in real-life use cases including integration into an automated recruitment system and an issues and defects resolution system. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Term set expansion is the task of expanding a given partial set of terms into a more complete set of terms that belong to the same semantic class. For example, given a seed of personal assistant application terms like 'Siri' and 'Cor- tana', the expanded set is expected to include addi- tional terms such as 'Amazon Echo' and 'Google Now'. Many NLP-based information extraction applications, such as relation extraction or docu- ment matching, require the extraction of terms be- longing to fine-grained semantic classes as a basic building block. A practical approach to extracting such terms is to apply a term set expansion system. The input seed set for such systems may contain as few as 2 to 10 terms, which is practical to obtain. SetExpander uses a corpus-based approach based on the distributional similarity hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Harris, 1954)</ref>, stating that semantically similar words ap- pear in similar contexts. Linear bag-of-words con- 1 A video demo of SetExpander is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id= 1e545bB87Autsch36DjnJHmq3HWfSd1Rv</p><p>(some images were blurred for privacy reasons).</p><p>text is widely used to compute semantic similar- ity. However, it typically captures more topical and less functional similarity, while for the pur- pose of set expansion, we need to capture more functional and less topical similarity. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For exam- ple, given a seed term like the programming lan- guage 'Python', we would like the expanded set to include other programming languages with similar characteristics, but we would not like it to include terms like 'bytecode' or 'high-level programming language' despite these terms being semantically related to 'Python' in linear bag-of-words con- texts. Moreover, for the purpose of set expan- sion, a seed set contains more than one term and the terms of the expanded set are expected to be as functionally similar to all the terms of the seed set as possible. For example, 'orange' is function- ally similar to 'red' (color) and to 'apple' (fruit), but if the seed set contains both 'orange' and 'yel- low' then only 'red' should be part of the expanded set. However, we do not want to capture only the term sense; we also wish to capture the granular- ity within a category. For example, 'orange' is functionally similar to both 'apple' and 'lemon'; however, if the seed set contains 'orange' and 'ba- nana' (fruits), the expanded set is expected to con- tain both 'apple' and 'lemon'; but if the seed set is 'orange' and 'grapefruit' (citrus fruits), then the expanded set is expected to contain 'lemon' but not 'apple'.</p><p>While term set expansion has received atten- tion from both industry and academia, there are only a handful of available implementations. Rel- ative to prior work, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents an iterative end-to-end workflow that enables users to select an input cor- pus, train multiple embedding models and com- bine them; after which the user can easily select a seed set of terms, expand it, view the expanded set, validate it, iteratively re-expand the validated set and store it. Second, it describes the SetExpander application that provides these abilities. SetEx- pander is based on a novel corpus-based set expan- sion algorithm. This algorithm combines multi- context term embeddings using a neural classi- fier in order to capture different aspects of seman- tic similarity and to make the system more ro- bust across different semantic classes and differ- ent domains. The algorithm is briefly described in Section 3. Our system has been used success- fully in several real-life use cases. One of them is an automated recruitment system that matches job descriptions with job-applicant resumes. An- other use case involves enhancing a software de- velopment process by detecting and reducing the amount of duplicate defects in a validation sys- tem. Section 5 includes a detailed description of both use cases. The system is distributed as open source software under the Apache license as part of NLP Architect by Intel AI Lab. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>State-of-the-art set expansion techniques return the k nearest neighbors around the seed terms as the expanded set, where terms are represented by their co-occurrence or embedding vectors in a training corpus. Vectors are constructed accord- ing to different context types, such as linear bag- of-words context ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Pantel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Shi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rong et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zaheer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gyllensten and Sahlgren, 2018)</ref>, explicit lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Roark and Charniak, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sarmento et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">He and Xin, 2011</ref>), coordinational patterns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sarmento et al., 2007</ref>) and unary patterns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rong et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Shen et al., 2017)</ref>. SetExpander looks at additional context types that can capture functional seman- tic similarities and combines context type embed- dings using a neural classifier.</p><p>Google Sets, now discontinued, was one of the earliest web applications for term set expan- sion. It used methods like latent semantic index- ing to pre-compute lists of similar words from the web. Word Grab Bag 4 is another web application based on a method that builds lists dynamically us- ing word2vec embeddings based on linear bag-of- word contexts, but their algorithm is not publicly described. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wang and Cohen (2007)</ref> pro- posed the SEAL (Set Expander for Any Language) system which automatically finds semi-structured web pages that contain 'lists of' items, and then aggregates these lists so that the most promising items are ranked higher. In our paper, we describe an iterative end-to-end system, including model training and using additional context types.</p><p>Pantel et al. <ref type="formula">(2009)</ref> propose a highly scalable algorithm, implemented in the MapReduce frame- work, for computing semantic similarity, where terms are represented by large and sparse co- occurrence vectors. SetExpander ensures scala- bility by representing terms with small and dense embeddings vectors.</p><p>The current paper extends (Mamou et al., 2018) paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Term Extraction and Representation</head><p>Our approach is based on representing any term of an (unlabeled) training corpus by its word embed- dings in order to estimate the similarity between seed terms and candidate expansion terms.</p><p>Noun phrases provide good approximation for candidate terms and are extracted in our system us- ing a noun phrase chunker. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Term variations, such as aliases, acronyms and synonyms, which refer to the same entity, are grouped together. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Next, we use term groups as input units for embedding training; this enables obtaining more contextual information compared to using individual terms, thus enhancing embedding model robustness. In the remainder of this paper, by language abuse, term will be used instead of term group.</p><p>While word2vec originally uses a linear bag- of-words context around the focus term to learn the term embeddings, the literature describes other possible context types. For each focus term, we extract context units of different types, as follows (see examples in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">and Charniak, 1998</ref>).</p><p>Syntactic Dependency Context (Dep). This context type is defined by the syntactic depen- dency relations in which the focus term partici- pates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Levy and Goldberg, 2014</ref>). Context units consist of terms or other words, along with the type and the direction of the dependency relation. This context type has not been used for set expan- sion in prior work. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Levy and Goldberg (2014)</ref> showed that this context yields more func- tional similarities of a co-hyponym nature than is yielded by linear bag-of-words context, which suggests its relevance for set expansion.</p><p>Symmetric Patterns (SP). Context units con- sist of terms co-occurring with the focus term in symmetric patterns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Davidov and Rappoport, 2006</ref>). For example, the symmetric pattern 'X rather than Y' captures a certain semantic related- ness between the terms X and Y. This context type generalizes coordinational patterns ('X and Y', 'X or Y'), which have been used for set expansion.</p><p>Unary Patterns (UP). This context type is de- fined by the unary patterns in which the focus term occurs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rong et al., 2016)</ref>. Context units consist of n-grams of terms and other words, in which the focus term occurs; ' ' denotes the placeholder of the focus term in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We found that indeed in different domains and for different semantic classes, better similarities are found using different context types. The differ- ent contexts thus complement each other by cap- turing different types of semantic relations. For example, explicit list contexts worked well for the automated recruitment system use case, while unary patterns contexts worked well for the issues and defects resolution use case (discussed in Sec- tion 5). Moreover, explicit lists, syntactic depen- dency, symmetric patterns and unary patterns con- text types tend to capture functional rather than topical semantic similarities. We train a separate term embedding model for each of the five con- text types and thus, for each term, we obtain five different representations.</p><p>Terms are represented by their linear bag- of-words window context embeddings using the word2vec toolkit 8 and by arbitrary context em- beddings using the generic word2vecf toolkit. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . For each focus term in the corpus, &lt;focus term, context unit&gt; pairs are extracted from the corpus and are then fed to the embeddings training al- gorithm. Concerning linear bag-of-words context type, some hyperparameters of the term embed- dings training can be tuned to optimize the set ex- pansion task; in particular, a smaller window size <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rong et al. (2016)</ref>, we extract six n- grams per focus term.</p><p>Given a sentence fragment c−3 c−2 c−1 t c1 c2 c3 where t is the focus term and ci are the context units, the following n-grams are extracted: (c−3 c−2 c−1 t c1), (c−2 c−1 t c1 c2), (c−2 c−1 t c1), (c−1 t c1 c2 c3), (c−1 t c1 c2), (c−1 t c1).</p><p>8 http://code.google.com/archive/p/ word2vec</p><p>9 http://bitbucket.org/yoavgo/ word2vecf seems to capture functional rather than topical se- mantic similarities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Levy and Goldberg, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multi-Context Term Similarity</head><p>To make set expansion more robust, we aim to combine multi-context embeddings. Follow- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berant et al., 2012</ref>), who train a Support Vec- tor Machine (SVM) to combine different similar- ity score features, we train a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier that predicts whether a candidate term should be part of the expanded set based on ten similarity scores (considered as input features) obtained by the five different context types and two different similarity-scoring methods. The two similarity scores are estimated by the cosine sim- ilarity between the centroid of the seed terms and each candidate term, and by the average pairwise cosine similarity between each seed term and each candidate term; both methods ensure that the can- didate term is similar to all the seed terms. MLP is trained on a labeled training set of seed terms and candidate terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Implementation and Evaluation</head><p>NLP Architect by Intel AI Lab 10 has been used for noun phrase chunking, dependency parsing and term embeddings model training. The perfor- mance of the algorithm was first evaluated by the Mean Average Precision at different top n values (MAP@n). MAP@10, MAP@20 and MAP@50 on an English Wikipedia based dataset 11 are re- spectively 0.83, 0.74 and 0.63. These figures indi- cate the quite useful performance of the algorithm, which was further assessed by the use cases de- scribed in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">System Workflow and Application</head><p>This section describes the iterative end-to-end workflow of SetExpander, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Steps 1 &amp; 2: Selecting an Input Corpus and</head><p>Training Models. The first step of the flow is to select an input corpus, performed by select- ing Open (not shown) from the File menu (see the red rectangle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The second step of the flow is to train the models based on the selected corpus, performed by selecting Train Models (not shown) from the Tools menu (see the yellow rect- angle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The "train models" step ex- tracts term groups from the corpus, trains the com- bined term groups embedding models (Section 3.1) and the MLP classifier that predicts whether a candidate term should be part of the expanded set (Section 3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Steps 3 &amp; 4: Selecting and Expanding a Seed</head><p>Set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> also shows the seed set selection and expansion user interface. Each row in the dis- played table corresponds to a different term group. The top 5000 term group names are displayed un- der the Expression column, sorted by their TF-IDF based importance score. Term groups that include more than one term are highlighted in bold, and are represented in the display, by the term with the highest importance score among the terms of the group. Hovering over such a group opens a drop-down list that displays all the terms within the group. The user can choose to exclude spe- cific terms from the group if their semantic mean- ing does not align with that of the group. The Fil- ter text box is used for searching for specific term groups. Upon selecting (clicking) a term group, the context view on the right hand side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> (blurred) displays text snippets from the input cor- pus that include terms that are part of the selected term group (highlighted in green). The context view enables the user to verify the semantic mean- ing of terms in various contexts in the topical do- main.</p><p>The user can create a seed set assembled from specific term groups by checking their Expand checkbox (see the red circle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The user can set a name for the semantic category of the seed set. This name will be used for displaying and storing the seed set and the resulting expanded set of terms. The category name can be selected from a predefined list of category names or added as a new custom category name (see the drop down list in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Once the seed set is assembled, the user can expand the seed set by selecting the Ex- pand option (not shown) in the Tools menu.</p><p>Steps 5 &amp; 6: Edit, Validate and Re-expand. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the output of the expansion pro- cess. The Certainty score represents the relat- edness of each expanded term group to the seed set, as determined by the MLP classifier (Section 3.2). The Certainty scores of term groups that were manually selected as part of the seed set are   set to 1. The user can validate each expanded item by checking the Completed checkbox. The vali- dated list can then be saved and later used as a fine- grained semantic class input to external applica- tions. Following validation, the user can perform re-expansion by creating a new seed set based on the validated expanded terms and the original seed set terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Field Use Cases</head><p>This section describes two use cases in which Se- tExpander has been successfully used.</p><p>Automated Recruitment System. Human matching of applicant resumes to open positions in organizations is time-consuming and costly. Automated recruitment systems enable recruiters to speed up and refine this process. The recruiter provides an open position description and then the system scans the organizations resume repository searching for the best matches. One of the main features that affect the matching is the skills list, for example, a good match between an applicant and an open position regarding specific program- ming skills or experience using specific tools is significant for the overall matching. However, manual generation and maintenance of compre- hensive and updated skills lists is tedious and difficult to scale. SetExpander was integrated into such a recruitment system. Recruiters used the system's user interface <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 2 &amp; 3)</ref> to generate fine-grained skills lists based on small seed sets for eighteen engineering job position categories. We evaluated the recruitment system use case for different skill classes. The system achieved a precision of 94.5%, 98.0% and 70.5% at the top 100 applicants, for the job position categories of Software Machine Learning Engineer, Firmware Engineer and ADAS Senior Software Engineer, respectively.</p><p>Issues and Defects Resolution. Quick identi- fication of duplicate defects is critical for effi- cient software development. The aim of auto- mated issues and defects resolution systems is to find duplicates in large repositories of millions of software defects used by dozens of development teams. This task is challenging because the same defect may have different title names and different textual descriptions. The legacy solution relied on manually constructed lists of tens of thousands of terms, which were built over several weeks. Our term set expansion application was integrated into such a system and was used for generating do- main specific semantic categories such as product names, process names, technical terms, etc. The integrated system enhanced the duplicate defects detection precision by more than 10% and sped- up the term list generation process from several weeks to hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We presented SetExpander, a corpus-based system for set expansion which enables users to select a seed set of terms, expand it, validate it, re-expand the validated set and store it. The expanded sets can then be used as a domain specific semantic classes for downstream applications. Our system was used in several real-world use cases, among them, an automated recruitment system and an is- sues and defects resolution system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SetExpander end-to-end workflow.</figDesc></figure>

Linear Bag-of-Words Context. This context 
type is defined by neighboring context units within 
a fixed length window of context units, denoted by 
win, around the focus term. Both terms and other 
words can be context units. One of its implemen-
tations is word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), widely 
used for NLP tasks including set expansion. 

Explicit Lists. Context units consist of terms co-
occurring with the focus term in textual lists such 
as comma separated lists and bullet lists (Roark
