				<p>People use online platforms to seek out support for their informational and emotional needs. Here, we ask what effect does revealing one&apos;s gender have on receiving support. To answer this, we create (i) a new dataset and method for identifying supportive replies and (ii) new methods for inferring gender from text and name. We apply these methods to create a new massive corpus of 102M online interactions with gender-labeled users, each rated by degree of supportiveness. Our analysis shows widespread and consistent disparity in support: identifying as a woman is associated with higher rates of support-but also higher rates of disparagement.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Despite substantial efforts to reduce gender dis- parities in online social contexts, gender gaps per- sist and, increasingly, negatively affect women through online harassment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Duggan, 2017)</ref>. On- line social platforms still serve a critical role for individuals as they seek to fill informational and emotional needs, frequently by interacting with others ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goswami et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chuang and Yang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hether et al., 2016</ref>). The supportive replies of others help promote personal well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(MacGeorge et al., 2011</ref>), yet unsupportive replies can not only lead to distress but discourage online en- gagement altogether. Given gender disparity in the receipt of anti-social behavior, to what degree does this disparity persist in individuals' receipt of support? We answer this question, illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, by examining supportive and unsupport- ive message rates across millions of online inter- actions, using a new computational model of sup- port. Our work is motivated by an agenda of pro- moting supportive online platforms where people can participate equally.</p><p>This work connects with the growing body of In this fictitious example, KatieZ22 receives a supportive reply from PizzaMagic. In choosing their names, each user has chosen a partic- ular gender performance, signaling female and gender- anonymity, respectively. In online settings, such gender performances evoke stereotypes that affect how others interact and provide access to online resources. Our study asks what effect does this gender signaling have on individuals receiving support and disparagement? computational studies of gender disparity in online behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lam et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Magno and Weber, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garimella and Mihalcea, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Li et al., 2018)</ref>; our work here examines this disparity along a new dimension, support, and unlike prior work, examines disparity along the full spectrum of both pro-social (supportive) and anti-social (unsupport- ive) behaviors. Prior works have also examined the language of support in online support forums for health-related issues ( <ref type="bibr">Biyani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">De Choudhury and De, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Althoff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">De Choudhury and Kiciman, 2017)</ref>, often with the aim of improving people's access. Here, we aim to study support in general, everyday interactions, drawing upon theories of how sup- port is expressed in language ( <ref type="bibr">Cutrona and Suhr, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wright et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Our investigation provides four main contribu- tions. First, we introduce a new task of rating the supportiveness of a message and provide an accompanying dataset of 9,032 post-reply pairs with annotations ( §2). Second, using this data, we develop a new computational model for au- tomatically identifying supportive and unsupport- ive replies ( §3), using theory-based features that operationalize linguistic strategies for giving sup- port. Third, we develop a new state-of-the-art sys-tem for classifying the gender of a username ( §4) and construct a massive dataset of over 102M post- reply pairs from three online platforms ( §5), where participants are labeled by gender. Further, the text of each post is rated for its gender predictiveness, enabling studying gender performance at the name and textual levels. Finally, we apply our support classifier to our social interaction dataset to re- veal wide-spread disparity on the basis of gender ( §6). Our results show that when gender is per- formed, female performances are associated both with higher rates of supportive comments and with higher rates of unsupportive comments, highlight- ing that gender disparity is not just for negative behaviors online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Language of Support</head><p>Individuals engage in online platforms for a va- riety of reasons and supportive responses to this engagement can take many forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Shumaker and Brownell, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vaux, 1985)</ref>, from informational support like advice to emotional support like ex- pressions of sympathy. Responders may choose from different linguistic support strategies de- pending on the speaker and context <ref type="bibr">(Cutrona and Suhr, 1992)</ref>. For example, given an individ- ual commenting on a Wikipedia talk page about their idea for adding new content, a responder may point to an additional resource they can use, whereas given an individual posting to Reddit for relationship advice, a responder may express sym- pathy. Our goal is to study the language and be- havior of everyday supportive or unsupportive in- teractions as they occur on three large social plat- forms: Reddit, StackExchange, and Wikipedia. These platforms represent common settings peo- ple seek out to engage in discussions and ask for help. Therefore, we annotate a dataset by degrees of support and analyze how linguistic expectations of support manifest in online interactions. Data and Annotation Post and reply pairs were selected from the three platforms. Many of these interactions are short and therefore to increase di- versity, annotated pairs were sampled by balanc- ing by platform and the lengths of posts and replies seen in each.</p><p>As a social activity, support is often expressed by drawing upon other social strategies such as politeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feng et al., 2013)</ref>. To help focus annotators' attention on support specifically and disentangle related social cues, we pair our sup- port annotation with contrastive annotation ques- tions for three other related phenomena: agree- ment (with the post's message), politeness, and of- fensiveness. Annotators were asked to rate support on a five-point Likert scale from very unsupport- ive and very supportive, with analogous questions each for agreement and politeness; offensiveness was rated on a five point scale from inoffensive to very offensive. All data was annotated using CrowdFlower with detailed instructions and example replies for each level of the Likert scale. Each task presented five post-reply pairs and with detailed instructions that ask annotators to focus on rating each reply along these four dimensions. Annotators were required to pass a training phase where they had at least 70% agreement with a gold standard annotation on 10 items. After training, each task included one control question, which was used to remove anno- tators whose agreement with the gold standard fell below 70%.</p><p>In total, 9,032 instances were annotated by three annotators, who had a Krippendorff's α of 0.766, indicating substantial agreement on the data <ref type="bibr">(Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the distri- bution of ratings. Support is positively correlated with agreement (r=0.71) and politeness (r=0.51), though annotators rated replies as having more po- liteness than support on average. Support annota- tion examples are shown in  : Support strategies and their presence in our data, as shown through the mean supportiveness rating (-2 to 2) for replies using that strategy and the percentage of posts in the top 25% of the most-supportive that employ the strategy. For supportiveness, posts are compared with all others not employing that strategy, with significance measured using the Mann-Whitney U test. Throughout the paper, *** denotes p&lt;0.001, ** p&lt;0.01, and * p&lt;0.05. and context. <ref type="bibr">Cutrona and Suhr (1992)</ref> proposed a broad taxonomy of support strategies based on in- person interactions, such as offering an appraisal of the current situation or seeking to relieve the other person of blame. We examine to what degree are these strategies employed in online, relatively- anonymous settings and whether their usage on- line is associated with higher perceived support. To test this, support strategies were automatically identified using a combination of regular expres- sions for lexical patterns and dependency-parsed trees, together with specialized lexicons matching each strategy and rules for detecting negation. For example, suggestions were detected by identifying a second-person subject with a modal verb indicat- ing possibility <ref type="bibr">(Quirk et al., 1985, p. 219</ref>).</p><p>Many of the strategies suggested by <ref type="bibr">Cutrona and Suhr (1992)</ref> for expressing support in per- son were also observed online; <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the average supportiveness rating for replies contain- ing each strategy, where supportiveness is cen- tered to <ref type="bibr">[−2, 2]</ref>. Further, their effect on perception of supportiveness, while small, is significant and positive for many. However, we do observe two notable negative trends. First informational sup- port strategies of aiding a person by reassessing their situation (e.g., offering a new perspective) and by teaching were considered less supportive. We observed that in several cases these strategies were employed when an individual was not seek- ing support, in which case unrequested new infor- mation can appear condescending. Indeed, replies employing these two support strategies were still rated polite, 0.30 and 0.31 mean politeness respec- tively, suggesting the context in which new infor- mation is given weighs heavily on whether it is treated as supporting the individual.</p><p>Support can also be conveyed implicitly through unconscious stylistic choices. Rains (2016) notes linguistic accommodation is fre- quently observed in supportive responses, where individuals match the function word frequency of the original communication <ref type="bibr">(Bucholtz and Hall, 2005</ref>; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011). Shown in the bottom of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we observe only a weak non-significant positive association between support and accommodation (as measured using Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. <ref type="formula">(2011)</ref>), though the single post-reply unit of analysis limits our ability to detect long-term accommodation across multiple dialog turns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liviatan et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Li and Feng (2014)</ref> found that supportive replies often to contain more emotional language, which evokes a personal connection and intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Spottswood et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Braithwaite et al., 1999</ref>). Shown in the bottom of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we find a signifi- cant and positive association where more emotive posts are viewed as more supportive.</p><p>Finally, we note that a few strategies suggested by <ref type="bibr">Cutrona and Suhr (1992)</ref> were not seen in our annotated dataset. Strategies of offering to partici- pate, using physical affection, assurances of confi- dentiality, material and financial loans, and prayer were not seen; a broader scan of our unannotated data did find these attested but rare in practice. We attribute this rareness to the public, online nature of the interactions, in contrast to the interpersonal setting studied by <ref type="bibr">Cutrona and Suhr (1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Computational Model of Support</head><p>Our primary objective is to measure the relation- ship between identity and support in online social systems. Therefore, we next develop a classifier to automatically label replies with support.</p><p>Features As a social activity, the language of sup- port draws upon multiple lexical and stylistic cues. We base on classifier on theory-inspired and data- driven features. The first set consists of the opera- tionalized linguistic strategies for expressing sup- port, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. Further, in constructing our feature set, we build upon past linguistic anal- yses of related social-situated language. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wellman and Wortley (1990)</ref> note that the availability of support is related to social distance, which is in part expressed linguistically through the degree of formality <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hovy, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sigley, 1997)</ref>. Therefore, we include features from <ref type="bibr">Pavlick and Tetreault (2016)</ref>, which examined linguistic markers of for- mality. Advice giving is a core component of many theories of support <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(MacGeorge et al., 2011</ref>) and such advice is frequently wrapped in polite- ness language <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feng et al., 2013</ref>), e.g., hedging suggestions rather than imposing direction, which provides face-saving opportunities for the per- son receiving support <ref type="bibr">(Clark and Schunk, 1980)</ref>. Therefore, we include the feature set of Danescu- Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Mizil et al. (2013)</ref>, which though fo- cused on requests, provides many general lexical patterns for politeness.</p><p>Beyond these, we include features motivated by observational studies of support. In analyzing on- line support groups, <ref type="bibr">Alpers et al. (2005)</ref> found that LIWC ( <ref type="bibr">Pennebaker and Stone, 2003</ref>) was valid as a construct for analyzing messages and com- pared similarly human judgments about the cat- egories. To capture emotional language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Li and Feng, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liviatan et al., 2008)</ref>, we include the NRC emotion lexicons of <ref type="bibr">Mohammad and Turney (2013)</ref>. Given the informational support strategy, we include lexicons from argumentation for cap- turing explanatory replies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Teufel, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Support may be given in response to stressors, which change in nature throughout a person's life- time <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vaux, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Segrin, 2003)</ref>. To potentially capture variation in the language of support based on the posting individuals, we include features known to be associated with age such as elon- gation and capitalization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Goswami et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barbieri, 2008)</ref>, grammatical differences in sen- tence construction and length <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hovy and Søgaard, 2015)</ref>, and a lexicon for age of acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kuperman et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Data-driven features include (1) lexical fea- tures capturing the presence of n-grams, their rel- ative frequency, (2) grammatical features from dependency-parsed triples, which are also backed off to parts of speech, (3) word lexicons for for- mality, sentiment, and subjectivity, (4) style fea- tures such as word and sentence length, complex- ity, and use of contractions, and (5) the average word vector for the sentence.</p><p>In total, our model includes 23,903 features, the bulk of which are n-grams and dependency triples. A detailed listing of all features is provided in Sup- plemental §1.</p><p>One notable feature that we did not include was the presence of self-disclosure in a reply, which has been linked to high-social support as a way of conveying connection and empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wright et al., 2003)</ref>. While computational models for self- disclosure have been proposed ( <ref type="bibr">Bak et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">De Choudhury and De, 2014)</ref>, we were unable to scale these methods to the size of our analysis. Task Setup Support ratings are discretized to create a ternary classification task with labels {−1, 0, 1}, denoting unsupportive, neutral, and supportive comments. Ratings were discretized by treating all those ratings ≤-0.67 as negative and those with a rating ≥0.67 as positive.</p><p>A Random Forest classifier was trained on all 23,903 features; random forests are robust to over- fitting even with large numbers of features, mak- ing them suitable for this high-dimensional fea- ture space <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014</ref>). Fur- thermore, random forests are able to learn con- junctive features, allowing us to learn how com- binations of strategies are employed to yield sup- port. As the majority of posts are neutral, we mit- igate the class imbalance using SMOTE ( <ref type="bibr">Chawla et al., 2002</ref>) to generate synthetic examples in the   training fold using the 5 nearest neighbors, taking care to avoid contamination of the test set. The classifier is implemented using Scikit-learn (Pe- dregosa et al., 2011) and syntactic processing was done using spaCy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Honnibal and Johnson, 2015)</ref>. Word vectors are the publicly released Google- News word2vec vectors ( <ref type="bibr">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. Three works have examined related tasks where <ref type="bibr">Biyani et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Khanpour et al. (2018)</ref> classify posts in online cancer support groups as providing informational or emotional support and  classify the degree of support along these dimensions. Here, we solve a more general task that includes unsupportive comments and is in the general domain. Evaluation We compare our full model for pre- dicting support against three models: our 14 fea- tures for detecting support strategies from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table  2</ref>, a model trained on the subset of unigram fea- tures <ref type="bibr">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr">352)</ref>, and a model trained on bigram fea- tures <ref type="bibr">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr">897)</ref>, the latter of which is known to be a strong lexical baseline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang and Manning, 2012</ref>). All models were tested using five-fold cross-validation with Macro-F1 for evaluation and including baselines for labeling instances at ran- dom or choosing the most frequent.</p><p>Our full model obtains substantial improve- ments over all baselines and models, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. Further, the simple support strategy fea- tures provide a large and statically-significant im- provement over the two baselines. The model us- ing support strategy features performs similarity to the unigram model, despite having two orders of magnitude fewer features. A follow-up analysis on cross-platform performance, described in Sup- plemental §1.2, showed that while within-platform performance was relatively high (0.54 Macro F1 for Reddit and 0.53 for Wikipedia), performance for the more technical StackExchange site was lower both within (0.44) and across (0.40 when trained on Reddit and 0.42 when on Wikipedia).</p><p>Examining our full model's most important fea- tures showed that the two support strategies for validation and compliments (cf. Table 2) were the most important features, followed closely by lexicons for emotion: Anger in LIWC, Disgust in NRC, and the positive sentiment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Liu et al. (2005)</ref>, all of which were motivated by theory. These results confirm that our theory-inspired fea- tures are both salient for supportiveness and effec- tive as features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Inferring Gender</head><p>As a part of interacting, individuals present a view of themselves as an interlocutor, revealing aspects about themselves such as gender through explicit means <ref type="bibr">(Marwick, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Allen and Wiles, 2016</ref>), e.g., profile pictures, or through implicit-and potentially unconscious-cues such as stylistic choices in language (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Eckert and McConnellGinet, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bamman et al., 2014</ref>). In the rela- tively anonymous and deindividuated online set- ting, these identity cues can have a profound im- pact on how other perceive and interact with them (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Mickelson et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Herring, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ammari et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Megarry, 2014</ref>) and these min- imal gender cues give rise to full-fledged social stereotypes and, potentially, the negative behav- ior that comes when treating someone as a stereo- type ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kiesler et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lea and Spears, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Postmes et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wang et al., 2009</ref>). Here, we develop methods for inferring gender from two signals: (1) names that users chose; and (2) im- plicit cues conveyed by linguistic features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Gender from Names</head><p>Prior work has developed models for inferring gender from username alone (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Liu and Ruths, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jaech and Ostendorf, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knowles et al., 2016)</ref>. Here, we de- velop a new character-based neural model that incorporates rich gender-labeled username infor- mation for identifying additional gender-salience cues in usernames from roles and attributes, e.g., <ref type="bibr">SuperDad1</ref> or AspiringActress99. Data Individuals convey their gender in multi- ple ways beyond using gender-associated names. Therefore, to capture this variety, we collect user- names from two online platforms where users have self-declared their perceived gender. First, Twit- ter usernames and screen names were collected from a 10% sample from 2014 to 2017. Here, we identify usernames whose biography contains an explicit mention of their gender, e.g., by stat- ing a gendered role "mom to two kids" or spec-ifying pronoun preferences "he/him/his." Gen- dered profiles were collected for 4,900,250 indi- viduals using a selection of lexical patterns with aggressive filtering to remove false positives. Sec- ond, we collect 283,427 usernames from Reddit identified through self-declarations of gender in /R/RELATIONSHIPS, e.g., " <ref type="bibr">- huber, 1997</ref>). Following platform restrictions on usernames, character sequences are restricted to being in ascii range and are embedded into 16 di- mensional vectors as input. Adopting best prac- tices ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015)</ref>, batch normaliza- tion is applied prior to the dense layer used to com- pute the gender prediction. LSTMs were sized at 256 after limited hyperparameter tuning on devel- opment data. We optimize with Adam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) with a learning rate of 0.002. Training and Evaluation All data is partitioned into 80% train, 10% development, and 10% test splits. As some usernames are repeated in dif- ferent communities, we keep only one unique in- stance prior to partitioning to avoid leakage be- tween partitions.</p><note type="other">I [23F] need to talk to my boyfriend [27M]", and 84,068 usernames where the user has chosen a gender-indicating flair (a visual icon displayed within the subreddit). These two sources provide much-needed variation for gender in usernames beyond those mirroring full names. Model Given a username, we infer gender us- ing a character-based encoder consisting of three stacked LSTM networks (Hochreiter and Schmid</note><p>Training mini-batches were balanced for both genders, which yielded better performance in tests on the development data. We compare the perfor- mance of our model on the test set against two cur- rent state-of-art systems available off the shelf for inferring gender from usernames, demographer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knowles et al., 2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jaech and Ostendorf (2015)</ref>. Demographer is trained on names from the Social Security Administration and the method of Jaech and Ostendorf (2015) is trained on user- names from OkCupid and uses 3.5M Snapchat usernames for self-learning to improve accuracy.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, our model outperforms both systems by substantial margins for both Twit- ter and Reddit data. In tests on data from both pa- pers reported in Supplemental §3, our model also outperforms their systems. High accuracy is not expected for these models in most domains, as many usernames do not signal gender.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Gender from Text</head><p>Gender can also manifest through more subtle, stylistic cues (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schnoebelen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Flekova and Gurevych, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bamman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Volkova et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garimella and Mihalcea, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carpenter et al., 2016</ref>). Thus, even when a person chooses a neutral username, their linguis- tic style may reveal their gender. Therefore, we construct a regression model to infer the degree to which either gender is expressed through text. Data and Model Gender-labeled post data was constructed using held-out data from our three platforms where posts were authored by a user with a high-confidence gender prediction. Posts were randomly sampled across forums (e.g., sub- reddits) from the held-out data to achieve gender parity with 555K posts for Wikipedia, and 58K for StackExchange; Reddit was subsampled to 1M posts total due to its size. Features were selected by drawing upon prior work: (i) stylistic features like punctuation and number frequencies, casing, word length and (ii) content features including n-grams, sentiment, and specialized lexicons like LIWC. A full listing of features is reported in Supplemental §1.</p><p>Following prior work ( <ref type="bibr">Bamman et al., 2014</ref>), a logistic regression model was trained for each platform using L2 regression; we adopt separate models for each to better adapt to any platform- specific gender variation. Evaluation Models were evaluated using AUC with five-fold cross validation, with 0.661 AUC for StackExchange, 0.700 for Wikipedia, and 0.661 for Reddit. The models perform substan- tially better than random choice (0.5) for the chal- lenging task of inferring gender from a single post, as many posts contain no signal of gender. Addi- tional analyses are reported in Supplemental §1.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Gender and Support</head><p>The gender cues provided through computer medi- ated communication provide enough information that a person will fill in the result with a stereotype ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lea and Spears, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Spears and Lea, 1992)</ref>. What effect might this stereotyping have for ac- cess to support? While establishing full causality for an answer is infeasible in our current observa- tional study, we take the first step by quantifying whether disparity in support exists and examine what contextual factors may affect support giving. Using our classifier, we label the 102M post-reply pairs from our dataset ( §5), which includes both high-confidence and gender-neutral users. Model To quantify access to support, we construct separate mixed-effect logistic regression models for predicting the dependent variable of whether a post will receive a supportive reply and for whether it will receive an unsupportive reply. Ran- dom effects are added for each community within a platform, which capture the variance in sup- port rates between communities, e.g., due to dif- ferences in community norms, topic, or size. As fixed effects, we include a categorical variable for name-inferred gender, always using the gender- neutral condition as the reference coding, which, critically, allows us to examine the changes of sup- port for revealing gender relative to users whose identity is effectively anonymous. We include the predicted probability of a user's gender from their writing ( §4.2), centered to [−0.5, 0.5] such that 0 denotes a gender-neutral writing style. Finally, we include interaction terms for writing and names to capture effects of joint gender performance. Results Three main results are observed. First, <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Logistic regression coefficients for predicting whether a post will receive a supportive reply (left) or unsupportive reply (right) on the basis of a gendered name and writing (denoted ), with coefficients for name and writing interactions. Name gender is categorical with the reference coding is neutral.

Our results agree with those from the small scale study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feng et al. (2013)</ref> who found that accounts with hu- man pictures and person-sounding usernames re- ceive higher social support. Indeed, while several studies have touted the benefits of anonymity on- line for discussing sensitive topics <ref type="bibr">(Campbell and Wright, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wright, 2002a,b)</ref>, our results sug- gest that selecting a gender neutral name may lead to lower support overall. Our findings also rein- force the observation that the personal-anonymity online does not lead to equal support due to cues about identity ( <ref type="bibr">Postmes and Spears, 2002</ref>).</p><p>Second, the rates of supportive and unsupport- ive comments are significantly associated with both kinds of gender performances (i.e., names and writing style). These results suggest that on- line audiences are sensitive to both kinds of overt and implicit gender displays and that even innocu- ous choices such as gendered usernames can shape our online interactions.</p><p>Third, when gender is performed in together name and writing, female performances are con- sistently associated across all three platforms with higher rates of receiving supportive replies and un- supportive replies. Note that this trend is seen in the cumulative effect on support after combin- ing coefficients for the interactions term with the coefficients for writing and name. We illustrate this cumulative effect for two types of gender per- formances in Reddit, shown as separate axes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Indeed, when a user has a gendered username, the cumulative effect of male writing performance is consistently associated with fewer supportive replies.

Does the replier's gender matter? <ref type="bibr">Mickelson et al. (1995)</ref> note that men and women differ in how they receive support, with the gender com- position of the interacting pair driving the kind of supportive behavior. Here, we examine whether men and women differ in the rates they give sup- port to one another, using gendered names as a proxy for identity. Because only Reddit has suffi- cient data, we construct a mixed-effect regression model for Reddit using the 4.5M post-reply pairs where the replier has a high-confidence or neutral gender and include the replier's gender as a factor with interactions for the poster. The results shown in <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> reveal two main conclusions. First, men and women give supportive comments at different rates, with women being far more likely to leave supportive replies and less likely to leave unsup- portive replies. Second, the interaction terms show that there is minimal dyadic interaction between the gender identities of the poster and replier with SUP.

We only observe significant inter- actions indicating (1) replying users with female names are less likely to leave supportive replies to posting users with female names and (2) replying users with male names are i) more likely to leave supportive replies to other users with male names, ii) less likely to leave supportive comments if the writing appears more female, iii) more likely to leave unsupportive comments if the posters name is female, and iv) less likely to leave unsupportive comments if the writing appears more female.</p><p>Limitations The observations of our study should still be viewed within its practical limitations, of which we note two. First, in examining the content of replies, we do not control for potential direct or indirect requests for help in text that may ulti- mately affect the rates of support. This issue could be a potential confound, as the cultural norms for masculinity often promote self reliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Addis and Mahalik, 2003)</ref>, ultimately leading to gen- dered differences in requests. Second, this obser- vational study cannot establish causality between gender displays and support; while the disparity is real, exogenous factors could potentially explain the disparity without finding gender displays as a cause, though the mixed effects still control for some contextual variability in the different sup- port frequencies across communities. In spite of these limitations, we view this work as an impor- tant first step for demonstrating gender disparity in support-both positive and negative-and inviting future work to establish a causal explanation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Ethical Considerations</head><p>The use of gender as a variable in NLP requires that we also discuss ethical considerations result- ing from this work, as it directly relates to identity and the dignity of persons being studied. Follow- ing the guidelines of Larson (2017) for using gen- der in NLP, our use of gender is intentional and central to this study on gender disparities in re- ceived support. We base our notion of gender as one of linguistic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(DeFrancisco et al., 2013)</ref>, in which individuals adapt their style and name to emphasize or de-emphasize certain as- pects of their gender identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Eckert, 2008)</ref>. Ac- cordingly, we have opted represent gender per- formance along a graded scale, though we recog- nize that this representation does not capture non- binary gender identities. The gender inference methods introduced here raise ethical considerations as they ultimately en- able automatic identification of gender for any person on the basis of name or writing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hamidi et al., 2018)</ref>. Such technology could be used to unfairly identify and target persons of either gen- der for malicious behavior or may harm through misgendering individuals. Ultimately, we decided that such risk was acceptable given the positive impact of our study on revealing gender dispar- ity. We hope to also use our method to bet- ter support privacy-preserving behavior <ref type="bibr">(Allen and Wiles, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reddy and Knight, 2016)</ref> by help- ing individuals identify and change names or state- ments that would indicate a particular gender. Fur- ther, we hope that when used in combination with our support classifier and a larger context of gen- dered interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Voigt et al., 2018)</ref>, these tech- nologies can identify healthy communities that are supportive of all people.</p></div>

Reddit Reddit data was selected using a longitu-
dinal sample of one month (July) per year, from 
2006 to 2017, and a continuous sample of one full 
year's data in 2017. Our initial data consists of the 
top 10,000 subreddits ordered by the total num-
ber of posts in the data. From these communi-
ties we restrict our analysis to a comment and its 
first reply, which reduces confounds from multi-
party communication. These post-reply pairs were 
further filtered to remove non-English posts us-
ing Google CLD2 (McCandless, 2010), yielding 
434.29M candidate communications. 
StackExchange StackExchange (SE) contains 
substantial social interaction in the comment to 
posts and replies (Ahn et al., 2013; Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013). These communi-
cations often expand beyond the immediate topic. 
Directed communication within these comments 
is frequently signaled using an explicit mention 
starting with an "," which we use to identify 
pairs. In total, we collected post-reply pairs from 
the full history of all StackExchange, yielding 
3.16M pairs across 162 sites. 
Wikipedia Wikipedia features an active social 
component in its talk pages, with more per-
sonal communication-or even personal attacks-
during debates around appropriateness or sug-
gested changes (Bender et al., 2011). Similar to 
Reddit, we construct post-reply pairs by identify-
ing each comment and its first response on a talk 
page, yielding 26.7M pairs from 387K talk pages.
