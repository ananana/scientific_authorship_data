					<note>Translation Technologies at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. Dr. Roukos received his B.E. from the American University of Beirut, in 1976, his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the University of Florida, in 1978 and 1980, re-spectively. He joined Bolt Beranek and Newman from 1980 through 1989, where he was a Senior Scientist in charge of projects in speech compres-sion, time scale modification, speaker identifica-tion, word spotting, and spoken language under-standing. He was an Adjunct Professor at Boston University in 1988 before joining IBM in 1989.</note>

			<abstract>
				<p>Electronically available multi-modal data (primarily text and meta-data) is unprecedented in terms of its volume, variety, velocity , (and veracity). The increased interest and investment in cognitive computing for building systems and solutions that enable and support richer human-machine interactions presents a unique opportunity for novel statistical models for natural language processing. In this talk, I will describe a journey at IBM during the past three decades in developing novel statistical models for NLP covering statistical parsing, machine translation , and question-answering systems. Along with a discussion of some of the recent successes, I will discuss some difficult challenges that need to be addressed to achieve more effective cognitive systems and applications.</p>
