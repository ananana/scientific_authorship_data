				<p>In this paper, we address the problem of generating English tag questions (TQs) (e.g. it is, isn&apos;t it?) in Machine Translation (MT). We propose a post-edition solution , formulating the problem as a multi-class classification task. We present (i) the automatic annotation of English TQs in a parallel corpus of subtitles and (ii) an approach using a series of classifiers to predict TQ forms, which we use to post-edit state-of-the-art MT outputs. Our method provides significant improvements in En-glish TQ translation when translating from Czech, French and German, in turn improving the fluidity, naturalness, grammatical correctness and pragmatic coherence of MT output.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>When it comes to the machine translation (MT) of discourse, revisiting the question of what consti- tutes a high quality translation is essential; which aspects of language should be tackled and how to evaluate them. A first step is to identify the many stylistic aspects of speech that pose a prob- lem for current MT techniques and to study how they could be taken into account and evaluated.</p><p>We take a step in this direction by addressing a new aspect of discourse in MT, related to speaker attitude and style: the English tag question (here- after TQ), i.e. utterances such as catchy, ain't it? and it wasn't him, was it?. When translating into English, TQs present two main challenges. The first is knowing when to generate one. Similar to the translation of discourse connectives, TQ use is a question of style and speaker attitude, and im- portantly, there is not often a direct, lexical corre- spondence across languages. TQs are common in English and far less so in other languages, which means that other contextual cues are necessary to determine whether a TQ should appear in the En- glish translation. The second, in particular for canonical TQs (e.g. was it?, isn't it?), is that the overall grammaticality of the utterance is deter- mined by the correct choice of tag, which, in a similar way to anaphor translation, is grammati- cally dependent on the rest of the MT output.</p><p>Our aim in this paper is to improve the gener- ation of English TQs in an MT setting with En- glish as the target language. We formulate this as a multi-class classification task, using features from both source sentences and machine translated out- puts. The prediction of the appropriate question tag to use in the English translation (if any) is then used to post-edit MT outputs. Our results, when translating from Czech (CS), French (FR) and German (DE) into English (EN), display sig- nificant improvements, as shown by automatic and manual evaluations (Sec. 5). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">English tag questions (TQs)</head><p>TQs are interrogative constructions, common in spoken English, formed of a main clause (typically declarative), followed by a peripheral interrogative element, the question tag:</p><p>(1) You do believe in happy endings, don't you?</p><p>(2) He can't do that, can he?</p><p>In its canonical form, the English question tag (in bold) is formed of an auxiliary verb, which can be negated, followed by a pronoun. It parallels the verb and subject (underlined) of the preceding host clause (in italics). The grammatical structure of TQs and agreement between the host and the tag gives them the name of grammatical TQs. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> There exists a second type of TQ, lexical TQs, formed of a word or phrase that is invariant to the subject and verb of the host clause. For example: <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref> He's a proper bad man, innit?</p><p>(8) There's got to be a cure, right?</p><p>TQs' functions are complex and communicate information about speaker attitude, tone, the rela- tionship between dialogue participants, common ground and dialogue flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(McGregor, 1995</ref>). Yet few languages have such a systematic use of TQs, in particular of grammatical <ref type="bibr">TQs, as English (Axelsson, 2011</ref>). When translating into English, the first difficulty is appropriately generating English TQs from a source sentence that does not have a TQ; the complex and often ambiguous functions of TQs (e.g. expressing doubt or surprise) can be expressed differently, and subtly, in the source lan- guage. The second difficulty is ensuring gram- matical coherence of canonical TQs. Consider the German sentence Sie lebt noch, nicht wahr? and its English translation She's alive, isn't she?. The choice of the question tag isn't she? is depen- dent on the subject and verb of the anchor clause. Had the translation been She still lives, the correct question tag would have been doesn't she?.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related work</head><p>Discourse is a growing field in MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hardmeier, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hardmeier, , 2014</ref>). To our knowledge, there has been no previous work on TQs in MT, but the two main challenges described above are similar to those associated with two pre- viously studied discursive aspects: the translation of discourse connectives and of anaphoric pro- nouns. As with TQs, their frequency is relatively low, but their mistranslation has a high impact on coherence, naturalness and therefore human un- derstanding of translations (Meyer and Popescu- Belis, 2012).</p><p>Discourse connectives (e.g. since, because) in- dicate the relation between discursive units and are linked to the overall coherence of a text in a simi- lar way to TQs. They often have no direct mapping when translated <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Meyer and Webber, 2013)</ref> and it is often necessary to generate a discourse connec- tive or a TQ where one is not present in the source sentence. Previous work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Meyer and Webber (2013)</ref> consists in the disambiguation of discourse connectives in source sentences prior to transla- tion, using automatic sense classification, which guides the MT system's choice of how a discourse connective should be translated (if at all). How- ever they do not handle the case of generating dis- course relations from a source sentences in which they do not appear lexically, as is our aim for TQs.</p><p>The difficulty of anaphoric pronoun translation is ensuring grammatical agreement between a pro- noun and its coreferent, when the information rel- evant to grammatical agreement in the target lan- guage is not present in the source language. For example, the French translation of the pronoun it in I hear an owl but I can't see it is translated as le or la, depending on whether owl is translated as masc. hibou or fem. chouette. The position of the coreferent, as with the subject and verb for TQs, is not pre-determined, and identifying which words the translated pronoun or TQ must agree with is not always easy. The majority of works perform classification of pronominal forms in view to post- editing MT output <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Guillou, 2016)</ref>, encouraged by the shared task on cross-lingual pronoun predic- tion at <ref type="bibr">DiscoMT15 (Hardmeier et al., 2015</ref>) and WMT16 ( . We use the same strategy here, since the coherent use of TQs, like anaphors, is dependent on the MT translation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Our post-edition approach</head><p>Our method to improve the generation of English TQs in MT is the automatic post-edition of state- of-the-art MT outputs. We formulate the problem as a supervised, multi-class classification task, ex- ploiting lexical features from source sentences and their machine translations (Sec. 4.2). Possible la- bels are the different question tag forms (e.g. isn't it, ok). Predicted tags are either used to replace the question tag already present in the MT output or appended to it otherwise. We test our method for three source languages (CS, DE and FR) into EN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Corpus annotation for English TQs</head><p>The first step is to produce annotated data. The corpora used cover three language pairs: CS- EN, DE-EN and FR-EN, and are large subsets of the most recent films of the OpenSubtitles 3 par- allel corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lison and Tiedemann, 2016</ref>). The subtitles were automatically cleaned using heuris- tics and processed with the MElt tokeniser <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Denis and Sagot, 2012</ref>) and the Moses truecaser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Koehn et al., 2007</ref>). We then developed robust, manually defined lexical rules to identify English TQs. We identify both the presence of TQs and the question tags themselves (e.g. is it?, right?).</p><p>A manual evaluation on a random subset of 500 grammatical TQs and 500 lexical TQs shows that annotations are near perfect (accuracy of ≈98% and recall of 100% on sentence-final grammatical TQs whose host clause is in the same subtitle). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Each corpus was divided into three sets: TRAIN ( 2 3 ), DEV ( 1 6 ) and TEST <ref type="formula">( 1  6</ref> ). The distribution of TQs is shown in Tab. 1. TQs make up approx- imately 1% of subtitles, but are common among questions (≈20%). There are between 238 and 285 distinct English question tags, depending on the language pair (including a label none for non- TQs). The most frequent question tag is right? (≈20%), followed by ok? (≈16%). The major- ity of labels are grammatical question tags, but the most frequent (isn't it?) represents only ≈3% of all TQs, revealing a huge class imbalance.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: TQ distribution for each language pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Question tag classification</head><p>Given the class imbalance (Sec. 4.1) and the dif- ferent nature of lexical and grammatical TQs, we hypothesise that first predicting the presence of an English TQ before selecting tag forms is prefer- able to directly predicting tags in a single, direct pass. We compare a single statistical classifier (hereafter CL-ONE), which directly predicts the question tag (including the label none), to a more complex system using a sequence of classifiers (hereafter CL-SEQ, see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). In CL-SEQ, a first classifier (CL-SEQ coarse ) predicts a coarse-grained label gram (grammatical TQ), lex (lexical TQ) or none (non-TQ), which determines which classi- fier (CL-SEQ lex or CL-SEQ gram ) is used to predict the tag form. Both CL-SEQ coarse and CL-SEQ lex are statistical classifiers. CL-SEQ lex is trained on the TRAIN examples assigned the label lex by CL- SEQ coarse , which explains why it provides a second chance to predict grammatical or non-TQs. CL- SEQ gram is a rule-based system, a choice that is better adapted to the sparse labels of grammatical TQs. Where there is no rule available, this system too can predict the label none.</p><note type="other">(i) CL-SEQcoarse predicts classes gram, lex and none</note><p>Experimental setup All statistical classifiers are linear classifiers trained using Vowpal Wabbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Langford et al., 2009</ref>). <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> To account for class im- balance, examples are weighted according to their relative frequency in the TRAIN set, and the de- gree of weighting is optimised on the DEV set. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Features used for all statistical classifiers are de- scribed just below. The rule-based CL-SEQ gram system relies on the MT output alone.</p><p>Features We use automatically and manually defined lexical feature templates. Unless indicated the features apply to both the source sentence and the MT output. The first set of features are au- tomatically identified bag-of-word features, which represent the 500 uni-, bi-and tri-grams most as- sociated with a TQ, as measured by a G 2 test. The second set of features are manually defined, based on language-specific question-response pat- terns and recognisable lexical clues. They include (i) the presence of a question tag (and its form), (ii) the presence of a final question mark, (iii) (CS and DE only) whether the following subtitle con- tains a verb that appears in the current subtitle (and if so, we include as a feature the verb type and the preceding word in both the current and following subtitles) 8 , (iv) the following subtitle contains a specific response (from a predefined list of replies <ref type="bibr">5</ref> http://hunch.net/ ˜ vw/ 6 We use "OAA", FTRL-proximal optimisation, L2 regu- larisation (λ = 1e − 6) and quadratic features. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We vary weights from equal for all examples to weights that fully counterbalance the class distribution.</p><p>8 In German and Czech, it is common for a reply to a yes/no question to repeat the verb of the question, e.g. Poslala jsi mu to? 'Did you send it to him?' -Poslala jsem 'Yes, I did' (lit. 'send (I) did') ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gruet-Skrabalova, 2013</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Precision (P), Recall (R), F-score (F) and fine-grained labelling precision (P*) for the TEST set on each language pair. Results are given for each coarse-grained TQ class (gram, lex and non-TQ).</p><p>Labelling precision is calculated on the subtitles with the corresponding predicted coarse-grained label. Marked in grey are the cells containing the best F-scores for coarse-grained label groupings and the overall labelling precision (for fine-grained classes).</p><p>such as OK, yes, no, etc.), and (v) the first words of the MT output (1-4 gram), the last auxiliary, the last pronoun and the last pronoun-auxiliary pair.</p><p>Rule-based grammatical TQ prediction Our rule-based approach is designed to predict which grammatical tag should be appended to a given translation. The rules consist in the identification of certain lexical cues from the translation. For instance, utterance-initial words can be a good in- dicator of the use of a particular question tag: im- peratives such as let's ... (indicative of the tag shall we), and claims about the interlocutor's perception such as you think... or you know... (indicative of the tag don't you). When there is a single auxiliary and subject, these are directly used to construct a question tag, using, as a simplification, the oppo- site polarity to that of the anchor clause, which is the most common polarity pattern in TQs. We in- clude several rules to account for complex clauses and perform grammatical checking between the subject and auxiliary of the question tag. The com- plete set of rules is available at the address cited in Footnote 1.</p><p>"Baseline" MT outputs For Czech and Ger- man, we use the top systems at WMT16, both at- tentional encoder-decoder NMT models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Sennrich et al., 2016</ref>). For French, we trained a phrase- based model with Moses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Koehn et al., 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Baseline predictions are automatically extracted from the MT outputs using our English TQ identi- fication rules (Sec. 4.1). <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We use a combination of three phrase tables and three 4- gram KenLM language models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Heafield et al., 2013)</ref>, trained on Europarl, Ted Talks and 3M-sentence subtitles, tuned us- ing kbmira on a disjoint 2.5K-sentence subset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results and analysis</head><p>As mentioned by Hardmeier (2012), evaluating coherence-related MT phenomena is problematic. A question tag can be the correct choice without matching the question tag form in the reference translation (Sec. 2), making traditional metrics in- volving lexical comparison (including all standard MT evaluation metrics) ill-adapted to the task.</p><p>Despite this, we provide in Tab. 2 results us- ing traditional metrics. To get a better view of the scores, we group final predicted question tags into their coarse-grained classes (gram, lex, none) and calculate the precision (P), recall (R) and F-score (F) for these three classes. Within each coarse- grained class, we also provide labelling precision (P*), corresponding to the number of question tags within that coarse-grained class assigned the cor- rect question tag form according to the gold label. Labelling precision is also given overall for all test sentences (in the final column).</p><p>Overall labelling precision is significantly im- proved for all language pairs with both classifica- tion systems, but in particular for CL-SEQ. This is partly due to a better prediction of non-TQs, rep- resented by the high corresponding F-scores for CL-SEQ for all three language pairs. However it is also linked to a better labelling of grammatical and lexical TQs, which can be seen by the high la- belling precision (P*) in the context of high recall (R). The higher scores of CL-SEQ over CL-ONE, particularly in terms of recall, which are most likely a result of question tag label sparsity, show that our two-tier strategy of predicting grammat- ical and lexical tags separately is better adapted than a single classifier.</p><p>There is a notable drop in recall between CL-Source Reference Baseline CL-SEQ</p></div>

This is most likely due to the huge class imbalance in the different question tags (221 grammatical tags vs. 16 lexical tags), which causes the purely statistical one-pass sys- tem to favour the more frequent lexical tags and struggle to predict the wide range of much rarer grammatical tags.  Tab. 4 shows a comparison of baseline and pre- dicted tags for the DE→EN test set. For ease of illustration, the question tags are again regrouped into their three coarse-grained classes (gram, lex and none). The matrix reveals that for predicted lexical tags and non-TQs, the majority were cor- rectly classed into these coarse-grained classes. However, grammatical tags proved more difficult to predict, the majority being classed as non-TQs, most likely a result of the fact that no such tag question was present on the German source side. The most common errors on this test set were pre- dicting a non-TQ when a lexical tag was expected. For example, CL-SEQ predicted none 1112 times when the gold tag right? was expected. How- ever the number of correct predictions of right ex- ceeded this number (1371 cases) and compared to baseline predictions, all coarse-grained categories show an improvement in recall.</p><p>Manual analysis Given the drawbacks of auto- matic metrics, we manually evaluated a set of final translations post-edited with the predictions pro- duced by the CL-SEQ system for DE→EN. We randomly selected 100 examples for which the baseline translation was modified and, comparing the baseline and CL-SEQ prediction, we labelled the example as improved (baseline incorrect and prediction correct) or degraded (baseline correct and prediction incorrect) or equal (both baseline and prediction (in)correct). Examples of these choices are provided in Tab. 3. We found that post- edition made an improved choice of tag in 59/100 examples (compared to 13 worse choices). Only 25 of the 59 improved examples exactly matched the reference tag, confirming the problem of re- lying solely on traditional metrics. We notice in particular an improvement in the choice of gram- matical TQs (33 out of the 59 improvements).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and perspectives</head><p>Improvements in the generation of English TQs in MT outputs, as seen by our manual analysis, result in improved grammatical coherence, particularly for grammatical TQs. However, TQ translation is far from solved. As a stylistic aspect, its prediction and evaluation are complex and should be further explored. Possible improvements include improv- ing the choice of linguistic information used and using this work to explore how TQs' functions are portrayed in languages other than English.</p><p>Interesting future work would be to compare the opposite approach to the task; augmenting source sentences with disambiguating information prior to translation, particularly within an NMT frame- work, which has good potential for handling non- local context and integrating extra features.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: CL-SEQ classification: (i) into coarsegrained classes, (ii-iii) prediction of forms</figDesc></figure>
