				<p>Different approaches to high-quality grammatical error correction have been proposed recently, many of which have their own strengths and weaknesses. Most of these approaches are based on classification or statistical machine translation (SMT). In this paper, we propose to combine the output from a classification-based system and an SMT-based system to improve the correction quality. We adopt the system combination technique of Heafield and Lavie (2010). We achieve an F 0.5 score of 39.39% on the test set of the CoNLL-2014 shared task, outperforming the best system in the shared task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Grammatical error correction (GEC) refers to the task of detecting and correcting grammatical er- rors present in a text written by a second language learner. For example, a GEC system to correct English promises to benefit millions of learners around the world, since it functions as a learning aid by providing instantaneous feedback on ESL writing.</p><p>Research in this area has attracted much interest recently, with four shared tasks organized in the past several years: Helping Our Own (HOO) 2011 and 2012 <ref type="bibr">(Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dale et al., 2012)</ref>, and the CoNLL 2013 and 2014 shared tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ng et al., 2014)</ref>. Each shared task comes with an annotated corpus of learner texts and a benchmark test set, facilitating further re- search in GEC.</p><p>Many approaches have been proposed to de- tect and correct grammatical errors. The most dominant approaches are based on classification (a set of classifier modules where each module ad- dresses a specific error type) and statistical ma- chine translation (SMT) (formulated as a transla- tion task from "bad" to "good" English). Other ap- proaches combine the classification and SMT ap- proaches, and often have some rule-based compo- nents.</p><p>Each approach has its own strengths and weak- nesses. Since the classification approach is able to focus on each individual error type using a sep- arate classifier, it may perform better on an er- ror type where it can build a custom-made classi- fier tailored to the error type, such as subject-verb agreement errors. The drawback of the classifica- tion approach is that one classifier must be built for each error type, so a comprehensive GEC sys- tem will need to build many classifiers which com- plicates its design. Furthermore, the classification approach does not address multiple error types that may interact.</p><p>The SMT approach, on the other hand, natu- rally takes care of interaction among words in a sentence as it attempts to find the best overall cor- rected sentence. It usually has a better coverage of different error types. The drawback of this ap- proach is its reliance on error-annotated learner data, which is expensive to produce. It is not pos- sible to build a competitive SMT system without a sufficiently large parallel training corpus, consist- ing of texts written by ESL learners and the corre- sponding corrected texts.</p><p>In this work, we aim to take advantage of both the classification and the SMT approaches. By combining the outputs of both systems, we hope that the strengths of one approach will offset the weaknesses of the other approach. We adopt the system combination technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Heafield and Lavie, 2010)</ref>, which starts by creating word-level alignments among multiple outputs. By perform- ing beam search over these alignments, it tries to find the best corrected sentence that combines parts of multiple system outputs.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as fol-lows:</p><p>• It is the first work that makes use of a system combination strategy to improve grammatical error correction;</p><p>• It gives a detailed description of methods and experimental setup for building compo- nent systems using two state-of-the-art ap- proaches; and</p><p>• It provides a detailed analysis of how one ap- proach can benefit from the other approach through system combination.</p><p>We evaluate our system combination approach on the CoNLL-2014 shared task. The approach achieves an F 0.5 score of 39.39%, outperforming the best participating team in the shared task.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 gives the related work. Section 3 describes the individual systems. Section 4 ex- plains the system combination method. Section 5 presents experimental setup and results. Section 6 provides a discussion and analysis of the results. Section 7 describes further experiments on system combination. Finally, Section 8 concludes the pa- per.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Grammatical Error Correction</head><p>Early research in grammatical error correction fo- cused on a single error type in isolation. For ex- ample, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Knight and Chander (1994)</ref> built an article correction system for post-editing machine trans- lation output.</p><p>The classification approach has been used to deal with the most common grammatical mistakes made by ESL learners, such as article and prepo- sition errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Han et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chodorow et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gamon, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011;</ref>, and more recently, verb errors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rozovskaya et al., 2014b</ref>). Statis- tical classifiers are trained either from learner or non-learner texts. Features are extracted from the sentence context. Typically, these are shallow fea- tures, such as surrounding n-grams, part-of-speech (POS) tags, chunks, etc. Different sets of fea- tures are employed depending on the error type addressed.</p><p>The statistical machine translation (SMT) ap- proach has gained more interest recently. Earlier work was done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brockett et al. (2006)</ref>, where they used SMT to correct mass noun errors. The major impediment in using the SMT approach for GEC is the lack of error-annotated learner ("par- allel") corpora. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mizumoto et al. (2011)</ref> mined a learner corpus from the social learning platform Lang-8 and built an SMT system for correcting grammatical errors in Japanese. They further tried their method for English ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mizumoto et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Other approaches combine the advantages of classification and SMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a</ref>) and sometimes also include rule-based components. Note that in the hybrid approaches proposed previously, the output of each compo- nent system might be only partially corrected for some subset of error types. This is different from our system combination approach, where the out- put of each component system is a complete cor- rection of the input sentence where all error types are dealt with.</p><p>State-of-the-art performance is achieved by both the classification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dahlmeier et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rozovskaya et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rozovskaya et al., 2014a</ref>) and the SMT approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Felice et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014)</ref>, which motivates us to attempt system output com- bination from both approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">System Combination</head><p>System combination is the task of combining the outputs of multiple systems to produce an out- put better than each of its individual component systems. In machine translation (MT), combin- ing multiple MT outputs has been attempted in the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Callison-Burch et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bojar et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>One of the common approaches in system com- bination is the confusion network approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rosti et al., 2007b</ref>). In this approach, a confusion net- work is created by aligning the outputs of multi- ple systems. The combined output is generated by choosing the output of one single system as the "backbone", and aligning the outputs of all other systems to this backbone. The word order of the combined output will then follow the word order of the backbone. The alignment step is critical in system combination. If there is an alignment er- ror, the resulting combined output sentence may be ungrammatical.</p><p>Rosti et al. (2007a) evaluated three system com- bination methods in their work:</p><p>• Sentence level This method looks at the com- bined N-best list of the systems and selects the best output.</p><p>• Phrase level This method creates new hy- potheses using a new phrase translation ta- ble, built according to the phrase alignments of the systems.</p><p>• Word level This method creates a graph by aligning the hypotheses of the systems. The confidence score of each aligned word is then calculated according to the votes from the hy- potheses.</p><p>Combining different component sub-systems was attempted by CUUI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rozovskaya et al., 2014a</ref>) and CAMB <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Felice et al., 2014</ref>) in the CoNLL-2014 shared task. The CUUI system em- ploys different classifiers to correct various error types and then merges the results. The CAMB system uses a pipeline of systems to combine the outputs of their rule based system and their SMT system. The combination methods used in those systems are different from our approach, because they combine individual sub-system components, by piping the output from one sub-system to an- other, whereas we combine the outputs of whole systems. Moreover, our approach is able to com- bine the advantages of both the classification and SMT approaches. In the field of grammatical error correction, our work is novel as it is the first that uses system combination to improve grammatical error correction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Component Systems</head><p>We build four individual error correction systems. Two systems are pipeline systems based on the classification approach, whereas the other two are phrase-based SMT systems. In this section, we describe how we build each system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Pipeline</head><p>We build two different pipeline systems. Each sys- tem consists of a sequence of classifier-based cor- rection steps. We use two different sequences of correction steps as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. As shown by the table, the only difference between the two pipeline systems is that we swap the noun number and the article correction step. We do this because there is an interaction between noun number and article correction. Swapping them generates sys- tem outputs that are quite different.</p><p>Step Pipeline 1 (P1) Pipeline 2 (P2 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">)  1  Spelling  Spelling  2  Noun number  Article  3  Preposition  Preposition  4  Punctuation  Punctuation  5  Article  Noun number  6</ref> Verb form, SVA Verb form, SVA <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: The two pipeline systems.</p><p>We model each of the article, preposition, and noun number correction task as a multi-class clas- sification problem. A separate multi-class confi- dence weighted classifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Crammer et al., 2009</ref>) is used for correcting each of these error types. A correction is only made if the difference between the scores of the original class and the proposed class is larger than a threshold tuned on the devel- opment set. The features of the article and prepo- sition classifiers follow the features used by the NUS system from HOO 2012 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dahlmeier et al., 2012</ref>). For the noun number error type, we use lexical n-grams, ngram counts, dependency rela- tions, noun lemma, and countability features.</p><p>For article correction, the classes are the arti- cles a, the, and the null article. The article an is considered to be the same class as a. A sub- sequent post-processing step chooses between a and an based on the following word. For prepo- sition correction, we choose 36 common English prepositions as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dahlmeier et al., 2012</ref>). We only deal with preposition replacement but not preposition insertion or deletion. For noun number correction, the classes are singular and plural.</p><p>Punctuation, subject-verb agreement (SVA), and verb form errors are corrected using rule- based classifiers. For SVA errors, we assume that noun number errors have already been corrected by classifiers earlier in the pipeline. Hence, only the verb is corrected when an SVA error is de- tected. For verb form errors, we change a verb into its base form if it is preceded by a modal verb, and we change it into the past participle form if it is preceded by has, have, or had.</p><p>The spelling corrector uses Jazzy, an open source Java spell-checker <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . We filter the sugges- tions given by Jazzy using a language model. We accept a suggestion from Jazzy only if the sugges- tion increases the language model score of the sen- tence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Statistical Machine Translation</head><p>The other two component systems are based on phrase-based statistical machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Koehn et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>It follows the well- known log-linear model formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Och and Ney, 2002)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ e = arg max e P (e|f ) = arg max e exp M m=1 λ m h m (e, f ) (1)</formula><p>where f is the input sentence, e is the corrected output sentence, h m is a feature function, and λ m is its weight. The feature functions include a trans- lation model learned from a sentence-aligned par- allel corpus and a language model learned from a large English corpus. More feature functions can be integrated into the log-linear model. A decoder finds the best correctionêcorrectionˆcorrectionê that maximizes Equa- tion 1 above.</p><p>The parallel corpora that we use to train the translation model come from two different sources. The first corpus is NUCLE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dahlmeier et al., 2013</ref>), containing essays written by students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) which have been manually corrected by English instruc- tors at NUS. The other corpus is collected from the language exchange social networking website Lang-8. We develop two versions of SMT sys- tems: one with two phrase tables trained on NU- CLE and Lang-8 separately (S1), and the other with a single phrase table trained on the concate- nation of NUCLE and Lang-8 data (S2). Multiple phrase tables are used with alternative decoding paths ( . We add a word-level Levenshtein distance feature in the phrase table used by S2, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Felice et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">JunczysDowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014</ref>). This feature is not included in S1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">System Combination</head><p>We use MEMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Heafield and Lavie, 2010)</ref> to combine the outputs of our systems. MEMT uses METEOR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banerjee and Lavie, 2005</ref>) to perform alignment of each pair of outputs from the compo- nent systems. The METEOR matcher can identify exact matches, words with identical stems, syn- onyms, and unigram paraphrases.</p><p>MEMT uses an approach similar to the confu- sion network approach in SMT system combina- tion. The difference is that it performs alignment on the outputs of every pair of component systems, so it does not need to choose a single backbone. As MEMT does not choose any single system out- put as its backbone, it can consider the output of each component system in a symmetrical manner. This increases word order flexibility, as choosing a single hypothesis as the backbone will limit the number of possible word order permutations.</p><p>After creating pairwise alignments using ME- TEOR, the alignments form a confusion network. MEMT will then perform a beam search over this graph to find the one-best hypothesis. The search is carried out from left to right, one word at a time, creating a partial hypothesis. During beam search, it can freely switch among the component sys- tems, combining the outputs together into a sen- tence. When it adds a word to its hypothesis, all the words aligned to it in the other systems are also marked as "used". If it switches to another input sentence, it has to use the first "unused" word in that sentence. This is done to make sure that ev- ery aligned word in the sentences is used. In some cases, a heuristic could be used to allow skipping over some words <ref type="figure">(Heafield et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>During beam search, MEMT uses a few features to score the hypotheses (both partial hypotheses and full hypotheses):</p><p>• Length The number of tokens in a hypoth- esis. It is useful to normalize the impact of sentence length.</p><p>• Language model Log probability from a lan- guage model. It is especially useful in main- taining sentence fluency.</p><p>• Backoff The average n-gram length found in the language model.</p><p>• Match The number of n-gram matches be- tween the outputs of the component systems and the hypothesis, counted for small order n-grams.</p><p>The weights of these features are tuned using Z- MERT (Zaidan, 2009) on a development set. This system combination approach has a few advantages in grammatical error correction. ME- TEOR not only can match words with exact matches, but also words with identical stems, syn- onyms, and unigram paraphrases. This means that it can deal with word form, noun number, and verb form corrections that share identical stems, as well  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0"># sentences # source tokens  NUCLE  57,151  1,161,567  Lang-8  1,114,139  12,945,666  CoNLL-2013  1,381  29,207  CoNLL-2014  1,312  30,144  English  Wikipedia  86,992,889  1,778,849,655   Table 2</ref>: Statistics of the data sets.</p><p>as word choice corrections (with synonyms and unigram paraphrases).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>Our approach is evaluated in the context of the CoNLL-2014 shared task on grammatical error correction. Specific details of the shared task can be found in the overview paper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ng et al., 2014</ref>), but we summarize the most important details rele- vant to our study here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data</head><p>We use NUCLE version 3.2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dahlmeier et al., 2013)</ref>, the official training data of the CoNLL- 2014 shared task, to train our component systems. The grammatical errors in this corpus are catego- rized into 28 different error types. We also use the "Lang-8 Corpus of Learner English v1.0" 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tajiri et al., 2012</ref>) to obtain additional learner data. En- glish Wikipedia 3 is used for language modeling and collecting n-gram counts. All systems are tuned on the CoNLL-2013 test data (which serves as the development data set) and tested on the CoNLL-2014 test data. The statistics of the data sets can be found in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluation</head><p>System performance is evaluated based on pre- cision, recall, and F 0.5 (which weights precision twice as much as recall). Given a set of n sen- tences, where g i is the set of gold-standard edits for sentence i, and e i is the set of system edits for sentence i, precision, recall, and F 0.5 are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P = n i=1 |g i ∩ e i | n i=1 |e i | (2) R = n i=1 |g i ∩ e i | n i=1 |g i |<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">F 0.5 = (1 + 0.5 2 ) × R × P R + 0.5 2 × P<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the intersection between g i and e i for sen- tence i is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g i ∩ e i = {e ∈ e i |∃g ∈ g i , match(g, e)} (5)</formula><p>The official scorer for the shared task was the MaxMatch (M 2 ) scorer 4 (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b). The scorer computes the sequence of sys- tem edits between a source sentence and a system hypothesis that achieves the maximal overlap with the gold-standard edits. Like CoNLL-2014, F 0.5 is used instead of F 1 to emphasize precision. For statistical significance testing, we use the sign test with bootstrap re-sampling on 100 samples.</p></div>

We use the WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fellbaum, 1998</ref>) morphology software to generate singular and plural word sur- face forms.</p><p>The article, preposition, and noun number cor- rectors use the classifier approach to correct errors. Each classifier is trained using multi-class confi- dence weighted learning on the NUCLE and Lang- 8 corpora. The classifier threshold is tuned using a simple grid search on the development data set for each class of a classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">SMT System</head><p>The system is trained using Moses ( , with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for word alignment. The translation table is trained using the "parallel" corpora of NUCLE and Lang-8. The table contains phrase pairs of maximum length seven. We include five standard parameters in the translation table: forward and reverse phrase trans- lations, forward and reverse lexical translations, and phrase penalty. We further add a word-level Levenshtein distance feature for S2.</p><p>We do not use any reordering model in our sys- tem. The intuition is that most error types do not involve long-range reordering and local reorder- ing can be easily captured in the phrase translation table. The distortion limit is set to 0 to prohibit reordering during hypothesis generation.</p><p>We build two 5-gram language models using the corrected side of NUCLE and English Wikipedia. The language models are estimated using the KenLM toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heafield et al., 2013</ref>) with mod- ified Kneser-Ney smoothing. These two language models are used as separate feature functions in the log-linear model. Finally, they are binarized into a probing data structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heafield, 2011)</ref>. Tuning is done on the development data set with MERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Och, 2003)</ref>.

The test data is input into both the pipeline and SMT system respectively and the output from each system is then matched using METEOR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banerjee and Lavie, 2005</ref>). Feature weights, based on BLEU, are then tuned using Z- MERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zaidan, 2009)</ref>. We repeat this process five times and use the weights that achieve the best score on the development data set in our final com- bined system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Results</head><p>Our experimental results using the CoNLL-2014 test data as the test set are shown in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref>: Performance of the pipeline, SMT, and combined systems on the CoNLL-2014 test set. All improvements of combined systems over their component systems are statistically signifi- cant (p &lt; 0.01). The differences between P1 and S1 and between P2 and S2 are not statistically sig- nificant.</p><p>ensure a fairer evaluation (i.e., without using alter- native answers). First, we can see that both the pipeline and SMT systems individually achieve relatively good results that are comparable with the third high- est ranking participant in the CoNLL-2014 shared task. It is worth noting that the pipeline systems only target the seven most common error types, yet still perform well in an all-error-type setting. In general, the pipeline systems have higher recall but lower precision than the SMT systems.</p><p>The pipeline system is also sensitive to the or- der in which corrections are applied; for example applying noun number corrections before article corrections results in a better score. This means that there is definitely some interaction between grammatical errors and, for instance, the phrase a houses can be corrected to a house or houses de- pending on the order of correction.</p><p>We noticed that the performance of the SMT system could be improved by using multiple trans- lation models. This is most likely due to domain differences between the NUCLE and Lang-8 cor- pus, e.g., text genres, writing style, topics, etc. Note also that the Lang-8 corpus is more than 10 times larger than the NUCLE corpus, so there is some benefit from training and weighting two translation tables separately.</p><p>The performance of the pipeline system P1 is comparable to that of the SMT system S1, and likewise the performance of P2 is comparable to that of S2. The differences between them are not statistically significant, making it appropriate to combine their respective outputs.</p><p>Every combined system achieves a better result than its component systems. In every combina- tion, there is some improvement in precision over the pipeline systems, and some improvement in re- call over the SMT systems. The combination of the better component systems (P1+S1) is also sta- tistically significantly better than the combination of the other component systems (P2+S2). Com- bining all four component systems yields an even better result of 39.39% F 0.5 , which is even better than the CoNLL-2014 shared task winner. This is significant because the individual component sys- tems barely reached the score of the third highest ranking participant before they were combined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>In this section, we discuss the strengths and weak- nesses of the pipeline and SMT systems, and show how system output combination improves perfor- mance. Specifically, we compare P1, S1, and P1+S1, although the discussion also applies to P2, S2, and P2+S2.</p><p>Type performance. We start by computing the recall for each of the 28 error types achieved by each system. This computation is straightforward as each gold standard edit is also annotated with error type. On the other hand, precision, as men- tioned in the overview paper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ng et al., 2014)</ref>, is much harder to compute because systems typically do not categorize their corrections by error type. Although it may be possible to compute the pre- cision for each error type in the pipeline system (since we know which correction was proposed by which classifier), this is more difficult to do in the SMT and combined system, where we would need to rely on heuristics which are more prone to er- rors. As a result, we decided to analyze a sample of 200 sentences by hand for a comparatively more robust comparison. The results can be seen in <ref type="table">Ta- ble 4</ref>.</p><p>We observe that the pipeline system has a higher recall than the SMT system for the following er- ror types: ArtOrDet, Mec, Nn, Prep, SVA, Vform, and Vt. Conversely, the SMT system generally has a higher precision than the pipeline system. The combined system usually has slightly lower pre- cision than the SMT system, but higher than the pipeline system, and slightly higher recall than the SMT system but lower than the pipeline system. In some cases however, like for Vform correction, both precision and recall increase.</p><p>The combined system can also make use of cor- rections which are only corrected in one of the systems. For example, it corrects both Wform and Pform errors, which are only corrected by the SMT system, and SVA errors, which are only cor- rected by the pipeline system.</p><p>Error analysis. For illustration on how sys- tem combination helps, we provide example out- put from the pipeline system P1, SMT system S1, and the combined system P1+S1 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref>. We illustrate three common scenarios where sys- tem combination helps: the first is when P1 per- forms better than S1, and the combined system chooses the corrections made by P1, the second is the opposite where S1 performs better than P1 and the combined system chooses S1, and the last is when the combined system combines the correc- tions made by P1 and S1 to produce output better than both P1 and S1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Additional System Combination Experiments</head><p>We further evaluate our system combination ap- proach by making use of the corrected system out- puts of 12 participating teams in the CoNLL-2014 shared task, which are publicly available on the shared task website. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Specifically, we combined the system outputs of the top 2, 3, . . . , 12 CoNLL- 2014 shared task teams and computed the results. In our earlier experiments, the CoNLL-2013 test data was used as the development set. How- ever, the participants' outputs for this 2013 data are not available. Therefore, we split the CoNLL- 2014 test data into two parts: the first 500 sen- tences for the development set and the remaining 812 sentences for the test set. We then tried com- bining the n best performing systems, for n = 2, 3, . . . , 12. Other than the data, the experimen- tal setup is the same as that described in Sec- tion 5.5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 6</ref> shows the ranking of the par- ticipants on the 812 test sentences (without alter- </p></div>

Note that since we use a subset of the original CoNLL-2014 test data for testing, the ranking is different from the official CoNLL-2014 ranking. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 7</ref> shows the results of system combina- tion in terms of increasing numbers of top sys- tems. We observe consistent improvements in F 0.5 when we combine more system outputs, up to 5 best performing systems. When combining 6 or more systems, the performance starts to fluctu- ate and degrade. An important observation is that when we perform system combination, it is more effective, in terms of F 0.5 , to combine a handful of high-quality system outputs than many outputs  of variable quality. Precision tends to increase as more systems are combined although recall tends to decrease. This indicates that combining multi- ple systems can produce a grammatical error cor- rection system with high precision, which is useful in a practical application setting where high preci- sion is desirable. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows how the perfor- mance varies as the number of combined systems increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a system combination ap- proach for grammatical error correction using MEMT. Our approach combines the outputs from two of the most common paradigms in GEC: the pipeline and statistical machine translation ap- proach. We created two variants of the pipeline and statistical machine translation approaches and showed that system combination can be used to combine their outputs together to yield a superior system. Our best combined system achieves an F 0.5 score of 39.39% on the official CoNLL 2014 test set without alternative answers, higher than the top participating team in CoNLL 2014 on this data set. We achieved this by using component systems which were individually weaker than the top three systems that participated in the shared task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Performance in terms of precision (P ), recall (R), and F 0.5 versus the number of combined top systems.</figDesc></figure>
