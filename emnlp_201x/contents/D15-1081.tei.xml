				<p>Linking named mentions detected in a source document to an existing knowledge base provides disambiguated entity referents for the mentions. This allows better document analysis, knowledge extraction and knowledge base population. Most of the previous research extensively exploited the linguistic features of the source documents in a supervised or semi-supervised way. These systems therefore cannot be easily applied to a new language or domain. In this paper, we present a novel unsuper-vised algorithm named Quantified Collective Validation that avoids excessive linguistic analysis on the source documents and fully leverages the knowledge base structure for the entity linking task. We show our approach achieves state-of-the-art English entity linking performance and demonstrate successful deployment in a new language (Chinese) and two new domains (Biomedical and Earth Science). Experiment datasets and system demonstration are available at http://tw.rpi.edu/web/doc/ hanwang_emnlp_2015 for research purpose.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Motivation</head><p>The entity linking (EL) task aims at analyzing each named entity mention in a source document and linking it to its referent in a knowledge base (KB). Consider the following example: "One day after released by the Patriots, Florida born Cald- well visited the Jets. ...... The New York Jets have six receivers on the roster: Cotchery, Coles, ...". Here "Caldwell" is an ambiguous mention * These authors contributed equally to this <ref type="bibr">work.</ref> because not only are there thousands of people with different professions named "Caldwell", but even if as an American football player, as most people would recognize it from the context, there are several "Caldwell"s who are/were associated with either "the Patriots" or "the Jets". An EL system should be able to disambiguate the men- tion by carefully examining the context and then identify the correct KB referent, which is Reche Caldwell in this case.</p><p>Although EL has attracted a lot of community attention in the recent years, most research efforts have been focused on developing systems only ef- fective for generic English corpora. When these systems are migrated to a new language or do- main, their performance will usually suffer from a noticeable decline due to the following reasons:</p><p>1) State-of-the-art EL systems have developed comprehensive linguistic features from the source documents to generate advanced representations of the mentions and their context. While this methodology has been proved rewarding for a resource-rich language such as English, it prevents the systems from being adopted to a new language, especially to one with limited linguistic resources. One can imagine that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for an English EL system that benefits from the part-of-speech tagging, depen- dency parsing, and named entity recognition to be deployed to a new language such as Chinese that has quite different linguistic characteristics.</p><p>2) The current EL approaches mostly target at people, organizations, and geo-political entities which are widely present in a general KB such as Wikipedia. However, domain-specific EL tends to pay more attention to entities beyond the above three types. For instance, in the biomedical sci- ence domain, protein is a major class of entities that greatly interest scientists. Conventional EL systems are very likely to fail in linking protein mentions in the text due to the lack of labeled training data. Moreover, their reliance on general reference KBs seems insufficient for a specific do- main. Take "A20", a type of protein as an example. Wikipedia has more than a few items listed un- der the name of "A20" and their types range from aircrafts to roads. This diversified information in- evitably introduces noise for a biomedical EL ap- plication.</p><p>One potential solution to tackle these limita- tions is, instead of concentrating on the source documents, to conduct more deliberate study on the KB. Structured KBs such as DBpedia 1 typi- cally offer detailed descriptions about entities, a large collection of named relations between enti- ties, and a growing number of multi-lingual en- tity surface forms. By embracing these ready- for-use information and linked structures, we will be able to obtain sufficient contextual information for disambiguation without generating a full list of linguistic features from the source documents, and therefore eliminate the language dependency. Moreover, currently there exist numerous pub- licly available domain ontology repositories such as BioPortal 2 and OBO Foundry 3 which provide significantly more domain knowledge than general KBs for EL to leverage. By incorporating these domain ontologies, we can easily increase the en- tity coverage and reduce noise for deploying EL in various new domains.</p><p>In order to make the most of the KB structure, the mention context should be matched against the KB such that the relevant KB information can be extracted. A collective way of aligning co-occurred mentions to the KB graph has been proved to be a successful strategy to better rep- resent the source context <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fern√°ndez et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cucerzan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dalton and Dietz, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zheng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pan et al., 2015)</ref>. We take a further step to consider quantitatively differentiating entity relations in the KB in or- der to evaluate entity candidates more precisely. Meanwhile, we jointly validate these candidates by aligning them back to the source context and in- tegrating multiple ranking results. This novel EL framework deeply exploits the KB structure with a light weight representation of the source context, and thus enables a smooth migration to new lan-guages and domains.</p><p>The main novel contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 1) We design an unsuper- vised EL algorithm, namely, Quantified Collec- tive Validation (QCV) that builds KB entity can- didate graphs with quantified relations for the pur- pose of collective disambiguation and inference. 2) We develop a procedure of building language and domain independent EL systems by incorpo- rating various ontologies into the QCV compo- nent. 3) We demonstrate that our system is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in English EL, and it can also produce promising results for Chinese EL as well as EL in Biomedical Science and Earth Science.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Baseline Collective EL</head><p>As a baseline, we adopt a competitive unsuper- vised collective EL system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zheng et al., 2014</ref>) utilizing structured KBs. It defines entropy based weights for the KB relations, and embeds them in a two-step candidate ranking process to produce the EL results.</p><p>Structured KB Terminologies: In a structured KB, a fact is usually expressed in the form of a triple: (e h , r, e t ) where e h , e t are called the head entity and the tail entity, respectively, and r is the relation between e h and e t .</p><p>Entropy Based KB Relation Weights: The goal is to leverage various levels of granularity of KB relations. The calculation of the relation weight H(r) is given in Equation (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H(r) = ‚àí et‚ààEt(r) P (e t ) log(P (e t ))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where E t (r) is the tail entity set for r in the KB, and P (e t ) is the probability of e t appearing as the tail entity for r in the KB. Salience Ranking: As the first ranking step, we examine the candidates without the context and prefers those with higher importance in the KB. Equation (2) computes the salience score S a (c) for a candidate c:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S a (c) = r‚ààR(c),et‚ààEt(r) H(r) S a (e t ) L(e t )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R(c) is the relation set for c in the KB; H(r) is given by Equation (1); E t (r) is the tail entity set with c being the head entity and r being the connecting relation in the KB; L(e t ) denotes the cardinality of the tail entity set with e t being the head entity in the KB. S a (c) is recursively com- puted until convergence.</p><p>Collective Ranking: The similarity Sim F (m, c) between a candidate c and its mention m is defined using Equation (3) as the final ranking score:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Sim F (m, c) = Œ± ¬∑ JS(m, c) ¬∑ S a (c) + Œ≤ ¬∑ r‚ààR(c) H(r) ¬∑ n‚ààEt(r)‚à©C(m) S a (n) (3)</formula><p>where JS(m, c) is the Jaccard similarity between the string surface forms of m and c; S a (c) and S a (n) are both evaluated by Equation (2); C(m) denotes the candidate set for mention m; Œ± and Œ≤ are hyperparameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Quantified Collective Validation</head><p>Incorporating the KB relation weighing mecha- nism of the baseline system, our QCV algorithm constructs a number of candidate graphs for a given set of collaborative mentions, and then per- forms a two-level ranking followed by a collective validation on those candidate graphs to acquire the linking results. Because this procedure minimally relies on linguistic analysis of the source docu- ments while mainly uses the KB structure which by nature keeps detached from any specific lan- guage or domain, we claim that QCV comes with language and domain independence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Candidate Graph Construction</head><p>The KB entity candidate graphs are constructed based on a mention context graph and a KB graph. We will introduce them in order as follows.</p><p>Mention Context Graph: To avoid abusing lin- guistic knowledge from the source documents, we construct a mention context graph G m simply in- volving mention co-occurrence. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> depicts a constructed G m for the Caldwell example at the beginning of Section 1. In this figure, men- tions "New York Jets", "Cotchery" and "Coles" are brought into G m through the coreference be- tween "Jets" and "New York Jets" since the three of them are outside the context window of "Cald- well", "Florida", "Patriots", and "Jets". G m con- tains a set of vertices representing the mentions extracted from the source document and a set of undirected edges. There will be an edge between two mention vertices if both of them fall into a context window with width w m in the source doc- ument. Ideally, w m should cover a single dis- course according to the one sense per discourse assumption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gale et al., 1992</ref>), but for simplic- ity we heuristically set w m to be 7-sentence wide as a hyperparameter. Two mention vertices will be connected via a dashed edge if they are coref- erential but are not located in the same context window. Here we determine the coreference by performing substring matching and abbreviation expansion. The dashed edge indicates the out- of-context coreferential mention together with its neighbors will be indirectly included in G m as extended context to later facilitate the candidate graph collective validation. Note that all of these loose settings comply with our intention of gener- ating a light-weight source context representation born with domain and language independence. KB Graph: A structured KB such as DBpedia can be represented as a weighted graph G k that consists of a set of vertices representing the en- tities and a set of directed edges labeled with re- lations between entities. The weights of relations are computed using Equation (1). In order to fur- ther enrich the KB relations, we add a type of re- lation named "wiki link" between two entities if one of them appears in the Wikipedia article of the other. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> presents a subgraph of the DBpe- dia KB graph containing the relevant entities in the Caldwell example.</p><p>Candidate Graph: The candidate graph is a set of graphs G i c (i = 1, 2, ...) used for com- puting ranking scores for the KB entity candi- dates. For each of the mentions extracted from the source context, we first select a list of entity candidates from G k with heuristic rules such as fuzzy string matching, synonyms, Wikipedia redi- rect, etc. Then we pick one candidate for each of the mentions to constitute the vertices of a G i c . In each G i c , we add an edge between two vertices if they are connected in G k by some relation r and their mentions are connected in G m . The edge la- bel r from G k is transferred to G i c . Upon comple-  tion, every G i c represents a collective linking solu- tion to the given mention set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows three of the constructed candidate graphs for the Cald- well example. One can see that the first two graphs are very likely to be good solutions since they in- herit many of the relation edges from G K , while the third one is probably a poor collection as the candidates barely connect to one another. In the next section, we will more formally reveal how to rank these candidate graphs to obtain the optimal linking results.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Candidate Ranking</head><p>With the constructed candidate graphs, QCV per- forms two levels of ranking. First, it uses Equa- tion (2) to compute the candidates' salience scores as a priori ranking. Then it compares each can- didate graph with the mention context graph, and evaluates their vertex set similarity for context similarity ranking. Finally, by considering the re- lation weights in the candidate graphs as well as previous ranking scores, QCV collectively vali- dates all the candidates and assembles the linking results. Below we will focus on introducing the context similarity ranking and the collective vali- dation since the salience ranking resembles that of our baseline system. Context Similarity Ranking: As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 3</ref>, among the constructed candidate graphs, some of them contain many connected vertices while some are otherwise quite disconnected. In- tuitively we would like to measure this structure difference by comparing each candidate graph G i c with its mention context graph G m . Granted, we can only assert co-occurrence between two con- nected mentions in G m , but it should be of great probability that two co-occurring mentions have their entity referents connected by some relation in the KB. In other words, the more a G i c is struc- turally similar to its G m , the better the candidates in this G i c represent their mentions in G m . There- fore, we define the context similarity S m (m c , c) between a candidate c and its mention m c using Jaccard similarity in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S m (m c , c) = |Œò Gm (m c ) ‚à© Œò G i c (c)| |Œò Gm (m c ) ‚à™ Œò G i c (c)|<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Œò Gm (m c ) and Œò G i c (c) denote m c 's neigh- bor set in G m and c's neighbor set in G i c , re- spectively. The intersection takes the candidates of those mentions in Œò Gm (m c ) that appear in Œò G i c (c), and the union is equivalent to Œò Gm (m c ) due to the way we construct G i c . We rank G i c using the summation of the context similarity of every c in G i c . Note that our baseline system uses Jaccard similarity to achieve approximate string match be- tween the surface forms of a mention and a can- didate, while we alternatively use it to capture the graph's structural similarity. After ranking with the context similarity, those G i c with more con- nected vertices such as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref> will get closer to the top of the ranked candidate graph list.</p><p>Candidate</p><note type="other">Graph Collective Validation: Be- sides the salience, the context similarity provides another ranking score for each candidate c in G i c , and it promotes those candidates remaining con- nected in G i c . However, it fails to differenti- ate how two candidates are connected. In Fig- ure 3A, Reche Caldwell is a former player of New England Patriots, and in Fig- ure 3B, Andre Caldwell's Wikipedia article includes a hyperlink pointing to New England Patriots.</note><p>The former seems a "tighter" rela- tion than the latter. Although these two distinct relations imply that these two candidate pairs are related with different relation types, the context similarity rankings for these two candidate graphs are identical. Based on this observation, assuming that a "tighter" relation between two candidates is more likely to be an appropriate representation of the relation between their co-occurring mentions in the source context, we propose a novel valida- tion step that not only considers the two previous ranking scores of each candidate but also quantita- tively examines the relations between candidates. We transfer the calculated relation weights from G k to G i c as positive indicators of how tightly two candidates are related, and then define the com- posite graph weight W (G i c ) for each G i c in Equa- tion (5) as the final ranking metric:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">W (G i c ) = c‚ààV (G i c ) S a (c)S m (m c , c) + r‚ààE(G i c ) H(r)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where V (G i c ) and E(G i c ) are the vertex set and the edge set of G i c ; S a (c), S m (m c , c), and H(r) are given by Equation (2), Equation (4), and Equa- tion (1), respectively. With this composite graph weight, since the relation "former team" has a greater weight than "wiki link", the candidate graph in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref> outweighs that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>, and therefore is ranked to the top.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we first show QCV's performance on generic English corpora and compare it with our baseline together with other state-of-the-art EL systems. Then we move to a new language (Chinese) and two new domains (Biomedical Sci- ence and Earth Science) to demonstrate the lan- guage and domain independent nature of our algo- rithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">EL on Generic English Corpora</head><p>For this evaluation, we used the TAC-KBP2013 EL dataset 1 , which contains 2,190 mentions ex- tracted from English newswire, web blogs, and discussion forums. We selected a subset of 1,090 linkable mentions that have entity referents in the KB for our experiment. DBpedia 3.9, which was generated from the Wikipedia dump in early 2013 and includes more than 4 million entities and more than 470 million facts 2 , was used as our KB. We followed the KBP EL track using B-Cubed+ (Ji et al., 2011) as the evaluation metric. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the results of QCV, our baseline system, as well as the top 3 supervised participant sys- tems <ref type="bibr">3</ref>  As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, QCV not only substan- tially outperforms the best unsupervised systems but also beats the best supervised systems from the KBP participants. In order to understand this notable advancement, we broke down our system into components and evaluated them accumula- tively using the same dataset as above. The ex- periment results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>  In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, SR, CS, and CV correspond to the Salience Ranking, the Context Similarity Rank- ing, and the Collective Validation in our QCV algorithm, respectively. It can be seen that SR already outperforms the best KBP unsupervised systems from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. This is mainly attributed to the engagement of the entropy based relation weights which injects the impact of different re- lations into the entity salience. Notwithstanding being somewhat effective, SR solely depends on the KB and plays its role without the source con- text. It should be straightforward that the sys- tem performance gets improved after enabling CS since the source context has been incorporated. However, it was a little puzzling that the perfor- mance boost by enabling CS turned out to be rel- atively small. We took a careful look at the in- termediate experiment results and discovered that although CS did not produce a lot more correct linking results than SR did, it did promote a great number of good candidates to the top of the rank- ing list. For example, in the Caldwell case, CS successfully raised the rankings of the context- related candidates such as Reche Caldwell, Andre Caldwell, and Jim Caldwell, de- spite the fact that it delivered Andre Caldwell instead of Reche Caldwell as the final linking result. This convincingly implies that CS is able to well capture the context of the target mentions, but meanwhile it is deficient in recognizing the subtle contextual difference among similar candidates. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> there is a significant performance gain after enabling CV. As described in Section 3.2, CV collectively validates the candidates of the target mention "Caldwell" and the mentions in its con- text such as "Florida", "Patriots", and "Jets" by integrating their SR and CS scores as well as the weights of the KB relations between them. There- fore this improvement is reasonably substantial.</p><p>By investigating the remaining errors, we iden- tified several potential causes: 1) Our system occa- sionally could not capture enough context for the target mention. This happened more frequently for web blogs and discussion forums, where the language was informal and casual. Without any linguistic analysis on the source documents, it was difficult for us to extract additional context words. 2) Our simple coreference rules some- times failed to work correctly and introduced false candidates, which, without clear context to dis- ambiguate, could lead to linking errors. 3) Our KB had limited knowledge about some entities in a way that certain relations were missing. This kept us from creating necessary links in the can- didate graphs and further effectively validating the graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">EL on Generic Chinese Corpora</head><p>Using Chinese as a case study, we evaluate the lan- guage portability of our approach. We used the TAC-KBP2012 Chinese EL dataset 1 , and selected a subset of 1,240 linkable mentions out of the total 2,122 mentions extracted from Chinese newswire, web blogs, and discussion forums. For KB, we still used DBpedia because it contains multilingual surface forms for its entities. For instance, the en- tity Barack Obama has surface forms in over 30 languages including the Chinese one: "Ë¥ùÊãâÂÖã¬∑Â•• Â∑¥È©¨". This cross-lingual surface form mapping naturally provides us with a convenient translation tool. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the linking performance com- parison among QCV, our baseline system, and the top 3 participant systems of the KBP Chinese EL track. Again, we employed the B-Cubed+ met- ric.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Performance on the TAC-KBP2012 Chi- nese EL Dataset (1240 linkable mentions).</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, the best performance is achieved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fahrni et al. (2012)</ref>, a supervised sys- tem using over 20 fine-tuned features and many linguistic resources. In contrast, our QCV is an unsupervised approach without using any labeled data or linguistic resources. During the error anal- ysis, we found that in this dataset multiple men- tions are often the variants of the surface form of a single KB entity. For example, "Â••Â∑¥È©¨" and "Ê¨ßÂ∑¥È©¨", being just different Chinese transliter- ations, both refer to "Obama". This fact tends to result in a low recall for our system because one or more of the mention variants may not exist in the KB. We decided to heuristically apply a sub- string matching in addition to the Wikipedia redi- rection mapping to boost the recall. However, as one can imagine, this simple strategy will impair the system precision due to the introduced noise. Take "Â•• Â∑¥ È©¨" again for example. If we only match its second and third characters, "Ê¨ßÂ∑¥È©¨" will be correctly picked, but "Â∑¥È©¨Èïá" (a small town in China) will also be falsely included. For- tunately, our QCV algorithm was able to select and rank candidates complying with the source con- text. Consequently most of this kind of noise got filtered out, and we thus could produce balanced precision and recall. We acknowledge that, without performing deeper linguistic analysis on the source docu- ments, the cross-language surface form mapping of the KB plays a crucial role in our approach. One can replace it with any machine translation prod- uct which, however, is not always available espe- cially for a low-resource language. We should take advantage of the existing KBs where such cross- lingual mapping has already been widely created. The latest DBpedia provides localized versions in 125 languages 1 , for instance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">EL in Biomedical Science</head><p>To demonstrate the domain portability of our ap- proach, we first take the biomedical science do- main as a case study. We conducted our ex- periment using the evaluation dataset created by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zheng et al. (2014)</ref> which contains 208 linkable mentions extracted from several biomedical pub- lications. We built our KB with over 300 domain ontologies downloaded from BioPortal. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> compares the linking accuracy of QCV and our baseline system.</p><p>As shown in  similar performance to our baseline system which is the state-of-the-art to our knowledge. However, we were curious why QCV did not improve the baseline system in the biomedical domain as much as it did in the general domain. After some in- depth analysis of the experiment results, we dis- covered that in this dataset the candidates of the related mentions (i.e. those mentions within the same context window) mostly have similar rela- tions in the KB. In other words, for each men- tion, the candidate entity types are not as diverse as those in the general domain. As a consequence, the collective validation step in QCV does not take much effect since the weights of the involved re- lations are quite close to one another. On such a dataset, the context similarity ranking will play a major part for the disambiguation, and QCV will not be able to function at its full power. Nonethe- less, from the results we can see that our approach can be efficiently and effectively adapted to this new domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">EL in Earth Science</head><p>Now we move to another new domain, Earth Sci- ence. As far as we know, we are the first to study EL in this domain. In order to create an evaluation dataset, our domain expert selected three scientific papers about Early Triassic discovery, Global Stra- totype Section, and Triassic crisis, which are three different aspects of Earth Science related discov- ery, and then identified 296 mentions that can be linked to DBpedia entities.  The linking errors were mainly caused by the following reasons: 1) As a general KB, DBpe- dia has introduced certain noise for our domain-specific EL. For example, in Geology, the term "Beds" mostly refers to "Geology Bed", which is a division of a geologic formation. But in general, "Beds" usually means the beds people sleep on. Much more common in the KB, the latter had such a significantly higher salience score than the for- mer that the final ranking score of our system got biased. 2) Some relations between Earth Science related entities are not clearly defined in DBpe- dia. For instance, in geology time scale, the period "Chattian" is immediately preceded by the period "Rupelian". An explicit relation such as "preceded by" should be inserted between these two period entities. Instead, only a vague "wiki link" relation is present in our KB. This directly diminishes the differentiating power of our system on the KB re- lations.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that there exists a large number of well established ontologies for different sub-domains of Earth Science. SWEET ontolo- gies 1 , for example, widely capture Earth and En- vironmental terminologies. By adopting these on- tologies, we will be able to considerably improve our domain EL performance, and the benefits of EL in the domain will further get revealed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">System Complexity</head><p>We indexed our KB and ontologies in the format of triples using Apache Lucene 2 such that retrieving entity candidates of a mention is O(1). We pre- computed all the entropy-based relation weights and entity salience scores with complexities of O(n r ¬∑ n e ) and O(n e ¬∑ k), respectively, where n r is the number of KB relations, n e is the number of KB entities, and k is the number of iterations it took for the salience score to get converged. For the final QCV score computation, the upper bound of the computing time to link all the mentions in a document is O(n m ¬∑ n c ¬∑ n nc ¬∑ n nm ), where n m is the number of linkable mentions in the document, n c is the number of candidates for each mention, and n nc is the number of neighbor nodes of a can- didate, and n nm is the number of neighbors of a mention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>In recent years, collective inference methods for EL have become increasingly popular. Many ef- forts have been devoted to encoding linguistic fea-tures from the source documents in order to pre- cisely select collaborator mentions for collective inference. These features include topic model- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cassidy et al., 2012)</ref>, re- lation constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cheng and Roth, 2013)</ref>, coref- erential chaining <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Nguyen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huang et al., 2014)</ref>, and dependency restriction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ling et al., 2014</ref>). Some recent work utilized multi-layer lin- guistic analysis integration to capture contextual properties for better mention collection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pan et al., 2015)</ref>. While many of these approaches have been proved to be effective, the dependency on deep linguistic knowledge makes it difficult to migrate them to a new language or domain. In contrast to these methods, we establish a very loose setting for the mention selection, and rely on the quanti- fied information computed from the structured KB to collectively evaluate and validate the entity can- didates. Since the KB is relatively universal to languages and domains, our approach inherently is language and domain independent.</p><p>Recent cross-lingual EL approaches can be di- vided into two types. The first type <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(McNamee et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cassidy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">McNamee et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miao et al., 2013</ref>) trans- lated entity mentions and source documents from the new language into English and then ran En- glish mono-lingual EL to link to English KB. The second type <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Monahan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fahrni et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fahrni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Monahan and Carpenter, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Clarke et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fahrni et al., 2013</ref>) de- veloped EL systems on the new language and used cross-lingual KB links to map the link results back to English KB. While the bottleneck of the former method usually is on translation errors, the latter approach heavily relies on the linguistic resources and the KB of the new language. In comparison, our system mainly uses the English KB and a men- tion surface form mapping that can either come from translation or cross-lingual KB links, and re- quires minimal linguistic resources from the new language.</p><p>There is a limited amount of research work in the literature that focused solely on domain- specific EL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zheng et al., 2014</ref>). In the biomed- ical domain, a few studies have been found on EL-related tasks such as scientific name discov- ery ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akella et al., 2012)</ref>, gene name normaliza- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hirschman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fang et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dai et al., 2010)</ref>, biomedical named entity recog- nition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Usami et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Van Landeghem et al., 2012</ref>) and concept mention extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tsai et al., 2013</ref>). The baseline system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zheng et al., 2014</ref>) in this paper is the work most similar to ours in a sense of collectively aligning mentions to struc- tured KBs. However, our system differs by inte- grating a context similarity ranking and a candi- date validation to conduct a two-way collective in- ference with better performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Language and domain independence is a new re- quirement to EL systems and this capability is par- ticularly welcome by low-resource language re- lated applications and domain scientists. In this paper we demonstrated a high-performance EL approach that can be easily migrated to new lan- guages and domains due to the minimal reliance on linguistic analysis and the deep utilization of structured KBs. In the future, we plan to improve the source document processing such that the sys- tem can better extract the mention context without involving extensive linguistic knowledge. We are also experimenting with our collective validation algorithm to incorporate the impact of more dis- tant KB entities other than just the neighbors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Mention context graph for the Caldwell example.</figDesc></figure>
