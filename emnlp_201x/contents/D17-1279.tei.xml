				<p>This paper addresses the problem of extracting keyphrases from scientific articles and categorizing them as corresponding to a task, process, or material. We cast the problem as sequence tagging and introduce semi-supervised methods to a neu-ral tagging model, which builds on recent advances in named entity recognition. Since annotated training data is scarce in this domain, we introduce a graph-based semi-supervised algorithm together with a data selection scheme to leverage unanno-tated articles. Both inductive and trans-ductive semi-supervised learning strategies outperform state-of-the-art information extraction performance on the 2017 SemEval Task 10 ScienceIE task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As a research community grows, more and more papers are published each year. As a result there is increasing demand for improved methods for finding relevant papers and automatically under- standing the key ideas in those papers. However, due to the large variety of domains and extremely limited annotated resources, there has been rel- atively little work on scientific information ex- traction. Previous research has focused on unsu- pervised approaches such as bootstrapping ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gupta and Manning, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tsai et al., 2013)</ref>, where hand-designed templates are used to extract sci- entific keyphrases, and more templates are added through bootstrapping.</p><p>Very recently a new challenge on Scientific Information Extraction (ScienceIE) ( ) 1 provides a dataset consisting of 500 scientific paragraphs with keyphrase annotations for three categories: TASK, PROCESS, MATERIAL across three scientific domains, Computer Science (CS), Material Science (MS), and Physics (Phy), as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. This dataset enables the use of more advanced approaches such as neural network (NN) models. To that end, we cast the keyphrase extraction task as a sequence tagging problem, and build on recent progress in another informa- tion extraction task: Named Entity Recognition (NER) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lample et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Peng and Dredze, 2015)</ref>. Like named entities, keyphrases can be identified by their linguistic context, e.g. re- searchers "use" methods. In addition, keyphrases can be associated with different categories in dif- ferent contexts. For example, 'semantic parsing' can be labeled as a TASK in one article and as a PROCESS in another. Scientific keyphrases dif- fer in that they can include both noun phrases and verb phrases and in that non-standard "words" (equations, chemical compounds, references) can provide important cues.</p><p>Since the scale of the data is still small for su- pervised training of neural systems, we introduce semi-supervised methods to the neural tagging model in order to take advantage of the large quan- tity of unlabeled scientific articles. This is par- ticularly important because of the differences in keyphrases across domains. Our semi-supervised learning algorithm uses a graph-based label prop- agation scheme to estimate the posterior proba- bilities of unlabeled data. It additionally extends the training objective to leverage the confidence of the estimated posteriors. The new training treats low confidence tokens as missing labels and com- putes the sentence-level score by marginalizing over them.</p><p>Our experiments show that our neural tagging model achieves state-of-the-art results in the Se- mEval Science IE task. We further show that both inductive and transductive semi-supervised strate- gies significantly improve the performance. Fi- nally, we provide in-depth analysis of domain dif- ferences as well as analysis of failure cases.</p><p>The key contributions of our work include: i) achieving state of the art in scientific infor- mation extraction SEMEVAL Task 10 by ex- tending recent advances in neural tagging mod- els; ii) introducing a semi-supervised learning al- gorithm that uses graph-based label propagation and confidence-aware data selection, iii) explor- ing different alternatives for taking advantage of large, multi-domain unannotated data including both unsupervised embedding initialization and semi-supervised model training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>There has been growing interest in research on au- tomatic methods to help researchers search and extract useful information from scientific litera- ture. Past research has addressed citation sen- timent (Athar and Teufel, 2012b,a), citation net- works <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kas, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gabor et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Do et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jaidka et al., 2014</ref>), summa- rization (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011) and some analysis of research community <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vogel and Jurafsky, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Luan et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Luan et al., , 2014b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Levow et al., 2014</ref>). However, due to scarce hand-annotated data resources, previ- ous work on information extraction (IE) for sci- entific literature is very limited. Gupta and Man- ning (2011) first proposed a task that defines sci- entific terms for 474 abstracts from the ACL an- thologhy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bird et al., 2008</ref>) into three aspects: domain, technique and focus and apply template- based bootstrapping to tackle the problem. Based on this study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tsai et al. (2013)</ref> improve the per- formance by introducing hand-designed features from NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collins and Singer, 1999</ref>) to the boot- strapping framework. QasemiZadeh and Schu- mann (2012) compile a dataset of scientific terms into 7 fine-grained categories for 171 abstracts of ACL anothology. Similar to our work, very re- cently Augenstein and Søgaard (2017) also eval- uated on ScienceIE dataset, but use multi-task learning to improve the performance of a super- vised neural approach. Instead, we introduce a semi-supervised neural tagging approach that leverages unlabeled data.</p><p>Neural tagging models have been recently in- troduced to tagging problems such as NER. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Collobert et al. (2011)</ref> use a CNN over a sequence of word embeddings and apply a CRF layer on top. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Huang et al. (2015)</ref> use hand-crafted features with LSTMs to improve performance. There is currently great interest in using character- based embeddings in neural models. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chiu and Nichols, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lample et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ballesteros et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ma and Hovy, 2016)</ref>. Our approach also takes advantage of neural tagging models and character-based embeddings for IE in scientific ar- ticles.</p><p>Previous work on semi-supervised learning for neural models has mainly focused on transfer learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dai and Le, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Luan et al., 2014a;</ref>) or initializing the model with pre-trained word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pennington et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Levy and Goldberg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Luan et al., 2016b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Luan et al., , 2016a</ref>). In our work, we use pre-training but also use more powerful methods including graph-based semi- supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Subramanya and Bilmes, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Liu and Kirchhoff, 2013</ref>,b) and a method for leveraging partially labeled data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kim et al., 2015)</ref>. We show that the combination of these techniques gives better results than any one alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Problem Definition and Data</head><p>The purpose of this work is to extract phrases that can answer questions that researchers usually face when reading a paper: What TASK has the paper addressed? What PROCESS or method has the pa- per used or compared to? What MATERIALS has the paper utilized in experiments? While these fundamental concepts are important in a wide vari- ety of scientific disciplines, the terms that are used in specific disciplines can be substantially differ-ent. For example, MATERIALS in computer sci- ence might be a text corpus, while they would be physical materials in physics or materials science.</p><p>Data We use the SemEval 2017 Task 10 Sci- enceIE dataset. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> provides examples that il- lustrate the variation in domains, but also show that there are common cues such as "the task of", "using", "technique," etc. A challenge with this dataset is that the size of the training data is very small. It is built from ScienceDirect open access publications and consists of 500 journal articles, but only one paragraph of each article is manu- ally labeled. Therefore, we use a large amount of external data to leverage the continuous-space rep- resentation of language in neural network model. We explore the effect of pre-training word embed- ding with two different external resources: i) a data set of Wikipedia articles as a general English resource, and ii) a data set of 50k Computer Sci- ence papers from ACM. 2 Tagging Problem Formulation The task re- quires detecting the exact span of a keyphrase. In order to be able to distinguish spans of two consec- utive keyphrases of the same type, we assign labels to every word in a sentence, indicating position in the phrase and the type of phrase. We formulate the problem as an IOBES (Inside, Outside, Begin- ning, End and Singleton) tagging problem where every token is labeled either as: B, if it is at the beginning of a keyphrase; E, if it ends the phrase; I, if it is inside a keyphrase but not the first or last token; S, if it is a single-word keyphrase; or O, oth- erwise. For example, "named entity recognition" in first sentence of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> is labeled as "B-Task I- task E-task".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Neural Architecture Model</head><p>We introduce an end-to-end model to categorize scientific keyphrases, building on a neural named entity recognition model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lample et al., 2016</ref>) and adding a feature-based embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Model</head><p>We develop a 3-layer hierarchical neural model to tag tokens of the documents (details of the to- kenization is in Sec. 6). <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> The token repre- sentation layer concatenates three components for each token: a bi-directional character-based em- bedding, a word embedding, and an embedding as- sociated with orthographic and part-of-speech fea- tures. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> The token LSTM layer uses a bidirec- tional LSTM to incorporate contextual cues from surrounding tokens to derive intermediate token embeddings. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> The CRF tagging layer models token-level tagging decisions jointly using a CRF objective function to incorporate dependencies be- tween tags.</p><p>Character-Based Embedding. The embedding for a token is derived from its characters as the concatenation of forward and backward represen- tations from a bidirectional LSTM. The charac- ter lookup table is initialized at random. The ad- vantage of building a character-based embedding layer is that it can handle out-of-vocabulary words and equations, which are frequent in this data, all of which are mapped to "UNK" tokens in the Word Embedding Layer. Word Embedding. Words from a fixed vocab- ulary (plus the unknown word token) are mapped to a vector space, initialized using Word2vec pre- training with different combinations of corpora. Feature Embedding. We map features to a vec- tor space: capitalization (all capital, first capital, all lower, any capital but first letter) and Part-of- Speech tags. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We randomly initialize feature vec- tors and train them together as other parameters. Token LSTM Layer We apply a bidirectional LSTM at the token level taking the concatenated character-word-feature embedding as input. The token representation obtained by stacking the for- ward and backward LSTM hidden states is passed as input to a linear layer that project the dimension to the size of label type space and is used as input to CRF layer. CRF Layer Keyphrase categorization is a task where there is strong dependencies across out- put labels (e.g., I-TASK cannot follow B-Process). Therefore, instead of making independent tag- ging decisions for each output, we model them jointly using conditional random field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>). For an input sentence x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , . . . , x n ), we consider P to be the ma- trix of scores output by the bidirectional LSTM network. P is of size n × m, where n is the num- ber of tokens in a sentence, and m is the number of distinct tags. P t,i corresponds to the score of the i-th tag of the t-th word in a sentence. We use a first-order Markov Model and define a transition matrix T where T i,j represents the score from tag i to tag j. We also add y 0 and y n as the start and end tags of a sentence. Therefore T becomes a square matrix of dimension m + 2. Given one possible output y, and neural network parameters θ we define the score as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">φ(y; x, θ) = n t=0 T yt,y t+1 + n t=1 P t,yt<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The probability of sequence y is obtained by ap- plying a softmax over all possible tag sequences</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p θ (y|x) = exp(φ(y; x, θ)) y ∈Y exp(φ(y ; x, θ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Y denotes all possible tag sequences. The normalization term is efficiently computed using the forward algorithm.</p><p>Supervised Training During training, we max- imize the log-probability L(Y ; X, θ) of the cor- rect tag sequence given the corpus {X, Y }. Back- propagation is done based on a gradient computed using sentence-level scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Semi-supervised Learning</head><p>We develop a semi-supervised algorithm that ex- tends self-training by estimating the labels of un- labeled data and then using those labels for re- training. Specifically, we use a graph-based al- gorithm to estimate the posterior probabilities of unlabeled data and develop a new CRF training to take the uncertainty of the estimated labels into ac- count while optimizing the objective function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Graph-based Posterior Estimates</head><p>Our semi-supervised algorithm uses the following steps to estimate the posterior. It first constructs a graph of tokens based on their semantic similar- ity, then uses the CRF marginal as a regularization term to do label propagation on the graph. The smoothed posterior is then used to either interpo- late with the CRF marginal or as an additional fea- ture to the neural network. Graph Construction Vertices in the graph cor- respond to tokens, and edges are distance between token features which capture semantic similarity. The total size of the graph is equal to the num- ber of tokens in both labeled data V l and unlabeled data V u . The tokens are modelled with a concate- nation of pre-trained word embeddings (with di- mension d) of 5-gram centered by the current to- ken, the word embedding of the closest verb, and a set of discrete features including part-of-speech tags and capitalization (43 and 4 dimension one- hot features). The resulting feature vector with dimension of 5d + d + 43 + 4 is then projected down to 100 dimensions using PCA. We define the weight w uv of the edge between nodes u and v as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w uv = d e (u, v) if v ∈ K(u) or u ∈ K(v)</formula><p>, where K(u) is the set of k-nearest neigh- bors of u and d e (u, v) is the Euclidean distance between any two nodes u and v in the graph. An example of our graph is in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>.</p><p>For every node i in the graph, we compute the marginal probabilities {q i } using the forward- backward algorithm. Let θ i represent the estimate of the CRF parameters after the n-th iteration, we compute the marginal probabilities˜pprobabilities˜ probabilities˜p (j,t) = p(y j t |x; θ i ) over IOBES tags for every token posi- tion t in sentence j in labeled and unlabeled data. Label Propagation We use prior-regularized measure propagation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Liu and Kirchhoff, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Subramanya and Bilmes, 2011</ref>) to propagate la- bels from the annotated data to their neighbors in the graph. The algorithm aims for the label distri- bution between neighboring nodes to be as similar to each other as possible by optimizing an objec- tive function that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distances between: i) the empirical distribution r u of labeled data and the predicted label distribution q u for all labeled nodes in the graph; ii) the distri- butions q u and q v for all nodes u in the graph and their neighbors v; iii) the distributions q u and the CRF marginals˜pmarginals˜ marginals˜p u for all nodes. The third term regularizes the predicted distribution toward the CRF prediction if the node is not connected to a labeled vertex, ensuring the algorithm performs at least as well as standard self-training.</p><p>Posterior Estimates We develop two strategies to estimate the new posteriorsˆpposteriorsˆ posteriorsˆp(y t |x; θ), which can then be used in the CRF training.</p><p>The first strategy (called GRAPHINTERP) is the commonly used approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Subramanya et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aliannejadi et al., 2014</ref>) that interpolates the smoothed posterior {q} with CRF marginals p:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ˆ p(y t |x; θ) = αp(y t |x; θ) + (1 − α)q(y) (3)</formula><p>where α is a mixing coefficient.</p><p>A second strategy introduced here (called GRAPHFEAT) uses the smoothed posterior {q} as features and learns it with other parameters in the neural network. Given a sentence {x 1 , . . . , x n }, let Q = {q 1 , . . . , q n } be the predicted label distri- bution from the graph. We then use Q as a feature input to neural network as˜Pas˜ as˜P = P + M Q where P is the n × m matrix output by the bidirectional LSTM network as in Eq. 1, and M is m × m ma- trix and is learned together with other parameters of neural network. We modify Eq. 1 by replacing P t,yt with˜Pwith˜ with˜P t,yt . Note that GRAPHFEAT can only be done in a transductive way since it requires out- put Q from the graph at test time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">CRF training with Uncertain Labels</head><p>A standard approach to self-training is to make hard decisions for labeling tokens based on the estimated posteriors and retrain the model. How- ever, the estimated posteriors in our task are noisy due to the difficulty and variety of the ScienceIE task. Instead, we extend the CRF training to lever- age the confidence of the estimated posteriors. The new CRF training (called Uncertain Label Marginalizing (ULM)) treats low confidence to- kens as missing labels and computes the sentence- level score by marginalizing over them. A similar idea has been previously used in treating partially labeled data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kim et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, given a sentence x we define a con- strained lattice Y(x), where at each position t the allowed label types Y(x t ) are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y(x t ) = {y t }, if p(y t |x; θ) &gt; η All label types, otherwise<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where η is the confidence threshold, y t is the pre- diction of posterior decoding and p(y t |x; θ) is its CRF token marginal. The new neural network pa- rameters θ are estimated by maximizing the log- likelihood of p θ (Y(x k )|x k ) for every input sen- tence x k , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p θ (Y(x k )|x k ) = y k ∈Y(x k ) exp(φ(y k ; x k , θ)) y ∈Y exp(φ(y ; x, θ))</formula><p>where y k is an instance sequence of lattice Y(x), and k is the sentence index in the training set. Ex- treme cases are when all tokens are uncertain then the likelihood would be equal to 1, when all to- kens of a sequence are confident, it would be equal to Eq. 2 where only one possible sequence, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. Inductive and Transductive Learning The semi-supervised training process is summarized as follow: It first computes marginals over the un- labeled data given a set of CRF parameters. It then uses the marginals as a regularization term for label propagation. The smoothed posteriors from the graph are then interpolated with the CRF marginal in GRAPHINTERP or used as an addi- tional feature in GRAPHFEAT. It then uses the estimated labels for the unlabeled data combined with the labeled data to retrain the CRF using ei- ther the hard decision CRF training objective as Eq. 2 or the ULM data selection objective.</p><p>In the inductive setting, we only use the unla- beled data from the development set for the semi- supervision. In the transductive setting we also use the unlabeled data of the test set to construct the graph. In both cases, the parameters are tuned only on the dev set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experimental Setup</head><p>Data The SemEval ScienceIE (SE) corpus con- sists of 500 journal articles; one paragraph of each   Comparisons We compare our system with two template matching baselines and the state-of-the- art on the SemEval Science IE task. The first baseline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gupta and Manning, 2011</ref>) is an un- supervised method to extract keyphrases by ini- tially using seed patterns in a dependency tree, and then adding to seed patterns through bootstrap- ping. The second baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tsai et al., 2013</ref>) im- proves the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gupta and Manning (2011)</ref> by adding Named Entity Features and use different set of seed patterns.</p><p>Implementation details All parameters are tuned on the dev set performance, the best pa- rameters are selected and fixed for model switch- ing and semi-supervised systems. The word em- bedding dimension is 250; the token-level hidden dimension is 100; the character-level hidden di- mension is 25; and the optimization algorithm is SGD with a learning rate of 0.05. For building the graph, the best pre-trained embeddings for the supervised system (Sec. 7.2) are used in each do- main. Two special tokens BOS and EOS are added when pre-training, indicating the begin and end of a sentence. The number of the graph vertices is 2M in tranductive setting and 1.4M in inductive setting. The ULM parameter η in Eq. 4 is tuned from 0.1 to 0.9, the best η is 0.4. The best pa- rameters of label propagation are µ = 10 −6 and ν = 10 −5 . The interpolation parameter α in Eq. 3 is tuned from 0.1 to 0.9, the best α is 0.3. We do iteration of semi-supervised learning until we ob- tain the best result on the dev set, which is mostly achieved in the second round.</p><p>We use Stanford CoreNLP ( ) tokenizer to tokenize words. The tokenizer is augmented with a few hand-designed rules to handle equations (e.g. "fs(B,t)=Spel(t)S" is a sin- gle token) and other non-standard word phenom- ena (Cu40Zn, 20MW/m2) in scientific literature. We use Approximate Nearest Neighbor Searching (ANN) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> to calculate the k-nearest neighbors. For all experiments in this paper, k = 10.</p><p>Setup We evaluate our system in both inductive and transductive settings. The systems with a * superscript in the table are transductive. The in- ductive setting uses 400 full articles in ScienceIE training and dev sets, while the transductive set- ting uses 500 full articles including the test set. In both settings parameters are tuned over the dev set.</p></div>

Moreover, we observe a large improve- ment (20.6% relative) in the scientific IE task by adding the CRF layer. Initialization  mains. We explore different word embedding pre- training with ScienceIE training set alone (SE), and adding other external resources including Wikipedia (wiki) and Computer Science articles (ACM). All alternatives use word2vec. Compared with using SE alone, introduction of all external data sources improve performance. Moreover, we observe that with the introduction of the ACM dataset, the performance on the CS domain is in- creased significantly in both the dev and test sets. Adding Wikipedia data benefits all three domains, with more significant improvement on the MS and Physics domains.</p><p>Based on these observations, we select the best model on each domain according to the dev set and use the combined result as our best suprevised sys- tem (called NN-CRF(supervised)). The F1 score improves from 39.4 to 40.2 when applying model switching strategy. The best model on the dev set is used for each domain: for MS and physics do- main, we pretrain word embeddings with the SE and Wiki, and for the CS domain, we pretrain with the SE and ACM. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> reports the results of the semi-supervised learning algorithms in different settings. In par- ticular we ablate incorporating the graph-based methods of computing the posterior and CRF training (ULM vs. hard decision). The table shows incorporating graph-based methods for computing posterior and ULM for CRF training outperforms their counterparts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Semi-Supervision Learning</head><p>For computing the posterior, we explore two different strategies of the graph-based meth- ods: i) GRAPHINTERP that interpolates the smoothed posterior from label propagation with CRF marginals; For inductive setting, GRAPHIN- TERP only uses un-annotated data from the dev set and uses the best model for decoding at test time. For transductive setting, GRAPHINTERP * uses un- annoated data from test set to build the graph as   well, and tune the parameters on the dev set. ii) GRAPHFEAT uses the smoothed posterior from la- bel propagation as additional feature to neural net- work and only has transductive setting. As expected, the transductive approaches con- sistently outperform inductive approaches on the test set. With around the same performance on dev set, GRAPHINTERP* seems to generalize bet- ter on test set with 1.6% relative improvement over GRAPHINTERP. We observe higher improvement with GRAPHFEAT* compared to GRAPHINTERP. This is mainly because automatically learning the weight matrix M between neural network scores and graph outputs adds more flexibility compared to tuning an interpolation weight α. The perfor- mance is further improved by applying data selec- tion through modifying the objective to ULM. The best inductive system is ULM+GRAPHINTERP with 5.6% relative improvement over pure Self- Training that makes hard decisions, and the best transductive system is ULM+GRAPHFEAT* with 8.6% relative improvement. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> details the performance of our method on the three categories at the span and token level. We observe significant improvement by using ULM+GRAPHINTERP and ULM+GRAPHFEAT over best SemEval and our best supervised sys- tem on all three categories at both token and span levels. We further observe that systems' per- formance on TASK classification is much lower than PROCESS and MATERIAL. This is in part because TASK is much less frequent than the other types. In addition, TASK keyphrases of- ten include verb phrases while the other two do- mains mainly consists of noun phrases. An anal- ysis of confusion patterns show that the most frequent type confusions are between PROCESS and MATERIAL. However, we observe that ULM+GRAPHFEAT* can greatly reduce the con- fusion, with 3.5% relative improvement of PRO- CESS and 3.6% relative improvement of PROCESS over ULM+GRAPHINTERP on token level.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Error Analysis</head><p>We provide examples of typical errors that our sys- tem makes in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. As described in the previ- ous subsection, TASK is the hardest type to iden- tify with our system. Row 1 shows a failure to detect the verb phrase following 'to' as part of the TASK, but detect 'enantiopure products' as MA- TERIAL. The system prefers to predict PROCESS or MATERIAL since those classes have more sam- ples than TASK. Row 2 illustrates the problem of identifying general terms as keyphrases due to similar context, such as 'receptors' and 'drug ac- tion'. A third common error involves incorrectly labeling adjectives, such as 'neighbouring' in Row 3, which leads to span errors. Another common cause of error is insufficient context: in the last example, a larger context is needed to determine whether 'SWE' is a PROCESS or MATERIAL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>This paper casts the scientific information extrac- tion task as a sequence tagging problem and in- troduces a hierarchical LSTM-CRF neural tag- ging model for this task, building on recent results in NER. We introduced a semi-supervised learn- ing algorithm that incorporates graph-based label propagation and confidence-aware data selection. We show the introduction of semi-supervision sig- nificantly outperforms the performance of the su- pervised LSTM-CRF tagging model. We addi- tionally show that external resources are useful for initializing word embeddings. Both induc- tive and transductive semi-supervised strategies  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Common errors, where blue means golden label our system misses, red means falsely predicted results, and green means correctly predicted spans.</p><p>achieve state-of-the-art performance in SemEval 2017 ScienceIE task. We also conducted a detailed analysis of the system and point out common error cases.</p><p>In our experiments, we observe that including in-domain data only for semi-supervised learning has slightly better performance than using cross- domain data. Reducing the amount of in-domain data hurts performance. Therefore, adding more in-domain unlabeled data may help when com- bined with selection schemes such as the ULM al- gorithms proposed here. It would be useful to as- sess the impact of matched unlabeled data for the physics and material science domain. Other future work includes leveraging global context, informa- tion of citation network.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Annotated ScienceIE examples.</figDesc></figure>
