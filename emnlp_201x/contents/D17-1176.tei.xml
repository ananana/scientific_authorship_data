				<p>We study the impact of big models (in terms of the degree of lexicalization) and big data (in terms of the training corpus size) on dependency grammar induction. We experimented with L-DMV, a lexicalized version of Dependency Model with Valence (Klein and Manning, 2004) and L-NDMV, our lexicalized extension of the Neural Dependency Model with Va-lence (Jiang et al., 2016). We find that L-DMV only benefits from very small degrees of lexicalization and moderate sizes of training corpora. L-NDMV can benefit from big training data and lexicaliza-tion of greater degrees, especially when enhanced with good model initialization, and it achieves a result that is competitive with the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Grammar induction is the task of learning a gram- mar from a set of unannotated sentences. In the most common setting, the grammar is unlexical- ized with POS tags being the tokens, and the train- ing data is the WSJ10 corpus (the Wall Street Journal corpus with sentences no longer than 10 words) containing no more than 6,000 training sentences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cohen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Tu and Honavar, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Lexicalized grammar induction aims to incor- porate lexical information into the learned gram- mar to increase its representational power and im- prove the learning accuracy. The most straight- forward approach to encoding lexical informa- tion is full lexicalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pate and Johnson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Spitkovsky et al., 2013)</ref>. A major problem with * This work was supported by the National Natural Sci- ence Foundation of China (61503248). full lexicalization is that the grammar becomes much larger and thus learning is more data de- manding. To mitigate this problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Headden et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blunsom and Cohn (2010)</ref> used par- tial lexicalization in which infrequent words are replaced by special symbols or their POS tags. Another straightforward way to mitigate the data scarcity problem of lexicalization is to use training corpora larger than the standard WSJ corpus. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pate and Johnson (2016)</ref> used two large corpora containing more than 700k sentences; Marecek and Straka (2013) utilized a very large corpus based on Wikipedia in learning an unlexi- calized dependency grammar. Finally, smoothing techniques can be used to reduce the negative im- pact of data scarcity. One example is Neural DMV (NDMV) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jiang et al., 2016</ref>) which incorporates neural networks into DMV and can automatically smooth correlated grammar rule probabilities.</p><p>Inspired by this background, we conduct a sys- tematic study regarding the impact of the degree of lexicalization and the training data size on the accuracy of grammar induction approaches. We experimented with a lexicalized version of Depen- dency Model with Valence (L-DMV) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Klein and Manning, 2004</ref>) and our lexicalized extension of NDMV (L-NDMV). We find that L-DMV only benefits from very small degrees of lexicalization and moderate sizes of training corpora. In com- parison, L-NDMV can benefit from big training data and lexicalization of greater degrees, espe- cially when it is enhanced with good model ini- tialization. The performance of L-NDMV is com- petitive with the current state-of-the-art.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Lexicalized DMV</head><p>We choose to lexicalize an extended version of DMV ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gillenwater et al., 2010</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">… Wchd v dec = W dec f v chd = W chd f</formula><p>Fully Connected Layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f = ReLU(W dir [v val ; v word ; v tag ]) [v val ; v word ; v tag ] Softmax(v chd ) Sof tmax(v dec )</formula><p>Figure 1: The structure of the neural networks in the L-NDMV model. It predicts the probabilities of the CHILD rules and DECISION rules.</p><p>ilar approach to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Spitkovsky et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blunsom and Cohn (2010)</ref> and represent each token as a word/POS pair. If a pair appears in- frequently in the corpus, we simply ignore the word and represent it only with the POS tag. We control the degree of lexicalization by replacing words that appear less than a cutoff number in the WSJ10 corpus with their POS tags. With a very large cutoff number, the grammar is virtu- ally unlexicalized; but when the cutoff number be- comes smaller, the grammar becomes closer to be fully lexicalized. Note that our method is different from previous practice that simply replaces rare words with a special "unknown" symbol (Head- den <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">III et al., 2009)</ref>. Using POS tags instead of the "unknown" symbol to represent rare words can be helpful in the neural approach introduced below in that the learned word vectors are more informa- tive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Lexicalized NDMV</head><p>With a larger degree of lexicalization, the gram- mar contains more tokens and hence more param- eters (i.e., grammar rule probabilities), which re- quire more data for accurate learning. Smoothing is a useful technique to reduce the demand for data in this case. Here we employ a neural approach to smoothing. Specifically, we propose a lexicalized extension of neural DMV (Jiang et al., 2016) and we call the resulting approach L-NDMV.</p><p>Extended Model: The model structure of L- NDMV is similar to that of NDMV except for the representations of the head and the child of the CHILD and DECISION rules. The net- work structure for predicting the probabilities of CHILD rules [p c 1 , p c 2 , ..., p cm ] (m is the vocab- ulary size; c i is the i-th token) and DECISION rules [p stop , p continue ] given the head word, head POS tag, direction and valence is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref>. We denote the input continuous represen- tations of the head word, head POS tag and va- lence by v word , v tag and v val respectively. By concatenating these vectors we get the input repre- sentation to the neural network:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[v val ; v word ; v tag ].</formula><p>We map the input representation to the hidden layer f using the direction-specific weight matrix W dir and the ReLU activation function. We rep- resent all the child tokens with matrix W chd = [W word , W tag ] which contains two parts: child word matrix W word ∈ R m×k and child POS tag matrix W tag ∈ R m×k , where k and k are the pre- specified dimensions of output word vectors and tag vectors respectively. The i-th rows of W word and W tag represent the output continuous repre- sentations of the i-th word and its POS tag respec- tively. Note that for two words with the same POS tag, the corresponding POS tag representations are the same. We take the product of f and the child matrix W chd and apply a softmax function to ob- tain the CHILD rule probabilities. For DECISION rules, we replace W chd with the decision weight matrix W dec and follow the same procedure.</p><p>Extended Learning Algorithm: The original NDMV learning method is based on hard-EM and is very time-consuming when applied to L-NDMV with a large training corpus. We propose two im- provements to achieve significant speedup. First, at each EM iteration we collect grammar rule counts from a different batch of sentences instead of from the whole training corpus and train the neural network using only these counts. Second, we train the same neural network across EM it- erations without resetting. More details can be found in the supplementary material. Our algo- rithm can be seen as an extension of online EM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Liang and Klein, 2009</ref>) to accommodate neural network training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Model Initialization</head><p>It was previously shown that the heuristic KM ini- tialization method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Klein and Manning (2004)</ref> does not work well for lexicalized grammar in- duction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Headden III et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pate and Johnson, 2016</ref>) and it is very helpful to initialize learn- ing with a model learned by a different grammar induction method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Le and Zuidema, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jiang et al., 2016</ref>). We tested both KM initialization and the following initialization method: we first learn an unlexicalized DMV using the grammar induc- tion method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Naseem et al. (2010)</ref> and use it to parse the training corpus; then, from the parse trees we run maximum likelihood estimation to produce the initial lexicalized model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Setup</head><p>For English, we used the BLLIP corpus 1 in ad- dition to the regular WSJ corpus in our experi- ments. Note that the BLLIP corpus is collected from the same news article source as the WSJ corpus, so it is in-domain and is ideal for train- ing grammars to be evaluated on the WSJ test set. In order to solve the compatibility issue as well as improve the POS tagging accuracy, we used the Stanford tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>) to re- tag the BLLIP corpus and selected the sentences for which the new tags are consistent with the original tags, which resulted in 182244 sentences with length less than or equal to 10 after remov- ing punctuations. We used this subset of BLLIP and section 2-21 of WSJ10 for training, section 22 of WSJ for validation and section 23 of WSJ for testing. We used training sets of four differ- ent sizes: WSJ10 only (5779 sentences) and 20k, 50k, and all sentences from the BLLIP subset. For Chinese, we obtained 4762 sentences for training from Chinese Treebank 6.0 (CTB) after convert- ing data to dependency structures via Penn2Malt <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Nivre, 2006</ref>) and then stripping off punctuations. We used the recommended validation and test data split described in the documentation.</p><p>We trained the models with different degrees of lexicalization. We control the degree of lexicaliza- tion by replacing words that appear less than a cut- off number in the WSJ10 or CTB corpus with their POS tags. For each degree of lexicalization, we tuned the dimension of the hidden layer of the neu- ral network on the validation dataset. For English, we tested nine word cutoff numbers: 100000, 500, 200, 100, 80, 70, 60, 50, and 40, which resulted in vocabulary sizes of <ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">63,</ref><ref type="bibr">98,</ref><ref type="bibr">166,</ref><ref type="bibr">203,</ref><ref type="bibr">226,</ref><ref type="bibr">267,</ref><ref type="bibr">306</ref>, and 390 respectively; for Chinese, the word cutoff numbers are 100000, 100, 70, 50, 40, 30, 20, 12, and 10. Ideally, with higher degrees of lex- icalization, the hidden layer dimension should be larger in order to accommodate the increased num- ber of tokens. For the neural network of L-NDMV, we initialized the word and tag vectors in the neu- 1 Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing (BLLIP) 1987-89 WSJ Corpus Release 1 ral network by learning a CBOW model using the Gensim package <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Rehůřek and Sojka, 2010)</ref>. We set the dimension of input and output word vectors to 100 and the dimension of input and output tag vectors to 20. We trained the neural network with learning rate 0.03, mini-batch size 200 and mo- mentum 0.9. Because some of the neural network weights are randomly initialized, the model con- verges to a different local minimum in each run of the learning algorithm. Therefore, for each setup we ran our learning algorithm for three times and reported the average accuracy. More detail of the experimental setup can be found in the supplemen- tary material.</p></div>

It can be seen that on the smallest WSJ10 training corpus, lexicalization im- proves learning only when the degree of lexical- ization is small; with further lexicalization, the learning accuracy significantly degrades. On the three larger training corpora, the impact of lexi- calization on the learning accuracy is still negative but is less severe. Overall, lexicalization seems to be very data demanding and even our largest training corpora could not bring about the bene- fit of lexicalization.

Dimin- ishing return of big data is no longer observed, which implies further increase in accuracy with even more data. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> compares the result of L-NDMV (with the largest corpus and the vocabulary size of 203 which was selected on the validation set) with pre- vious approaches to dependency grammar induc- tion. It can be seen that L-NDMV is competitive with previous state-of-the-art approaches. We did some further analysis of the learned word vectors in L-NDMV in the supplementary material. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2(d)</ref> shows the results of the three ap- proaches on the Chinese treebank. Because the corpus is relatively small, we did not study the im- pact of the corpus size. Similar to the case of En- glish, the accuracy of lexicalized DMV degrades with more lexicalization. However, the accuracy with L-NDMV increases significantly with more lexicalization even without good model initializa- tion. Adding good initialization further boosts the performance of L-NDMV, but the benefit of lexi- calization is less significant (from 0.55 to 0.58).</p></div>
