<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Biomedical literature offers a rich set of knowl- edge sources to discover important facts and find associations among them. For instance, MED- LINE contains over 18 million references to arti- cles published since 1946 and sourced from over 5500 journals worldwide <ref type="bibr">(Simpson and DemnerFushman, 2012</ref>). Two major processing tasks performed on the biomedical text are: (1) iden- tify and classify biomedical entities (NER) into predefined categories such as proteins, genes, or diseases, and (2) infer pair-wise relationships among named entities e.g., protein-protein interac- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Poon et al., 2014</ref>), gene-protein, and medical problem-treatment.</p><p>This paper presents a system that processes biomedical text to extract two specific types of re- lationships among biomedical entities: (a) cause- effect and (b) correlation.</p><p>This system is motivated by the need to bet- ter automate biomedical knowledge extraction and identify important information from them, as new scientific findings appear across a large collection of publications. For instance, given user sleep pat- terns, existing biomedical research can be better utilized to provide insights: inform about poten- tial effect (e.g., "diabetes", "obesity") due to the cause (e.g., "sleep disorder") and suggest appro- priate treatment.</p><p>Since biomedical articles usually have title and abstract summarizing the contents of the full-text article, we focus on extracting the two relationship types from them. Unfortunately, mining this sum- mary data still poses several key challenges. Sim- ilar to full-text, this data comprises unstructured text with domain-specific vocabulary, issues of synonymy (e.g., "heart attack" vs. "myocardial infarction"), acronyms, abbreviations and rapidly evolving terminology due to new scientific discov- eries. While the titles are short and informative, they do not contain the key information that would be contained in the abstract.</p><p>Many of these challenges are also applicable for biomedical relation extraction. Further, iden- tifying particular relation types is challenging be- cause relations are expressed as discontinuous spans of text , and the relation types are typically application-specific. Finally, there is often little consensus on how to best annotate relation types resulting in lack of high quality annotated corpora for training.</p><p>In this study, we develop neural networks with novel similarity modeling for better causal- ity/correlation relation extraction, as we map the extraction task into a representational similarity measurement task in the vector space. Our ap- proach innovates in that it explicitly measures both relational and contextual similarity among repre- sentations of named entities, entity relations and contexts. Our system also provides a novel com- bination of recognizing named entities, predicting relationships (insights) between extracted entities, and ranking the output. We conduct human eval- uations of the system to show it is able to ex- tract insights with high human acceptance accu- racy, and on a SemEval task evaluation its causal- ity/correlation relation extraction compares favor- ably against previous state-of-the-art work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Most previous work in BioNLP focused on ex- traction of biomedical concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Craven, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Finkel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Poon and Vanderwende, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Simpson and Demner-Fushman, 2012</ref>; Liu, 2016), such as drug or protein names. We also con- duct relation extraction on general named entities, such as "smoking" or "sleep quality". <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kabiljo et al. (2009)</ref> compared pattern-matching tech- niques against a baseline regular expression ap- proach for gene/protein entity extraction. But ex- isting tools for relation extraction are not as com- prehensive as entity recognition tools. Medical dictionaries and resources are heavily utilized by previous work. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al. (2008)</ref> extracted disease-drug relation pairs with <ref type="bibr">MedLEE (Friedman et al., 2004</ref>) system for clinical information extraction of EHR records. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liu et al. (2015)</ref> developed a text-mining system to search for associations among human diseases, genes, drugs, metabolites and toxins against large collections of text-rich biological databases. Pre- vious research efforts also lead to semantic rep- resentation program SemRep ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rindflesh and Fiszman, 2003)</ref>, which exploits biomedical domain knowledge and linguistic analysis of biomedical text. Other unconventional resource such as web query logs are also utilized ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Paparrizos et al., 2016</ref>) to provide early warnings about the pres- ence of devastating diseases.</p><p>Feature engineering was the dominant approach in most biomedical relation extraction work with machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dogan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yala et al., 2016)</ref>; different sparse features were explored. For example, word n-gram features, Algorithm 1 System Overview 1: Input: Biomedical article title and abstract 2: Preprocess the input texts <ref type="bibr">3:</ref> for each sentence of the input do 4:</p><p>Identify all possible named entities <ref type="bibr">5:</ref> for each named entity pair ( A, B) do</p></div>

Lastly our work models insight extraction as a similar- ity measurement problem, and is inspired by sim- ilarity measurement work ( ) on pairwise word interaction modeling with deep neural networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System Overview</head><p>We provide a recipe to build a system for biomed- ical insight extraction and use it as a guide for the remainder of this paper (Algorithm 1).</p><p>To make our discussion concrete, we will use a sample biomedical article in Example 1. Given the text, at line 4 of Algorithm 1 we firstly look for all named entities using a shallow parser and pub- lic medical dictionaries (see details in Section 4). Many named entities could be found, for example, "clinical study", "sleep disturbances in middle- aged men" and "diabetes". Next given any pair of previously extracted entities within a sentence, RESEARCH METHODS: A group of 6,599 initially healthy, nondiabetic middle-aged men took part in a prospective, population-based study. The incidence of diabetes during a mean follow-up of 14.8 years was examined in relation to self-reported difficulties in falling asleep. RESULTS: A total of 615 subjects reported ei- ther difficulties in falling asleep or use of hyp- notics (seen as makers of sleep disturbances). Among those, 281 of the men developed diabetes during the follow-up period. The clinical study suggests sleep disturbances in middle-aged men are likely associated with diabetes.</p><p>Example 1: Sample Text at line 6 our neural network-based relation extrac- tor checks if a valid causality/correlation relation- ship exists (Section 5). For example, our mod- els can identify that the entity "sleep disturbances in middle-aged men" has a correlation relation- ship with "diabetes" but not with "clinical study". Later each valid entity pair is scored via the rank- ing component at line 7 (Section 6). In the final step, the system returns top ranked insight(s) to users: "sleep disturbances in middle-aged men → diabetes" given this example. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> presents the system which consists of three major neural network-based compo- nents: (1) a named entity extractor, (2) a causal- ity/correlation relation extractor, and (3) an insight ranker. Our system reads in biomedical texts, then provides insights in the end. We primarily inno- vate in the relation extraction component. Next, we describe each of these components in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Named Entity Extraction</head><p>Named entity extraction in biomedical domain is challenging due to the domain-specific and rapidly evolving terminology. For example, "Diabetes mellitus type 1", "Type 1 diabetes", "IDDM", or "juvenile diabetes" all express the same concept. Given frequent evolution of entity naming for new drugs, diseases or abbreviations, this task becomes more complicated.</p><p>Most existing off-the-shelf biomedical entity recognizers narrowly focus on specific biomedical terms. Instead we aim to improve the system recall by extracting both specific biomedical concepts such as "gene tmem230" or "prostate cancer" as well as general noun phrases such as "sleep qual-  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Three major components of the system. ity", "daily exercises", or "men with diabetes". Thus the scope of the system is broader.</p><p>We design an entity extractor by using both an in-domain medical knowledge base for key- word matching, and a domain-independent neural network-based shallow parser for entity boundary detection. We present the procedure below: 1. We firstly use a large public dictionary, Metathesaurus of the Unified Medical Lan- guage System (UMLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bodenreider, 2004</ref>) to obtain in-domain biomedical terms. UMLS Metathesaurus is a set of dictionaries provid- ing large collections of biomedical vocabular- ies. We extract over 3.3 million of biomedical terms from UMLS, then utilize the Aho Cora- sick pattern matching algorithm to create a dic- tionary lookup tool. Our tool can efficiently lo- cate all UMLS terms given input texts, since it has a linear complexity due to its trie tree data structure. 2. We also use a neural network-based shallow parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Collobert et al., 2011</ref>) to identify bound- aries of general noun phrases, which are not limited to biomedical terms. Usage of shallow parser is to improve system recall on named en- tity recognition. 3. Our named entity extraction component aims to locate all entities of input texts. The result list is an output concatenation of both step 2 and 3, and is later provided to the causality/correlation relation extraction component for further pro- cessing. If entity overlaps exist, only phrases with longest matching sequence are extracted. Our insight extraction system adopts a coarse- to-fine design approach. First, we focus on im- proving recall for the entity extraction task. Then we show how the causality/correlation relation ex- traction component (Sec. 5) processes extracted named entities to achieve high precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Relation Extraction as Similarity Measurement</head><p>We first provide our model design intuition: if a causality/correlation relationship holds between two named entities, then representations of the two entities should be semantically similar and close to the representation of the relation in a low- dimensional vector space. Therefore we map the causality/correlation relation extraction into a sim- ilarity measurement task in the vector space. Our novel approach learns representations of named entities ( A, B), context words and the rela- tion vector R, then explicitly measures two aspects of the similarity: 1) relational similarity between entities and relation (Sec. 5.2); plus, 2) contextual similarity between entities and sentence context (Sec. 5.3).</p><p>The intent of our approach is to enforce such structure of the vector space: as the similarity among entities, relation and contexts gets stronger, a fit of all should be observed for better causal- ity/correlation relation extraction. We develop two neural network models with such property; both are utilized in the relation extraction component of the system.</p><p>We define input sentence representation S ∈ R ×d to be a sequence of words, each with a d-dimensional word embedding vector. x t ∈ R d denotes the embedding vector of the t-th word (t ∈ <ref type="bibr">[1, l]</ref>) in S. Model details are described in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Context Modeling</head><p>Different words occurring in similar contexts should have a higher chance to contribute to sim- ilarity measurement and relation extraction. We use bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTM) for context modeling as a basis for all following models.</p><p>LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>) is a special variant of Recurrent Neural Net- works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Williams and Zipser, 1989)</ref>. At time step t, given an input word x t and previous LSTM hid- den state h t−1 , LST M (x t , h t−1 ) outputs current hidden state h t ∈ R dim . BiLSTM consists of two LSTMs that run in parallel in opposite direc- tions. The BiLSTM hidden state h bi t ∈ R 2dim is a concatenation of forward LSTM's h f or t and back- ward LSTM's h back t , representing contexts of input word x t in the sentence. We define concat oper- ation and output sentence context representation H S ∈ R ×2dim below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ht = LST M (xt, ht−1)<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">h bi t = concat(h f or t , h back t )<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">H S [t] = h bi t (3) Function 1 SimiScore( A, B, R) 1: conC = concat( A, B) 2: entityC = W C · conC 3: relationT = W D · R 4: dist = W di · tanh(entityC + relationT ) 5: return dist</formula><p>Context modeling with BiLSTM allows our fol- lowing model components to be built over con- texts rather than over individual words. Given named entity positions of the sentence, we get A and B from context H S .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Relational Similarity Modeling</head><p>Relational similarity modeling focuses on inter- actions between named entities and relations in the vector space. When the named entity A goes through a transformation process induced by the relation R, our intent of relational similarity mod- eling is to force the transformed entity to be trans- lated to the other named entity B in the same vec- tor space so that the relation R holds between the two named entities.</p><p>We show the following objective function of our relational similarity modeling:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A + B − R 0<label>(4)</label></formula><p>To model the transformation process in Equa- tion 4, we need to know how to measure the similarity of the triplet ( A, B, R). There- fore we develop a similarity measurement func- tion SimiScore( A, B, R) with learnable weights (W * ), the similarity function takes an input named entity pair of ( A, B) and a relation R, returns a similarity score dist ∈ R 1 representing how se- mantically close ( A, B, R) are, as in Function 1. We utilize a ranking approach during training to incorporate the constraint of Equation 4 into the relational similarity model. Our goal is to learn a function SimiScore(·) so that the positive triplet ( A, B, R + ) is assigned a larger score than that of the negative triplet ( A, B, R − ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SimiScore( A, B, R + ) &gt; SimiScore( A, B, R − )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where R + denotes the positive causal- ity/correlation relation, R − denotes a non- causality/non-correlation relation. The ranking approach maximizes the similarity score between the entity pair ( A, B) and a positive relation R + while minimizing the score with the negative R − ,</p><note type="other">2694 C : Lung cancer is most likely caused by smoking Named Entities ( A, B)</note></div>

Our relational similarity model and the ranking training approach facilitate the transformation pro- cess of ( A, B) and R in the vector space, which in the end leads to better constraint satisfaction of objective Equation 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relational Similarity</head><p>The relational similarity model is placed on top of BiLSTM (Sec 5.1) as part of the system. We initialize named entities A/ B as h bi A /h bi B from the BiLSTM model, then initialize relation represen- tations R + / R − as random vectors. During train- ing both R + / R − are updated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Contextual Similarity Modeling</head><p>Since not all words of a given title/abstract are cre- ated equal, important context words around named entities that can better contribute to the causal- ity/correlation relation extraction deserve more model focus. We develop a contextual similarity model that can increase model weights onto im- portant context words to better utilizing contextual information. For example, given a sentence, lung cancer is most likely caused by smoking, the context words caused by are important clues to suggest there exists a causality/correlation relationship between the two named entities. Clue words that require model attentions usually include, e.g. lead to, is associated with, because of, while others are not obvious, such as promote, reflect, reduce, make.</p><p>Our system does not require a manually pre- pared list of clue words, but an attention mecha- nism ( ) is utilized to better identify them by conducting similarity measure- ment between context word representation h bi t (not including entity words) and extracted named en- tities ( A, B) (from Sec. 4). Resulting similarity scores of words are accumulated in atten ∈ R .</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">mix = W a · concat( A, B)<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">E[t] = dotProd (mix, h bi t ), ∀t ∈ [1, l] (7) atten = softmax (E)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where we concatenate both entity representations ( A, B), apply linear transformation with weights W a to obtain a representation mix of both entities. We then use dot product dotP rod to measure the similarity between mix and each context word, fi- nally normalize the attention weights atten <ref type="bibr">[:]</ref> with softmax . The weights of atten indicate the im- portance of each context word with respect to both named entities.</p><p>The attention weights should better guide the focus of the model onto important context words of the sentence. That is, context words that are closer to entity representation mix should have better chances to be clue words. We define the attention re-weighted sentence representation attenSen ∈ R 2dim :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">attenSen = atten H S<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where represents element-wise multiplication. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> illustrates an example where repre- sentation mix of named entities attends to con- text words one at a time. Important context clue words "caused by" should receive higher attention weights than irrelevant neighbor words.</p><p>The re-weighted sentence representation attenSen is used together with entity representa- tions ( A, B) for final prediction. In summary, both models described in this section focus on different aspects of similarity measurement in relation extraction: the contex- tual similarity model utilizes context information around named entities, while the relational simi- larity model focuses on enforcing a transformation constraint between entities and relation in the vec- tor space. We adopt both models for better relation extraction, in the end only pairs of named entities that are recognized positively by either one of the models are passed to the next stage of the system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Ranking of Extracted Insights</head><p>The last major component of our system is to rank extracted relations ( A, B, R) from the output of the relation extraction component, as there could be many extracted relations but not all of them are important enough as insights of the article. Impor- tance scores of extracted relations are obtained by following a set of rules below:</p><p>1. We utilize the output classification probability (∈ <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>) of the relational similarity model as the base ranking score.</p><p>2. We use a multi-perspective convolutional neural network model (MPCNN) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">He et al., 2015)</ref> to measure the similarity (∈ <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>) between the ti- tle of the article and extracted relation, since the MPCNN model has competitive performance on multiple benchmarks for textual similarity measurement. We compare title text with " A leads to B" of an extracted relation, if the sim- ilarity score is over a threshold of 0.75, we in- crease the extracted relation's ranking score by 15%. If the extracted relation is from the title text, we also boost its ranking score by 15% be- cause of its location importance.</p><p>Once all extracted relations are scored, our system only returns the top ranked insights to users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Experiment Setup</head><p>Datasets. Experiments are conducted on two datasets: our own dataset of medical/health publi- cations annotated on Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS), a crowdsourcing platform for end-to-end system evaluation; and SemEval-2010 task 8 dataset for training and evaluation of our re- lation extraction component:</p><p>1. The first dataset consists of 100 publications from recent biomedical/health journals, which are then annotated on UHRS to evaluate our system. In order to ensure high-quality human annotations, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> provides an annotation in- terface on UHRS, which displays instructions, title/abstract texts of publications and a list of top ranked extracted insights from the system output. For fair evaluation the order of extracted insights is randomized then we ask expert an- notators with suitable background to verify the correctness of each. 2. <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2010</ref><ref type="bibr">Task 8 (Hendrickx et al., 2009</ref>) defines 9 relation types between named entities: Cause-Effect, Instrument-Agency, Product-Producer, Content-Container, Entity- Origin, Entity-Destination, Component-Whole, Member-Collection and Message-Topic, and a tenth relation type Other when two named enti-ties do not have the first 9 relations. SemEval- 2010 dataset consists of 10, 717 sentences, with 8, 000 for training and 2, 717 for test. The dataset is human annotated, and each in- stance provides one sentence which includes two named entities and a relation type between the two entities.</p><p>Since our system focuses on extracting insights, we only use Cause-Effect subset of SemEval- 2010 dataset as the positive training/testing ex- amples and treat the remaining 9 categories data such as Content-Container, Message-Topic as negatives. We use this dataset for training and evaluating our relation extraction component (Sec. 5) only.</p><p>Training. Two loss functions are adopted to train relation extraction neural network models.</p><p>For contextual similarity model (Sec. 5.3), a hinge loss is used. The training objective is to min- imize the following loss, summed over examples x, y gold :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">losscontextSim (w, x, y gold ) = y =y gold max(0, 1 + fw(x, y ) − fw(x, y gold ))<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where input x represents an entity pair ( A, B) plus its sentence context, y gold is the ground truth la- bel and y is the model predicted label. Both y and y gold indicate the relation type with direction- ality (e.g. directional causality). w represents weights of contextual similarity model with BiL- STM, function f w (x, y ) outputs the model pre- dicted label value, function f w (x, y gold ) outputs the model ground truth label value, and n is the number of training examples.</p><p>For relational similarity model (Sec. 5.2), a Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rendle et al., 2009</ref>) is used. The label of the rela- tional similarity model is binary because the BPR loss ranks positive inputs above negative inputs, thereby requiring the supervision signal to distin- guish positives from negatives. Due to BPR loss's ranking nature, each training instance of the rela- tional similarity model include one positive input (x, R + ) and one negative input (x, R − ). Given a positive correlation/causality input ( R + ), we gen- erate negative training examples by matching the input x with each of the negative relation labels ( R − ). BPR loss is shown to be better tailored for ranking tasks empirically ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Verga et al., 2016)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">loss relationSim (w, x, R + , R − ) = R − − log(σ(f w (x, R + ) − f w (x, R − )))<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where σ is the sigmoid function, function f w (x, R) represents the relational similarity model with BiLSTM, and outputs a similarity score for ranking purpose (Sec. 5.2).</p><p>In all experiments, we perform optimization us- ing RMSProp (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012) with backpropagation (Bottou, 1998) and a learning rate fixed to 10 −4 and a momentum parameter 0.9.</p><p>Settings and Preprocessing. We preprocess both datasets with Stanford CoreNLP toolkit ). We tokenize, lowercase, sen- tence split and dependency parse all words of both datasets. We set LSTM hidden state dim = 500.</p><p>Two sets of d = 300-dimension word embed- dings are utilized. The first one is 300-dimension GloVe word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) trained on 840 billion tokens; for better biomed- ical/health domain adaptation, we also train sec- ond word embeddings using the GloVe toolkit on biomedical research articles with over 1 billion to- kens. We do not update word embeddings in all experiments.</p><p>During system deployment, we only initialize input words with the medical word embeddings if they do not exist in GloVe embeddings' vocab- ulary. We also concatenate embeddings of both input words and their head words on dependency trees as input for relation extraction models. We follow the task settings and compute F1-score with the official evaluation script only on Cause-Effect subset of SemEval-2010 data, then the best model based on F1 is selected for final system deploy- ment. We set a distance limit and do not extract re- lations between two named entities if the distance is larger than 15.</p></div>

We also provide a baseline system, of which its relation extraction component is a bidirectional gated RNN model (BiGRU) ( . Bi- GRU model and the ranking component are major differences between our full and baseline system. Since typically only a limited number of key find- ings is presented in one article, we evaluate the system with an averaged acceptance accuracy at top 1 (Precision@1) and top 3 (Precision@3) po- sitions of the output rank list, which represent on average the number of extracted insights accepted by annotators among the first 1 and 3 output. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows annotation results with accep- tance accuracies for each of the ten output posi- tions given biomedical titles and articles. The Pre- cision@3 of our full system is 50.6%, which is sig- nificantly better than the baseline system's 21.3%. For top 3 extracted insights on the list, our full system on average have 1.5 insights accepted by annotators.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Relation Extraction Component.</head><p>We also evaluate the relation extraction compo- nent (Sec. 5) on Cause-Effect subset of SemEval- 2010 dataset. Note our causality/correlation rela- tion extraction component is not supposed to be a general purpose one, since our system only fo- cuses on insight extraction of biomedical/health literature. We compare our relation extraction models against previous work on the Cause- Effect subset of the data, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows our relational similarity model, without the use of sparse features or external resources such as Word- Net, outperforms recent state-of-the-art treeLSTM model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Miwa and Bansal, 2016)</ref>. It also shows BiGRU model is reasonably competitive on this dataset, which is why we use it in our baseline sys- tem for comparison purpose.  Equation 8 and 9 from within the contextual sim- ilarity model (Sec. 5.3). Given four sentences in the test set of SemEval-2010 data, the model pre- dicts that all provided entity pairs (in bold) have the causality/correlation relation. From <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> we observe the model is able to do its expected job: it can recognize important clues words, such as "result in", "produce", "generated by" and "cause"; the model produces attention weights (each ∈ <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>) to tell the importance of clue words for causality/correlation relation extraction. We also observe the model tends to focus more on prepositions of clue words, such as "by" of "gen- erated by" and "in" of "result in", this is probably because we use head words as extra inputs (Sec. 7) to the model.</p><p>Case Study. We lastly provide case study of our system. We show two biomedical articles' titles and abstracts as examples, with only necessary omissions to remove irrelevant texts due to the space limit. Given Case 1, our system outputs the top in- sight "the slow negative shift of the DC potential → increased cortical excitability" with a score of 0.71. Given Case 2, our system outputs top 3 in- sights: "excessive drinking → skin cancer" with a score of 0.55, "excessive drinking → alcohol" with a score of 0.43, and "excessive drinking → sunburn" with a score of 0.31. The above exam- ples show that our system can provide reasonable insights from biomedical text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Conclusion</head><p>We build an end-to-end system for insight extrac- tion on biomedical literature. We develop novel similarity measurement modeling with deep neu- ral networks to extract causation/correlation rela- tions. Our evaluation shows the system is able to extract insights with competitive human accep- Case 1: Scalp recorded direct current potential shifts associated with the transition to sleep in man. Abstract: Cortical direct current (DC) potentials are considered to reflect the state of cortical excitability which may change char- acteristically from wakefulness to sleep. The present experiments examined changes in the scalp recorded DC potential in 10 healthy hu- mans ... It is reasonable to assume that the slow negative shift of the DC potential at the transi- tion from wakefulness to sleep reflects increased cortical excitability.</p><p>Case 2: Alcohol consumption and self-reported sunburn: a cross-sectional, population-based survey. Abstract: Heavy drinking has been asso- ciated with several cancers, including melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. ... 299,658 adults reported their use of alcohol in the preceding month and a history of sunburn in the preceding year. Approximately 33.5% of respondents re- ported a sunburn within the past year. ... Exces- sive drinking is associated with higher rates of sunburn among American adults. The observed relationship typifies the high-risk behavior asso- ciated with excessive drinking and suggests one pathway linking alcohol use with skin cancer.</p><p>Example 2: Case Study tance accuracy and its relation extraction compo- nent compares favorably against previous work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>&gt;Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Our causality/correlation relation extraction component models both relational similarity (blue) and contextual similarity (red).
