				<p>Automatically compiling bilingual dictionaries of technical terms from comparable corpora is a challenging problem, yet with many potential applications. In this paper, we exploit two independent observations about term translations: (a) terms are often formed by corresponding sub-lexical units across languages and (b) a term and its translation tend to appear in similar lexical context. Based on the first observation , we develop a new character n-gram compositional method, a logistic regression classifier, for learning a string similarity measure of term translations. According to the second observation, we use an existing context-based approach. For evaluation , we investigate the performance of compositional and context-based methods on: (a) similar and unrelated languages, (b) corpora of different degree of comparability and (c) the translation of frequent and rare terms. Finally, we combine the two translation clues, namely string and contextual similarity, in a linear model and we show substantial improvements over the two translation signals.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Bilingual dictionaries of technical terms are re- sources useful for various tasks, such as computer- aided human translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dagan and Church, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fung and McKeown, 1997)</ref>, Statistical Ma- chine Translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Och and Ney, 2003)</ref> and Cross- Language Information Retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballesteros and Croft, 1997</ref>). In the last two decades, researchers have focused on automatically compiling bilingual term dictionaries either from parallel ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Smadja et al., 1996</ref>; Van der Eijk, 1993) or comparable cor- pora <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rapp, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fung and Yee, 1998)</ref>. While parallel corpora contain the same sentences in two languages, comparable corpora consist of bilin- gual pieces of text that share some features, only, such as topic, domain, or time period. Comparable corpora can be constructed more easily than paral- lel corpora. Freely available, up-to-date, on-line resources (e.g., Wikipedia) can be employed.</p><p>In this paper, we exploit two different sources of information to extract bilingual terminology from comparable corpora: the compositional and the contextual clue. The compositional clue is the hypothesis that the representations of a term in any pair of languages tend to consist of cor- responding lexical or sub-lexical units, e.g., pre- fixes, suffices and morphemes. In order to cap- ture associations of textual units across languages, we investigate three different character n-gram ap- proaches, namely a Random Forest (RF) classifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kontonatsios et al., 2014)</ref>, Support Vector Ma- chines with an RBF kernel (SVM-RBF) and a Lo- gistic Regression (LogReg) classifier. Whilst the previous approaches take as an input monolingual features and then try to find cross-lingual map- pings, our proposed method (LogReg classifier) considers multilingual features, i.e., tuples of co- occurring n-grams.</p><p>The contextual clue is the hypothesis that mu- tual translations of a term tend to occur in similar lexical context. Context-based approaches are un- supervised methods that compare the context dis- tributions of a source and a target term. A bilin- gual seed dictionary is used to map context vec- tor dimensions of two languages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Li and Gaussier (2010)</ref> suggested that the seed dictionary can be used to estimate the degree of comparability of a bilingual corpus. Given a seed dictionary, the cor- pus comparability is the expectation of finding for each word of the source corpus, its translation in the target part of the corpus. The performance of context-based methods has been shown to depend on the frequency of terms to be translated and the corpus comparability. In this work, we use an ex- isting distributional semantics approach to locate term translations.</p><p>Furthermore, we hypothesise that the compo- sitional and contextual clue are orthogonal, since the former considers the internal structure of terms while the latter exploits the surrounding lexical context. Based on the above hypothesis, we com- bine the two translation clues in a linear model. For experimentation, we construct compara- ble corpora for four language pairs (English- Spanish, English-French, English-Greek and English-Japanese) of the biomedical domain.</p><p>We choose this domain because a large propor- tion of the medical terms tends to composition- ally translate across languages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lovis et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Namer and Baud, 2007)</ref>. Additionally, given the vast amount of newly introduced terms (neolo- gisms) in the medical domain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pustejovsky et al., 2001</ref>), term alignment methods are needed in or- der to automatically update existing resources.</p><p>We investigate the following aspects of term alignment: (a) the performance of compositional methods on closely related and on distant lan- guages, (b) the performance of context vectors and compositional methods when translating frequent or rare terms, (c) the degree to which the corpus comparability affects the performance of context- based and compositional methods (d) the improve- ments that we can achieve when we combine the compositional and context clue.</p><p>Our experiments show that the performance of compositional methods largely depends on the dis- tance between the two languages. The perfor- mance of the context-based approach is greatly affected by corpus-specific parameters (the fre- quency of occurrence of the terms to be translated and the degree of corpora comparability). It is also shown that the combination of compositional and contextual methods performs better than each of the clues, separately. Combined systems can be deployed in application environments with differ- ent language pairs, comparable corpora and seeds dictionaries.</p><p>The LogReg, dictionary extraction method de- scribed in this paper is freely available 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Context-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fung and Yee, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rapp, 1999</ref>) adapt the Distributional Hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Harris, 1954)</ref>, i.e., words that occur in similar lexical context tend to have the same meaning, in a multilingual environment. They represent the context of each term t as a context vector, usu- ally following the bag-of-words model. Each di- mension of the vector corresponds to a context word occurring within a predefined window, while the corresponding value is computed by a corre- lation metric, e.g., Log-Likelihood Ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Morin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002</ref>) or Point-wise Mutual Information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andrade et al., 2010)</ref>. A general bilingual dictionary is then used to translate/project the target context vectors into the source language. As a result, the source and target context vectors become directly compara- ble. In a final step, candidate translations are being ranked according to a distance metric, e.g., cosine similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tamura et al., 2012)</ref> or Jaccard index ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zanzotto et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Apidianaki et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Whilst context-based methods have become a common practise for bilingual dictionary extrac- tion from comparable corpora, nonetheless, their performance is subject to various factors, one of which is the quality of the comparable corpus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Li and Gaussier (2010)</ref> introduced the corpus com- parability metric and showed that it is related to the performance of context vectors. The higher the corpus comparability is, the higher the perfor- mance of context vectors is. Furthermore, context vector approaches are sensitive to the frequency of terms. For frequent terms, distributional seman- tics methods exhibit robust performance since the corresponding context is more informative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2002)</ref> reported an accuracy of 91% for the top 20 candidates when translating terms that occur 100 times or more. However, the performance of context vectors drastically de- creases for lower frequency terms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kontonatsios et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Morin and Daille, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Our work is more closely related to a second class of term alignment methods that exploits the internal structure of terms between a source and a target language. Compositional translation al- gorithms are based on the principal of composi- tionality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Keenan and Faltz, 1985)</ref>, which claims that the translation of the whole is a function of the translation of its parts. <ref type="bibr">Lexical (Morin and Daille, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daille, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Robitaille et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Tanaka, 2002</ref>) and sub-lexical <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Delpech et al., 2012</ref>) compositional algorithms are knowledge- rich approaches that proceed in two steps, namely generation and selection. In the generation step, an input source term is segmented into basic trans- lation units: words (lexical compositional meth- ods) or morphemes (sub-lexical methods). Then a pre-compiled, seed dictionary of words or mor- phemes is used to translate the components of the source term. Finally, a permutation function gen- erates candidate translations using the list of the translated segments. In the selection step, candi- date translations are ranked according to their fre- quency <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Morin and Daille, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Robitaille et al., 2006</ref>) or their context similarity with the source term <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tanaka, 2002</ref>). The performance of the compositional translation algorithms is bound to the coverage of the seed dictionary <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Daille, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Delpech et al. (2012)</ref> noted that 30% of untrans- lated terms were due to the low coverage of the seed dictionary. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kontonatsios et al. (2014)</ref> introduced a Random Forest (RF) classifier that learns correspondences of character n-grams between a source and target language. Unlike lexical and sub-lexical compo- sitional methods, a RF classifier does not require a bilingual dictionary of translation units. The model is able to automatically build correlation paths between source and target sub-lexical seg- ments that best discriminate translation from non- translation pairs. However, being a supervised method, it still requires a seed bilingual dictio- nary of technical terms for training. The RF classi- fier was previously applied on an English-Spanish comparable corpus and it was shown to signifi- cantly outperform context-based approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>In this section we describe the character n-gram models, the context vector method and the hybrid system. The lexicon induction task is formalised as a two-class classification problem. Given a pair of terms in a source and a target language, the out- put is a prediction of whether the terms are mutual translations are not. Furthermore, each term align- ment method implements a ranking function that calculates a similarity score between a source and a target term. The methods rank target terms ac- cording to the similarity score and select the top N ranked terms as candidate translations. The rank- ing functions will be discussed in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Character n-gram models</head><p>Let s be a source term containing p character n- grams (s={s 1 , s 2 , ..., s p } s i ∈ S, ∀i ∈ [1, p]) and t a target term of q n-grams (t={t 1 , t 2 , ..., t q } t i ∈ T , ∀i ∈ <ref type="bibr">[1, q]</ref>). We extract charac- ter n-grams by considering any contiguous, non- linguistically motivated sequence of characters that occurs within a window size of <ref type="bibr">[2 − 5]</ref> 2 ) for English, French and Greek. For Japanese, uni- grams are included (window size of <ref type="bibr">[1 − 5]</ref> be- cause Japanese terms often contain Kanji (Chi- nese) characters.</p><p>Given the two lists of source and target n-grams, our objective is to find an underlying relationship between S and T that best discriminates trans- lation from non-translation pairs. The RF clas- sifier was previously shown to exhibit such be- haviour ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kontonatsios et al., 2014</ref>). An RF clas- sifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Breiman, 2001</ref>) is a collection of decision trees voting for the most popular class. For a pair of source and target terms s, t, the RF method creates feature vectors of a fixed size 2r, i.e., first order feature space. The first r features are ex- tracted from the source term, while the last r fea- tures from the target term. Each feature has a boolean value (0 or 1) that designates the pres- ence/absence of the corresponding n-gram in the input instance.</p><p>The ability of the RF to detect latent associa- tions between S and T relies on the decision trees. The internal nodes of a decision tree represent the n-gram features that are linked together in the tree- hierarchy. Each leaf node of the trees is labelled as translation or non-translation indicating whether the parent path of n-gram features is positively or negatively associated. The classification margin that we use to rank the candidate translations is given by a margin function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Breiman, 2001)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">mg(X, Y ) = av(I(x) = 1)−av(I(x)) = 0) (1)</formula><p>where x is an instance s, t, y ∈ Y = {0, 1} the class label, I(·) : (s, t) −→ {0, 1} is the indicator function of a decision tree and av(I(·)) the aver- age number of trees voting for the same class la- bel. In our experiments, we used the same settings as the ones reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kontonatsios et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>We used 140 decision trees and log 2 |2q| + 1 ran- dom features. For training an RF model, we used the WEKA platform ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hall et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The second class of machine learning algo- rithms that we investigate is Support Vector Ma- chines (SVMs). The simplest version of SVMs is a linear classifier (linear-SVM) that tries to place a hyperplane, a decision boundary, that sepa- rates translation from non-translation instances. A linear-SVM is a feature agnostic method since the model only exploits the position of the vectors in the hyperspace to achieve class separation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hastie et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>The first order feature representation used with the RF classifier does not model associations be- tween S and T . Hence, intuitively, a first or- der feature space is not linearly separable, i.e., there exists no decision boundary that divides the data points into translations and non-translations. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . To solve non-linear classification problems, SVMs employ non-linear kernels. A kernel func- tion projects input instances into a higher dimen- sional space to discover non-linear associations between the initial features. In this new, projected feature space, the SVM attempts to define a sep- arating plane. For training an non-linear SVM on the first order feature space, we used the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011) with a radial ba- sis function (RBF) kernel. For ranking candidate translations, we used the decision value given by LIBSVM which represents the distance between an instance and the hyperplane. To translate a source term, the method ranks candidate transla- tions by decision value and suggests as best trans- lation the candidate with the maximum distance (maximum margin).</p><p>While the first order models try to find cross- lingual mappings between monolingual features, our proposed method follows a different approach. It models cross-lingual links between the source and target character n-grams and uses them as second order features to train a linear classifier. A second order feature is a tuple of n-grams in S and T , respectively, that co-occur in a train- ing, translation instance. Second order feature values are boolean. Given a translation instance s, t of p source and q target n-grams, there are p×q second order features. For dimensionality re- duction, we consider as second order features the most frequent out of all possible first order feature combinations, only. Experiments indicate that a large number of features needs to be considered to achieve robust performance. To cope with the high dimensional second order space, we use LI- BLINEAR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fan et al., 2008)</ref>, which is designed to solve large-scale, linear classifications prob- lems. LIBLINEAR implements two linear clas- sification algorithms: LogReg and linear-SVM. Both models solve the same optimisation problem, i.e., determine the optimal separating plane, but they adopt different loss functions. Since LIBLIN- EAR does not support decision value estimations for the linear-SVM, we only experimented with LogReg. Similarly to SVM-RBF, LogReg ranks candidate translations by classification margin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Context vectors</head><p>We follow a standard approach to calculate context similarity of source and target terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rapp, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Morin and Daille, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Morin and Prochasson, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Delpech et al., 2012)</ref>. Context vectors of candidate terms in the source and target lan- guage are populated after normalising each bilin- gual corpus, separately. Normalisation consists of stop-word filtering, tokenisation, lemmatisa- tion and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. For En- glish, Spanish and French we used the TreeTagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schmid, 1994)</ref> while for Greek we used the ILSP toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Papageorgiou et al., 2000</ref>). The Japanese corpus was segmented and PoS-tagged using Ju- man ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kurohashi and Kawahara, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In succession, monolingual context vectors are compiled by considering all lexical units that oc- cur within a window of 3 words before or af- ter a term (a seven-word window). Only lexical units (seeds) that occur in a bilingual dictionary are retained The values in context vectors are Log- Likelihood Ratio associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dunning, 1993)</ref> of the term and a seed lexical unit occurring in it. In a second step, we use the translations in the seed dictionary to map target context vectors into the source vector space. If there are several transla- tions for a term, they are all considered with equal weights. Finally, candidate translations are ranked in descending order of the cosine of the angle be- tween the mapped target vectors and the source  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Architecture of the hybrid term align- ment system.</p><p>vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Hybrid term alignment system</head><p>Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of our term alignment system. We use two bilingual seed dic- tionaries: (a) a dictionary of term translation pairs to train the n-gram models and (b) a dictionary of word-to-word correspondences to translate target context vectors. The n-gram and context vector methods are used separately to score term pairs. The n-gram model computes the value of the com- positional clue while the context vector estimates the score of the contextual clue. The hybrid model combines both methods by using the correspond- ing scores as features to train a linear classifier. For this, we used a linear-SVM of the LIBSVM package with default values for all parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data</head><p>Following previous research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Prochasson and Fung, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klementiev et al., 2012</ref>), we construct compara- ble biomedical corpora using Wikipedia as a freely available resource. Starting with a list of 4K biomedical English terms (query-terms), we collected 4K English Wikipedia articles, by matching query-terms to the topic signatures of articles. Then, we followed the Wikipedia interlingual links to retrieve the- matically related articles in each target language. Since not all English articles contain links for all four target languages (Spanish, French, Greek and Japanese), we used a different list of query-terms for each language pair. Corpora were randomly divided into training and testing parts. For train- ing we used 3K documents and for testing the re- maining 1K. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the size of corpora in terms of numbers of source (SW) and target words (TW).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Seed dictionaries</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the term alignment methods require two seed bilingual dictionaries: a term and a word dictionary. The character n-gram models rely on a bilingual term dictionary to learn asso- ciations of n-grams that appear often in technical terms. The dictionary may contain both single- word and multi-word terms. For English-Spanish and English-French we used UMLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bodenreider, 2004</ref>) while for English-Japanese we used an elec- tronic dictionary of medical terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Denshika and Kenkyukai, 1991</ref>).</p><p>An English-Greek biomedical dictionary was not available at the time of conducting these ex- periments, thus we automatically compiled a dic- tionary from a parallel corpus. For this, we trained a standard Statistical Machine Translation system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koehn et al., 2007</ref>) on EMEA (Tiedemann, 2009), a biomedical parallel corpus containing sentence- aligned documents from the European Medicines Agency. Then, we extracted all English-Greek pairs for which: (a) the English sequence was listed in UMLS and (b) the translation probability was equal or higher to 0.7.</p><p>The sizes of the seed term dictionaries vary sig- nificantly, e.g., 500K entries for English-French but only 20K entries for English-Greek. How- ever, the character n-gram models require a rela- tively small portion of the corresponding dictio- nary to converge. In the reported experiments, we used 10K translation pairs as positive, train- ing instances. In addition, we generated an equal number of pseudo-negative instances by randomly matching non-translation terms.</p><p>Morin and Prochasson (2011b) showed that the translation accuracy of context vectors is higher when using bilingual dictionaries that contain both general language entries and technical terms rather than general or domain-specific dictionaries, sep-  arately. In a mixed dictionary, lexical units are either single-word technical terms, such as "dis- ease" and "patient", or general language words, such as "occur" and "high". Note that we have already compiled a seed term dictionary for each pair of languages. Following the suggestion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Morin and Prochasson (2011b)</ref>, we attempt to en- rich the seed term dictionaries with general lan- guage entries. For this, we extracted bilingual word dictionaries for English-Spanish, English- French and English-Greek by applying GIZA++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Och and Ney, 2003</ref>) on the EMEA corpus. We then concatenated the word with the term dictio- naries to obtain enhanced seeds for the three lan- guage pairs. For English-Japanese, we only used the term dictionary to translate the target context vectors.</p><p>Once the word dictionaries have been compiled, we compute the corpus comparability measure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Li and Gaussier (2010)</ref> define corpus comparability as the percentage of words that can be translated bi-directionally, given a seed dictionary. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows corpus comparability scores of the four corpora accompanied with the number of English, single words in the seed dictionar- ies. It can be observed that seed dictionary sizes are not necessarily proportional to the correspond- ing corpus comparability scores. As expected, for English-Japanese, corpus comparability is low be- cause the dictionary contains single-word terms, only. The English-Spanish dictionary is smaller than the English-French but achieved higher cor- pus comparability, i.e., a higher percentage of words can be bi-directionally translated using the corresponding seed dictionary. A possible ex- planation is that the comparable corpora were constructed using different lists of query-terms. Hence, the query-terms used for English-Spanish retrieved a more coherent corpus. The resulting values of corpus comparability indicate that the context vectors will perform the best for English- Spanish while for English-Japanese the perfor- mance is expected to be substantially lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Training and evaluation datasets</head><p>For evaluation, we construct a test dataset of single-word terms, in particular nouns or adjec- tives. The dataset contains 1K terms that occur more frequently than 20 but not more than 200 times and are listed in the English part of the UMLS. In order to extract candidate translations, we considered all nouns or adjectives that occur at least 5 times in the target part of the corpus. Furthermore, we do not constraint the evaluation datasets only to those terms whose corresponding translation occurs in the corpus.</p><p>The hybrid model that combines the composi- tional and context clue, is based on a two-feature model. Therefore, the model converges using only a few hundred instances. For training a hybrid model, we used 1K translation instances that oc- curred in the training comparable corpora. Sim- ilarly, to the character n-gram models, pseudo- negative instances were generated by randomly coupling non-translation terms. The ratio of posi- tive to negative instances is 1 : 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we present three experiments con- ducted to evaluate the character n-gram, con- text vector and hybrid methods. Firstly, we examine the performance of the n-gram mod- els on closely related language pairs (English- French, English-Spanish), on a distant language pair (English-Greek) and on an unrelated language pair (English-Japanese). English and Greek are not unrelated because they are members of the same language family, but also not closely re- lated because they use different scripts. Secondly, we compare the character n-gram methods against context vectors when translating frequent or rare terms and on comparable corpora of similar lan- guage pairs (English-French, English-Spanish) but of different corpus comparability scores. Thirdly, we evaluate the hybrid method on all four com- parable corpora and investigate the improvement margin of combining the contextual with the com- positional clue.</p><p>As evaluation metrics, we adopt the top-N translation accuracy, following most previous ap- proaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rapp, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tamura et al., 2012</ref>). The top-N translation accuracy is defined as the per- centage of source terms for which a given method has output the correct translation among the top N candidate translations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Character n-gram models</head><p>In the first experiment, we investigate the perfor- mance of the character n-gram models consider- ing an increasing number of features. The features were sorted in order of decreasing frequency of oc- currence. Starting from the top of the list, more features were incrementally added and translation accuracy was recorded. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows the top-20 translation accu- racy of single-word terms on an increasing num- ber of first and second order features. With re- gards to the first order models (Subfigure 2a), the Random Forest (RF) classifier outperforms our baseline method (SVM-RBF) for all four lan- guage pairs. The largest margin between RF and SVM-RBF can be observed for the English-Greek dataset while for closely related language pairs, i.e., English-French and English-Spanish, the mar- gin is smaller. Furthermore, it can be noted that using only a small number of first order features, 1K features (500 for the source and 500 for the target language, both n-gram models reach a sta- ble performance.</p><p>In contrast to the first order models, the Lo- gReg classifier requires a large number of sec- ond order features to achieve a robust performance (Subfigure 2b). Starting from 100K features, the translation accuracy continuously increases. The best performance is observed for a total number of 4M second order features when considering the English-French, English-Spanish and English- Greek datasets. For English-Japanese, the best performance is achieved for 2M features. Beyond this point, translation accuracy decreases slightly.</p><p>After feature selection is performed, we directly compare all the character n-gram models. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarises performance achieved by the LogReg, RF and SVM-RBF models. It can be noted that LogReg and RF performed similarly for closely related languages (no statistically significant dif- ferences were observed) while both methods out- performed the SVM-RBF. However, for English- Greek and English-Japanese, LogReg achieved a statistically significant improvement over the translation accuracy of RF and SVM-RBF. Lo- gReg outperformed RF by 7% for English-Greek, while for English-Japanese the improvement was 10% and 17% percent for top-1 and top-20 accu- racy, respectively. Finally, it can be observed that the more distant the language pair is, the lower the performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">N-gram methods and context vectors</head><p>In this experiment, we compare the n-gram meth- ods against context vectors with regards to two pa- rameters: (a) the frequency of source terms to be translated and (b) corpus comparability. English- French and English-Spanish are similar language pairs but the corresponding corpora are of dif- ferent corpus comparability scores. To investi- gate how performance is affected by term occur- rence frequency, we compiled an additional test dataset of 1K rare English terms in the frequency range <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref>. Our intuition is, that character n- gram methods will perform similarly for all set- tings since character n-grams are corpus indepen- dent features.</p><p>We compare (a) the character n-gram models (LogReg, RF and SVM-RBF) with (b) the con- text vector method (context) and (c) an upper bound. The latter represents the percentage of source terms for which a reference translation ac- tually occurs in the target corpus. Hence, the up- per bound is the maximum performance achiev- able according to the reference evaluation. <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> shows the top-20 translation accu- racy for high and medium frequency terms, within the frequency range <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">200]</ref>. Context vectors achieved a robust performance of 52% and 45% for English-Spanish and English-French, respec- tively. The difference in corpus comparability can explain this 7% margin between these perfor- mances. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, the corpus com- parability scores for English-Spanish and English-  <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref> Figure 3: Top-20 translation accuracy of terms in the frequency range of <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">200]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref> French are 0.75 and 0.71, respectively. In contrast to context vectors, the character n-gram methods performed comparably.</p><p>A second factor that affects the performance of context vectors, is the frequency of the terms to be translated. The translation of rare terms has been shown to be a challenging case for context vectors. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Morin and Daille (2010)</ref> reported low accuracy (21% for the top-20 can- didates) of context vectors for terms occurring 20 times or less. In our experiments, <ref type="figure">Figure 3b</ref> illus- trates accuracies achieved for less frequent terms ( <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref>). The performance of context vectors is significantly lower, 26% for English-Spanish and 21% for English-French. Furthermore, the trans- lation accuracy of the n-gram methods decreases slightly (∼ 5% to 8%). This can be explained by the decrease of the upper bound for lower fre- quency terms (∼ 3% to 6%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Combining internal and contextual similarity</head><p>We have hypothesised that the compositional and contextual clue are orthogonal, i.e., they convey  To investigate this intuition, we evaluate the hybrid model on all four comparable corpora, for term oc- currence frequencies in <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">200]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4a</ref> illustrates top-20 translation accu- racy scores for (a) the character n-gram models, (b) the context vector method and (c) the hy- brid models, i.e., LogReg+Context, RF+Context, SVM-RBF+Context. We observe that the com- bination of the compositional and contextual clue improved the performance of all methods. The hy- brid model largely improved the performance of the SVM-RBF (∼ 14% to 20%). With regards to the combined signals the translation accuracy of LogReg and RF increased by ∼ 4% for the English-Japanese corpus and ∼ 8% for all other corpora.</p><p>For the top 1 candidate translation, we observe in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> smaller improvements achieved by the hybrid model in comparison to the top-20 accu- racy. Interestingly, the RF classifier performed slightly better on its own for English-French, English-Spanish and English-Japanese. This in- dicates that the hybrid method ranks more correct translations in the top 20 candidates but it does not always assign the best score to the correct answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discusion and Future work</head><p>In this paper, we investigated a compositional and a context-based approach useful for compil- ing bilingual dictionaries of terms automatically from comparable corpora. Compositional transla- tion methods exploit the internal structure of terms across languages while context-based approaches investigate the surrounding lexical context.</p><p>We proposed a character n-gram composi- tional method, i.e., a Logistic Regression clas- sifier, which uses a multilingual representation, i.e., source and target terms. Experimental evi- dence showed that the LogReg classifier signifi- cantly outperformed the baseline methods on dis- tant languages. For closely related languages, Lo- gReg performed comparably to an existing n-gram method based on a Random Forest classifier.</p><p>Furthermore, we compared the n-gram models against a context-based approach under different corpus-specific parameters: (a) corpus compara- bility, which is relevant to the seed dictionary, and (b) the occurrence frequency of the terms to be translated. It was shown that the performance of n-gram methods was not affected by different pa- rameter settings. Only small fluctuations were ob- served, since the n-gram methods are based on corpus-independent features, only. In contrast, the context-based method was affected by corpus comparability scores. The corresponding transla- tion accuracy declined significantly for rare terms.</p><p>Finally, we hypothesised that the n-gram and context-based methods provide complimentary in- formation. To test this hypothesis, we developed a hybrid method that combines compositional and contextual similarity scores as features in a lin- ear classifier. The hybrid model achieved signif- icantly better top-20 translation accuracy than the two methods separately but minor improvements were observed in terms of top-1 accuracy.</p><p>As future work, we plan to improve the qual- ity of the extracted dictionary further by exploiting additional translation signals. For example, previ- ous works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klementiev et al., 2012</ref>) have reported that the temporal and topic similarity are clues that indicate transla- tion equivalence. It would be interesting to investi- gate the contribution of different clues for various experimental parameters, e.g., domain, distance of languages, types of comparable corpora.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Top-20 translation accuracy of models trained on (a) first and (b) second order features English-French English-Spanish English-Greek English-Japanese acc@1 acc@20 acc@1 acc@20 acc@1 acc@20 acc@1 acc@20 LogReg 0.45 0.61 0.42 0.62 0.3 0.48 0.25 0.41 RF 0.47 0.58 0.43 0.59 0.23 0.41 0.15 0.24 SVM-RBF 0.38 0.51 0.33 0.53 0.1 0.25 0.06 0.16 Table 3: Top-1 (acc@1) and top-20 (acc@20) translation accuracy of LogReg, RF and SVM-RBF</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> we have experiments with larger and narrower window sizes but this setting resulted in better translation accuracy</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> We applied a linear-SVM with the first order feature representation on the four comparable corpora for EnglishFrench, English-Spanish, English-Greek and EnglishJapanese. In all cases, the best accuracies achieved were close to zero. Additionally, the ranked list of candidate translations was the same for all source terms. Hence, we can empirically suggest that the linear-SVM cannot exploit a first order feature space.</note>
