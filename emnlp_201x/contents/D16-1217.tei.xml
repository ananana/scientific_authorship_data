			<abstract>
				<p>We investigate whether psychological well-being translates across English and Span-ish Twitter, by building and comparing source language and automatically translated weighted lexica in English and Spanish. We find that the source language models perform substantially better than the machine translated versions. Moreover, manually correcting translation errors does not improve model performance, suggesting that meaningful cultural information is being lost in translation. Further work is needed to clarify when automatic translation of well-being lexica is effective and how it can be improved for cross-cultural analysis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Interest in sentiment analysis spans academic and commercial domains, with wide-ranging applica- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Pang and Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Liu, 2012)</ref>. While the majority of tools for sentiment analysis have been developed for English text, ideally sentiment and emotion could be analyzed across many languages. Does one need to build models for each language of interest, or can models be applied cross-culturally? More generally, how do cultures differ in the lan- guage they use to express sentiment and feeling? Sentiment in resource-poor languages has com- monly been assessed by first translating text into En- glish and then applying an English sentiment model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mohammad et al., 2016)</ref>. This approach is eco- nomical and efficient, as building each model of in- terest in every target language is resource-intensive. Yet it is not clear how much culturally specific information and accuracy are lost in the transla- tion process, and specifically how this varies across languages, cultures, linguistic content, and corpora (e.g., social media vs. news). While extensive work has demonstrated that automatic machine transla- tion (MT) methods are competitive when translat- ing opinion in news and blogs, less research has ex- amined the translation of sentiment on social me- dia, and specifically on Twitter, known for its re- striction of individual exchanges to short samples of text (140 characters) and informal language. More- over, research has not focused on translating subjec- tive well-being specifically.</p><p>Beyond sentiment, this paper investigates how ex- pressions of personal well-being translate between English and Spanish on Twitter. We have English and Spanish speakers annotate Tweets in their na- tive language for five components of subjective well- being (positive emotion, engagement, positive re- lationships, meaning, and accomplishment) (Selig- man, 2011). We then compare how well models trained and tested in the same language compare to (a) models developed in one language, and then translated (using Google Translate) to the other lan- guage (e.g., how well English models translated to Spanish work on Spanish Tweets) and (b) how well models developed in one language work on Tweets translated from another language (e.g., how well En- glish models work on Tweets translated from Span- ish to English).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>There is a vast literature on sentiment analysis which space precludes us from surveying; see ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Liu, 2012)</ref> for an excellent overview. A small but rapidly grow- ing camp is developing methods to estimate per- sonality and emotion, asking "how does she feel?" rather than "how much does she like the product?" ). In social media, the well-being of individuals as well as communities has been studied, on various platforms such as <ref type="bibr">Facebook and Twitter (Bollen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Schwartz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Eichstaedt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Schwartz et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Translating sentiment</head><p>Past work has, on the whole, regarded state-of-the- art automatic translation for sentiment analysis opti- mistically. In assessing statistical MT, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balahur and Turchi, 2012)</ref> found that modern SMT systems can produce reliable training data for languages other than English. Comparative evaluations between En- glish and Romanian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Mihalcea et al., 2007)</ref> and En- glish and both Spanish and Romanian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banea et al., 2008</ref>) based on the English MPQA sentiment data suggest that, in spite of word ambiguity in either the source or target language, automatic translation is a viable alternative to the construction of mod- els in target languages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wan (2008)</ref> shows that it is useful to improve a system in a target language (Chinese) by applying ensemble methods exploit- ing sentiment-specific data and lexica from the tar- get language and a source language (English). More recent work has examined how sentiment changes with translation between English and Arabic, also finding that automatic translation of English texts yields competitive results <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mohammad et al., 2016)</ref>. However, translated texts tend to lose sentiment information such that the translated data is more neutral than the source lan- guage ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Salameh et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>It is less obvious how well expressions of emo- tion or subjective well-being translate between lan- guages and cultures; the words for liking a phone or TV may be more similar across cultures than the ones for finding life and relationships satisfying, or work meaningful and engaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Well-being</head><p>In contrast to classic sentiment analysis, well-being is not restricted to positive and negative emo- tion. In 2011, the psychologist Martin Selig- man proposed PERMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Seligman, 2011)</ref>, a five- dimensional model of well-being where 'P' stands for positive emotion, 'E' is engagement, 'R' is pos- itive relationships, 'M' is meaning, and 'A' is a sense of accomplishment. PERMA is of interest to this translation context because while the 'P' dimen- sion maps relatively cleanly onto traditional con- ceptions of sentiment (i.e., positive and negative emotion), PERMA also includes social and cogni- tive components which may be expressed with more variation across languages and cultures. In recent work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Schwartz et al. (2016)</ref> developed an English PERMA model using Facebook data. In this pa- per, we adopt a similar method when building our message-level models over Tweets.</p><p>Governments around the world are increasingly dedicating resources to the measurement of well- being to complement traditional economic indica- tors such as gross domestic product. Being able to measure well-being across regions is not only be- coming more important for institutions and policy- makers, but also for private sector entities that want to assess and promote the well-being of their orga- nizations and customers. This raises the importance of translation, given that resources for the measure- ment of well-being are disproportionately available in English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>We collected Spanish data using the Twitter API, gathering 15.3 million geolocated Tweets between September and November 2015 using a lati- tude/longitude bounding box around Spain. This set was reduced to messages containing only Spanish using the Language Identification (LangID) Python package ( <ref type="bibr">Lui and Baldwin, 2012)</ref>. We restricted to messages with an 80% or higher Spanish confidence score as given by LangID. This resulted in 6.1 mil- lion Tweets from 290,000 users. We selected 5,100 random messages from this set for annotation. En- glish Tweets were similarly collected using the Twit- ter API, restricted to the US, and filtered to be (pri- marily) in English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Annotating message-level data</head><p>Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) was used to annotate the 5,000 random English (American) Tweets <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . CrowdFlower, an online crowdsourcing platform similar to MTurk, but more widely used in Europe, was used to annotate our 5,100 random Spanish Tweets <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . As the Tweets exclusively came from Spain, raters were restricted to fluent Spanish speakers who live in Spain.</p><p>On both MTurk and CrowdFlower, separate anno- tation tasks were set up for each of the 10 PERMA components (positive and negative dimensions for the 5 components). Workers were given the defini- tion of the PERMA construct, directions on how to perform the task, and were presented with an exam- ple annotation task. During the task workers were asked to indicate "to what extent does this message express" the construct in question on a scale from 1 ("Not at all") to 7 ("Extremely"). Directions were presented in English for the English task, and in Spanish for the Spanish task. The Spanish instruc- tions were translated manually from English by a bilingual English-Spanish speaker and verified by an additional bilingual speaker.</p><p>In the English task, two raters assessed each mes- sage. If the raters disagreed by more than 3 points, a rating was obtained from a third rater. It proved more difficult to get raters for the Spanish task, even on CrowdFlower. In some cases we were unable to obtain even a single annotation for a given Tweet and PERMA component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Developing weighted lexica</head><p>Tweets were tokenzied using an emoticon-aware to- kenizer, 'happy fun tokenizer' 1 . We then extracted unigrams and bigrams from each corpus, yielding vocabularies of 5,430 and 4,697 'words' in English and Spanish, respectively. The presence/absence of these unigrams and bigrams in each Tweet were used as features in Lasso (L1 penalized regression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Tibshirani, 1996</ref>) models to predict the average anno- tation score for each of the crowdsourced PERMA labels. Separate models, each consisting of regres- sion weights for each term in the lexicon, were built for each of the ten (five positive and five nega- tive) PERMA components in both English and Span- ish 1 . Each model was validated using 10-fold cross validation, with Pearson correlations averaged over the 10 positive/negative PERMA components. Re- 1 Available at www.wwbp.org. sults are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The models were then transformed into a predictive lexicon using the methods described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sap et al., 2014)</ref>, where the weights in the lexicon were derived from the above Lasso regression model. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Translating the models</head><p>We used Google Translate to translate both the orig- inal English and Spanish Tweets and the words in the models. We also created versions of the trans- lated models in which we manually corrected appar- ent translation errors for 25 terms with the largest regression coefficients for each of the 10 PERMA components (the top 250 terms for each model).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Comparative evaluation</head><p>We evaluated how well the different models worked, computing the Pearson correlations be- tween message-level PERMA scores predicted from the different models and the ground-truth annota- tions. Lexica were built on 80% of the messages and then evaluated on the remaining 20%. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref> shows test accuracies. Comparing the English and Spanish source language and machine translated models, we observe substantially better performance when models were built over the same language they are applied to, i.e., using models built in Spanish to predict on Spanish Tweets. Translating the mod- els (e.g., translating an English model to Spanish and using it on Spanish Tweets) or translating the Tweets (e.g., translating Spanish Tweets to English and using an English model) work substantially less well, with translating the Tweets giving marginally better performance than translating the models. Fi- nally, we translate both the model and Tweets, giv- ing slightly better performance than translating the Tweets alone. Complete PERMA lexica were then built over the entire message sets for public release.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Error Analysis</head><p>To quantify the errors in translation, we took the 25 top-weighted words in each component of the PERMA lexicon (250 terms total) and manually translated them with the help of a native Spanish speaker. The manual translations were then com- pared against the automatic translations. Out of the top 25 words we calculated the percentage of cor- rect automatic translations (when manual and auto- matic translations matched) and averaged the per- centages across positive and negative PERMA com- ponents. The average percentage of correct transla- tions is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> as correct trans. These correctly translated terms were then com- pared to the terms in the opposite source model (i.e., after translating English PERMA to Spanish, we compared the translations with Spanish PERMA). We calculated the percentage of the top 250 trans- lated words missing in the 250 top words of the source lexicon for each PERMA component and av- eraged over the 10 components. This value is re- ported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> as missing terms. For terms that appeared in both the translated and source lexica we compared their respective weights, calculating both percentage of terms in which the weights were of different signs and percentage of terms with sub- stantially different weights. Again, these percent- ages were averaged over the 10 PERMA compo- nents. Percentages are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> as opp sign and weight diff, respectively. To be considered "substantially different" the two weights must differ by a factor of 2. It is worth noting that at no point were the translated and source weights equal (within a tolerance of 10 −5 ).</p><p>We then looked at the errors term by term. Out of the 500 terms considered <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(top 250 words per source   source  lang  correct  trans  missing  terms  opp  sign  weight  diff  English  83%  81%</ref> 0.5% 6.9% Spanish 74% 91% 0.0% 4.8%  The % chg column is percentage change relative to the larger weight.

The weight for this term in the translated English to Spanish model was 0.42 whereas the weight in the Spanish model was -0.18, amounting to a 140% change. Next, for each source model we report terms with the largest and smallest differences in weight. These terms and weights are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The language ab- breviation ("en" or "es") listed under each PERMA component is used to denote the source language we translated from. For example, (en) indicates that we started with English PERMA, translated it into Spanish and then compared to Spanish PERMA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>The difference in performance between source and machine translated models can be attributed to a few main problems. First, the translation might be in- accurate (e.g., from our corpus, "te" is not in fact "tea"). We manually corrected translation errors in the prediction models with the help of a native Span- ish speaker, but found that translation error accounts for marginal discrepancy between the source lan- guage and machine translated models. A second source of errors are translations which are technically accurate, yet do not translate cultur- ally. For instance, even though "andaluces" trans- lated correctly into "Andalusians," "Andalusia" (an autonomous community in Spain) does not invoke the same cultural meaning in English as it does for Spaniards. A machine would be hard-pressed to translate "Andalusia" into a relevant region within the U.S. that might invoke similar popular sentiment. Although Spanish and American people share some holidays, musicians, and sports heroes, many of these differ (e.g., "Iker Casillas" is not well known in the U.S. and "La selectividad" may be similar to the "SATs," but this is not captured in MT).</p><p>A third source of error stems from cultural dif- ferences, with certain topics resonating differently cross-culturally. For instance, when comparing the highest weighted positive terms across PERMA, re- ligious language (e.g., "god," "blessed") appears in English but not Spanish, fitting with the popular no- tion that Americans are more religious than Euro- peans. Spanish PERMA's positive emotion com- ponent contains multiple highly weighted instances of laughter; none have high weights in the English model. Highly weighted English negative emo- tion terms are marked by general aggression (e.g., "kill," "stupid") whereas the highest weighted Span- ish terms include derogatory terms for disliked peo- ple (e.g., "douchebag," "fool"). The American posi- tive relationship component is marked by words like "friend" and "friends," while "sister" is weighted more highly in Spanish PERMA.</p><p>Note that this is fundamentally a problem of do- main adaptation rather than MT, as our error analy- sis revealed that the majority of top-weighted terms were exclusive to one source model. Different cul- tures use different words (or at least vastly different word frequencies) when revealing the same kind of well-being. Exploring where the sentiment around a similar concept diverges across languages can pro- vide insight to researchers studying cross-cultural variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Limitations</head><p>This work has significant limitations. First, the En- glish and Spanish annotation processes, though kept as similar as possible, were not identical; annota- tions were gathered on different platforms, and due to our difficulty in recruiting Spanish raters, our total annotations per message varied across tasks. Addi- tionally, the models were built over relatively small corpora of 5,000 English Tweets and 5,100 Span- ish Tweets. These Tweets came from different time periods, which may further reduce similarity be- tween the Spanish and English corpora. Finally, our method does not account for the presence of various sub-cultures within the United States and Spain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we investigated how well expressions of subjective well-being translate across English and Spanish Twitter, finding that the source language models performed substantially better than the ma- chine translated versions. Moreover, manually cor- recting translation errors in the top 250 terms of the lexica did not improve model performance, suggest- ing that meaningful cultural information was lost in translation.</p><p>Our findings suggest that further work is needed to understand when automatic translation of language-based models will lead to competitive sen- timent translation on social media and how such translations can be improved. Cultural differences seem more important than language differences, at least for the tasks we studied here. We expect that language indicators of personality and emotion will similarly translate poorly, but that remains to be studied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Performance (Pearson r correlation) between groundtruth annotations and predicted lexica scores averaged over the 10 PERMA components.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="4,72.00,60.66,226.79,129.26" type="bitmap" /></figure>
