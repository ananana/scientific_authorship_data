				<p>The problem of entity-typing has been studied predominantly in supervised learning fashion , mostly with task-specific annotations (for coarse types) and sometimes with distant supervision (for fine types). While such approaches have strong performance within datasets, they often lack the flexibility to transfer across text genres and to generalize to new type taxonomies. In this work we propose a zero-shot entity typing approach that requires no annotated data and can flexibly identify newly defined types. Given a type taxonomy defined as Boolean functions of FREEBASE &quot;types&quot;, we ground a given mention to a set of type-compatible Wikipedia entries and then infer the target mention&apos;s types using an inference algorithm that makes use of the types of these entries. We evaluate our system on a broad range of datasets, including standard fine-grained and coarse-grained entity typing datasets, and also a dataset in the biological domain. Our system is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art supervised NER systems and outperforms them on out-of-domain datasets. We also show that our system significantly outperforms other zero-shot fine typing systems.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Entity type classification is the task of connect- ing an entity mention to a given set of seman- tic types. The commonly used type sets range in size and level of granularity, from a small num- ber of coarse-grained types <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003)</ref> to over a hundred fine-grained types ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ling and Weld, 2012)</ref>. It is understood that semantic typing is a key component in many natu- ral language understanding tasks, including Ques- tion Answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Toral et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li and Roth, 2005</ref>) and Textual Entailment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dagan et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dagan et al., , 2013</ref>. Consequently, the ability to type mentions semantically across domains and text genres, and to use a flexible type hierarchy, is essential for solving many important challenges.</p><p>Nevertheless, most commonly used ap- proaches and systems for semantic typing (e.g., CORENLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Manning et al., 2014</ref>), COG- COMPNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Khashabi et al., 2018)</ref>, NLTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Loper and Bird, 2002</ref>), SPACY) are trained in a super- vised fashion and rely on high quality, task- specific annotation. Scaling such systems to other domains and to a larger set of entity types faces fundamental restrictions.</p><p>Coarse typing systems, which are mostly fully supervised, are known to fit a single dataset very well. However, their performance drops signifi- cantly on different text genres and even new data sets. Moreover, adding a new coarse type re- quires manual annotation and retraining. For fine- typing systems, people have adopted a distant- supervision approach. Nevertheless, the number of types used is small: the distantly-supervised FIGER dataset covers only 113 types, a small fraction of most-conservative estimates of the number of types in the English language (the FREEBASE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bollacker et al., 2008)</ref> and WORD- NET <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Miller, 1995)</ref> hierarchies consist of more than 1k and 1.5k unique types, respectively). More importantly, adapting these systems, once trained, to new type taxonomies cannot be done flexibly.</p><p>As was argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Roth (2017)</ref>, there is a need to develop new training paradigms that support scal- able semantic processing; specifically, there is a need to scale semantic typing to flexible type tax- onomies and to multiple domains.</p><p>In this work, we introduce ZOE, a zero-shot entity typing system, with open type definitions. Given a mention in a sentence and a taxonomy of entity types with their definitions, ZOE identifies a set of types that are appropriate for the mention <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: ZOE maps a given mention to its type-compatible entities in Wikipedia and infers a collection of types using this set of entities. While the mention "Oarnniwsf," a football player in the U. of Washington, does not exist in Wikipedia, we ground it to other entities with approximately the same types ( §3).</p><p>in this context. ZOE does not require any training, and it makes use of existing data resources (e.g., Wikipedia) and tools developed without any task- specific annotation. The key idea is to ground each mention to a set of type-compatible Wikipedia en- tities. The benefit of using a set of Wikipedia titles as an intermediate representation for a mention is that there is much human-curated information in Wikipedia -categories associated with each page, FREEBASE types, and DBpedia types. These were put there independently of the task at hand and can be harnessed for many tasks: in particular, for de- termining the semantic types of a given mention in its context. In this grounding step, the guid- ing principle is that type-compatible entities often appear in similar contexts. We rely on contextual signals and, when available, surface forms, to rank Wikipedia titles and choose those that are more compatible with a given mention. Importantly, our algorithm does not require a given mention to be in Wikipedia; in fact, in many cases (such as nominal mentions) the mentions are not available in Wikipedia. We hypothesize that any entity possible in English corresponds to some type-compatible entities in Wikipedia. We can then rely mostly on the context to reveal a set of compatible titles, those that are likely to share se- mantic types with the target mention. The fact that our system is not required to ground to the exact concept is a key difference between our ground- ing and "standard" Wikification approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ratinov et al., 2011</ref>). As a consequence, while entity linking approaches rely heavily on priors associated with the surface forms and do not consider those that do not link to Wikipedia titles, our system mostly relies on con- text, regardless of whether the grounding actually exists or not. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a high-level visualization of our system. Given a mention, our system grounds it into type-compatible entries in Wikipedia. The target mention "Oarnniwsf," is not in Wikipedia, yet it is grounded to entities with approximately correct types. In addition, while some of the grounded Wikipedia entries are inaccurate in terms of entity types, the resulting aggregated de- cision is correct.</p><p>ZOE is an open type system, since it is not re- stricted to a closed set of types. In our experi- ments, we build on FREEBASE types as primitive types and use them to define types across seven different datasets. Note, however, that our ap- proach is not fundamentally restricted to FREE- BASE types; in particular, we allow types to be defined as Boolean formulae over these primitives (considering a type to be a set of entities). Further- more, we support other primitives, e.g., DBPedia or Wikipedia entries. Consequently, our system can be used across type taxonomies; there is no need to restrict to previously observed types or re- train with annotations of new types. If one wants to use types that are outside our current vocabu- lary, one only needs to define the target type tax- onomy in terms of the primitives used in this work.</p><p>In summary, our contributions are as follows:</p><p>• We propose a zero-shot open entity typing framework 1 that does not require training on entity-typing-specific supervised data. • The proposed system outperforms existing zero-shot entity typing systems.</p><p>• Our system is competitive with fully- supervised systems in their respective do- mains across a broad range of coarse-and fine-grained typing datasets, and it outper- forms these systems in out-of-domain set- tings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Named Entity Recognition (NER), for which the goal is to discover mention-boundaries in addi- tion to typing, often using a small set of mutu-ally exclusive types, has a considerable amount of work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grishman and Sundheim, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mikheev et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Florian et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ratinov and Roth, 2009</ref>).</p><p>There have been many proposals to scale the systems to support a bigger type space <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fleischman and Hovy, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sekine et al., 2002</ref>). This direction was followed by the introduction of datasets with large label-sets, either manually annotated like BBN ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005</ref>) or distantly supervised like FIGER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ling and Weld, 2012)</ref>. With larger datasets avail- able, supervised-learning systems were proposed to learn from the data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yosef et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abhishek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shimaoka et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xu and Barbosa, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Choi et al., 2018)</ref>. Such systems have achieved remarkable success, mostly when restricted to their observed domain and labels.</p><p>There is a handful of works aiming to pave the road towards zero-shot typing by address- ing ways to extract cheap signals, often to help the supervised algorithms: e.g., by generating gazetteers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nadeau et al., 2006</ref>), or using the an- chor texts in Wikipedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nothman et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nothman et al., , 2009</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ren et al. (2016)</ref> project labels in high- dimensional space and use label correlations to suppress noise and better model their relations. In our work, we choose not to use the supervised- learning paradigm and instead merely rely on a general entity linking corpus and the signals in Wikipedia. Prior work has already shown the im- portance of Wikipedia information for NER. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Tsai et al. (2016a)</ref> use a cross-lingual WIKIFIER to fa- cilitate cross-lingual NER. However, they do not explicitly address the case where the target entity does not exist in Wikipedia.</p><p>The zero-shot paradigm for entity typing has only recently been studied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Yogatama et al. (2015)</ref> proposed an embedding representation for user- defined features and labels, which facilitates in- formation sharing among labels and reduces the dependence on the labels observed in the train- ing set. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yuan and Downey (2018)</ref> can also be seen in the same spirit, i.e., systems that rely on a form of representation of the labels. In a broader sense, such works-including ours- are part of a more general line of work on zero- shot learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Palatucci et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Norouzi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Romera-Paredes and Torr, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Song and Roth, 2014</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Comparison of recent work on entity typ- ing. Our system does not require any labeled data for entity typing; therefore it works on new datasets without retraining.</p><p>be thought of as the continuation of the same re- search direction. A critical step in the design of zero-shot sys- tems is the characterization of the output space. For supervised systems, the output representations are trivial, as they are just indices. For zero-shot systems, the output space is often represented in a high-dimensional space that encodes the seman- tics of the labels. In OTYPER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yuan and Downey, 2018)</ref>, each type embedding is computed by av- eraging the word embeddings of the words com- prising the type. The same idea is also used in PROTOLE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ma et al., 2016)</ref>, except that averag- ing is done only for a few prototypical instances of each type. In our work, we choose to define types using information in Wikipedia. This flex- ibility allows our system to perform well across several datasets without retraining. On a concep- tual level, the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lin et al. (2012)</ref> and  are close to our approach. The gov- erning idea in these works is to cluster mentions, followed by propagating type information from representative mentions. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> compares our proposed system with several recently proposed models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Zero-Shot Open Entity Typing</head><p>Types are conceptual containers that bind entities together to form a coherent group. Among the en- tities of the same type, type-compatibility creates a network of loosely connected entities: Definition 1 (Weak Type Compatibility) Two entities are type-compatible if they share at least one type with respect to a type taxonomy and the contexts in which they appear.</p><p>In our approach, given a mention in a sentence, we aim to discover type-compatible entities in Wikipedia and then infer the mention's types us- ing all the type-compatible entities together. The advantage of using Wikipedia entries is that the rich information associated with them allows us to infer the types more easily. Note that this prob- lem is different from the standard entity linking or Wikification problem in which the goal is to find the corresponding entity in Wikipedia. Wikipedia does not contain all entities in the world, but an entity is likely to have at least one type-compatible entity in Wikipedia.</p><p>In order to find the type-compatible entities, we use the context of mentions as a proxy. Defining it formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Definition 2 (Context Consistency) A mention m (in a context sentence s) is context-consistent</formula><p>with another well-defined mention m , if m can be replaced by m in the context s, and the new sentence still makes logical sense.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 Context consistency is a strong proxy for type compatibility.</p><p>Based on this hypothesis, given a mention m in a sentence s, we find other context-compatible mentions in a Wikified corpus. Since the men- tions in the Wikified corpus are linked to the cor- responding Wikipedia entries, we can infer m's types by aggregating information associated with these Wikipedia entries. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the high-level architecture of our proposed system. The inputs to the system are a mention m in a sentence s, and a type definition T . The output of the system is a set of types {t Target } ⊆ T in the target taxonomy that best represents the given mention. The type definitions characterize the target entity-type space. In our experiments, we choose to use FREEBASE types to define the types across 7 datasets; that is, T is a mapping from the set of FREEBASE types to the set of target types: T : {t FB } → {t Target }. This definition comprises many atomic defi- nitions; for example, we can define the type location as the disjunction of FREEBASE types like FB.location and FB.geography:</p><p>Figure 2: A high-level view of our approach. The inputs to the system are a mention m in a context s, and type definitions T . The output is set of types {t} in the type definition. The figure also highlights the input resources , as well as offline and online processes .</p><p>The type definitions of a dataset reflect the un- derstanding of a domain expert and the assump- tions made in dataset design. Such definitions are often much cheaper to define, than to anno- tate full-fledged supervised datasets. It is impor- tant to emphasize that, to use our system on differ- ent datasets, one does not need to retrain it; there is one single system used across different datasets, working with different type definitions.</p><p>For notational simplicity, we define a few con- ventions for the rest of the paper. The notation t ∈ T , simply means t is a member of the image of the map T (i.e., t is a member of the target types). For a fixed concept c, the notation T (c) is the ap- plication of T (.) on the FREEBASE types attached to the concept c. For a collection of concepts C, T (C) is defined as c∈C T (c). We use T coarse (.) to refer to the subset of coarse types of T (.), while T fine (.) defines the fine type subset.</p><p>Components in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> are described in the fol- lowing sections. Extraction of topically relevant concepts. Word-concept map is pre-computed using WIK- ILINKS and used to retrieve the most relevant concepts for a given mention (see §3.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Initial Concept Candidate Generation</head><p>Given a mention, the goal of this step is to quickly generate a set of Wikipedia entries based on other words in the sentence. Since there are millions of entries in Wikipedia, it is extremely ineffi- cient to go through all entries for each mention. We adopt ideas from explicit semantic analysis (ESA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007)</ref>, an approach to representing words with a vector of Wikipedia concepts, and to providing fast retrieval of the relevant Wikipedia concepts via inverted in- dexing.</p><p>In our construction we use the WIK- ILINKS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Singh et al., 2012</ref>) corpus, which contains a total of 40 million mentions over 3 million concepts. Each mention in WIKILINKS is associated with a Wikipedia concept. To char- acterize it formally, in the WIKILINKS corpus, for each concept c, there are example sentences sent(c) = {s i }.</p><p>Offline computation: The first step is to con- struct an ESA representation for each word in the WIKILINKS corpus. We create a mapping from each word in the corpus to the relevant concepts associated with it. The result is a map S from to- kens to concepts: S : w → {c, score(c|w)} (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>), where score(c|w) denotes the associa- tion of the word w with concept c, calculated as the sum of the TF-IDF values of the word w in the sentences describing c:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">score(c|w) s∈sent(c) w∈s tf-idf(w, s).</formula><p>That is, we treat each sentence as a document and compute TF-IDF scores for the words in it.</p><p>Online computation: For a given mention m and its sentence context s, we use our offline word- concept map S to find the concepts associated with each word, and aggregate them to create a single list of weighted concepts; i.e., w∈s S(w). The resulting concepts are sorted by the corresponding weights, and the top ESA candidates form a set C ESA which is passed to the next step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Context-Consistent Re-Ranking</head><p>After quick retrieval of the initial concept candi- dates, we re-rank concepts in C ESA based on con- text consistency between the input mention and concept mentions in WIKILINKS.</p><p>For this step, assume we have a representation that encodes the sentential information anchored on the mention. We denote this mention-aware context representation as SentRep(s|m). We de- fine a measure of consistency between a concept c and a mention m in a sentence s:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Consistency(c, s, m) = cosine(SentRep(s|m), ConceptRep(c)),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ConceptRep(c) is representation of a con- cept:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ConceptRep(c) avg s SentRep(s|c) s ∈ WIKILINKS, c ∈ s) ,</formula><p>which is the average vector of the representation of all the sentences in WIKILINKS that describe the given concept. We use pre-trained ELMO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peters et al., 2018)</ref>, a state-of-the-art contextual and mention- aware word representation. In order to gener- ate SentRep(s|m), we run ELMO on sentence s, where the tokens of the mention m are concate- nated with " ", and retrieve its ELMO vector as <ref type="bibr">SentRep(s|m)</ref>.</p><p>According to the consistency measure, we se- lect the top ELMO concepts for each mention. We call this set of concepts C ELMO .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Surface-Based Concept Generation</head><p>While context often is a key signal for typing, one should not ignore the information included in the surface form of the mentions. If the corresponding concept or entity exists in Wikipedia, many men- tions can be accurately grounded with only trivial prior probability Pr(concept|surface). The prior distribution is pre-computed by calculating the fre-quency of the times a certain surface string refers to different concepts within Wikipedia.</p><p>In the test time, for a given mention, we use the pre-computed probability distribution to obtain the most likely concept, c surf = arg max c Pr(c|m), for the given mention m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Type Inference</head><p>Our inference algorithm starts with selection of concepts, followed by inference of coarse and fine types. Our approach is outlined in Algorithm 1 and explained below.</p><p>Concept inference. To integrate surface-based and context-based concepts, we follow a simple rule: if the prior probability of the surface-based concept (c surf ) has confidence below a threshold λ, we ignore it; otherwise we include it among the concepts selected from context (C ELMO ), and only choose coarse and fine types from c surf .</p><p>To map the selected concepts to the target entity types, we retrieve the FREEBASE-types of each concept and then apply the type definition T (de- fined just before §3.1). In Algorithm 1, the set of target types of a concept c is denoted as T (c). This is followed by an aggregation step for selection of a coarse type t coarse ∈ T coarse (.), and ends with the selection of a set of fine types {t fine } ⊆ T fine (.).</p><p>Coarse type inference. Our type inference al- gorithm works in a relatively simple confidence analysis procedure. To this end, we define Count(t; C) to be the number of occurrences of type t in the collection of concepts C: Count(t; C) := |{c : c ∈ C and t ∈ T (c)}|.</p><p>In theory, for a sensible type t, the count of context-consistent concepts that have this type should be higher than that of the initial concept candidates. In other words, Count(t;C ELMO )// ELMO Count(t;C ESA )// ESA &gt; 1. We select the first concept (in the C ELMO rank- ing) which has some coarse type that matches this criterion. If there is no such concept, we use the coarse types of the highest scoring concept. To se- lect one of the coarse types of the selected concept, we let each concept of C ELMO vote based on its consistency score. We name this voting-based pro- cedure SelectCoarse(c), which selects one coarse type from a given concept: Consistency(˜ c, s, m),</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OntoNotes</head><p>• For fine typing, we focus on FIGER (Ling and Weld, 2012), BBN (Weischedel and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Brunstein, 2005)</ref>, and OntoNotes fine ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gillick et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>• In addition to the news NER, we use the BB3 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Del˙ eger et al., 2016)</ref>, with contain men- tions of bacteria or other notions, extracted from sentences of scientific papers.</p><p>ZOE's parameters. We use different type defi- nitions for each dataset. In order to design type definitions for each dataset, we follow in the foot- steps of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abhishek et al. (2017)</ref> and randomly sam- ple 10% of the test set. For the experiments, we exclude the sampled set. For completeness, we have included the type definitions of the major ex- periments in Appendix D. The parameters are set universally across dif- ferent experiments. For parameters that deter- mine the number of extracted concepts, we use ESA = 300 and ELMO = 20, which are based on the upper-bound analysis in Appendix A. For other parameters, we set λ = 0.5, η s = 0.8 and η c = 0.3, based on the FIGER dev set. We em- phasize that these parameters are universal across our evaluations.</p><p>Evaluation metrics. Given a collection of men- tions M , denote the set of gold types and predicted types of a mention m ∈ M as T g (m) and T p (m) respectively. We define the following metrics for our evaluations:</p><p>• Strict Accuracy (Acc.):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">|{m|Tg(m)=Tp(m)}| |M | . • Macro F1 (F 1 ma ): Macro Precision is defined as 1 |M | m∈M |Tp(m)∩Tg(m)| |Tp(m)|</formula><p>. With this, the defini- tions of Macro recall and F1 follow.</p><p>• Micro F1 (F 1 mi ): The precision is defined as m∈M |Tp(m)∩Tg(m)| m∈M |Tp(m)|</p><p>, and the Micro recall and F1 follow the same pattern. In the experiment in §4.3, to evaluate systems on unseen types we used modified versions of met- rics. Let G(t) be the number of mentions with gold type t, P (t) be the number of mentions pre- dicted to have type t, C(t) be the number of men- tions correctly predicted to have type t:</p><p>• The precision corresponding to F 1 type ma is defined as t C(t) P (t) G(t) t G(t ) ; recall follows the same pat- tern.</p><p>• The precision corresponding to F 1 type mi is defined as  <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yuan and Downey, 2018)</ref> 50.6 23.4 ZOE (ours) 71.7 71.1 <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Comparing systems where no labels (types) are seen a priori ( §4.3).</p><p>Baselines. To add to the best published results on each dataset, we create two simple and effec- tive baselines. The first baseline, ELMONN, se- lects the nearest neighbor types to a given men- tion, where mentions and types are represented by ELMO vectors. To create a representation for each type t, we average the representation of the WIK- ILINKS sentences that contain mentions of type t (as explained in §3.2). Our other baseline, WIK- IFIERTYPER, uses Wikifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tsai et al., 2016b</ref>) to map the mention to a Wikipedia concept, followed by mapping to FREEBASE types, and finally pro- jecting them to the target types, via type defini- tion function T (.). Additionally, to compare with published zero-shot systems, we compare our sys- tem to OTYPER, a recently published open-typing system. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowl- edge, the systems proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ma et al.;</ref> are not available online for em- pirical comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Fine-Grained Entity Typing</head><p>We evaluate our system for fine-grained named- entity typing. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the evaluation result for three datasets, FIGER, BBN, and OntoNotes fine . We report our system's perfor- mance, our zero-shot baselines, and two super- vised systems (AFET, plus the-state-of-the-art), for each dataset. There is no easy way to trans- fer the supervised systems across datasets, hence no out-of-domain numbers for such systems. For each dataset, we train OTYPER and evaluate on the test sets of all the three datasets. In order to run OTYPER on different datasets, we disabled orig- inal dataset-specific entity and type features. As a result, among the open typing systems, our sys- tem has significantly better results. In addition, our system has competitive scores compared to the supervised systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Coarse Entity Typing</head><p>In  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Results of the system classifying mentions to "bacteria" or something else ( §4.4). Numbers are F 1 in percentage.</p><p>that are shared among the datasets: PER, LOC, ORG. In coarse-entity typing, the best available systems are heavily supervised. In this evaluation, we use gold mention spans; i.e., we force the de- coding algorithm of the supervised systems to se- lect the best of the three classes for each gold men- tion. As expected, the supervised systems have strong in-domain performance. However, they suffer a significant drop when evaluated in a dif- ferent domain. Our system, while not trained on any supervised data, achieves better or comparable performance compared to other supervised base- lines in the out-of-domain evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Typing of Unseen Types within Domain</head><p>We compare the quality of open typing, in which the target type(s) have not been seen before. We compare our system to OTYPER, which relies on supervised data to create representations for each type; however, it is not restricted to the observed types. We follow a similar setting to <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yuan and Downey (2018)</ref> and split the FIGER test in folds (one fold per type) and do cross-validations. For each fold, mentions of only one type are used for evaluation, and the rest are used for training OTYPER. To be able to evaluate on unseen types (only for this experiment), we use modified met- rics F 1 type ma and F 1 type mi that measure per type qual- ity of the system ( §4). In this experiment, we focus on a within-domain setting, and show the results of transfer across genres in the next experiments. The results are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. We ob- serve a significant margin between ZOE and other systems, including OTYPER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Biology Entity Typing</head><p>We go beyond the scope of popular entity-typing tasks, and evaluate the quality of our system on a dataset that contains sentences from scientific pa- pers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Del˙ eger et al., 2016)</ref>, which makes it differ- ent from other entity-typing datasets. The men- tions refer to either "bacteria", or some miscella- neous class (two class typing). As indicated in Ta-  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Ablation study of different ways in which concepts are generated in our system ( §4.5). The first row shows perfor- mance of our system on each dataset, followed by the change in the performance upon dropping a component. While both signals are crucial, contextual information is playing more important role than the mention-surface signal.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">FIGER BBN OntoNotesfine Approach Acc.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Ablation Study</head><p>We carry out ablation studies that quantify the con- tribution of surface information ( §3.3) and context information ( §3.2). As <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows, both fac- tors are crucial and complementary for the sys- tem. However, the contextual information seems to have a bigger role overall. We complement our qualitative analysis with the quantitative share of each component. In 69.3%, 54.6%, and 69.7% of mentions, our system uses the context information (and ignores the sur- face), in FIGER, BBN, and OntoNotes fine datasets, respectively, underscoring the importance of con- textual information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Error Analysis</head><p>We provide insights into specific reasons for the mistakes made by the system. For our analysis, we use the erroneous decisions in the FIGER dev set. Two independent annotators label the cause(s) of the mistakes, resulting in 83% agreement be- tween the annotators. The disagreements are later reconciled by an adjudication step. 1. Incompatible concept, due to context informa- tion: Ambiguous contexts, or short ones, of- ten contribute to the inaccurate mapping to con- cepts. In our manual annotations, 23.3% of er- rors are caused, at least partly, by this issue. 2. Incompatible concept, due to surface informa- tion: Although the prior probability is high, the surface-based concept could be wrong. About 26% of the errors are partly due to the surface signal errors. 3. Incorrect type, due to type inference: Even when the system is able to find several type- compatible concepts, it can fail due to inference errors. This could happen if the types attached to the type-compatible concepts are not the ma- jority among other types attached to other con- cepts. This is the major reason behind 56.6% of errors. 4. Incorrect type, due to type definition: Some er- rors are caused by the inaccurate definition of the type mapping function T . About 23% of the mistakes are partly caused by this issue. Note that each mistake could be caused by mul- tiple factors; in other words, the above categories are not mutually disjoint events. A slightly more detailed analysis is included in Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Moving beyond a fully supervised paradigm and scaling entity-typing systems to support bigger type sets is a crucial challenge for NLP. In this work, we have presented ZOE, a zero-shot open entity typing framework. The significance of this work is threefold. First, the proposed system does not require task-specific labeled data. Our sys- tem relies on type definitions, which are much cheaper to obtain than annotating thousands of ex- amples. Second, our system outperforms exist- ing state-of-the-art zero-shot systems by a signifi- cant margin. Third, we show that without reliance on task-specific supervision, one can achieve rela- tively robust transfer across datasets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: Extraction of topically relevant concepts.
