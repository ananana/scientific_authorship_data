			<abstract>
				<p>We present a sequential model for temporal relation classification between intra-sentence events. The key observation is that the overall syntactic structure and compositional meanings of the multi-word context between events are important for distinguishing among fine-grained temporal relations. Specifically, our approach first extracts a sequence of context words that indicates the temporal relation between two events, which well align with the dependency path between two event mentions. The context word sequence, together with a parts-of-speech tag sequence and a dependency relation sequence that are generated corresponding to the word sequence, are then provided as input to bidirectional recurrent neural network (LSTM) models. The neural nets learn compositional syntactic and semantic representations of contexts surrounding the two events and predict the temporal relation between them. Evaluation of the proposed approach on TimeBank corpus shows that sequential modeling is capable of accurately recognizing temporal relations between events, which outperforms a neural net model using various discrete features as input that imitates previous feature based models.</p>

It has di- rect application in tasks such as question answer- ing, event timeline generation and document sum- marization.</p><p>Bush said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from Iraq's invasion of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Relations: (dispute af ter rel 1 invasion, invasion ibef ore rel 2 buildup, dispute af ter rel 3 buildup) <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Example sentence to illustrate the tem- poral context for event pairs. Previous works studied this task as the classifi- cation problem based on discrete features defined over lexico-syntactic, semantic and discourse fea- tures. However, these features are often derived from local contexts of two events and are only ca- pable of capturing direct evidences indicating the temporal relation. Specifically, when two events are distantly located or are separated by other events in between, feature based approaches often fail to utilize compositional evidences, which are hard to encode using discrete features.</p><p>Consider the example sentence in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref>.</p><p>Here, the first two temporal re-lations, dispute after rel 1 invasion and invation ibefore rel 2 buildup, involve events that are close by and discrete features, such as dependency relations and bag-of-words extracted from local contexts of two events, might be sufficient to correctly detect their relations. However, for the temporal relation dispute after rel 3 buildup, the context between the two events is long, complex and involves another event (invasion) as well, which makes it challenging for any individual feature or feature combinations to capture the temporal relation. We propose that the overall syntactic structure of in-between contexts including the linear order of words as well as the compositional semantics of multi-word contexts are critical for predicting the temporal relation between two events. Further- more, the most important syntactic and semantic structures are derived along dependency paths be- tween two event mentions <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . This aligns well with the observation that semantic composition relates to grammatical dependency relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Monroe and Wang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reddy et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our approach defines rules on dependency parse trees to extract temporal relation indicating con- texts. First, we extract the dependency path be- tween two event mentions. Then we apply two heuristic rules to enrich extracted dependency paths and deal with complex syntactic structures such as punctuations. Empirically, we found that parts-of-speech tags (POS) and dependency se- quences generated following the dependency path provide evidences to predict the temporal relation as well.</p><p>We use neural net sequence models to cap- ture structural and semantic compositionality in describing temporal relations between events. Specifically, we generate three sequences for each dependency path, the word sequence, the POS tag sequence and the dependency relation sequence. Using the three types of sequences as input, we train bi-directional LSTM models that consume each of the three sequences and model compo- sitional structural information, both syntactically and semantically.</p><p>The evaluation shows that each type of se- quences is useful to temporal relation classifica- tion between events. Our complete neural net model taking all the three types of sequences per-forms the best, which clearly outperforms feature based models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Works</head><p>Most of the previous works on temporal relation classification are based on feature-based classi- fiers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mani et al. (2006)</ref> built MaxEnt classifier on hand-tagged features in the corpus, including tense, aspect, modality, polarity and event class for classifying temporal relations. Later <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chambers et al. (2007)</ref> used a two-stage classifier which first learned imperfect event attributes and then com- bined them with other linguistic features in the second stage to perform the classification.</p><p>The following works mostly expanded the fea- ture sets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bethard and Martin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">UzZaman et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bethard, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kolomiyets et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chambers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Laokulrat et al., 2013)</ref>. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chambers (2013)</ref> used direct dependency path between event pairs to capture syntactic context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Laokulrat et al. (2013)</ref> used 3-grams of paths between two event mentions in a dependency tree as features instead of full paths as those are too sparse. We found that modeling the entire path as one sequence provides greater compositional evidence on the temporal re- lation. In addition, modifiers attached to the words in a path with specific dependency relations like nmod:tmod are also informative.</p><p>Ng (2013) proposed a hybrid system for tempo- ral relation classification that combines the learned classifier with 437 hand-coded rules. Their sys- tem first applied high-accuracy rules and then used the learned classifier, trained on rich features in- cluding those high-accuracy rules as features, to classify the cases that were not handled by the rules.  also showed the ef- fectiveness of different discourse analysis frame- works for this task. Later <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mirza and Tonelli (2014)</ref> showed that a simpler approach based on lexico-syntactic features achieved results compa- rable to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ng (2013)</ref>. They also reported that de- pendency order between events, either governor- dependent or dependent-governor, was not useful in their experiments. However, we show that de- pendency relations, when modeled as a sequence, contribute significantly to this task.</p></div>

(2007)</ref> and the first two versions of <ref type="bibr">TempEval (Verhagen et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, 2010</ref> simplified the task by consid- ering only six relation types. They combined the pair of relation types that are the inverse of each other and ignored the relations during and dur- ing inv. Then TempEval-3 (Uzzaman et al., 2013) extended the task to complete 14 class classifica- tion problem and all later works have considered all 14 relations. Our model performs 14-class clas- sification following the recent works, as this is ar- guably more challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ng, 2013)</ref>. Also, we consider gold annotated event pairs, mainly be- cause the corpus is small and distribution of re- lations is very skewed. All previous works focus- ing on the problem of classifying temporal relation types assumed gold annotation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relations</head><p>Train  We have used TimeBank corpus v1.2 for train- ing and evaluating our model. The corpus con- sists of 14 temporal relations between 2308 event pairs, which are within the same sentence. These relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Saurı et al., 2006</ref>) are simultaneous, before, after, ibefore, iafter, begins, begun by, ends, ended by, includes, is included, during, dur- ing inv, identity. Six pairs among them are inverse of each other and other two types are commuta- tive (e 1 Re 2 ≡ e 2 Re 1 , R ∈ {identical, simultane- ous}). Our sequential model requires that relation should always be between e 1 and e 2 , where e 1 oc- curs before e 2 in the sentence. Therefore, before extracting the sequence, we inverted the relation types in cases where relation type was annotated in opposite order. Final distribution of dataset is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Extracting Context Word Sequence</head><p>First, we extract words that are in the dependency path between two event mentions. However, event pairs can be very far in a sentence and are in- volved in complex syntactic structures. Therefore, we also apply two heuristic rules to deal with com- plex syntactic structures, e.g., two event mentions are in separate clauses and have a punctuation sign in their context. We describe our specific rules be- low. We used the Stanford parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen and Manning, 2014</ref>) for generating dependency relations and parts-of-speech tags and all notations follow enhanced universal dependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(De Marneffe and Manning, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Rule 1 (punctuation): Comma directly influ- ences the meaning in text and omitting it may alter the meaning of phrase. Therefore, include comma if it precedes or follows e 1 , e 2 or their modifiers.</p><p>Rule 2 (children): Modifiers like now, then, will, yesterday, subsequent, when, was, etc. contains information on the temporal order of events and help in grounding events to the timeline. These modifiers are often related to event mentions with a specific class of dependency relations. Include all such children of e 1 , e 2 and other words in the path between them, which are connected with de- pendency relations nmod:tmod, mark, case, aux, conj, expl, cc, cop, amod, advmod, punct, ref.</p></div>

We also compare model performance using per-class F-score and macro F- score. We briefly describe all the systems we have used for evaluation.</p><p>Majority Class: assigns "after" relation to all event pairs.</p><p>Unidirectional LSTMs: use single LSTM layer to encode each sequence (POS tags, dependency relation and word forms) individually for extracted phrase in forward order.</p><p>Bidirectional LSTMs: use two LSTM layers to encode each sequence individually, taken from POS tags, dependency and word forms sequences.

The features used are: POS tag, dependency relation, token and lemma of e 1 (e 2 ); dependency relations between e 1 (e 2 ) and their children; binary features indicat- ing if e 1 and e 2 are related with the 'happens- before' or the 'similar' relation according to <ref type="bibr">VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004)</ref>, if e 1 and e 2 have the same POS tag, or if e 1 (e 2 ) is the root and e 1 modifies (or governs) e 2 ; the dependency relation between e 1 and e 2 if they are directly con- nected in the dependency parse tree; prepositions that modify (or govern) e 1 (e 2 ); signal words <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2012</ref>) and entity distance between e 1 and e 2 . These features are concate- nated and fed into an output neural layer with 14 neurons.</p><p>Baseline II: a neural network classifier using POS tags and word forms of words in the surface path as input. The surface path consists of words that lie in between two event mentions based on the original sentence. The classifier uses four LSTM layers to encode both POS tag and word sequences in forward and backward order. The output neural layer and parameters for all LSTM layers are kept the same as the Full model.</p><p>Baseline III: a neural network classifier based on event embeddings for both event mentions that were learned using bidirectional LSTMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016)</ref>. The learning uses two LSTM layers, each with 150 neurons and dropout of 0.2, to embed the forward and back- ward representations for each event mention. The input to LSTM layers are sequences of concate- nated word embeddings and POS tags; each se- quence corresponding to 19 context words to the left or to the right side of an event mention for the forward or the backward LSTM layer respectively. Event embeddings are then concatenated and fed into an output neural layer with 14 neurons.</p><p>All baselines are trained using rmsprop opti- mizer on an objective function defined by cate- gorical cross entropy and their output layer uses softmax activation function.    <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Per-class results of our best system and the baseline I. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> reports accuracy scores for all the sys- tems. We see that simple sequential models out- perform the strong feature based system, Base- line I, which used various discrete features. Note that dependency relation and POS tag sequences alone achieve reasonably high accuracies. This implies that an important aspect of temporal rela- tion is contained in the syntactic context of event mentions. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mirza and Tonelli (2014)</ref> observed that discrete features based on depen- dency parse tree did not contribute to improving their classifier's accuracy. On the contrary, using the sequence of dependency relations yields a high accuracy in our setting which signifies the advan- tages of using sequential representations for this task. Our Full Model achieves a performance gain of 11.35% over Baseline I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Results and Discussion</head><p>We developed two more baselines (Baseline II and III) that do not require syntactic information as well as the Direct dependency path model that used no rules. The Full Model outperformed them by 9.42%, 8.57% and 4.07% respectively. This af- firms that the most useful syntactic and semantic structures are derived along dependency paths and additional context words, including prepositions, signal words and punctuations that are indirectly attached to event words, entail evidence on tem- poral relations as well. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> compares precision, recall and F 1 scores of our Full Model with Baseline I. Our model performs reasonably well compared to the baseline system for most of the classes. In ad- dition, it is able to identify relations present in small proportion like begun by, ibefore, iafter etc., which the baseline system couldn't iden- tify. A similar observation was also reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mirza and Tonelli (2014)</ref> that relation types be- gins, ibefore, ends and during are difficult to iden- tify using feature based systems, which often gen- erate false positives for before and after relations.</p></div>
