				<p>Having an entity annotated corpus of the clinical domain is one of the basic requirements for detection of clinical entities using machine learning (ML) approaches. Past researches have shown the superiority of statistical/ML approaches over the rule based approaches. But in order to take full advantage of the ML approaches, an accurately annotated corpus becomes an essential requirement. Though there are a few annotated corpora available either on a small data set, or covering a narrower domain (like cancer patients records, lab reports), annotation of a large data set representing the entire clinical domain has not been created yet. In this paper, we have described in detail the annotation guidelines, annotation process and our approaches in creating a CER (clinical entity recognition) corpus of 5,160 clinical documents from forty different clinical specialities. The clinical entities range across various types such as diseases, procedures , medications, medical devices and so on. We have classified them into eleven categories for annotation. Our annotation also reflects the relations among the group of entities that constitute larger concepts altogether.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Corpus annotation is a process of adding inter- pretive linguistic information to a corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Leech, 2004</ref>). In the era of increasing trend of ma- chine learning in NLP, annotated data drives the progress of NLP systems in many ways. Fields of NLP like Machine Translation, Information Ex- traction/Retrieval, Relationship Detection among the entities, depends heavily on an annotated cor- pus. In the past, many traditional NLP engines have used rule based dictionary lookup methods, with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lindberg et al., 1993</ref>) as a base dictionary, to de- tect clinical entities. However, these approaches fetch very low recall, due to the fact that the dic- tionary lookup can never capture all the lexical and linguistic variants of a medical term, and also due to the fact that the clinical documents depend upon a physician's writing style ( .</p><p>Over the last few decades, Electronic Medi- cal Records (EMR) have been an integral part of health care. Most of the data consists of a patient's symptoms, procedures being conducted and the medications prescribed to them. This data is mostly available in free text form or semi- structured form and may contain different level of difficulties in parsing this natural text and getting meaningful information. The extensive linguis- tic study is not available for a clinical domain to the extent it is for the general domain. Therefore, ML approaches are preferred over rule based ap- proaches in the clinical domain. So a resource of the annotated corpus became a necessity to take full advantage of ML approaches. In the recent past, a few attempts have been made to anno- tate clinical texts. One of the first such attempt was made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Wang, 2009</ref>) on 311 clinical notes from an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) department of the single hospital -Royal Prince Alfred Hospi- tal (RPAH). However, no specific guidelines on how that data were annotated are available. Shared tasks like i2b2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Uzuner et al., 2011</ref>) (more than 800 documents), ShARe/CLEF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Suominen et al., 2013</ref>) (around 300 documents) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">and SemEval 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pradhan et al., 2014</ref>), 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Elhadad et al., 2015</ref>) (around 300 documents) have contributed a lot in increasing the availability of annotated clinical corpora. However, these cor- pora are focused only on certain type of entities. For example, i2b2 2010 data set has the annota- tion of three entity types, including test, treatment and disease.</p><p>There are other contributions to annotating clin-ical corpora, but depending on the purpose of the clinical research, most of the corpora generated in this domain are very specific to a disease or a dis- ease category or some specialities of hospitals. For example, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fiszman et al., 2000</ref>) annotated chest x-ray reports for automatic identification of acute bacterial pneumonia; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(South et al., 2009</ref>) manu- ally annotated clinical records to identify pheno- typic information for inflammatory bowel disease; ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Koeling et al., 2011</ref>) have annotated oncology re- ports on ovarian cancer for symptoms; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Xia and Yetisgen-Yildiz, 2012</ref>) have manually annotated the corpus for three different categories -Pneu- monia (PNA), Critical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) and critical recommendation on Radiology and ICU Reports; Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Roberts et al., 2009</ref>) have anno- tated various types of clinical records from a sin- gle hospital, Royal Marsden Hospital, Oncology Center. This corpus is restricted to diagnosis, and only considers documents from the patients with neoplasms, that is only a primary diagnosis code in one of the top level sub-categories of ICD-10 Chapter II (neoplasms). As none of the above cor- pora cover the clinical domain in entirety, we have started building our own CER corpus. In this paper, we demonstrate our approach of creating the corpus, deciding on annotation guide- lines, annotation processes, annotation error anal- ysis and improving the annotation quality with a corpus of 5,160 de-identified clinical documents for 11 different entity types varying from 40 dif- ferent domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Corpus Creation</head><p>The success of many healthcare IT applications like computer assisted coding (CAC), clinical doc- ument improvement (CDI), core/quality measure monitoring are directly proportional to the accu- racy of entity recognition and relations among the group of entities. Our aim of creating this corpus was to encapsulate as many entity types as possi- ble, keeping in mind many of such future appli- cations. We have annotated 5,160 de-identified clinical documents for 11 different entity types varying from 40 different domains. All the doc- uments were de-identified using simple rule based approaches which follow safe harbour guidelines before any further use.</p><p>Clinical documents are very peculiar. Type of text in the document depends heavily on work types (like admit notes, discharge notes, opera- tive notes, progress notes, etc.), associated med- ical domains (cardiology, oncology, endocrinol- ogy etc.) and varies considerably from physician to physician. So it was very important for us to make sure that we include as many different do- mains, work types and physicians as we could. So the first step towards corpus creation was to clas- sify documents into different domains. We took around 700,000 documents, from 119 providers (hospitals and specialty clinics), unfortunately not all of these documents had the information regard- ing its domain and work type. We used a semi- automatic way to find domain related information and were able to classify 236,850 documents from all the documents into 40 different domains. We were also able to capture information regarding sub-specialities and physician expertise for these documents.  Based on this classification, our domain team prepared a list of important domain and worktype pairs from the whole corpus and on the basis of document distribution over these pairs, we filtered 5,160 documents to annotate which represent 40 different domains and more than 100 worktypes.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows a sample selection of gastroenterology domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Annotation Guidelines</head><p>The first step towards preparing the annotation guideline was to decide on what has to be anno- tated. The best resource available to make this de- cision for the clinical domain was UMLS seman- tic group. The UMLS classifies the bio-medical entities into 133 semantic groups defined as Term Unique Identifiers (TUIs). These semantic groups are very fine-grained. We grouped multiple of these TUIs into different bucket to come up with 11 different types of medical entities. For the pur- pose of clinical information extraction, it is not necessary to use this much of detail as they would not be of much use in the clinical NLP applica- tions, for example, clinical coding etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Clinical Entity Types</head><p>The clinical domain includes medical records like consultation reports, progress notes, his- tory and physical, discharge summary, operative notes. These medical records comprise informa- tion about patient's diseases, affected anatomical area, procedures performed to treat the condition, devices used during the procedures and list of medications. It mainly covers the important entity types such as Problem, Anatomical structure, Pro- cedure, Medical device and Medicine respectively. Apart from such information, the medical record also consists of the patient's normal functions, vi- tal signs, lab examination and status of the patient. To cover this information, we have added other en- tity types Body function, Body measurement, Lab- oratory data and Finding respectively. Most of the times, entity type like Body measurement is men- tioned with its values and to cover these values we have added an entity type named Measurement value which acts like a numerical modifier to add meaning to the entity type. Just a numerical entity has no meaning, so it is necessary that this entity type is always used in relation to an entity type named Body measurement. There are some words used in the clinical domain to add specificity to an entity. Such type of words are mostly adjectives and need a head word without which they have no contextual meaning and cannot be annotated alone. For example the word acute. The word acute alone has no specific meaning, but when it is relates to a head word entity like pain then it adds meaning to the word pain. To cover such in- formation and to maintain the entities as simple and unique as possible, we have added an entity type named Modifier as a separate enhancing en- tity type. So in all, the gist of the medical record is captured by annotating the documents in our clas- sified entity types.</p><p>Problem: The disease conditions which in- clude major problem, disease, symptoms and dis- orders.</p><p>e.g.: Complication of bleeding, infection, arte- rial puncture, DVT.</p><p>Finding: Concepts apart from major problem, including abnormal conditions and the minor al- teration in the regular condition.</p><p>e.g.: This is a 27-year-old female gravida 4 para 1, feeling weak and lethargic.</p><p>Procedure: Surgery or other procedures per- formed to cure or diagnose.</p><p>e.g.: This is an 82-year-old female with the his- tory of appendectomy, status post open reduc- tion internal fixation.</p><p>Anatomical Structure: Anatomical sites, cells and organs of the human body.</p><p>e.g.: The patient continued to have mild colitis throughout into the cecum.</p><p>Body Function: Activities carried out by the body to maintain the normal functioning.</p><p>e.g.: The patient's breathing was normal.</p><p>Lab Data: The type of analysis performed on blood, urine, other body substances or tissues to help diagnose or monitor the patient's condition.</p><p>e.g.: AFB test is negative, TSH is 1.1. Body Measurement: The normal measurement of the body obtained without performing a com- plex procedure or test.</p><p>e.g.: The weight is up a couple pounds at 157 pounds, pulse is 74.</p><p>Measurement Value: Numerical value with its unit, associated with body measurement.</p><p>e.g.: The patient's heart rate was 90 and the BP was 140/90.</p><p>Medical Device: Instruments used for the treat- ment, operation and various medical purposes.</p><p>e.g.: Arterial line catheter was placed over the guidewire without any resistance.</p><p>Medicine: A drug used for the treatment or pre- vention of a disease. e.g.: Completed antibiotic course of ceftriax- one.</p><p>Modifier: Any word that adds some specific meaning to an Entity.</p><p>e.g.: Chronic skin excoriation due to known neurodermatitis.</p><p>We have classified our entity types in such a way that the meaning of the medical record is cap- tured properly. Medical terminology is vast in na- ture, so other entity types except the 11 mentioned types are possible, like gene/variants, lipids, cells, cell lines, steroids, etc. and no doubt they are im- portant entity types, but we do not need to annotate them separately because some of these entities can be classified in the existing entity types and others do not occur frequently in our medical records.</p><p>For example, an entity type like Lipid, docu- mented only in laboratory data section is covered by our entity type Laboratory data.</p><p>e.g.: Cholesterol levels are high.</p><p>In this example, cholesterol is an organic lipid molecule present in the body and generally should be labelled under entity type Lipid. But in the medical records, it is mostly present in the form of a laboratory test. So there is no need to create a new entity type as it would be easily covered under our classified entity type named Laboratory data. We encounter such cases in our data and so entity type like Lipid is not used and if we use, it alters the meaning, which in this case, the system won't understand that it is a lab report and not an organic lipid molecule present in the body.</p><p>Another example is an entity type like Steroid, it is documented only in the medicine section which is covered by our entity type Medicine.</p><p>e.g.: The patient was prescribed corticosteroids. "Corticosteroid" is a type of steroid hormone present in the body. But in this case, "corticos- teroids" is a medicine which is prescribed and it is annotated under Medicine type. We encounter such cases in our data and entity type like Steroid is covered by our classified Medicine type.</p><p>So we have categorized these groups into broader categories of entity types like Problem, Procedure etc. These categories are as mentioned in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> with relevant TUIs from UMLS.</p><p>Primary annotation guidelines were prepared by a linguist and an experienced medical coder. Both linguists and medical coder finalized entity types and created its initial descriptive definition with some complex examples. After that, both lin- guists and coder annotated the same set of doc- uments separately and on the basis of conflicting <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Entity Type Related TUI   Problem  T046,T047,T048,T049,  T050,T191,T037,T019,T184   Finding   T033,T034,T041,T084,T032,  T201,T053,T054,T069,T068,  T070,T067  Procedure  T059,T060,T061,T065,T058  Medicine  T200,T120,T110,T195,</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Entity types with their mappings to TUIs annotations they sat together and solved the con- flicts, then they updated the annotation guidelines to cover these conflict patterns. During this pro- cess, we have covered all possible domains and their existing document types in order to cover all the prominent entity patterns. After a few itera- tions, a well-defined annotation guideline was pre- pared and we started the actual annotation work. Note that the documents annotated during this pro- cess were not included in the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Inter-Conceptual Relationships</head><p>Relationships may exist between two or more con- cepts. In such instances, we considered inter- conceptual relationships between limited and fre- quently used terminologies. Relationships are marked only when relations occur in the same sen- tence and less frequent relationships like Lab data and problem, Medicine and Problem are rarely mentioned in a single sentence and hence we do not annotate those relations. We have not covered some relations like medicine with its attributes because it unnecessarily increases the complex- ity of the annotation task and these relations are easy to extract using finite state automata or regex based tools like cTAKES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Savova et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Savova et al., , 2011</ref>). Currently, the relationships are marked for the anatomical structure, measurement value and modifier with their related entities. Anatom- ical structures get related with three categories like problem, finding and procedure; measurement value gets related to only body measurement and modifier gets related to all other concepts except measurement value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Relationships with Anatomical Structures</head><p>Anatomical structure can be related to problem, procedure and finding. A relationship adds speci- ficity to the concept. Anatomical structure and problem relationship This type of relationship helps to understand which part of the anatomical structure is affected by the particular problem. It simplifies the under- standing of the problem and its area of effect.</p><p>For e.g.: she had severe pain in the left ankle.</p><p>Here pain is the problem and ankle is the anatomical structure.</p><p>A relationship can be formed between these two concepts and it makes it easy to understand that pain is in the ankle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anatomical structure and finding relationship</head><p>This relation helps to understand to which anatomical structure is the finding related.</p><p>For e.g.: He noted he had felt some tingling and numbness in the left upper chest area.</p><p>Here tingling is the finding and chest is the anatomical structure. By linking these two con- cepts in a relationship we explain that tingling is occurring in the chest. Anatomical structure and procedure relation- ship</p><p>This relationship explains that the procedure is being done at the given anatomical structure. It is usually used to relate any operation, test, and other such procedures to the organ or body site at which it is being performed.</p><p>e.g.: The patient had a CT of the brain.</p><p>Here CT is a procedure named Computed To- mography and brain is the anatomical structure. Relating these two concepts simplifies the under- standing that CT of the brain was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Relationships of Measurement Values</head><p>Measurement values cannot stand alone as only some numerical values do not provide any useful information. So these values need to be related to the concept where they belong to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body measurement and Measurement Value relationship</head><p>Body measurement is the measurement of basic body parameters like temperature, height, weight, pulse rate, etc. These parameters often have values that can be linked to the measurement in order to provide a complete meaning.</p><p>e.g.: Pulse: 80. BP: 110/70. Respirations: 16.</p><p>Here, pulse, BP, and respiration are the body measurements and 80, 110/70, and 16 are the mea- surement values of these respectively. So, forming the relationship between pulse and 80 signifies that the pulse rate is 80 per min, and similarly for all such concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Relationships of Modifier</head><p>All the concepts except modifier itself and mea- surement values can be related to the modifier to add specific meaning to these concepts. Modifiers can never stand alone.</p><p>So after classifying the entity types to be anno- tated and the possible relationships between those entity types as mentioned above, a set of definite principles were documented. Annotators followed these principles while annotating the data. Some directive principles from the guideline are men- tioned below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Directive Principles</head><p>Consistency in the annotation is very important to get the good accuracy of systems using ML ap- proaches. Therefore, to achieve good consistency, following simple rules were prescribed for the an- notators:</p><p>• The entities should be annotated based on the above given entity types and also generate re- lationship as mentioned above.</p><p>• Modifiers and measurement values should not be annotated without any relationship with other entity types.</p><p>• Entities from section headers should not be annotated.</p><p>• Adjective should be annotated as a modi- fier only if it is not a part of an abbreviated term instead of the selected text. For ex- ample, in "Chronic Hypertension", 'Chronic' should be annotated as Modifier and 'Hyper- tension' should be annotated as Problem but in "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" the whole phrase must be marked as Prob- lem, as the phrase has a universally accepted abbreviation COPD. We refer to the UMLS dictionary for the abbreviated terms.</p><p>• Mark normal alternation in condition as a finding and abnormal alteration as a problem. i.e. "ST wave changes" is marked as a finding while "ST wave abnormality" as a problem.</p><p>• The entities should be annotated depending on the meaning and the context of the sen- tences because there might be some cases in which the type of an entity changes based on the sentence structure. For example: There was an evidence of "drainage" of pus and "drainage" was carried out. In this case, the word drainage appears twice, in the first half it means the pus is oozing out, so it is tagged as an entity type finding and in the second half it means a procedure named drainage was carried out and so tagged under entity type Procedure.</p><p>• There are instances where there are disjoint entities present in the sentence which have a relationship with other entities too. For ex- ample "The patient suffered from chest and abdominal pain." In this case, the word pain is a disjoint entity but it also has a relation- ship with the chest. So in such cases, we mark chest and abdominal as an anatomi- cal structure respectively and pain as a prob- lem and then generate a relationship between these entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Annotation Process</head><p>There are different ways to annotate a medical corpus, but we embarked on two pre-eminent ap- proaches. The first approach is semi-automated annotation, in this approach, we can choose any pre-existing tools like MetaMap (Aronson, 2001), for CER task and thereafter annotator uses initial annotated results of tool to add, update or delete annotations as required and give the final anno- tated result. This approach definitely saves some human efforts and takes less time to annotate, however it is difficult to find an efficient and ac- curate tool. In addition, there is another issue with semi-automated annotation approach, that is, the annotator's decision may alter after viewing the output of the tool for ambiguous entities. The Sec- ond approach is to annotate the document based on just annotation guidelines and based on anno- tator's medical knowledge without looking at pre- annotated labels. As quality of annotation is more important than quantity of annotation specifically in medical domain, so we decided to go ahead with second approach. Protégé ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Noy et al., 2001</ref>) is an open source annotation and ontology editing tool. This tool was developed by Stanford Center for Biomedi- cal Informatics Research. It allows us to add en- tity types with a description and assign color. Us- ing this tool we can generate relationships between different entity types. The tool supports plain text, CSV and TSV format and so it is easy to load a medical document. The annotated data can be exported to a structured XML file format which makes the data widely accepted, machine readable and easy to use for any system.</p><p>Four annotators with a background in micro- biology and biochemistry were involved in the annotation process. The medical document con- sists of major entities like the problem, proce- dure, anatomical structure and lab data which the annotators are well aware of because microbiol- ogy and biochemistry experts have a good knowl- edge about the anatomy and physiology as well as information about many ailments and procedures and laboratory tests. The queries were solved us- ing UMLS dictionary and internal discussion with experienced medical experts and AAPC certified coders. The annotators are initially given a brief introduction about the importance of annotation and its applications and the impact of the anno- tated data on the clinical NLP. After that, the lin- guist and medical coders walk them through the set of guidelines which should be followed while annotating the corpus and present a demo of the annotating tool so that they get a brief knowledge of the tool. Initially, some documents were anno- tated in front of them so they become familiar with the process of annotation and tool. For the first few sets of documents (one set contains 30 doc- uments), we divided the team of annotators into two pairs and made them annotate the same docu- ments together. After completion of these sets, we changed the pairs of annotators. After 3 such it- erations, each annotator had worked with all other annotators. This process was performed to make sure that all the annotators have the same level of understanding towards the task. The annotators are instructed to keep a note of problems faced while annotating data and discuss it with the med- ical coders regarding the medical annotation and with engineers regarding the technical difficulties and the functioning of the tool. While annotating ambiguous entity, UMLS metathesaurus was used as a reference. However, annotators found many inconsistencies in the UMLS. So in case of any disagreement among the annotators, the final de- cision about what to be annotated was taken by a mutual consensus arrived after a discussion with the whole team. Note that the documents anno- tated during this process were not included in the corpus. After that, all the annotators were given a distinct set of documents in which 20% of the documents were the same between two annotators. We chose these same documents considering the distribution of worktypes over the corpus. These documents were used to calculate the kappa score (inter-annotator agreement). After annotation, the kappa score is calculated. The errors are discussed and solved by the annotators and then the data be- comes useful. It took one year for the annotators to complete this task, in which the initial one month was spent on the training process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Inter-annotator Agreement Calculation</head><p>Annotation is a mentally taxing task, and so an- notators occasionally miss to annotate some of the medical entities, especially when a document con- tains a large number of them. The annotators are free to mark the entities according to their med- ical knowledge and as a result of that, some dis- agreement arises. An inter-annotator agreement is an important quality measure. The Cohen's kappa coefficient is used to estimate the agreement be- tween the annotators. The Cohen's kappa equation is calculated with the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K = p o − p e 1 − p e = 1 − 1 − p o 1 − p e (1)</formula><p>where, p o is the relative observed agreement among annotators, and p e is the hypothetical prob- ability of chance agreement, using the observed data to calculate the probabilities of each observer randomly saying each category. If the annotators are in complete agreement then = 1. If there is no agreement among the raters other than what would be expected by chance (as given by pe), K ≤ 0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Koeling et al., 2011</ref>). The initial kappa score was 68.01% calculated on the set of 30 documents. The aim was to achieve good kappa score up to 95% to minimize the conception gap between the annotators. The kappa score is obtained after each set of annotation and the annotators are made to sit together and review the whole document with their own annotation results. They internally discuss why some entities are annotated and missed or am- biguously annotated. After discussion, they come to a conclusion and make a note of the changes which helps to decrease the conception gap. Using these notes, they are clear about what to annotate and what not to. Using structured guidelines and proper classification of entity types and relations, we achieved a 96.89% kappa score for the entity and relationship annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Corpus Statistics</head><p>Using the mentioned process, we have created a large annotated corpus of the medical domain for clinical entity and relationships which covers 5,160 clinical documents with 398,568 sentences. Out of these sentences, 190,188 sentences con- tained one or more medical entities which were annotated as concepts in the corpus, hence con- cept density over sentences is 47.72%. These 398,568 sentences vary in length from 1 token to 150+ tokens as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The cor- pus has average 9.59 tokens per sentence with to- tal 3,825,465 tokens across the corpus. Out of these 3,825,465 tokens, 600,550 tokens annotated as concepts in the corpus, hence concept density over token is 15.70%. An EMR record consists of a gist of the patient's conditions, procedure and tests carried out, medications prescribed etc. But, along with that, there is a lot of insignifi- cant information present in the record like hospital name and address, patient's demographics which are not healthcare entities. Apart from all these, an EMR contains information documented using definite templates and so a lot of sentence are gen- erally not important and common in every medi- cal record and they reflect in annotated token den- sity. The frequency of annotation for each relation and entity type are detailed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> and 2 re- spectively. There are in total 443,328 annotated concepts in the corpus. These annotated concepts result in an average length of 1.35 tokens per con- cept. The highest frequency concepts are Problem, Procedure, Medication, Anatomical Structure and Modifier which account for 78.81% of the data. The remaining 21.19% concepts are distributed into 6 rare categories. For the relation annota- tion, the corpus contains total 119,968 relations, out of which modifier -anatomical structure cover 30,018 relations, modifier with other entity types except anatomical structure cover 49,677 rela- tions, anatomical structure with other entity types except modifier cover 35,401 relations and body measurement -measurement value cover 4,872 re- lations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Initial Experiment with CRF</head><p>Initially, we used Conditional Random Fields (CRF) which is a well-known and a proven ap- proach to detect continuous entities using CRF++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Kudo, 2010)</ref> toolkit. Feature selection is the key task for accurate CRF model. We used feature sets as mentioned below <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pathak et al., 2015)</ref> • Bag of words features, prefix, suffix • Dictionary features, binary (true/false) was used to check whether the word is present in the medical dictionary or not.</p><p>• Stop words and word embedding id from word2vec trained on 2 lakh clinical docu- ments</p><p>• Section header and document type informa- tion and sentence cluster id <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the initial accuracy, calculated using the Perl script provided by the CoNLL 2000 task <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000</ref>), on CRF using a BIO format with the combination of different features on 5-fold validation. We are able   to get 91.58% f-measure with 92.12% precision and 91.05% recall using all features. We obtained a good performance using CRF which shows the quality of the annotation over the definite corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In the domain of clinical NLP, there is a paucity of good and large annotated corpus. Research shows that some amount of data has been anno- tated according to different purposes and applica- tions. Available annotated corpora are not found covering the clinical domain in entirety. In this pa- per, we have described the creation of a corpus of the clinical domain annotated with clinical entities and their inter-conceptual relationships. We have manually annotated the clinical corpus comprising of 5,160 documents, 398,568 sentences according to the guidelines created in-house.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>For example,</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
