			<abstract>
				<p>Users suffering from mental health conditions often turn to online resources for support, including specialized online support communities or general communities such as Twitter and Reddit. In this work, we present a framework for supporting and studying users in both types of communities. We propose methods for identifying posts in support communities that may indicate a risk of self-harm, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong previously proposed methods for identifying such posts. Self-harm is closely related to depression, which makes identifying depressed users on general forums a crucial related task. We introduce a large-scale general forum dataset consisting of users with self-reported depression diagnoses matched with control users. We show how our method can be applied to effectively identify depressed users from their use of language alone. We demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines on this general forum dataset.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Mental health remains a major challenge in pub- lic health care. Depression is one of the most common mental disorders and 350 million peo- ple are estimated to suffer from depression world- wide <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(WHO, 2010)</ref>. In 2014 an estimated 7% of all U.S. adults had experienced at least one ma- jor depressive disorder <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>. Suicide and self- harm are major related concerns in public men- tal health. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(CDC, 2015)</ref>, and each suicide case has major consequences on the physical and emotional * The first two authors contributed equally to this <ref type="bibr">work.</ref> well-being of families and on societies in general. Therefore identifying individuals at risk of self- harm and providing support to prevent it remains an important problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ferrari et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Social media is often used by people with men- tal health problems to express their mental is- sues and seek support. This makes social media a significant resource for studying language re- lated to depression, suicide, and self-harm, as well as understanding the authors' reasons for mak- ing such posts, and identifying individuals at risk of harm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Coppersmith et al., 2014a</ref>). Depression and suicide are closely related given that depres- sion is the psychiatric diagnosis most commonly associated with suicide. Research has demon- strated that forums are powerful platforms for self- disclosure and social support seeking around men- tal health concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(De Choudhury and De, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Manikonda and De Choudhury, 2017)</ref>. Such sup- port forums are often staffed by moderators who are mental health experts, trained volunteers, or more experienced users whose role is to identify forum posts suggesting that a user is at risk of self- harm and to provide support.</p><p>Studies have shown that self expression and so- cial support are beneficial in improving the indi- vidual's state of the mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Turner et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Choudhury and Kiciman, 2017)</ref> and thus such communities and interventions are important in suicide prevention. However, there are often thou- sands of user posts published in such support fo- rums daily, making it difficult to manually iden- tify individuals at risk of self-harm. Addition- ally, users in acute distress need prompt attention, and any delay in responding to these users could have adverse consequences. Therefore, identify- ing individuals at risk of self-harm in such sup- port forums is an important challenge. Identifying signs of depression in general social media, on the other hand, is also a difficult task that has appli-cations for both better understanding the relation- ship between mental health and language use and for monitoring a specific user's state (e.g., in the context of monitoring a user's response to clini- cal care). In this work we propose and evaluate a framework for performing self-harm risk assess- ment and for identifying depression in online fo- rums.</p><p>We present a general neural network architec- ture for combining posts into a representation of a user's activity that is used to classify the user. To address the challenge of depression risk as- sessment over the general forums, we introduce a large-scale novel Reddit dataset that is sub- stantially larger than the existing data and has a much more realistic number of control users. The dataset contains over 9,000 users with self- reported depression diagnoses matched with over 107,000 control users. We apply our approach to (1) identify the users with depression on a gen- eral forum like Reddit, and to (2) estimate the risk of self-harm indicated by posts in a more spe- cific mental-health support forum. Our methods perform significantly better on both datasets than strong existing methods, demonstrating that our approach can be used both to identify depressed users and to estimate the risk of self-harm posed by individual posts.</p></div>

To investigate NLP methods for identifying depression and PTSD users on Twit- ter, a shared task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coppersmith et al., 2015b</ref>) at the 2nd Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology Workshop (CLPsych 2015) was intro- duced where the participants evaluated their meth- ods on a dataset of about 1800 Twitter users. Other work has used data from approximately 900 Red- dit.com users to support self-reported diagnosis detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Losada and Crestani, 2016)</ref>. Previ- ous work identifying depression and other men- tal health problems, including the methods par- ticipating in <ref type="bibr">CLPsych 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">(e.g. (Resnik et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc-Pietro et al., 2015)</ref>) heavily rely on utilizing features such as LIWC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pennebaker et al., 2015)</ref>, topic modeling, manual lexicons, or other domain-dependent application-specific fea- tures. Aside from the effort required to design ef- fective features, these approaches usually model the problem with respect to the selected features and ignore other indicators and signals that can improve prediction. In contrast, our model only relies on text and is not dependent on any ex- ternal or domain-specific features. Previous self- reported diagnosis detection datasets contained a limited number of both control users and diag- nosed users. In contrast to this, we construct a new dataset with over 9,000 depressed users matched with a realistic number of control users.</p><p>In addition to general studies addressing men- tal health, related work has also specifically stud- ied suicide and self-harm through social me- dia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jashinsky et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thompson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gunn and Lester, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">De Choudhury et al., 2016;</ref>. Re- cently, <ref type="bibr">CLPsych 2016 (Hollingshead and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ungar, 2016</ref>) investigated approaches for detecting the self-harm risk of mental health forum posts <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Milne et al., 2016)</ref>. Most related work in this area uses variations of linear classifiers with some sort of feature engineering; successful methods have em- ployed: a combination of sparse (bag-of-words) and dense (doc2vec) representation of the target forum posts ( , a stack of feature- rich Random Forest and linear Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Malmasi et al., 2016)</ref>, an RBF SVM classifier utilizing similar sets of features <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brew, 2016)</ref>, and various contextual and psycholinguis- tic features <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cohan et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cohan et al., , 2017</ref>). In con- trast to the above works, our model does not use any general or domain specific feature engineer- ing; it learns appropriate representations of docu- ments by considering only their textual content.</p><p>Our proposed models consist of a shared archi- tecture based on a CNN, a merge layer, model- specific loss functions, and an output layer (as we will describe in §4). While our model shares similarities with CNN-based models in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kalchbrenner et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xiao and Cho, 2016)</ref>, it focuses on learning representations of user's posts and combining the post represen- tations into an overall representation of the user's activity. In the case of self-harm risk assessment, we experiment with several loss functions to de-termine whether considering the ordinal nature of self-harm risk labels (i.e., green, amber, red, and crisis) can improve performance. Evaluation re- sults suggest that the model variant using this loss function is more robust than our other variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Depression dataset construction.</head><p>We created a new dataset to support the task of identifying forum users with self-reported depres- sion diagnoses. The Reddit Self-reported Depres- sion Diagnosis (RSDD) dataset was created by annotating users from a publicly-available Red- dit dataset <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Users to annotate were selected by identifying all users who made a post between January 2006 and October 2016 matching a high- precision diagnosis pattern. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Users with fewer than 100 posts made before their diagnosis post were discarded. Each of the remaining diagno- sis posts was then viewed by three layperson an- notators to decide whether the user was claim- ing to have been diagnosed with depression; the most common false positives included hypotheti- cals (e.g., "if I was diagnosed with depression"), negations (e.g., "it's not like I've been diagnosed with depression"), and quotes (e.g., "my brother announced 'I was just diagnosed with depres- sion' "). Only users with at least two positive an- notations were included in the final group of diag- nosed users.</p><p>A pool of potential control users was identified by selecting only those users who had (1) never posted in a subreddit related to mental health, and (2) never used a term related to depression or men- tal health. These restrictions minimize the like- lihood that users with depression are included in the control group. In order to prevent the diag- nosed users from being easily identified by the us- age of specific keywords that are never used by the control users, we removed all posts by diag- nosed users that met either one of the aforemen- tioned conditions (i.e., that was posted in a mental health subreddit or included a depression term).</p><p>For each diagnosed user and potential control user, we calculated the probability that the user would post in each subreddit (while ignoring di- agnosed users' posts made to mental health sub- reddits). Each diagnosed user was then greedily matched with the 12 control users who had the smallest Hellinger distance between the diagnosed user's and the control user's subreddit post prob- ability distributions, excluding control users with 10% more or fewer posts than the diagnosed user. This matching approach ensures that diagnosed users are matched with control users who are inter- ested in similar subreddits and have similar activ- ity levels, preventing biases based on the subred- dits users are involved in or based on how active the users are on Reddit. This yielded a dataset con- taining 9,210 diagnosed users and 107,274 control users. On average each user in the dataset has 969 posts (median 646). The mean post length is 148 tokens (median 74).</p><p>The Reddit Self-reported Depression Diagno- sis (RSDD) dataset differs from prior work cre- ating self-reported diagnoses datasets in several ways: it is an order of magnitude larger, posts were annotated to confirm that they contained claims of a diagnosis, and a realistic number of control users were matched with each diagnosed user. The lists of terms related to mental health, subreddits related to mental health, high-precision depres- sion diagnosis patterns, and further information are available <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . We note that this dataset has some (inevitable) caveats: (i) the method only captures a subpopulation of depressed people (i.e. those with self-reported diagnosis), (ii) Reddit users may not be a representative sample of the population as a whole, and (iii) there is no way to verify whether the users with self-reported diagnoses are truthful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Self-harm assessment.</head><p>For self-harm risk assessment we use data from mental health forum posts from ReachOut.com, which is a successful Australian support forum for young people. In addition to providing peer- support, ReachOut moderators and trained volun- teers monitor and participate in the forum discus- sions. The NAACL 2016 Computational Linguis- tics and Clinical Psychology Workshop (Holling- shead and Ungar, 2016) released a Triage dataset containing 65,024 forum posts from ReachOut, with annotations for 1,227 posts indicating the au- thor's risk of self-harm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Milne et al., 2016</ref>). The annotations consist of one of four labels: green (indicating no action is required from ReachOut's moderators), amber (non-urgent attention is re- quired), red (urgent attention is required), and cri- sis (a risk that requires immediate attention).  , each of a user's posts) is processed by a convolutional network and merged to create a vector representation of the user's activ- ity. This vector representation is passed through one or more dense layers followed by an output layer that performs classification. The type of in- put received, merge operation, and output layer vary with the specific model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Ethical concerns.</head><p>Social media data are often sensitive, and even more so when the data are related to mental health. Privacy concerns and the risk to the in- dividuals in the data should always be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hovy and Spruit, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">ˇ Suster et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benton et al., 2017a</ref>). We note that the risks asso- ciated with the data used in this work are min- imal. This assessment is supported by previous work on the ReachOut dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Milne et al., 2016</ref>), on Twitter data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coppersmith et al., 2015b</ref>), and on other Reddit data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Losada and Crestani, 2016)</ref>. The RSDD dataset contains only publicly avail- able Reddit posts. Annotators were shown only anonymized posts and agreed to make no attempts to deanonymize or contact them. The RSDD dataset will only be made available to researchers who agree to follow ethical guidelines, which in- clude requirements not to contact or attempt to deanonymize any of the users. Additionally, for the ReachOut forum data that was explicitly re- lated to mental health, the forum's rules require the users to stay anonymous; moderators actively redact any user identifying information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methodology</head><p>We describe a general neural network architecture for performing text classification over multiple in- put texts. We propose models based on this ar- chitecture for performing two tasks in the social media and mental health domains that we call self- harm risk classification and detecting depression. The task of self-harm risk classification is estimat- ing a user's current self-harm risk given the user's post on a mental health support forum and the pre- vious posts in the thread. The task of detecting depressions in users is identifying Reddit users with self-reported depression diagnoses given the users' post histories (excluding posts containing mental health keywords or posted in subreddits re- lated to mental health).</p><p>While both tasks are focused on predicting a user's mental health status, they differ in both the type of classification performed (i.e., estimating severity on a four point scale vs. boolean classi- fication) and in the amount of data available. Our general architecture is based on a two step pro- cess: (1) identifying relevant features in each in- put text, and (2) combining the features observed in the model's inputs to classify the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Shared Architecture</head><p>Our proposed models share a common architec- ture that takes one or more posts as input, pro- cesses the posts using a convolutional layer to identify features present in sliding windows of text, merges the features identified into a vector representation of the user's activity, and uses a se- ries of dense layers to perform classification on the merged vector representation. The type of merg- ing performed and the output layers are properties of the model variant, which we describe in detail in the following section. Convolutional networks have commonly been applied to the task of text classification, such as by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim (2014)</ref>. We use cat- egorical cross-entropy as a loss function with both methods, but also experiment with other loss func- tions when performing severity classification. First, the model takes one or more posts as input and processes each post with a convolutional net- work containing a convolutional layer and a pool- ing layer. This process is illustrated with a max pooling layer in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The convolutional layer applies filters to a sliding window of k terms (a) and outputs a feature value for each sliding win- dow region and each filter (b). The same filters are applied to each window; each filter can be viewed as a feature detector and the overall process can be conceptualized as looking for windows of terms that contain specific features. The features are not specified a priori through feature engineering, but instead are learned automatically when the model is trained. After identifying the features present in each region (i.e., sliding window), a max pooling layer considers non-overlapping regions of length n and keeps the highest feature value for each re- gion (c). This step eliminates the regions (i.e., slid- ing windows) that do not contain useful features, which reduces the size of the convolutional net- work's output. The same convolutional network is applied to each input post, meaning that the model learns to look for the same set of features in each.</p><p>After each input post has been processed by a convolutional network, the output of each convo- lutional network is merged to create a represen- tation of the user's activity across all input posts. This representation is processed by one or more dense layers (i.e., fully connected layers) with dropout ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Srivastava et al., 2014</ref>) before being pro- cessed by a final output layer to perform classifica- tion. The type of output layer is dependent on the model variant. Our shared model architecture is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The architecture's hyperpa- rameters (e.g., the sliding window size k, the num- ber of convolutional filters used, and type of pool- ing) also vary among models and are described in the supplemental material. Both the convolutional and dense layers use ReLU activations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Nair and Hinton, 2010</ref>) in all model variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Models</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Depression detection</head><p>Our model for depression detection takes a user's posts as input and processes each post with a con- volutional network. Each convolutional network performs average pooling to produce its output. That is, the model considers non-overlapping se- quences of n posts and keeps the average feature value across all sequences. These post representa- tions are then merged with a second convolutional layer to create a user representation; we found this approach led to more stable performance than us- ing a second average pooling or max pooling layer. The user representation created by the merge step is then passed to one or more dense layers before being passed to a dense output layer with a soft- max activation function to perform classification. The number of dense layers used is a hyperparam- eter described in §5. Categorical cross-entropy is used as the model's loss function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Self-harm risk assessment</head><p>Our model for self-harm risk classification takes two inputs: the target post being classified and the prior posts (if any) in the target post's thread. The prior posts provide context and are thus useful for estimating the risk of self-harm present in the tar- get post. The two inputs are both processed by a convolutional network as in user-level classifica- tion, but in this case the convolutional network's outputs correspond to a representation of the tar- get post and to a representation of the target post's context (i.e., the prior posts in the thread). Given that these two outputs represent different aspects, they are merged by concatenating them together. This merged representation is then passed to one or more dense layers and to an output layer; the type of output layer depends on the loss function used. There are four self-harm risk assessment model variants in total:</p><p>Categorical Cross Ent. uses an output layer with a softmax activation function, and categori- cal cross-entropy as its loss function. This mirrors the output layer and loss function used in the user level classification model. MSE uses an output layer with a linear activa- tion function, and mean squared error as its loss function. The model's output is thus a single value; to perform classification, this output value is rounded to the nearest integer in the interval [0, t − 1], where t is the number of target classes.</p><p>The final two loss functions perform metric learning rather than performing classification di- rectly. They learn representations of a user's ac- tivity and of the four self-harm risk severity la- bels; classification is performed by comparing the euclidean distance between a representation of a user's activity (produced by the final layer) and each of the four severity label representations.</p></div>

The loss function becomes L i,p,n = max(0, ||X i − C p || 2 − ||X i − C n || 2 + α|p − n|) where |p − n| causes the margin to scale with the distance between classes p and n.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental setup.</head><p>The hyperparameters used with our models are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The severity risk assessment models' hyperparameters were chosen using 10- fold cross validation on the 947 ReachOut training posts, with 15% of each fold used as validation <ref type="bibr">4</ref> http://ir.cs.georgetown.edu/data/reddit depression/ data. The depression identification model's hy- perparameters were chosen using the Reddit val- idation set. The depression identification model's second convolutional layer (i.e., the layer used to merge post representations) used filters of length 15, a stride of length 15, and the same number of filters as the first convolutional layer. All mod- els were trained using stochastic gradient descent with the Adam optimizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>). The hyperparameters that varied across models are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The convolution size, number of convolutional filters, pooling type, pooling length, and number of dense layers was similar across all post models. Class balancing was performed with Categorical Cross Ent. by weighting classes in- versely proportional to their frequencies, whereas sampling an equal number of instances for each class worked best with the other methods.</p><p>Addressing limited data. The post classifica- tion models' input consists of skip-thought vectors ( <ref type="bibr">Kiros et al., 2015)</ref>; each vector used is a 7200- dimensional representation of a sentence. Thus, the convolutional windows used for post classifi- cation are over sentences rather than over terms. This input representation was chosen to mitigate the effects of the ReachOut dataset's relatively small size. The skip-thought vectors were gen- erated from the the ReachOut forum dataset by sequentially splitting the posts in the training set into sentences, tokenizing them, and training skip- thoughts using <ref type="bibr">Kiros et al.'</ref>s implementation with the default parameters. Sentence boundary detec- tion was performed using the Punkt sentence tok- enizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kiss and Strunk, 2006</ref>) available in NLTK ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bird et al., 2009</ref>). These 2400-dimensional forum post skip-thought vectors were concatenated with the 4800-dimensional book corpus skip-thought vectors available from Kiros et al.. Experiments on the training set indicated that using only the ReachOut skip-thought vectors slightly decreased performance, while using only the book corpus skip-thought vectors substantially decreased per- formance. As input the post models received the last 20 sentences in each target post and the last 20 sentences in the thread prior to the target post; any prior sentences are ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Depression detection.</head><p>The data used for depression detection was de- scribed in §3. We compare our model against several baselines using MNB and SVM classi- fiers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang and Manning, 2012</ref>). Specifically, we consider two sets of features for the classi- fiers. The first set of features is the post con- tent itself represented as sparse bag of words fea- tures (BoW baselines). The second set of features (feature-rich baselines) comprises a large set of features including bag of words features encoded as sparse weighted vectors, external psycholin- guistic features captured by LIWC <ref type="bibr">5 (2015)</ref>, and emotion lexicon features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Staiano and Guerini, 2014)</ref>. Since our problem is identifying depres- sion among users, psycholinguistic signals and emotional attributes in the text are potentially im- portant features for the task. These features (as described in §2) have been also previously used by successful methods in the Twitter self-reported di- agnosis detection task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coppersmith et al., 2015b</ref>). Thus, we argue that these are strong baselines for our self-reported diagnosis detection task. We ap- ply count based and tf-idf based feature weighting for bag of words features. We perform standard preprocessing by removing stopwords and lower- casing the input text. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The data is split into training, validation, and testing datasets each containing approximately 3,000 diagnosed users and their matched control users. The validation set is used for tuning devel- opment and hyperparameter tuning of our models and the baselines. The reported results are on the test set. The depression detection models' input consisted of raw terms encoded as one-hot vectors. We used an input layer to learn 50-dimensional representation of the terms. For each target user, the CNN received up to 400 posts containing up to 100 terms; experiments on the validation data indicated that increasing the maximum number of</p></div>

The results of identifying depressed users for our model and baselines are shown in Ta- ble 2. Our proposed model outperforms the base- lines by a large margin in terms of recall and F1 on the diagnosed users (increases of 41% and 16%, respectively), but performs worse in terms of pre- cision. As described later in the analysis section, the CNN identifies language associated with neg- ative sentiment across a user's posts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Self-harm risk classification.</head><p>We train our methods to label the ReachOut posts and compare them against the top methods from CLPsych '16. We use the same experimental pro- tocol as was used in CLPsych '16; our methods were trained on the 947 training posts and evalu- ated on the remaining 280 testing posts. We used 15% of the 947 training posts as validation data.</p><p>We report results using the same metrics used in CLPsych, which were: the macro-averaged F1 for the amber, red, and crisis labels (non- green posts); the macro-averaged F1 of green posts vs. amber ∪ red ∪ crisis (flagged posts); and the macro-averaged F1 of green ∪ amber vs. red∪crisis (urgent posts). The non-green F1 was used as the official CLPsych metric with the in- tention of placing emphasis on classification per- formance for the non-green categories (i.e., those that required some response). The binary flagged meta-class was chosen to measure models' abili- ties to differentiate between posts that require at- tention and posts that do not, and the binary urgent meta-class was chosen to measure their abilities to differentiate between posts that require quick responses and posts that do not. In addition to macro-averaged F1, CLPsych also reported the ac- curacy for each category. We additionally report F1 macro-averaged over all classes. <ref type="table">Non-green  Flagged  Urgent  All  F1</ref> F1 Acc. F1 Acc. F1 Acc.

The results on the self-harm risk as- sessment task for our models and for the current best-performing methods (briefly explained in §2) are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. We also report a baseline result which is based on a SVM classifier with bigram features. When measured by non-green F1, the official metric of the CLPsych '16 Triage Task, our proposed models perform up to 19% bet- ter than the best existing methods. Similarly, our models perform up to 11% better when measured with an F1 macro-averaged across all categories (i.e., all column) and up to 5% better with mea- sured accuracy across all categories. Categorical Cross Ent. performs best in all of these cases, though the difference between the performance of Categorical Cross Ent. and Class Metric with an ordinal margin is not statistically significant.</p><p>We also evaluate the performance of our meth- ods on the training set using 10-fold cross valida- tion to better observe the performance differences between our model variants ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>). All mod- els' perform substantially better on the training set than on the test set. This is partially explained by the fact that the models were tuned on the training set, but the large difference in some cases (e.g., the increase in the highest non-green F1 from 0.50 to 0.87) suggest there may be qualitative differ- ences between the training and testing sets. The best-performing method on the test set, Categori- cal Cross Ent., performs the worst on the training set. Similarly, the worst-performing method on the test set, MSE, performs the best on the training set. Class Metric (Ordinal) performs well on both the testing and training sets, however, suggesting that it is more robust than the other methods. Fur- thermore, there is no statistically significant dif- ference between Class Metric (Ordinal) and the best-performing method on either dataset. <ref type="table">i went to  to scare you  my whole</ref> to have it sometimes i my son was i'm so sorry it wasn't <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Example phrases that strongly con- tributed to a user's depression classification on the RSDD dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Analysis</head><p>In this section we analyze the language that strongly contributed to the identification of de- pressed users on the Reddit dataset. Note that it is impossible to show entire Reddit posts without compromising users' anonymity; we found that even when a post is paraphrased, enough informa- tion remains that it can easily be identified using a Web search engine. For example, one Reddit post that strongly contributed to the author's clas- sification as a depressed user contained the men- tion of a specific type of abuse and several com- ments vaguely related to this type of abuse. We at- tempted to paraphrase this post, but found that any paraphrase containing general language related to both the type of abuse and to the user's comments was enough to identify the user. Thus, to protect the anonymity of the users in our dataset, we do not publish posts in any form.</p><p>Rather than publishing posts, we identify key phrases in posts from users who were correctly identified as being depressed. Phrases from eight self-reported depressed users are shown in Ta- ble 5; to prevent these phrases from being used to identify users, we retain only the top phrase from each user. These phrases were identified by using the model's convolutional filter weights to identify posts in the validation dataset that are strongly contributing to the model's classification decision, and then using the convolutional filter weights to identify the phrase within each post that most strongly contributed to the post's classifica- tion (i.e., had the highest feature values).</p><p>In keeping with the design of our dataset, terms related to depression or diagnoses are not present. Instead, the model identifies phrases that often could be associated with a negative sentiment or outlook. For example, "my whole" could be part of a negative comment referring to the poster's whole life. It should be noted that the model makes classification decisions based on the occur- rence of phrases across many posts by the same user. Though one can imagine how the phrases shown here could be used to convey negative sen- timent, the presence of a single such phrase is not sufficient to cause the model to classify a user as depressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this work we argued for the close connection between social media and mental health, and de- scribed a neural network architecture for perform- ing self-harm risk classification and depression de- tection on social media posts. We described the construction of the Reddit Self-reported Depres- sion Diagnosis (RSDD) dataset, containing over 9,000 users with self-reported depression diag- noses matched with over 107,000 similar control users; the dataset is available under a data us- age agreement. We applied our classification ap- proach to the task of identifying depressed users on this dataset and found that it substantially out- performed strong existing methods in terms of Re- call and F1. While these depression detection re- sults are encouraging, the absolute values of the metrics illustrate that this is a challenging task and worthy of further exploration. We also ap- plied our classification approach to the task of estimating the self-harm risk posed by posts on the ReachOut.com mental health support forum, and found that it substantially outperformed strong previously-proposed methods.</p><p>Our approach and results are significant from several perspectives: they provide a strong ap- proach to identifying posts indicating a risk of self-harm in social media; they demonstrate a means for large scale public mental health stud- ies surrounding the state of depression; and they demonstrate the possibility of sensitive applica- tions in the context of clinical care, where clini- cians could be notified if the activities of their pa- tients suggest they are at risk of self-harm. Fur- thermore, large-scale datasets such as the one presented in this paper can provide complemen- tary information to existing data on mental health which are generally relatively smaller collections.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The general neural network architecture shared among our user and post classification models.
