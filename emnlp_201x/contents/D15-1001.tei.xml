				<p>In this paper, we consider the task of learning control policies for text-based games. In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against baselines using bag-of-words and bag-of-bigrams for state representations. Our algorithm outperforms the baselines on both worlds demonstrating the importance of learning expressive representations. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper, we address the task of learning con- trol policies for text-based strategy games. These games, predecessors to modern graphical ones, still enjoy a large following worldwide. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> They of- ten involve complex worlds with rich interactions and elaborate textual descriptions of the underly- ing states (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Players read descriptions of the current world state and respond with natural language commands to take actions. Since the un- derlying state is not directly observable, the player has to understand the text in order to act, making it State 1: The old bridge You are standing very close to the bridge's eastern foundation. If you go east you will be back on solid ground ... The bridge sways in the wind.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Command: Go east</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>State 2: Ruined gatehouse</head><p>The old gatehouse is near collapse. Part of its northern wall has already fallen down ... East of the gatehouse leads out to a small open area surrounded by the remains of the castle. There is also a standing archway of- fering passage to a path along the old south- ern inner wall. Exits: Standing archway, castle corner, Bridge over the abyss <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Sample gameplay from a Fantasy World. The player with the quest of finding a secret tomb, is currently located on an old bridge. She then chooses an action to go east that brings her to a ruined gatehouse (State 2). challenging for existing AI programs to play these games <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(DePristo and Zubek, 2001</ref>).</p><p>In designing an autonomous game player, we have considerable latitude when selecting an ad- equate state representation to use. The simplest method is to use a bag-of-words representation derived from the text description. However, this scheme disregards the ordering of words and the finer nuances of meaning that evolve from com- posing words into sentences and paragraphs. For instance, in State 2 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the agent has to understand that going east will lead it to the cas- tle whereas moving south will take it to the stand- ing archway. An alternative approach is to convert text descriptions to pre-specified representations using annotated training data, commonly used in 1 language grounding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Matuszek et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kushman et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>In contrast, our goal is to learn useful represen- tations in conjunction with control policies. We adopt a reinforcement learning framework and for- mulate game sequences as Markov Decision Pro- cesses. An agent playing the game aims to maxi- mize rewards that it obtains from the game engine upon the occurrence of certain events. The agent learns a policy in the form of an action-value func- tion Q(s, a) which denotes the long-term merit of an action a in state s.</p><p>The action-value function is parametrized us- ing a deep recurrent neural network, trained us- ing the game feedback. The network contains two modules. The first one converts textual descrip- tions into vector representations that act as prox- ies for states. This component is implemented us- ing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>). The second module of the network scores the actions given the vector representation computed by the first.</p><p>We evaluate our model using two Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) games <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Curtis, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amir and Doyle, 2002</ref>). The first game is designed to pro- vide a controlled setup for the task, while the sec- ond is a publicly available one and contains hu- man generated text descriptions with significant language variability. We compare our algorithm against baselines of a random player and mod- els that use bag-of-words or bag-of-bigrams rep- resentations for a state. We demonstrate that our model LSTM-DQN significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of number of completed quests and accumulated rewards. For instance, on a fan- tasy MUD game, our model learns to complete 96% of the quests, while the bag-of-words model and a random baseline solve only 82% and 5% of the quests, respectively. Moreover, we show that the acquired representation can be reused across games, speeding up learning and leading to faster convergence of Q-values.</p></div>

Example applications include interpreting help documenta- tion for software <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Branavan et al., 2010)</ref>, navi- gating with directions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kollar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Matuszek et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andreas and Klein, 2015)</ref> and playing computer games ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Eisenstein et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Branavan et al., 2011a)</ref>.</p><p>Games provide a rich domain for grounded lan- guage analysis. Prior work has assumed perfect knowledge of the underlying state of the game to learn policies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gorniak and Roy (2005)</ref> developed a game character that can be controlled by spoken instructions adaptable to the game situation. The grounding of commands to actions is learned from a transcript manually annotated with actions and state attributes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Eisenstein et al. (2009)</ref> learn game rules by analyzing a collection of game-related documents and precompiled traces of the game. In contrast to the above work, our model combines text interpretation and strategy learning in a single framework. As a result, textual analysis is guided by the received control feedback, and the learned strategy directly builds on the text interpretation.</p><p>Our work closely relates to an automatic game player that utilizes text manuals to learn strategies for Civilization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Branavan et al., 2011a</ref>). Similar to our approach, text analysis and control strate- gies are learned jointly using feedback provided by the game simulation. In their setup, states are fully observable, and the model learns a strategy by combining state/action features and features extracted from text. However, in our application, the state representation is not provided, but has to be inferred from a textual description. Therefore, it is not sufficient to extract features from text to supplement a simulation-based player.</p><p>Another related line of work consists of auto- matic video game players that infer state repre- sentations directly from raw pixels <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Koutník et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mnih et al., 2015</ref>). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mnih et al. (2015)</ref> learn control strategies using convolu- tional neural networks, trained with a variant of Q-learning ( <ref type="bibr">Watkins and Dayan, 1992)</ref>. While both approaches use deep reinforcement learning for training, our work has important differences. In order to handle the sequential nature of text, we use Long Short-Term Memory networks to auto- matically learn useful representations for arbitrary text descriptions. Additionally, we show that de- composing the network into a representation layer and an action selector is useful for transferring the learnt representations to new game scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Background</head><p>Game Representation We represent a game by the tuple H, A, T, R, Ψ, where H is the set of all possible game states, A = {(a, o)} is the set of all commands (action-object pairs), T (h | h, a, o) is the stochastic transition function between states and R(h, a, o) is the reward function. The game state H is hidden from the player, who only re- ceives a varying textual description, produced by a stochastic function Ψ : H → S. Specifically, the underlying state h in the game engine keeps track of attributes such as the player's location, her health points, time of day, etc. The function Ψ (also part of the game framework) then converts this state into a textual description of the location the player is at or a message indicating low health. We do not assume access to either H or Ψ for our agent during both training and testing phases of our experiments. We denote the space of all possi- ble text descriptions s to be S. Rewards are gener- ated using R and are only given to the player upon completion of in-game quests.</p><p>Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning is a com- monly used framework for learning control poli- cies in game environments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Silver et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amato and Shani, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Branavan et al., 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Szita, 2012)</ref>. The game environment can be formulated as a sequence of state transitions (s, a, r, s ) of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The agent takes an action a in state s by consult- ing a state-action value function Q(s, a), which is a measure of the action's expected long-term re- ward. Q-Learning ( <ref type="bibr">Watkins and Dayan, 1992</ref>) is a model-free technique which is used to learn an optimal Q(s, a) for the agent. Starting from a ran- dom Q-function, the agent continuously updates its Q-values by playing the game and obtaining re- wards. The iterative updates are derived from the Bellman equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sutton and Barto, 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1) Q i+1 (s, a) = E[r + γ max a Q i (s , a ) | s, a]</formula><p>where γ is a discount factor for future rewards and the expectation is over all game transitions that in- volved the agent taking action a in state s.</p><p>Using these evolving Q-values, the agent chooses the action with the highest Q(s, a) to maximize its expected future rewards. In practice, the trade-off between exploration and exploitation can be achieved following an -greedy policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sutton and Barto, 1998)</ref>, where the agent performs a random action with probability .</p><p>Deep Q-Network In large games, it is often im- practical to maintain the Q-value for all possible state-action pairs. One solution to this problem is to approximate Q(s, a) using a parametrized function Q(s, a; θ), which can generalize over states and actions by considering higher-level at- tributes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sutton and Barto, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Branavan et al., 2011a</ref>). However, creating a good parametrization requires knowledge of the state and action spaces. One way to bypass this feature engineering is to use a Deep Q-Network (DQN) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mnih et al., 2015</ref>). The DQN approximates the Q-value function with a deep neural network to predict Q(s, a) for all possible actions a simultaneously given the cur- rent state s. The non-linear function layers of the DQN also enable it to learn better value functions than linear approximators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Learning Representations and Control Policies</head><p>In this section, we describe our model (DQN) and describe its use in learning good Q-value approxi- mations for games with stochastic textual descrip- tions. We divide our model into two parts. The first module is a representation generator that con- verts the textual description of the current state into a vector. This vector is then input into the second module which is an action scorer. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 2</ref> shows the overall architecture of our model. We learn the parameters of both the representation generator and the action scorer jointly, using the in-game reward feedback.</p><p>Representation Generator (φ R ) The represen- tation generator reads raw text displayed to the agent and converts it to a vector representation v s . A bag-of-words (BOW) representation is not suf- ficient to capture higher-order structures of sen- tences and paragraphs. The need for a better se- mantic representation of the text is evident from the average performance of this representation in playing MUD-games (as we show in Section 6).</p><p>In order to assimilate better representations, we utilize a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>) as a representation generator. LSTMs are recurrent neural networks with the ability to connect and recognize long-range patterns between words in text. They are more robust than BOW to small variations in word usage and are able to capture underlying semantics of sentences to some ex- tent. In recent work, LSTMs have been used suc- cessfully in NLP tasks such as machine transla- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>) and sentiment anal- ysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tai et al., 2015</ref>) to compose vector repre- sentations of sentences from word-level embed- dings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). In our setup, the LSTM network takes in word embeddings w k from the words in a descrip- tion s and produces output vectors x k at each step.</p><p>To get the final state representation v s , we add a mean pooling layer which computes the element- wise mean over the output vectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x k . 3 (2) v s = 1 n n k=1 x k Action Scorer (φ A )</formula><p>The action scorer module produces scores for the set of possible actions given the current state representation. We use a multi-layered neural network for this purpose (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). The input to this module is the vec- tor from the representation generator, v s = φ R (s) and the outputs are scores for actions a ∈ A. Scores for all actions are predicted simultaneously, which is computationally more efficient than scor- ing each state-action pair separately. Thus, by combining the representation generator and action scorer, we can obtain the approximation for the Q- function as Q(s, a) ≈ φ A (φ R (s)) <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref>. An additional complexity in playing MUD- games is that the actions taken by the player are multi-word natural language commands such as eat apple or go east. Due to computational con- straints, in this work we limit ourselves to con- sider commands to consist of one action (e.g. eat) and one argument object (e.g. apple). This as- sumption holds for the majority of the commands in our worlds, with the exception of one class of commands that require two arguments (e.g. move red-root right, move blue-root up). We consider all possible actions and objects available in the game and predict both for each state using the same net- work ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2)</ref>. We consider the Q-value of the entire command (a, o) to be the average of the Q- values of the action a and the object o. For the rest of this section, we only show equations for Q(s, a) but similar ones hold for Q(s, o).</p><p>Parameter Learning We learn the parameters θ R of the representation generator and θ A of the action scorer using stochastic gradient descent with RMSprop (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012). The complete training procedure is shown in Algo- rithm 1. In each iteration i, we update the pa- rameters to reduce the discrepancy between the predicted value of the current state Q(s t , a t ; θ i ) (where θ i = [θ R ; θ A ] i ) and the expected Q-value given the reward r t and the value of the next state max a Q(s t+1 , a; θ i−1 ).</p><p>We keep track of the agent's previous experi- ences in a memory D. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Instead of performing updates to the Q-value using transitions from the current episode, we sample a random transition (ˆ s, ˆ a, s , r) from D. Updating the parameters in this way avoids issues due to strong correlation when using transitions of the same episode ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mnih et al., 2015)</ref>. Using the sampled transition and (1), we obtain the following loss function to minimize:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(3) L i (θ i ) = E ˆ s,ˆ a [(y i − Q(ˆ s, ˆ a; θ i )) 2 ]</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y i = E ˆ s,ˆ a [r + γ max a Q(s , a ; θ i−1 ) | ˆ s, ˆ a]</formula><p>is the target Q-value with parameters θ i−1 fixed from the previous iteration.</p><p>The updates on the parameters θ can be per- formed using the following gradient of L i (θ i ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ i L i (θ i ) = E ˆ s,ˆ a [2(y i − Q(ˆ s, ˆ a; θ i )) θ i Q(ˆ s, ˆ a; θ i )]</formula><p>For each epoch of training, the agent plays several episodes of the game, which is restarted after ev- ery terminal state.</p></div>

This increases the number of experi- ences used per step and is also more efficient due to optimized matrix operations.</p><p>The simplest method to create these mini- batches from the experience memory D is to sam- ple uniformly at random. However, certain ex- periences are more valuable than others for the agent to learn from. For instance, rare transitions that provide positive rewards can be used more of- ten to learn optimal Q-values faster. In our ex- periments, we consider such positive-reward tran- sitions to have higher priority and keep track of them in D. We use prioritized sampling (inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moore and Atkeson (1993)</ref>) to sample a frac- tion ρ of transitions from the higher priority pool and a fraction 1 − ρ from the rest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Setup</head><p>Game Environment For our game environ- ment, we modify Evennia, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> an open-source library for building online textual MUD games. Evennia is a Python-based framework that allows one to easily create new games by writing a batch file describing the environment with details of rooms, <ref type="bibr">5</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides statistics of the game worlds. We observe that the Fantasy world is moderately sized with a vocabulary of 1340 words and up to 100 different descriptions for a room. These de- scriptions were created manually by the game de- velopers. These diverse, engaging descriptions are designed to make it interesting and exciting for hu- man players. Several rooms have many alternative descriptions, invoked randomly on each visit by the player.</p><p>Comparatively, the Home world is smaller: it has a very restricted vocabulary of 84 words and the room descriptions are relatively structured. However, both the room descriptions (which are also varied and randomly provided to the agent) and the quest descriptions were adversarially cre- ated with negation and conjunction of facts to force an agent to actually understand the state in order to play well. Therefore, this domain pro- vides an interesting challenge for language under- standing.</p><p>In both worlds, the agent receives a positive reward on completing a quest, and negative re- wards for getting into bad situations like falling off a bridge, or losing a battle. We also add small deterministic negative rewards for each non- terminating step. This incentivizes the agent to learn policies that solve quests in fewer steps. The supplementary material has details on the reward structure.</p><p>Home World We created Home world to mimic the environment of a typical house. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The world consists of four rooms -a living room, a bedroom, a kitchen and a garden with connecting pathways. Every room is reachable from every other room. Each room contains a representative object that the agent can interact with. For instance, the kitchen has an apple that the player can eat. Transitions between the rooms are deterministic. At the start of each game episode, the player is placed in a ran- dom room and provided with a randomly selected quest. The text provided to the player contains both the description of her current state and that of the quest. Thus, the player can begin in one of 16 different states (4 rooms × 4 quests), which adds to the world's complexity.</p><p>An example of a quest given to the player in text is Not you are sleepy now but you are hun- gry now. To complete this quest and obtain a re- ward, the player has to navigate through the house to reach the kitchen and eat the apple (i.e type in the command eat apple). More importantly, the player should interpret that the quest does not re- quire her to take a nap in the bedroom. We cre- ated such misguiding quests to make it hard for agents to succeed without having an adequate level of language understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fantasy World</head><p>The Fantasy world is consider- ably more complex and involves quests such as navigating through a broken bridge or finding the secret tomb of an ancient hero. This game also has stochastic transitions in addition to varying state descriptions provided to the player. For instance, there is a possibility of the player falling from the bridge if she lingers too long on it.</p><p>Due to the large command space in this game, 7 we make use of cues provided by the game itself to narrow down the set of possible objects to consider in each state. For instance, in the MUD example in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the game provides a list of possible exits. If the game does not provide such clues for the current state, we consider all objects in the game.</p><p>Evaluation We use two metrics for measuring an agent's performance: (1) the cumulative reward obtained per episode averaged over the episodes and (2) the fraction of quests completed by the agent. The evaluation procedure is as follows. In each epoch, we first train the agent on M episodes of T steps each. At the end of this training, we have a testing phase of running M episodes of the game for T steps. We use M = 50, T = 20 for the Home world and M = 20, T = 250 for the Fan- tasy world. For all evaluation episodes, we run the agent following an -greedy policy with = 0.05, which makes the agent choose the best action ac- cording to its Q-values 95% of the time. We report the agent's performance at each epoch.</p><p>Baselines We compare our LSTM-DQN model with three baselines. The first is a Random agent that chooses both actions and objects uniformly at random from all available choices. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The other two are BOW-DQN and BI-DQN, which use a bag- of-words and a bag-of-bigrams representation of the text, respectively, as input to the DQN action scorer. These baselines serve to illustrate the im- portance of having a good representation layer for the task.</p><p>Settings For our DQN models, we used D = 100000, γ = 0.5. We use a learning rate of 0.0005 for RMSprop. We anneal the for -greedy from 1 to 0.2 over 100000 transitions. A mini-batch gradient update is performed every 4 steps of the gameplay. We roll out the LSTM (over words) for a maximum of 30 steps on the Home world and for 100 steps on the Fantasy world. For the prioritized sampling, we used ρ = 0.25 for both worlds. We employed a mini-batch size of 64 and word em- bedding size d = 20 in all experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>Home World <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the perfor- mance of LSTM-DQN compared to the baselines. We can observe that the Random baseline per- forms quite poorly, completing only around 10% of quests on average 9 obtaining a low reward of around −1.58. The BOW-DQN model performs significantly better and is able to complete around 46% of the quests, with an average reward of 0.20.</p><p>The improvement in reward is due to both greater quest success rate and a lower rate of issuing in- valid commands (e.g. eat apple would be invalid in the bedroom since there is no apple). We no- tice that both the reward and quest completion graphs of this model are volatile. This is because the model fails to pick out differences between quests like Not you are hungry now but you are sleepy now and Not you are sleepy now but you <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">9</ref> Averaged over the last 10 epochs.</p><p>are hungry now. The BI-DQN model suffers from the same issue although it performs slightly bet- ter than BOW-DQN by completing 48% of quests. In contrast, the LSTM-DQN model does not suf- fer from this issue and is able to complete 100% of the quests after around 50 epochs of training, achieving close to the optimal reward possible. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> This demonstrates that having an expressive rep- resentation for text is crucial to understanding the game states and choosing intelligent actions. In addition, we also investigated the impact of using a deep neural network for modeling the ac- tion scorer φ A . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the perfor- mance of the BOW-DQN and BI-DQN models along with their simpler versions BOW-LIN and BI-LIN, which use a single linear layer for φ A . It can be seen that the DQN models clearly achieve better performance than their linear counterparts, which points to them modeling the control policy better.</p><p>Fantasy World We evaluate all the models on the Fantasy world in the same manner as before and report reward, quest completion rates and Q- 10 Note that since each step incurs a penalty of −0.01, the best reward (on average) a player can get is around 0.98. values. The quest we evaluate on involves crossing the broken bridge (which takes a minimum of five steps), with the possibility of falling off at random (a 5% chance) when the player is on the bridge. The game has an additional quest of reaching a secret tomb. However, this is a complex quest that requires the player to memorize game events and perform high-level planning which are beyond the scope of this current work. Therefore, we focus only on the first quest. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> (bottom), we can see that the Random baseline does poorly in terms of both av- erage per-episode reward <ref type="bibr">11</ref> and quest completion rates. BOW-DQN converges to a much higher av- erage reward of −12.68 and achieves around 82% quest completion. Again, the BOW-DQN is often confused by varying (10 different) descriptions of the portions of the bridge, which reflects in its er- ratic performance on the quest. The BI-DQN per- forms very well on quest completion by finishing 97% of quests. However, this model tends to find sub-optimal solutions and gets an average reward of −26.68, even worse than BOW-DQN. One rea- son for this is the negative rewards the agent ob- tains after falling off the bridge. The LSTM-DQN model again performs best, achieving an average reward of −11.33 and completing 96% of quests on average. Though this world does not con- tain descriptions adversarial to BOW-DQN or BI- DQN, the LSTM-DQN obtains higher average re- ward by completing the quest in fewer steps and showing more resilience to variations in the state descriptions.</p><p>Transfer Learning We would like the represen- tations learnt by φ R to be generic enough and <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Note that the rewards graph is in log scale. transferable to new game worlds. To test this, we created a second Home world with the same rooms, but a completely different map, changing the locations of the rooms and the pathways be- tween them. The main differentiating factor of this world from the original home world lies in the high-level planning required to complete quests.</p><p>We initialized the LSTM part of an LSTM- DQN agent with parameters θ R learnt from the original home world and trained it on the new world. 12 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> (top right) demonstrates that the agent with transferred parameters is able to learn quicker than an agent starting from scratch initialized with random parameters (No Transfer), reaching the optimal policy almost 20 epochs ear- lier. This indicates that these simulated worlds can be used to learn good representations for language that transfer across worlds.</p><p>Prioritized sampling We also investigate the ef- fects of different minibatch sampling procedures on the parameter learning. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> (bottom right), we observe that using prioritized sampling significantly speeds up learning, with the agent achieving the optimal policy around 50 epochs faster than using uniform sampling. This shows promise for further research into different schemes of assigning priority to transitions.</p><p>Representation Analysis We analyzed the rep- resentations learnt by the LSTM-DQN model on the Home world. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> shows a visualization</p></div>

All the vectors were initialized ran- domly before training. We can see that semanti- cally similar words appear close together to form coherent subspaces. In fact, we observe four dif- ferent subspaces, each for one type of room along with its corresponding object(s) and quest words. For instance, food items like pizza and rooms like kitchen are very close to the word hungry which appears in a quest description. This shows that the agent learns to form meaningful associations between the semantics of the quest and the envi- ronment. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows some examples of de- scriptions from Fantasy world and their nearest neighbors using cosine similarity between their corresponding vector representations produced by LSTM-DQN. The model is able to correlate de- scriptions of the same (or similar) underlying states and project them onto nearby points in the representation subspace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>We address the task of end-to-end learning of con- trol policies for text-based games. In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language variability makes such envi- ronments challenging for automatic game play- ers. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feed- back. This framework enables us to map text de- scriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of learning good rep- resentations of text in order to play these games well. Future directions include tackling high-level planning and strategy learning to improve the per- formance of intelligent agents.</p><p>Christopher JCH <ref type="bibr">Watkins and Peter Dayan. 1992.
