				<p>Open Relation Extraction (ORE) overcomes the limitations of traditional IE techniques, which train individual extrac-tors for every single relation type. Systems such as ReVerb, PATTY, OLLIE, and Exemplar have attracted much attention on English ORE. However, few studies have been reported on ORE for languages beyond English. This paper presents a syntax-based Chinese (Zh) ORE system, ZORE, for extracting relations and semantic patterns from Chinese text. ZORE identifies relation candidates from automatically parsed dependency trees, and then extracts relations with their semantic patterns iteratively through a novel double propagation algorithm. Empirical results on two data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed system.</p>

This approach cannot scale to the web, where target relations are not defined in advance. Open Relation Extraction (ORE) at- tempts to solve this problem by shallow-parsing- based, syntax-based or semantic-role-based pat- tern matching without pre-defined relation types, and has achieved great success on open-domain corpora ranging from news to Wikipedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banko et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wu and Weld, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nakashole et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moro and Navigli, 2013</ref>). Many NLP and IR applications, in- cluding selectional preference learning, common- sense knowledge and entailment rule mining, have benefited from ORE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ritter et al., 2010)</ref>. Howev- er, most existing ORE systems focus on English, and little research has been reported on other lan- guages. In addition, existing ORE techniques are mainly concerned with the extraction of textual re- lations, without trying to give semantic analysis, which is the advantage of traditional IE.</p><p>Our goal in this paper is to present a syntax- based Chinese (Zh) ORE system, ZORE, which extracts relations by using syntactic dependen- cy patterns, while associating them with explic- it semantic information. An example is shown is <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, where the relation (c n ê (Oba- ma) oÚ (President) , Pred[.' (graduate)], M Ã (Harvard) { AE (Law School)) is extract- ed from the given sentence "cnê (Obama) o Ú (President) . ' (graduate) u (from) M Ã (Harvard) { AE (Law School)", and general- ized into the syntactic-semantic pattern {nsubj- NR(Af) Pred[. ' (graduate)] prep-u (from) pobj-NN(Di)}. Here, Af and Di stand for human and institution, respectively, according to a Chi- nese taxonomy Extended Cilin ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Che et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Rather than extracting binary relations and then generalizing them into semantic patterns, which most previous work does <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mausam et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nakashole et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moro and Navigli, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moro and Navigli, 2013)</ref>, we develop a novel method that extracts relations and patterns simul- taneously. A double propagation algorithm is used to make relation and pattern information reinforce each other, so that negative effects from automatic syntactic and semantic analysis errors can be miti- gated. In this way, semantic pattern information is leveraged to improve relation extraction.</p><p>We manually annotate two sets of data, from news text and Wikipedia, respectively. Experi- ments on both data sets show that the double prop- agation algorithm gives better precision and recall compared to the baseline. To our knowledge, we are one of the first to report empirical results on Chinese ORE. The ZORE system, together with the two sets of test data we annotated, and the sets of 5 million relations and 344K semantic patterns extracted from news and Wikipedia, is freely re- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Basic Definitions for Open Information Extraction</head><p>ZORE is applied to web text to extract general re- lations and their semantic types. Our definition of relations follow previous work on ORE <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Moro and Navigli, 2013)</ref>, but with language-specific ad- justments. In this section, we use the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> as an instance to describe the basic defi- nitions for ZORE. Definition 1 (predicate phrase) A predicate phrase is a sequence of words that contains at least one verb or copula, and governs one or more noun phrases syntactically. For instance, a predicate phrase for the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is ".' (grad- uate)". Following , <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mausam et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nakashole et al. (2012)</ref>, in case of light verb constructions, the verb and its direct ob- ject jointly serve as predicate phrase. We do not include prepositions into the predicate phrases.</p><p>Definition 2 (argument) An argument is a base noun phrase governed by a predicate phrase direct- ly or indirectly with a preposition. For instance, "cnê (Obama) oÚ (President)" and "MÃ (Harvard) { AE (Law School)" are two argu- ments of the predicate phrase ".' (graduate)". Definition 3 (relation) A binary relation is a triple that consists of the predicate phrase Pred and its two arguments x and y. Accordingly, an n-ary relation contains n arguments. For instance, the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> contains the binary rela- tion (cnê (Obama) oÚ (President), Pred[. ' (graduate)], M Ã (Harvard) { AE (Law School)). In English, the two arguments of a bi- nary relation are usually positioned on the left and right of Pred, respectively. Hence, shallow pat- terns are highly useful for English relation extrac- 1 https://sourceforge.net/projects/zore/ tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banko et al., 2007)</ref>. In Chinese, however, the two arguments can be both on the left, both on the right or one on the left and one on the right of the predicate, and the resulting binary relation can be either (x, y, Pred), (Pred, x, y) and (x, Pred, y), de- pending on the sentence. This makes the detection of relation phrases more complicated.</p><p>Definition 4 (syntactic pattern) A syntactic pat- tern is the syntactic abstraction of a relation. A re- lation can be generalized into the combination of words, POS-tags and syntactic dependency labels ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nakashole et al., 2012</ref>). For instance, the syntac- tic pattern of the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is {nsubj- NR(A) Pred[.'] prep-u pobj-NN(A)}. It con- sists of four sub-patterns. The first, nsubj-NR(A), denotes that the current phrase acts as the sub- ject of the predicate phrase with the POS-tag NR (proper nouns). Here, "(A)" means that the phrase is an argument of the extracted relation. The sec- ond sub-pattern denotes that the predicate phrase of the example is ".' (graduate)". Note that the words between the predicate and arguments (e.g., prep-u) are included into the pattern direct- ly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nakashole et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mausam et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>Definition 5 (semantic signature) The seman- tic signature of a relation consists of the semantic categories of the arguments. The semantic signa- ture of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is (Af, Di), where Af and Di de- notes human and institute, respectively.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ZORE</head><p>The architecture of ZORE is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. It consists of three components. The first is a relation candidate extractor, which consumes input tex- t and performs sentence segmentation, word seg- mentation, POS tagging, syntactic parsing, base NP extraction, light verb structure (LVC) detection and relation candidate extraction. The output is a set of relation candidates. The second component tags relations and extracts semantic patterns by a double propagation algorithm. In the third compo- nent, extracted patterns are grouped into synsets, and relations are filtered by confidence scores.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Parsing and Base NP Extraction</head><p>ZORE analyzes the syntactic structures of input texts by applying a pipeline of NLP tools. Each sentence is segmented into a list of words by using the Stanford segmenter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chang et al., 2008)</ref>, and parsed by using ZPar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhang and Clark, 2011)</ref>, with POS tags and constituent structures by the CTB standard ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xue et al., 2005</ref>). The result- ing constituent trees are transformed into projec- tive trees with Stanford dependencies by using the Stanford parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chang et al., 2009</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the parse tree of the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Next, base noun phrases (NPs) are extracted from the dependency tree. Here a base NP is a maximum phrase whose words can only have POS from the first row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The head word of a base NP can be either a noun, a pronoun, a num- ber or a measure word (the second row of <ref type="table">Table  1</ref>). The dependency labels within a base NP can only be from the third row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Obviously, a base NP does not contain other base NPs, and is also not contained by any other base NP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Detecting Light Verb Constructions</head><p>In linguistics, a light verb is a verb that has little semantic content of its own, and typically form- s a predicate with a noun <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Butt, 2003)</ref>. Exam- ple predicates by light verb constructions (LVC) include "is a capital of" and "claim responsibil- ity for", where "is" and "claim" are light verbs. Improper handling of LVC can cause a significan- t problem by uninformative extractions ). For example, if "is" and "claim" are ex- tracted as predicates, the resulting relations (such as (Hamas, claimed, responsibility) from the sen- tence "Hamas claimed responsibility for the Gaza attack") might not bare useful information. Re- Verb ( ) handles this problem by hard syntactic constraints, taking the noun phrase (e.g., responsibility) between a verb phrase (e.g., "claim") and a preposition (e.g., "for") as a part of the predicate phrase rather than an argument, lead- ing to the relation (Hamas, claimed responsibility for, the Gaza attack).</p><p>In Chinese, LVCs are highly frequent and should be handled properly in order to ensure that the extracted relations are informative. Howev- er, the syntactic constraints in ReVerb can not be transferred to Chinese directly, because the word orders of English and Chinese are quite different.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Labels Base NP modifier NN (common noun), M (measure word), CD (cardinal number), OD (ordinal number), PN (pronoun), NR (proper noun), NT (temporal noun), JJ (other noun-modifier), or PU (punctuation) Base NP head NN (common noun), M (measure word), CD (cardinal number), OD (ordinal number), PN (pronoun), NR (proper noun), NT (temporal noun) Labels in base NPs nn (noun compound modifier), conj (conjunct), nummod (number modifier), cc (coordinating conjunction),</head><p>clf (classifier modifier), det (determiner), ordmod (ordinal number modifier), punct (punctuation), dep (other dependencies), or amod (adjectival modifier) Labels from base NPs to predicate phrase nsubj (nominal subject), conj (conjunct), dobj (direct object), advmod (adverbial modifier), prep (preposi- tional modifier), pobj (prepositional object), lobj (localizer object), range (dative object that is a quantifier phrase), tmod (temporal modifier), plmod (localizer modifier of a preposition), attr (attributive), loc (local- izer), top (topic), xsubj (controlling subject), ba ("ba" construction), nsubjpass (nominal passive subject) <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Constraints on POS-tags and dependency labels. Labels in the top three rows are used for base NP extraction, while labels in the last row for traversing from a base NP to the predicate phrase.</p><p>In Chinese, prepositions acting as the modifier of a verb can be on both the left and right of the ver- b. For instance, the sentence "cnê (Obama) o Ú (President) u (from) MÃ (Harvard) {AE (Law School) .' (graduate)" is a paraphrase of the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, with the preposition u (from) on the left of the predicate phrase.</p><p>Chinese LVCs can be classified into two types, which we refer to as dummy-LVCs and common LVCs, respectively. For the first type, the predi- cate is a dummy verb such as "?1 (do)" and "ƒ ± (give)", which has a noun phrase as its object. Since dummy verbs in Chinese are a closed set, we detect this type of LVCs (such as "?1 (do) ¬! (talk)") by finding the dummy verb from a lexi- con. For the second type of LVCs, the predicate is a common verb, which has a nominalized structure or a common noun as its object. For instance, "Ð m (launch) N (investigation)" belongs to this type of construction.</p><p>Common LVCs are more difficult to detect than dummy-LVCs. We detect common LVCs by the context. Besides the NPs in the LVC itself, a com- mon LVC typically governs two NPs, with the lat- ter being connected to the predicate phrase by an LVC-related preposition such as "é (for), éu (for), é (for), • (to), Ó (with), † (with), Ú (with) ". Based on the observation, a basic idea of identifying common LVCs is to find verb-object structures that frequently co-occur with a LVC- related preposition in a large-scale corpus parsed automatically. For a given verb-object v, let f v and f p denote the frequency of v and the frequency of v co-occurring with an LVC-related preposition, re- spectively. We define the statistical strength of v to be an LVC as the ratio f p /f v . If the statistical strength of v exceeds a threshold t lvc , we identify v as a LVC. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> illustrates some high-frequency LVCs extracted by the method automatically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Extracting Relation Candidates</head><p>ZORE tries to extract relation candidates from sentences that contain two or more base NPs. Giv- en two base NPs, we traverse the dependency tree to obtain the shortest path that connects them. The path can contain only dependency labels in the fourth row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and should contain at least one of the labels from "nsubj" and "dobj" to en- sure that a predicate phrase is included in the path. If such a path is acquired, other base NPs governed by the same predicate phrase are included into the target relation, resulting in a n-ary relation candi- dates with each base NP being an argument. Ac- cording to the predicate phrase, relation candidates can be classified into the following classes.</p><p>Common and dummy LVC relations. In this type of relations, the predicate phrase of the path is an LVC (e.g., a light verb and a nominal ob- ject). The two base NPs can be the subject or prepositional object of the light verb. For instance, in the sentence "¿&amp;Z (Houdini) é (to) · (my) ¯' (career) k (have) éOE (big) K• (in- fluence)", "k (have)"and "K• (influence)" are combined into a common LVC and taken as the predicate phrase, resulting the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(¿ &amp; Z (Houdini), Pred[k (have) K• (influence)], · (my) ¯' (career)).</formula><p>In the corresponding English sentence, the predicate phrase "be a big influence in" is also an LVC structure.</p><p>Verb relations. In this type of relations, a verb acts as the predicate phrase. For instance, the rela- tion (cnê (Obama) oÚ (President), Pred[.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Semantic Tagging by Double Propagation</head><p>The basic idea of our approach is to identify rela- tions and patterns iteratively through semantical- ly tagging the head words of arguments in rela- tion candidates. Given a set of relation candidates and a semantic taxonomy, the propagation consist- s of three steps. In Step 1, monosemic arguments in candidate relations are tagged with a seman- tic category, such as Af and Di, to obtain seman- tic patterns. In Step 2 and Step 3, untagged am- biguous and unknown words are tagged by perfect matching and partial matching, respectively. In the end of each step, semantic patterns are generalized from extracted and tagged relations, and then used to help relation tagging in the next step. Because of the two-way information exchange, we call this method double propagation. The method can also be treated as similar to bootstrapping (Yangarber et al., <ref type="bibr">2000</ref>; Qiu et al., 2009).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Step 1: Tagging Monosemic Arguments</head><p>Each argument in a relation candidate is a base N- P. Since base NPs are endocentric, we can take the semantic category of the head word of a base NP as the semantic category of the base NP. In a tax- onomy, each word is associated with one or more semantic categories. In this step, however, only monosemic words are tagged, while both ambigu- ous words and unknown words are left untagged. Most named entities are not included in the taxonomy. However, after POS-tagging, most of them are detected as NR (proper noun). As a re- sult, they are taken as ambiguous words that can be person names, organization names or location names. The named entities that are not included in the taxonomy are tagged in Steps 2 and 3.</p><p>After this step, all the arguments in some re- lation candidates have been tagged with semantic categories. We refer to these relation candidates as tagged relation candidates, and the remaining re- lation candidates as untagged relation candidates. Tagged relation candidate are generalized into se- mantic patterns, consisting of syntactic patterns and semantic signatures, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and Section 2. We call the set of resulting seman- tic patterns Set SemP at .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Step 2: Tagging by Perfect Pattern Matching</head><p>In this step, the arguments in the untagged relation candidates are tagged by semantic pattern match- ing. Given an untagged relation candidate r, we acquire a set of possible semantic categories for each argument with an ambiguous head word. For the arguments with unknown head words, we ac- quire a set of possible semantic categories accord- ing to their characters. Qiu et al. (2011) demon- strate that 98% Chinese words have at least one synonym, which shares at least one character. For Chinese nouns, the set of synonyms usually shares the last one or two characters. According to this, our strategy for acquiring possible semantic cate- gories for an unknown word is as follows.</p><p>Given an unknown word w u , if we find a known word w k that shares the last two character with w u , the semantic categories of w k will be used as the possible semantic categories of w u . Otherwise, if we find a known word w k that share the last one character with w u , the semantic categories of w k will be used as the possible categories of w u .</p><p>We then acquire possible semantic signatures of untagged relation candidates, of which all the ar- guments are tagged with possible semantic cate- gories. As in Step 1, we generalize relation r in- to a syntactic pattern pat syn , and then combine pat syn with each possible semantic signature of r to generate possible semantic patterns. In case one or more possible semantic patterns of r ex- ist in Set SemP at , if the highest frequency of these patterns is above a threshold t sem , the correspond- ing pattern will be taken as the semantic pattern of r, from which we infer the semantic signature for r and then the semantic category for the head word of each argument of r. After this step, the frequency of each semantic pattern in Set SemP at is updated according to the newly tagged relation candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Step 3: Tagging by Partial Pattern Matching</head><p>In this step, we tag the ambiguous and unknown words by partial matching rather than perfec- t matching of the whole semantic pattern. This can be treated as a back-off of the last step. We first split n-ary semantic patterns in Set SemP at into binary semantic patterns, and cal- culate their frequencies. Second, we split each untagged relation candidate r into several binary sub-relations and then search for the correspond- ing semantic patterns as in Step 2 -for each bi- nary sub-relation, we obtain a binary semantic sig- nature with the highest frequency. By combining the binary semantic signatures, we obtain one n- ary semantic signature for r, based on which all the unknown and ambiguous words can be tagged with a semantic categories. If all the arguments of a relation candidate r are tagged, r is treated as tagged. Finally, according to the newly tagged re- lations, statistics in Set SemP at are updated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Grouping Patterns into Synsets</head><p>In this step, we group semantic patterns from Set SemP at into pattern synsets, based on a single-pass clustering process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Papka and Allan, 1998)</ref>. Given two semantic patterns SemPat i and SemPat j , we refer to their corresponding syntac- tic pattern, semantic signature and predicate phras- es as SynPat i and SynPat j , SemSig i and SemSig j , Pred i and Pred j , respectively. Not taking the pred- icate phrase into account, SynPat i and SynPat j are identical, and we call them loosely identical (≈).</p><p>The algorithm in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> is used to group  patterns, where ARGCOUNT(SynPat j ) denotes the number of arguments in SemPat i , SEMCAT(arg 1 ) indicates the semantic category of the first ar- gument, and ISSYNONYM (Pred i , Pred j ) return- s whether two predicates are synonyms. In similarity-based single-pass clustering, the topic excursion problem is common <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Papka and Allan, 1998)</ref>. But since our similarity measure is sym- metric, we do not suffer from this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Computing the Confidence for Relations</head><p>Without filtering, the extraction algorithm in the previous sections may yield false relations. Fol- lowing previous ORE systems, we make a balance between recall and precision by using a confidence threshold .

LENGTH(r), COUN- T(arguments) and SIZE(SemPat) indicate the num- ber of words in r, the number of arguments in r, and the number of relations that belong to the same semantic pattern SemPat as r. Because se- mantic patterns from the double propagation al- gorithm are used as features in the classifier, they participate in relation extraction also. Their effect on relation extraction can directly demonstrate the effectiveness of double propagation.</p></div>

The Chi- nese taxonomy Extended Cilin 2 (Cilin) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Che et al., 2010</ref>) is used to give semantic categories for each word. Cilin contains 77,492 Chinese words, or- ganized into a five-level hierarchy. There are 12 categories in the top level, 94 in the second and 1492 in the third. In this paper, the second level is used for semantic categories. We create two test sets, containing 500 sentences from Wiki and 500 sentences from Sina News, respectively (see <ref type="table">Table  4</ref>), annotated by two independent annotators us- ing the annotation strategy of . The thresholds t lvc and t sem for pattern matching are set as 0.4 and 5, tuned on 100 sentences from Wiki-500 dataset, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation of Relation Extraction</head><p>First, we compare ZORE with a baseline system to illustrate the effectiveness of the double prop- agation algorithm. The baseline system does not have the double propagation tagging component in   measure the precision and recall of the extracted relations. An extracted relation is considered cor- rect only when the predicate phrase and all the ar- guments match the the gold set. On each data set, we perform 5-fold cross-validation test and take the average as the final precision and recall. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 5 and 6</ref> show the comparison of the two systems on Wiki and Sina News, respectively. On Wiki, ZORE has higher precision than the baseline at all levels of recall. When the recall is 0.3, the precision of ZORE is 0.77, 0.11 higher than the baseline. The result on Sina News is similar. The second column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref> shows the weights of all features trained on the Wiki data set, which indi- cates that the semantic pattern features can give a positive effect on relation filtering.</p><p>Second, we compare the intermediate results at Steps 1, 2, and 3 in Section 3.2, respectively. The precision, recall and F1 of the three steps with d- ifferent numbers of Wiki sentences (from 10K to 5M sentences) are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref>. This figure shows that Step 2 achieves higher precision than Step 1 at all levels of recall, indicating that the word sense tagging method in step 2 is useful for</p></div>

In particular, Step 2 can extract about 20% relations with relatively high precision (about 90%). The result of Step 3 is better to that of Step 2 in terms of F1-measure, with the highest F1-measure achieved by this step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation of Patterns</head><p>ZORE acquires 122K and 222K patterns from Wi- ki and Sina News, clustered into 59K and 118K pattern synsets, respectively. The frequency distri- bution of the Wiki patterns is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, which conforms to Zipf's law.</p><p>To assess the accuracy of pattern extraction, we rank the extracted patterns by the size, and eval- uated the precision of the top 100 and a random set of 100 pattern synsets. Two annotators were shown a pattern synset with its semantic signature and a few example relations, and then asked to judge whether it indicates a valid semantic rela- tion or not. The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>. The averaged precision is 92% for the top 100 set, and 85% for the random 100 set.</p><p>The patterns in a pattern synset can be taken as paraphrases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barzilay and Lee, 2003)</ref>. We ob- serve that two synonymous patterns might differ in three aspects. First, two patterns can differ by the predicates, which are synonyms. For in- stance, the verbs "ú ?, , ?, Ñ ?, •, ‰" are synonyms, meaning "to hold the appointment of". Second, two patterns in the same synset can belong to different syntactic patterns, and there- fore are paraphrases in the syntactic level. For in- stance, the semantic patterns of the two sentences ".' (graduate) u (from) MÃ (Harvard) {AE (Law School) (de, an auxiliary word) cn ê (Obama) oÚ (president)" and "cnê (Oba- ma) oÚ (president) l(from) MÃ (Harvard) { AE (Law School) .' (graduate)" are both syn- onymous to that of the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>; al- l the three patterns are found in the same synset obtained by ZORE. Third, two patterns can dif- fer only by the POS-tag. For instance, "cnê (Obama) l(from) MÃ (Harvard) {AE (Law School) .' (graduate)" and "@ ‡ (That) AE" (attorney) l(from) MÃ (Harvard) {AE (Law School) .' (graduate)" are synonyms with d- ifferent POS-tags for the first argument (i.e. N- R and NN). According to the grouping algorithm in Section 3.3, all the three types of paraphrases are grouped in a pattern synset, which makes some synsets very large. The largest synset contains 110 patterns, while the top 100 synsets contain more than 20 patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Error analysis</head><p>We analyze the incorrect extractions (precision loss) and missed correct relations (recall loss) re- turned by Step 2, running on 500K sentences. Ta- ble 7 summarizes the types of correct relations that are missed by ZORE. 40% missed relations are due to the minimum frequency constraint on se- mantic patterns, which is used for a balance be- tween precision and recall. Another main source of failure is the incorrect identification of the pred- icate phrase due to parsing errors, which account for 37% of the total errors. Other sources of fail- ures include redundant arguments and segmenta- tion errors. Most redundant arguments are related to prepositions such as "Uì (according to)" and "Šâ (on the basis of)". For instance, in the sen- tence "Uì (according to) ù ‡ (the) *: (point of view) § (,) Š (fundamental) ¯K (prob- lem) ´ (is)", an incorrect binary relation (ù ‡ (the) *: (point of view), Š (fundamental) ¯ K (problem), Pred[´ (is)]) is extracted, because the prepositional object "ù ‡ (the) *: (point of view)" is tagged as an argument of the predi- cate phrase "´ (is)".   rect relations, 56% of which were caused by pars- ing errors, and 34% of which were due to word segmentation and POS tagging errors. Although many errors have been filtered by ZORE, the biggest source of errors is still syntactic analysis, which is very important for high quality of ORE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>English has been the major language on which ORE research has been conducted. Previous work on English ORE has evolved from shallow- syntactic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banko et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Merhav et al., 2012</ref>) to full-syntactic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nakashole et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mausam et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moro and Navigli, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Xu et al., 2013</ref>) and semantic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Johansson and Nugues, 2008</ref>) systems.</p><p>It has been shown that a full-syntactic system based on dependency grammar can give signif- icantly better results than shallow syntactic sys- tems based on surface POS-patterns, yet enjoy higher efficiency compared with semantic system- s ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mesquita et al., 2013)</ref>. Our investigation on Chinese ORE takes root in full dependency syntax and is hence able to identify patterns that involve long-range dependencies. Considering the charac- teristics of the Chinese language, such as the lack of morphology and function words, and the high segmentation and word sense ambiguities, we in- corporate semantic ontology information into the design of the system to improve the output quality without sacrificing efficiency.</p><p>The state-of-the-art systems most closely relat- ed to our approach are PATTY (Nakashole et al., 2012) and the system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moro and Navigli (2013)</ref>. Both, however, extract relations first, and then de- fines patterns based on extracted relations. This paper differs in that patterns and relations are ex- tracted in a simultaneous process and so they can improve each other.

By using double propagation, not only can we make relation and pattern extraction benefit from each other, but we can also tag relations and patterns with semantic categories in a joint process.</p><p>There has been a line of research on Chinese re- lation extraction, where both feature-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zhou et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al., 2008)</ref> and kernel-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Che et al., 2005</ref>) methods have been applied. In addition, semantic ontologies such as Extended Cilin have been shown useful for Chinese relation extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liu et al., 2013)</ref>. However, these studies have focused on tradition- al IE, with pre-defined relations. In contrast, we investigate ORE for Chinese, finding that seman- tic ontologies useful for this task also. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tseng et al. (2014)</ref> is the only previous research focusing on Chinese ORE. Their system can be considered as a pipeline of word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing, while our work gives semantic interpreta- tion and explicitly deals with statistical errors in parsing by a novel double propagation algorithm between patterns and relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We presented a Chinese ORE system that inte- grates relation extraction with semantic pattern generalization by double propagation. Experimen- tal results on two datasets demonstrated the ef- fectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We make the ZORE system, together with the large scale relations and pattern synsets extracted by ZORE, freely available at (https://sourceforge. net/projects/zore/). Another version of ZORE (ZORE-PMT), which is based on the de- pendency tagset from PMT1.0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Qiu et al., 2014)</ref>, is also provided.</p><p>Our error analysis demonstrates that the quali- ty of syntactic parsing is crucial to the accuracy of syntax-based Chinese ORE. Improvements to syn- tactic analysis is likely to lead to improved ORE. In addition, the idea of double propagation can be generalized into information propagation between relation extraction and syntactic analysis. We plan to investigate the use of ORE in improving syntac- tic analysis in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A sample sentence analyzed by ZORE.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,117.36,62.81,362.83,118.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
