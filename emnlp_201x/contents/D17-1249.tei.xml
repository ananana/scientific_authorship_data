				<p>Highlighting the recurrence of topics usage in candidates speeches is a key feature to identify the main ideas of each candidate during a political campaign. In this paper, we present a method combining standard topic modeling with signature mining for analyzing topic recurrence in speeches of Clinton and Trump during the 2016 American presidential campaign. The results show that the method extracts automatically the main ideas of each candidate and, in addition, provides information about the evolution of these topics during the campaign.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Political discourse analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Van Dijk, 1998</ref>) is a branch of discourse analysis that aims at explicit- ing from speeches or debates the salient features of political discourses. From that point of view, a presidential election provides interesting datasets to study. Indeed, it is a major political event in a country and gives rise to many political meet- ings where candidates discuss personally selected societal problems and detail their own solutions. In that context, the identification of the favourite topics of candidates as well as how they evolve throughout the campaign is a crucial task.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Savoy, 2010)</ref>, the author presents an analy- sis of the evolution of topics in political speeches by comparing the words that are overused or un- derused by Obama and McCain during the 2008 US presidential campaign. The dynamics of these particular words usage is analyzed over monthly periods to identify the underlying dynamics of the campaign topics. A limitation of this approach is that the period is fixed (monthly) whereas pre- dictable (vote, debates) or unpredictable (scan- dals) events usually give the rhythm to a political campaign. Other work used topic modeling meth- ods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>, Latent Semantic Anlayis (LSA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Landauer et al., 1998</ref>) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lee and Seung, 1999</ref>), to study political texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Prabhakaran et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Quinn et al., 2010</ref>). For instance in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Quinn et al., 2010</ref>), a topic model for legislative speech is de- fined. However, those works study topics one at a time whereas a set of co-referenced topics is more relevant since it constitutes the core of a candi- date's political program. There exist other works about political text analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Calvet and Véronis, 2008)</ref> but they focus on the use of predefined single words in speeches over time, whereas we aim at finding (without knowing in advance which topic are recurrent) the recurrent topics (multiple topics) usage over time.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to identify in political speeches the favourite topics considered by each candidate as well as how and when they evolve throughout the campaign. In our opinion, this gives critical clues to identify and to explain each candidate's main ideas and their evolution. Thus, we describe an approach to extract the topic signa- ture of a candidate from her/his political speeches, i.e. the set of topics discussed by some candi- date over time. The method associates NMF, a standard topic modeling technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lee and Seung, 1999</ref>), with signature mining ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gautrais et al., 2017)</ref> to analyze the speeches of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 US presiden- tial campaign. The advantages of this approach are twofold. First, the set of campaign speeches is modeled with topic signatures, i.e. recurrent top- ics occurring at a flexible periodicity during the campaign, instead of sets of specific words oc- curring at a fixed periodicity. The topic signature provides a more abstract view of each candidate's main ideas and propositions. Second, the signa- ture mining technique automatically adapts the pe- riodicity to the campaign rhythms, to provide a better insight of the campaign dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Topic Signature Model</head><p>To model recurrent topics in a political cam- paign, we use the signature model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gautrais et al., 2017)</ref>. This model was originally developed to capture the recurrent purchase behavior of retail customers. The analogy between politics and re- tail is that customers' purchases consist of regu- larly bought products, and, similarly, politicians' speeches contain recurrent topics.</p><p>We consider a set of topics (W) and a sequence of speeches (α) such that α = (t 1 , S 1 ), (t 2 , S 2 ) . . . (t n , S n ) where ∀i ∈ <ref type="bibr">[1, n]</ref>, S i ⊆ W and t i gives the timestamp of S i . For in- stance, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, W = {a, b, c, d, e} and α is a sequence of seven speeches displayed in chrono- logical order. We see that during Speech S3, two topics were addressed: b and d.</p><p>A k-segmentation of a sequence of speeches α, P (α, k) = E 1 . . . E k , is a sequence of k non- overlapping consecutive sub-sequences of α, E i , called episodes, each consisting of consecutive speeches. An example of a 4-segmentation is given in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the first episode E1 contains 3 speeches (S1, S2, S3), E2 contains 2 speeches (S4, S5), E3 contains speech S6 and E4 contains speech S7. This segmentation contains episodes of different sizes, in both number of speeches and time span. This flexibility of the model allows for adapting the episodes size to the sequence rhythm.</p><p>A topic k-signature, Rec(α, k), is defined as a maximal set of recurrent topics in a k- segmentation of α. Roughly, given P (α,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k) = E 1 . . . E k a k-segmentation of α, we have Rec(P (α, k)) = E i ∈P (α,k) ( S j ∈E i S j )</formula><p>. In other words, Rec(P (α, k)) contains the set of all recurrent topics that are present in each episode of P (α, k). Rec(α, k) is maximal means that it is obtained from a k-segmentation of α that maximizes the size of the recurrent top- ics set: Rec(α, k) = Rec(P max (α, k)) with P max (α, k) = argmax {P (α,k)} |Rec(P (α, k))|. k gives the number of recurrences of the topic signature in sequence α. Thus, given a num- ber of recurrences k, finding the topic k-signature relies on finding the k-segmentation that maxi- mizes the size of the topic set that appears in each episode of that segmentation. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, {a, b} is a topic 4-signature, indeed</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Rec(α, 4) = E1 ∩ E2 ∩ E3 ∩ E4 = (S 1 ∪ S 2 ∪ S 3 ) ∩ (S 4 ∪ S 5 ) ∩ (S 6 ) ∩ (S 7 ) = {a, b, c, d} ∩ {a, b} ∩ {a, b} ∩ {a, b, c, e} = {a, b}.</formula><p>There is no largest set of topics that is repeated in each episode of a 4-segmentation of α. As one can see in this example, episodes can be of differ- ent sizes, and speeches are grouped into episodes such that the topic signature is the largest.</p><p>The signature model contains two types of in- formation. First, the intersection of all E j contains the topics that are recurrent. In our case, this re- veals the topics that one candidate has been speak- ing about, throughout the campaign speeches. The second information is temporal, through the episode timestamps. These timestamps reveal the rhythm of the topics usage. The signature actually links both information, to give the recurrent topics and their dynamic.</p><p>By varying the value of k, one can explore the main topics (if k is large) or the secondary top- ics, that are still recurrent (when k is low). There- fore, recurrent topics and their dynamics can be analyzed on different time scales. The difference with some previous approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Savoy, 2010)</ref> is that the size of each episode E j is not defined in advance. Instead, the signature adapts the segmen- tation and episode size to reveal the rhythm of the topics usage.</p></div>

Next, the sentences were tokenized and the tokens associ- ated with some Part-of-Speech (POS) tags were kept. Precisely, nouns, adjectives and foreign words were kept while verbs and personal nouns were removed. While removing verbs can lead to a loss of semantic information, we found that it resulted in more interpretable topics. This choice of removing verbs has previously been made for topic modeling in political texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zirn and Stuckenschmidt, 2014</ref>). Personal nouns were discarded to remove all references to interviewers or other politicians. We considered keeping some proper nouns (the ones of both campaigners and of some other politicians) but it added noise in the topic modeling step, without providing additional rele- vant information. Finally, remaining tokens were lemmatized and stop words were removed. We used the WordNet lemmatizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Miller and Fellbaum, 1998</ref>) and the list of stop words from the nltk library 3 (Bird et al., 2009). The final dataset contained 6240 different lemma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Topic Modeling</head><p>Even though words could be analyzed directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Savoy, 2010)</ref> However, it should be noted that other topic mod- eling techniques ((Greene and Cross, 2017) for ex- ample) could be used, and lead to meaningful re- sults. Indeed, as our method is built on top of top- ics, any technique that provides good enough top- ics can be used. Any improvements in the topic model can help to draw more precise conclusions (if cleaner topics are available). This remark is also true regarding our choice of removing verbs and personal nouns. Within NMF, a speech is represented as a nu- meric weight vector across all topics. How- ever, the signature model works on symbolic data, which means that a set of representative topics for each speech has to be selected. As we want to discriminate the main topics of a speech from the remaining ones, we applied a clustering on the weight vectors of each speech. Two clusters were looked for, the first containing the highest weights i.e. the cluster of the main topics, and the second containing the secondary or absent topics, with lowest weights. We used the spectral clustering technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Shi and Malik, 2000</ref>) from the scikit- learn library <ref type="bibr">4 (Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>). We did not used techniques based on the Euclidean distance (such as k-means <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(MacQueen et al., 1967</ref> Clinton speech Trump speech average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Topic Signature Extraction</head><p>To study the main topics on different time scales, we computed signatures with different values of k. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> displays the results.</p></div>

Only the last months of the campaign are plotted, since both candi- dates were particularly active during that period and speeches were sparse earlier. The visualiza- tion is especially suited to analyze single topics. First, we can see that most topics are discrimina- tive, they appear often in one candidate's speech while being almost absent in the other's. Some topics, like Communities and police, are shared but not used on the same time line. Another exam- ple is the use of the Climate change issues topic. We can see that it is mainly used at the end of the presidential campaign by Clinton. 5</p><p>About Topic Signatures While the previous section shows how individual topics can be ana- <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Climate change issues became a topic of interest when Clinton attacked Trump on him saying that climate change is a hoax in the first presidential debate ( <ref type="bibr">September 26, 2016).</ref> lyzed, the signature allows for analyzing the main topics as a whole. Let us look at each candi- date's recurring topics in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The main top- ics of each candidate are well separated, showing that each candidate has its own targeted voters. Clinton focused on topics related to communities, youth, issues for the next generations, and woman as president. Trump focused on topics such as new economical policies, illegal immigration, new so- cial policies and criticism of the former govern- ment. The signature of Clinton is quite simple, as low-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sep 2016</head><p>Oct 2016 Nov 2016 T2 + Illegal Immigration T2 + Education policy ering the minimal number of occurrences only adds new topics to the signature. This means that Clinton is very stable in her main topics. This ob- servation is also partially true for Trump. Indeed, Trump has sometimes different signatures for a given number of occurrences. For example, with k = 15, Trump speeches main topics can include Illegal immigration or Education policy, but not both together. This is interesting because it shows that Trump is more diverse in his recurrent topics and that some of them rarely occur together.</p><p>To further deepen the analysis of the fact that Trump speeches include either Education policy or Illegal Immigration but rarely both, let us look at the episodes of the related signatures, represented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. First, we note that the difference be- tween both signatures episodes began to be appar- ent by September 2016. Indeed, the signature con- taining Illegal immigration only has three episodes (Group 2), whereas the one with Education policy has 11 episodes (Group 1). This large difference shows that, in September, Trump discussed his main topics a lot (Criticism of former government, New social policies and New economic policy) in association with Education policies. In October 2016, he switched to Illegal immigration while keeping his main topics, as there are 3 episodes for Education policy (Group 3) whereas there are 7 episodes for Illegal immigration (Group 4). While the fact that Trump stopped talking about Educa- tion policy at the end of September 2016 is vis- ible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, the segmentation performed by the signature brings additional information. In- deed, the signature is changing only one of its top- ics, so we know that Trump kept talking about his other main topics (Social policy and critics and New economic policy) while switching from Ed- ucation policy to Illegal immigration.</p><p>Another important point is that by the beginning of October, when Trump switched from Educa- tion policy to Illegal immigration, the episodes are longer than the remaining ones (Group 4). This means that Trump's main topics are distributed among more speeches than before, which can re- flect a change in his strategy. This information is not easily visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, but it is available from a simple analysis of Trump signature.</p><p>This case study, based on topic signatures, shows that our method is able to derive each can- didate's recurrent topics. Analyzing episodes and related signature topics enables to spot changes in Trump speeches and to explain how some of his recurrent topics are related to each other. This kind of precise analysis is beyond the capabilities of naive regular segmentation techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a new method for analyzing po- litical discourse. It associates standard topic mod- eling with signature mining and enables the iden- tification of the main topics of politicians during a campaign as well as their dynamics. The 2016 US presidential campaign analysis provides interest- ing results: though the discourse of H. Clinton was relatively stable, important changes could be iden- tified in the discourse and communication strategy of D. Trump. These specific results on the cam- paign dynamics were obtained thanks to the tem- poral flexibility of the model.</p><p>In the future, we would like to apply the method to more challenging data, such as polit- ical tweets. Preliminary results on the 2016 US campaign tweets show that the topics used by both candidates were different from their speech: the tweets, being shorter than speeches, empha- size more oversimplified criticism of the opponent rather than justified political ideas.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Campaign topics through time for each candidate.
