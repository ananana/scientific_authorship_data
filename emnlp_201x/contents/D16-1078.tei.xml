				<p>Speculation and negation are important information to identify text factuality. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model with probabilistic weighted average pooling to address speculation and negation scope detection. In particular, our CNN-based model extracts those meaningful features from various syntactic paths between the cues and the candidate tokens in both constituency and dependency parse trees. Evaluation on BioScope shows that our CNN-based model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on Abstracts, a sub-corpus in BioScope, and achieves comparable performances on Clinical Records, another sub-corpus in BioScope.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Factual information is critical to understand a sen- tence or a document in most typical NLP applica- tions. Speculation and negation extraction has been drawing more and more attentions in recent years due to its importance in distinguishing coun- terfactual or uncertain information from the facts. Generally speaking, speculation is a type of uncer- tain expression between certainty and negation, while negation is a grammatical category which reverses the truth value of a proposition.</p><p>Commonly, speculation and negation extraction involves two typical subtasks: cue identification and scope detection. Here, a cue is a word or phrase that has speculative or negative meaning (e.g., suspect, guess, deny, not), while a scope is a text fragment governed by the corresponding cue in a sentence. Consider the following two sentenc- es for examples: In sentence S1, the speculative cue "may" gov- erns the scope "may harm our lungs", while the negative cue "not" governs the scope "not like playing football" in sentence S2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(S1)</formula><p>Previous work have achieved quite success on cue identification (e.g., with F1-score of 86.79 for speculative cue detection in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tang et al. (2010)</ref>). In comparison, speculation and negation scope detec- tion is still a challenge due to its inherent difficul- ties and those upstream errors. In this paper, we focus on scope detection. Previous work on scope detection can be classified into heuristic rules based methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Özgür et al., 2009; Øvrelid et al., 2010)</ref>, machine learning based methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zou et al., 2013)</ref>, and hybrid approaches which integrate empirical models with manual rules ( ).</p><p>Different from those previous studies, this paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- based approach for scope detection. CNN models, firstly invented to capture more abstract features for computer vision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">LeCun et al., 1989</ref>), have achieved certain success on various NLP tasks in recent years, such as semantic role labeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collobert et al., 2011</ref>), machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Meng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hu et al., 2015)</ref>, event extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nguyen et al., 2015)</ref>, etc. These stud- ies have proved the ability of CNN models in learning meaningful features.</p><p>In particular, our CNN-based model extracts various kinds of meaningful features from the syn- tactic paths between the cue and the candidate to- ken in both constituency and dependency parse trees. The importance of syntactic information in scope detection has been justified in previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lapponi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zou et al., 2013, etc)</ref>. Our model can also benefit from the ability of neural networks in extracting useful information from syntactic paths ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xu et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Xu et al., 2015b</ref>) or more complex syntac- tic trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ma et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tai et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreo- ver, instead of traditional average pooling, our CNN-based model utilizes probabilistic weighted average pooling to alleviate the overfitting prob- lem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zeiler et al., 2013)</ref>. Experimental results on BioScope prove the effectiveness of our CNN- based model. The reminder of this paper is organized as fol- lows: Section 2 gives an overview of the related work. Section 3 describes our CNN-based model with probabilistic weighted average pooling for scope detection. Section 4 illustrates the experi- mental settings, and reports the experimental re- sults and analysis. Finally, Section 5 draws the conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In this section, we give an overview of previous work on both scope detection and utilization of CNNs in NLP applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Scope Detection</head><p>Earlier studies on speculation and negation scope detection focused on developing various heuristic rules manually to detect scopes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chapman et al. (2001)</ref> developed various regu- lar expressions for negation scope detection. Sub- sequently, various kinds of heuristic rules began to emerge. <ref type="bibr">Özgür et al. (2009)</ref> resorted to the part-of- speech of the speculative cues and the syntactic structures of the current sentences for identifying scopes, and developed heuristic rules according to the syntactic trees. <ref type="bibr">Øvrelid et al. (2010)</ref> construct- ed a set of heuristic rules on dependency structures and obtained the accuracy of 66.73% on the CoNLL evaluation data. The approaches based on heuristic rules were effective because the sentence structures in BioScope satisfy some grammatical rules to a certain extent.</p><p>With the release of the BioScope corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Szarvas et al., 2008)</ref>, machine learning based methods began to dominate the research of speculation and negation scope detection. <ref type="bibr">Morante et al. (2008)</ref> regarded negation scope detection as a chunk classification task utilizing lexical and syntactic features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Morante et al. (2009a)</ref> further implemented a scope detection system combining three classifiers, i.e., TiMBL, SVM and CRF, based on shallow syntactic fea- tures, and achieved the performance of 77.13% and 73.36% in Percentage of Correct Scopes (PCS) on speculation and negation scope detection on Abstracts, a sub-corpus of BioScope.  explored a hybrid method, adopting manu- ally crafted rules over dependency parse trees and a discriminative ranking function over nodes in constituent parse trees. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zou et al. (2013)</ref> proposed a tree kernel based approach on the syntactic parse trees to detect speculation and negation scopes.</p><p>Alternative studies treated scope detection as a sequential labeling task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tang et al. (2010)</ref> pro- posed a CRF model with POS, chunks, NERs, de- pendency relations as features. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lapponi et al. (2012)</ref> employed a CRF model with lexical and dependency features for negation scope and event resolution on the Conan Doyle corpus. The- se machine learning methods manifest the effec- tiveness of syntactic features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">CNN based NLP Applications</head><p>Currently, CNNs have obtained certain success on various NLP tasks, e.g., part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collobert et al., 2011</ref>). Specifically, CNNs have been proven effective in extracting sentence-level features. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CNN-based Modeling with Probabilis- tic Weighted Average Pooling</head><p>This section describes our CNN-based model for speculation and negation scope detection, which is recast as a classification task to determine whether each token in a sentence belongs to the scope of the corresponding cue or not. Principally, our CNN-based model first extracts path features from syntactic trees with a convolutional layer and con- catenates them with their relative positions into one feature vector, which is then fed into a soft- max layer to compute the confidence scores of its location labels, described in subsection 3.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Token Labeling</head><p>We employ following labeling scheme for each candidate token:  A token is labeled as O if it is NOT an ele- ment of a speculation or negation scope;  A token is labeled as B if it is inside a scope and occurs before the cue, i.e., P token ＜P cue , where P token and P cue are the positions of the token and the cue in a sentence, respectively;  A token is labeled as A if it is inside a scope and occurs after the cue (inclusive), i.e., P token ≥P cue .</p><p>Under this scheme, each token in a sentence is classified into B, A or O. For example, the labels of all the tokens in sentence S3 are shown in sen- tence S4. The advantage of our scheme is that it can de- scribe the location relationship among the tokens, cues and scopes more precisely than some previ- ous studies, which regarded scope detection as a binary classification task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Øvrelid et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zou et al., 2013</ref>). Compared to other schemes with more than two labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Morante et al., 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lapponi et al., 2012</ref>), our scheme can much alleviate the imbalance of labels, because the tokens occurring at the first or last positions of the scopes are much fewer than other tokens. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows the framework of our model based on neural network. We concentrate on Path Fea- ture and Position Feature. They are concatenated into one feature vector, which is finally fed into the softmax layer to obtain the output vector.    Relative Position has been proven useful in previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zeng et al., 2014;</ref>. In this paper, relative position is defined as the relative distance of the cue to the candidate token. For instance, in sentence S1, the relative distances of the cue "may" to the candidate tokens "warn" and "our" are 3 and -2, respectively. The values of position features are mapped into a vec- tor P of dimension d p , with P initialized randomly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Input Representation</head><p>Instead of the word sequence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zeng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zhang et al. 2015;</ref>, we argue that the Shortest Syntactic Path from the cue to the candidate token can offer effective fea- tures to determine whether a token belongs to the scope. It is remarkable that the lowest common ancestor node of the cue and the token is the high- est tree node in the path. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the architecture of our CNN- based model to extract path features. Here, convo- lutional features are first extracted from the matrix of embeddings of the path, and then fed into the hidden layer to produce more complicated features.</p><p>In this paper, the syntactic paths between the cues and the candidate tokens in constituency and dependency parse trees are both considered. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig- ure 3</ref> presents the constituency parse tree of sen- tence S1 and the constituency path from the cue "may" to the candidate token "our". It shows that the tokens are at both the beginning and the end of the path with the arrows indicating the directions. Meanwhile, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> displays the dependency parse tree of sentence S2 and the dependency path from the cue "not" to the token "playing".</p><p>As the input of our CNN-based model, both the constituency path and the dependency path be- tween the cue and the token can be regarded as the special "sentences" S=(t 1 , t 2 ,…, t n ), whose "words" can be tokens of sentences, syntactic categories, dependency relations, and arrows.</p><p>Similar to other CNN-based models, we also consider a fixed size window of tokens around the current token to capture its local features in the path. Here, the window size is set as an odd num- ber w, indicating that there are (w-1)/2 tokens be- fore and after the candidate token, respectively. In this case, path S is transferred into matrix , where d 0 is the dimension of the em- beddings and |T 0 | is the size of the table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Convolutional Neural Networking</head><p>After fed into the convolutional layer, the matrix of the syntactic path X 0 is processed with a linear operation:   </p><formula xml:id="formula_1"> 1 1 0 1 Y W X b<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">[ ( , 0 ), ( ,1), ..., ( , 1)] r m a x r r r n  1 1 1 C m a x Y Y Y (2) ( ) [ ( , 0 ), ( ,1), ..., ( , 1)] r m in r r r n  1 1 1 C m in Y Y Y<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where <ref type="bibr">1</ref> 01 rn    . Moreover, we extract a con- volutional feature Cpavg, whose elements are probabilistic weighted average values of rows in Y 1 . Formally, Cpavg can be written as: </p><p>In Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref>, p i is the probability of the ele- ment ( , ) </p><p>Then, C is fed into the hidden layer to learn more complex and meaningful features. Here, we process C with a linear operation just like in the convolutional layer, and choose hyperbolic tanh as the activation function to get </p><p>where <ref type="bibr">21</ref>  is the bias term. To produce the output of the hidden layer, a normalization operation is ap- plied to eliminate the manifold differences among various features:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">/  22 H Y Y<label>(8)</label></formula><p>In this way we obtain the path feature 2 n  H R for each candidate token and then concatenate it with the position feature P into one vector F 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">[ , ] T T T  0 F P H<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f n  R 0 F</formula><p>is the feature vector of a candi- date token with the dimension equaling the sum of n 2 and the dimension of P. Besides, we also con- sider the dropout operation for regularization to prevent the co-adaptation of hidden units on the penultimate layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9"> 10 F F M<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where is an element-wise multiplication and M is a mask vector whose elements follow the Ber- noulli distribution with the probability p of being 1. We determine whether the candidate token is in the scope of the current cue according to its F 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Output</head><p>Finally, F 1 is fed into the softmax layer: R is the bias term. The dimension of O is n 3 =3, which is equal to the number of labels repre- senting whether the token is an element of the scope, just as described in subsection 3.1, and the elements of O can be interpreted as the confidence scores of the three labels, i.e., B, A and O.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">() = s o ftm a x  3 1 3 O W F b<label>(11)</label></formula><p>To learn the parameters of the network, we su- pervise the predicted labels of O with the gold la- bels in the training set, and utilize the following training objection function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">2 1 1 ( ) lo g ( | , ) 2 m ii i J p y x m         <label>(12)</label></formula><p>where <ref type="bibr">( | , )</ref> ii p y x  is the confidence score of the golden label y i (B, A, O) of the training instance x i , m is the number of the training instances, λ is the regularization coefficient and θ={W 0 , W 1 , b 1 , W 2 , b 2 , W 3 , b 3 } is the set of parameters. To train the CNN-based model, the Stochastic Gradient De- scent algorithm is applied to fine-tune θ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimentation</head><p>In this section, we first introduce the evaluation data, and then describe the experimental settings. Finally, we report the experimental results and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Corpus</head><p>We evaluate our CNN-based model on BioScope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Szarvas et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Vincze et al., 2008</ref>), a widely used and freely available resource consisting of sentences annotated with speculative and negative cues and their scopes in biomedical domain. 3.87 (Notes: "Ave. Len" denotes average length; "Abs", "Papers" and "Cli" denote Abstracts, Full Papers and Clinical Records, respectively; "Spe" and "Neg" denote speculation and nega- tion, respectively.)  <ref type="bibr">13.38)</ref>. Moreo- ver, both the average lengths of sentences and scopes in Clinical Records are shorter than those of other two sub-corpora (Average length: 11.96 (speculation sentence), 8.53 (negation sentence), 4.92 (speculation scope) and 3.87 (negation scope)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experimental Settings</head><p>Following the previous work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Özgür et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Morante et al., 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Morante et al., , 2009b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zou et al., 2013)</ref>, we divide the Abstracts sub-corpus into 10 folds to perform 10-fold cross-validation. Moreo- ver, to examine the robustness of our CNN-based model towards different text types within biomed- ical domain, all the models are trained on the same Abstracts sub-corpus. Therefore, the results on Abstracts can be regarded as in-domain evaluation while the results on Clinical Records and Full Pa- pers can be regarded as cross-domain evaluation.</p><p>For the measurement, traditional Precision, Re- call, and F1-score are used to report the token- based performance in scope detection, while the Percentage of Correct Scopes (PCS) is adopted to report the scope-based performance, which con- siders a scope correct if all the tokens in the sen- tence have been assigned the correct scope classes for a specific cue. Obviously, PCS can better de- scribe the overall performance in scope detection. Besides, Percentage of Correct Left Boundaries (PCLB) and Percentage of Correct Right Bounda- ries (PCRB) are reported as partial measurements.</p><p>In all our experiments, both the constituency and dependency parse trees are produced by Stan- ford Parser 2 . Specially, we train the parser on the GENIA Treebank 1.0 3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tateisi et al., 2005</ref>), which contains Penn Treebank-style syntactic (phrase structure) annotation for the GENIA corpus. The parser achieves the performance of 87.12% in F1- score in terms of 10-fold cross-validation on GENIA TreeBank 1.0.</p><p>For the hyper-parameters in our CNN-based model, we set d 0 =100, d p =10, w=3, n 1 =200, n 2 =500, λ=10 -4 , p=0.8. The embeddings of the to- kens in ordinary sentences (as word sequences) are initialized by Word2Vec 4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>For the baseline, we utilize the classifier-based baseline developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zou et al. (2013)</ref>. Besides those typical features, constituency and dependen-cy syntactic features are also included. Further- more, Mallet 5 is selected as the classifier.</p><p>In addition, since our CNN-based model may result in discontinuous blocks, we utilize a post- processing algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Morante et al., 2008</ref>) to en- sure the continuity of scopes. Meanwhile, the cue must be in its scope as defined in Bioscope. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarizes the performances of scope detection on Abstracts. In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, CNN_C and CNN_D refer the CNN-based model with constit- uency paths and dependency paths, respectively (the same below). It shows that our CNN-based models (both CNN_C and CNN_D) can achieve better performances than the baseline in most measurements. This indicates that our CNN-based models can better extract and model effective fea- tures. Besides, compared to the baseline, our CNN-based models consider fewer features and need less human intervention. It also manifests that our CNN-based models improve significantly more on negation scope detection than on specula- tion scope detection. Much of this is due to the better ability of our CNN-based models in identi- fying the right boundaries of scopes than the left ones on negation scope detection, with the huge gains of 29.44% and 25.25% on PCRB using CNN_C and CNN_D, respectively. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> illustrates that the performance of spec- ulation scope detection is higher than that of nega- tion (Best PCS: 85.75% vs 77.14%). It is mainly attributed to the shorter scopes of negation cues. Under the circumstances that the average length of negation sentences is almost as long as that of speculation ones (29.28 vs 29.77), shorter negation scopes mean that more tokens do not belong to the scopes, indicating more negative instances. The imbalance between positive and negative instances has negative effects on both the baseline and the 5 http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ CNN-based models for negation scope detection. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> also shows that our CNN_D outper- forms CNN_C in negation scope detection (PCS: 77.14% vs 70.86%), while our CNN_C performs better than CNN_D in speculation scope detection (PCS: 85.75% vs 74.43%). To explore the results of our CNN-based models in details, we present the analysis of top 10 speculative and negative cues below on CNN_C and CNN_D, respectively.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the PCSs of the most fre- quent 10 speculative cues using CNN_C. The cues in the horizontal axis are in the order of lowest to highest in frequency. Among those cues, "sug- gest", "may", "indicate", and "appear" are commonly used to express opinions of certain in- dividuals. The scopes of these cues are integrated semantic fragments (probably clauses) governed by corresponding cues in grammatical sense, and the tokens in the scope tend to share the same chunk with the cue in the constituency parse tree. Hence, constituency paths are more useful for speculation scope detection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 5</ref> also shows that the PCSs of all the top 10 speculative cues are higher than 70% except "or" (PCS: 60.44%), mainly due to the flexible usage of "or", which Systems P(%) R(%) F1 PCLB(%) PCRB(%) PCS(%) can connect two words, two professional terms, or even two clauses.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 6</ref> illustrates the performances of the most frequent 10 negative cues using CNN_D. In those negative cues, "not" is in the absolute majority, and "not" and "no" cover over 70%. We have no- ticed that most negative cues (e.g., "not", "no", "without", "fail") are often applied to negate phrases, and the tokens in negation scope tend to have the tight dependency relationship with them. Therefore, our model can achieve better results using dependency paths for negation scope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experimental Results on Abstracts</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speculation</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 6</ref>, most negative cues have good PCSs (higher than 70%). However, "unable" has poor PCS of 16.67%. This is due to the fact that "una- ble" usually occurs in the phrase structure "be un- able to", which often follows a subject. It is nota- ble that a cue is always in its scope and most cues in BioScope are much closer to the left boundaries than to the right ones. Hence, the tokens labeled as B (i.e., inside the scope and before the cue) are much fewer than the ones labeled as A or O. Such imbalance makes it hard to judge whether the to- kens before "unable" are in of its scope or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Experimental Results on Clinical Records and Full Papers</head><p>The performances of our CNN-based models on the other two sub-corpora, i.e., Clinical Records and Full Papers, are presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Alt- hough Abstracts and Clinical Records have differ- ent genres, our CNN-based models can obtain sat- isfactory results on Clinical Records using both constituency paths and dependency paths, proving the portability of our models. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> also shows that the results of negation scope are better than those of speculation scope on Clinical Records (PCS: 89.66% vs 73.92%). We argue the reason is that both the lengths of nega- tion sentences and scopes (8.53 and 3.87, respec- tively) in Clinical Records are much shorter, indi- cating that the structures of negation sentences are simpler than those of speculation ones. After error analysis of speculation scopes, we find that 54.83% of our error scopes contain the annotated scopes, just like sentence S5: (S5) This does not [appear to represent a stone] and is not mobile.</p><p>The annotated scope of the cue "appear" is "appear to represent a stone". However, our CNN-based model identifies the whole sentence as the scope. These errors indicate that some words may be wrongly identified as the components of scopes because the scopes in Clinical Records are short and their structures are simple.</p><p>Compared with Abstracts and Clinical Records, the results on Full Papers are much lower. This is mainly due to the poor PCRBs, indicating a con- siderable quantity of right boundaries of scopes cannot be identified correctly. We should note that the average lengths of both speculation and nega- tion sentences <ref type="bibr">(30.76 and 30.55, respectively)</ref> in Full Papers are longer than those in Abstracts and Clinical Records. Normally, longer sentences mean more complicated syntactic structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systems P(%) R(%) F1 PCLB(%) PCRB(%) PCS(%) Speculation</head><p>Besides the results trained on Abstracts, we also consider the 10-fold cross-validation on Clinical Records and Full Papers. The PCSs of speculation and negation scope detection are 74.73% (CNN_C) and 91.03% (CNN_C) on Clinical Records, which are both higher than the ones trained on Abstracts. Remember that Abstracts and Clinical Records come from the different genres. However, we get lower PCSs on Full Papers (49.54% for specula- tion scope detection using CNN_C, and 44.67% for negation scope detection using CNN_C). In addition to the complex structures of long sentenc- es, another reason is that the smaller size of the Full Papers sub-corpus compared to the other two sub-corpora. Fewer sentences and scopes (only 672 speculation scopes in 519 sentences and 376 negation scopes in 339 sentences) mean that we cannot get an excellent model. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref> compares our CNN-based models with the state-of-the-art systems. It shows that our CNN- based models can achieve higher PCSs (+1.54%) than those of the state-of-the-art systems for spec- ulation scope detection and the second highest PCS for negation scope detection on Abstracts, and can get comparable PCSs on Clinical Records (73.92% vs 78.69% for speculation scopes, 89.66% vs 90.74% for negation scopes). It is worth noting that Abstracts and Clinical Records come from different genres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Comparison with the State-of-the-Art</head><p>It also displays that our CNN-based models per- form worse than the state-of-the-art on Full Papers due to the complex syntactic structures of the sen- tences and the cross-domain nature of our evalua- tion. Although our evaluation on Clinical Records is cross-domain, the sentences in Clinical Records are much simpler and the results on Clinical Rec- ords are satisfactory. Remind that our CNN-based models are all trained on Abstracts. Another rea- son is that those state-of-the-art systems on Full Papers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Li et al., 2010;</ref> are tree-based, instead of token-based. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Li et al. (2010)</ref> proposed a semantic parsing framework and focused on determining whether a constituent, rather than a word, is in the scope of a negative cue.  presented a hybrid framework, combining a rule-based approach us- ing dependency structures and a data-driven ap- proach for selecting appropriate subtrees in con- stituent structures. Normally, tree-based models can better capture long-distance syntactic depend- ency than token-based ones. Compared to those tree-based models, however, our CNN-based model needs less manual intervention. To improve the performances of scope detection task, we will explore this alternative in our future work.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper proposes a CNN-based model for spec- ulation and negation scope detection. Compared with various lexical and syntactic features adopted in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lapponi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zou et al., 2013)</ref>, our CNN-based model only considers the position feature and syntactic path feature. Experimental results on the BioScope corpus show that our CNN-based model can get the best performances for speculation scopes and the se- cond highest performances for negation scopes on Abstracts in in-domain evaluation. In cross- domain evaluations, we can achieve comparable results on Clinical Records, but our CNN-based model performs worse on Full Papers. This sug- gests our future direction to extend the model from token level to parse tree level in better capturing long-distance syntactic dependency and to address the cross-domain adaptation issue.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>For instance, Zeng et al. (2014) utilized a CNN-based model to extract sentence-level features for rela- tion classification. Zhang et al. (2015) proposed a shallow CNN-based model for implicit discourse relation recognition. Chen et al. (2015) presented a CNN-based model with dynamic multi-pooling on event extraction. More recently, researchers tend to learn features from complex syntactic trees. Ma et al. (2015) use a CNN-based model for sentence embedding, uti- lizing dependency tree-based n-grams. Xu et al. (2015a) exploited a CNN-based model to learn features from the shortest dependency path be- tween the subject and the object for semantic rela- tion classification.</figDesc></figure>

Compared to the standard average pooling, each element in Cpavg has a weight depending on its value. That is, during computing Cpavg, the most active elements with the largest absolute values (i.e., the maximum and minimum values) play the leading roles, while those less active elements with smaller absolute values have less effect. In this way, we can reduce the influence of less active elements, and can cap- ture more active information in ( , ) r  1 Y . From this respect, Cpavg can be regarded as a meaningful convolutional feature.
