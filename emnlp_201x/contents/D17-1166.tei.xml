				<p>Social media users often make explicit predictions about upcoming events. Such statements vary in the degree of certainty the author expresses toward the outcome: &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio will win Best Actor&quot; vs. &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio may win&quot; or &quot;No way Leonardo wins!&quot;. Can popular beliefs on social media predict who will win? To answer this question, we build a corpus of tweets annotated for veridicality on which we train a log-linear classifier that detects positive veridicality with high precision. 1 We then forecast uncertain outcomes using the wisdom of crowds, by ag-gregating users&apos; explicit predictions. Our method for forecasting winners is fully automated, relying only on a set of contenders as input. It requires no training data of past outcomes and outperforms sentiment and tweet volume baselines on a broad range of contest prediction tasks. We further demonstrate how our approach can be used to measure the reliability of individual accounts&apos; predictions and retrospectively identify surprise outcomes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the digital era we live in, millions of peo- ple broadcast their thoughts and opinions online. These include predictions about upcoming events of yet unknown outcomes, such as the Oscars or election results. Such statements vary in the ex- tent to which their authors intend to convey the event will happen. For instance, (a) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> strongly asserts the win of Natalie Portman over Meryl Streep, whereas (b) imbues the claim with <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The code and data can be found at https://github. com/SandeshS/Twitter-Veridicality  uncertainty. In contrast, (c) does not say anything about the likelihood of Natalie Portman winning (although it clearly indicates the author would like her to win). Prior work has made predictions about contests such as NFL games ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sinha et al., 2013</ref>) and elec- tions using tweet volumes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tumasjan et al., 2010)</ref> or sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(O'Connor et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shi et al., 2012</ref>). Many such indirect signals have been shown useful for prediction, however their utility varies across domains. In this paper we explore whether the "wisdom of crowds" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Surowiecki, 2005)</ref>, as measured by users' explicit predictions, can predict outcomes of future events. We show how it is possible to accurately forecast winners, by aggregating many individual predictions that assert an outcome. Our approach requires no his- torical data about outcomes for training and can directly be adapted to a broad range of contests.</p><p>To extract users' predictions from text, we present TwiVer, a system that classifies veridi- cality toward future contests with uncertain out- comes. Given a list of contenders competing in a contest (e.g., Academy Award for Best Actor), we use TwiVer to count how many tweets explic- itly assert the win of each contender. We find that aggregating veridicality in this way provides an accurate signal for predicting outcomes of fu- ture contests. Furthermore, TwiVer allows us to perform a number of novel qualitative analyses including retrospective detection of surprise out- comes that were not expected according to popu- lar belief (Section 4.5). We also show how TwiVer can be used to measure the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by individual accounts. This provides an intuitive measurement of the re- liability of an information source (Section 4.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In this section we summarize related work on text- driven forecasting and computational models of veridicality.</p><p>Text-driven forecasting models (Smith, 2010) predict future response variables using text written in the present: e.g., forecasting films' box-office revenues using critics' reviews ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Joshi et al., 2010)</ref>, predicting citation counts of scientific articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yogatama et al., 2011</ref>) and success of literary works <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ashok et al., 2013)</ref>, forecasting economic indi- cators using query logs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Choi and Varian, 2012)</ref>, improving influenza forecasts using Twitter data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Paul et al., 2014</ref>), predicting betrayal in online strategy games <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Niculae et al., 2015)</ref> and predict- ing changes to a knowledge-graph based on events mentioned in text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Konovalov et al., 2017</ref>). These methods typically require historical data for fitting model parameters, and may be sensitive to issues such as concept drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fung, 2014)</ref>. In contrast, our approach does not rely on historical data for training; instead we forecast outcomes of future events by directly extracting users' explicit predic- tions from text.</p><p>Prior work has also demonstrated that user sentiment online directly correlates with vari- ous real-world time series, including polling data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(O'Connor et al., 2010)</ref> and movie revenues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Mishne and Glance, 2006</ref>). In this paper, we em- pirically demonstrate that veridicality can often be more predictive than sentiment (Section 4.1).</p><p>Also related is prior work on detecting veridi- cality (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Marneffe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Søgaard et al., 2015</ref>) and sarcasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(González-Ibánez et al., 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Soni et al. (2014)</ref> investigate how journalists frame quoted content on Twitter using predicates such as think, claim or admit. In contrast, our system TwiVer, focuses on the author's belief toward a claim and direct predictions of future events as op- posed to quoted content.</p><p>Our approach, which aggregates predictions ex- tracted from user-generated text is related to prior work that leverages explicit, positive veridicality, statements to make inferences about users' demo- graphics. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Coppersmith et al. (2014;</ref> exploit users' self-reported statements of di- agnosis on Twitter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Measuring the Veridicality of Users' Predictions</head><p>The first step of our approach is to extract state- ments that make explicit predictions about un- known outcomes of future events. We focus specifically on contests which we define as events planned to occur on a specific date, where a num- ber of contenders compete and a single winner is chosen. For example,  To explore the accuracy of user predictions in social media, we gathered a corpus of tweets that mention events belonging to one of the 10 types listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. Relevant messages were col- lected by formulating queries to the Twitter search interface that include the name of a contender for a given contest in conjunction with the keyword win. We restricted the time range of the queries to retrieve only messages written before the time of the contest to ensure that outcomes were un- known when the tweets were written. We include 10 days of data before the event for the presiden- tial primaries and the final presidential elections, 7 days for the Oscars, Ballon d'Or and Indian gen- eral elections, and the period between the semi- finals and the finals for the sporting events. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Ta- ble 3</ref> shows several example queries to the Twitter search interface which were used to gather data. We automatically generated queries, using tem- plates, for events scraped from various websites: 483 queries were generated for the presidential primaries based on events scraped from ballotpe- <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Example of one item to be annotated, as displayed to the Turkers. dia 2 , 176 queries were generated for the Oscars, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> 18 for Ballon d'Or, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> 162 for the Eurovision con- test, 5 52 for Tennis Grand Slams, <ref type="bibr">6</ref> 6 for the Rugby World Cup, <ref type="bibr">7</ref> 18 for the Cricket World Cup, 8 12 for the Football World Cup, 9 76 for the 2016 US pres- idential elections, <ref type="bibr">10</ref> and 68 queries for the 2014 Indian general elections. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> We added an event prefix (e.g., "Oscars" or the state for presidential primaries), a keyword ("win"), and the relevant date range for the event. For example, "Oscars Leonardo DiCaprio win since:2016-2-22 until:2016-2-28" would be the query generated for the first entry in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.  We restricted the data to English tweets only, as tagged by langid.py <ref type="bibr">(Lui and Baldwin, 2012)</ref>. Jaccard similarity was computed between mes- sages to identify and remove duplicates. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We re- moved URLs and preserved only tweets that men- tion contenders in the text. This automatic post- processing left us with 57,711 tweets for all win- ners and 55,558 tweets for losers (contenders who did not win) across all events. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> gives the data distribution across event categories.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Mechanical Turk Annotation</head><p>We obtained veridicality annotations on a sample of the data using Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each tweet, we asked Turkers to judge veridical- ity toward a candidate winning as expressed in the tweet as well as the author's desire toward the event. For veridicality, we asked Turkers to rate whether the author believes the event will happen on a 1-5 scale ("Definitely Yes", "Probably Yes", "Uncertain about the outcome", "Probably No", "Definitely No"). We also added a question about the author's desire toward the event to make clear the difference between veridicality and desire. For example, "I really want Leonardo to win at the Os- cars!" asserts the author's desire toward Leonardo winning, but remains agnostic about the likelihood of this outcome, whereas "Leonardo DiCaprio will win the Oscars" is predicting with confidence that the event will happen. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the annotation interface pre- sented to Turkers. Each HIT contained 10 tweets to be annotated. We gathered annotations for 1, 841 tweets for winners and 1, 702 tweets for losers, giving us a total of 3, 543 tweets. We paid $0.30 per HIT. The total cost for our dataset was $1,000. Each tweet was annotated by 7 Turkers. We used MACE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hovy et al., 2013</ref>) to resolve dif- ferences between annotators and produce a single gold label for each tweet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 2a and 2c</ref> show heatmaps of the distri- bution of annotations for the winners for the Os- cars in addition to all categories. In both instances, most of the data is annotated with "Definitely Yes" and "Probably Yes" labels for veridicality. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ures 2b and 2d</ref> show that the distribution is more diverse for the losers. Such distributions indicate that the veridicality of crowds' statements could indeed be predictive of outcomes. We provide ad- ditional evidence for this hypothesis using auto- matic veridicality classification on larger datasets in §4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Veridicality Classifier</head><p>The goal of our system, TwiVer, is to automate the annotation process by predicting how veridical a tweet is toward a candidate winning a contest: is the candidate deemed to be winning, or is the author uncertain? For the purpose of our experi- ments, we collapsed the five labels for veridicality into three: positive veridicality ("Definitely Yes" and "Probably Yes"), neutral ("Uncertain about the outcome") and negative veridicality ("Defi- nitely No" and "Probably No").</p><p>We model the conditional distribution over a tweet's veridicality toward a candidate c winning a contest against a set of opponents, O, using a log-linear model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (y = v|c, tweet) ∝ exp (θ v · f (c, O, tweet))</formula><p>where v is the veridicality (positive, negative or neutral).</p><p>To extract features f (c, O, tweet), we first pre- processed tweets retrieved for a specific event to identify named entities, using ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ritter et al., 2011</ref>)'s Twitter NER system. Candidate (c) and opponent entities were identified in the tweet as follows: -TARGET (t). A target is a named entity that matches a contender name from our queries. -OPPONENT (O). For every event, along with the current TARGET entity, we also keep track of other contenders for the same event. If a named entity in the tweet matches with one of other contenders, it is labeled as opponent. -ENTITY (e): Any named entity which does not match the list of contenders.     losers for the Oscars, is re-tagged as OPPONENT. These tags provide information about the position of named entities relative to each other, which is used in the features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Features</head><p>We use five feature templates: context words, dis- tance between entities, presence of punctuation, dependency paths, and negated keyword. Target and opponent contexts. For every TAR- GET (t) and OPPONENT (o ∈ O) entities in the tweet, we extract context words in a window of one to four words to the left and right of the TAR- GET ("Target context") and OPPONENT ("Oppo- nent context"), e.g., t will win, I'm going with t, o will win. Keyword context. For target and opponent enti- ties, we also extract words between the entity and our specified keyword (k) (win in our case): t pre- dicted to k, o might k. Pair context. For the election type of events, in which two target entities are present (contender and state. e.g., Clinton, Ohio), we extract words between these two entities: e.g., t 1 will win t 2 . Distance to keyword. We also compute the dis- tance of TARGET and OPPONENT entities to the keyword.</p><p>Punctuation. We introduce two binary features for the presence of exclamation marks and ques- tion marks in the tweet. We also have features which check whether a tweet ends with an excla- mation mark, a question mark or a period. Punc- tuation, especially question marks, could indicate how certain authors are of their claims.</p><p>Dependency paths. We retrieve dependency paths between the two TARGET entities and be- tween the TARGET and keyword (win) using the TweeboParser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kong et al., 2014</ref>) after applying rules to normalize paths in the tree (e.g., "doesn't" → "does not").</p><p>Negated keyword. We check whether the keyword is negated (e.g., "not win", "never win"), using the normalized dependency paths.</p><p>We randomly divided the annotated tweets into a training set of 2,480 tweets, a development set of 354 tweets and a test set of 709 tweets. MAP parameters were fit using LBFGS-B ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zhu et al., 1997)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> provides examples of high-weight features for positive and negative veridicality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Evaluation</head><p>We evaluated TwiVer's precision and recall on our held-out test set of 709 tweets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> shows the precision/recall curve for positive veridicality. By setting a threshold on the probability score to be greater than 0.64, we achieve a precision of  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Some high-weight features for positive and negative veridicality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Performance on held-out event types</head><p>To assess the robustness of the veridicality classi- fier when applied to new types of events, we com- pared its performance when trained on all events vs. holding out one category for testing. Ta- ble 9 shows the comparison: the second and third columns give F1 score when training on all events vs. removing tweets related to the category we are testing on. In most cases we see a relatively mod- est drop in performance after holding out training data from the target event category, with the ex- ception of elections. This suggests our approach can be applied to new event types without requir- ing in-domain training data for the veridicality classifier. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 7</ref> shows some examples which TwiVer in- correctly classifies. These errors indicate that even though shallow features and dependency paths do a decent job at predicting veridicality, deeper text understanding is needed for some cases. The op- position between "the heart . . . the mind" in the first example is not trivial to capture. Paying atten- tion to matrix clauses might be important too (as shown in the last tweet "There is no doubt . . . ").</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Forecasting Contest Outcomes</head><p>We now have access to a classifier that can au- tomatically detect positive veridicality predictions about a candidate winning a contest. This enables us to evaluate the accuracy of the crowd's wis- dom by retrospectively comparing popular beliefs (as extracted and aggregated by TwiVer) against known outcomes of contests. We will do this for each award category (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Film and Best Director) in the Oscars from 2009 -2016, for every state for both Republican and Democratic parties in the 2016 US primaries, for both the candidates in ev- ery state for the final 2016 US presidential elec- tions, for every country in the finals of Eurovi- sion song contest, for every contender for the Bal- lon d'Or award, for every party in every state for the 2014 Indian general elections, and for the con- tenders in the finals for all sporting events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Prediction</head><p>A simple voting mechanism is used to predict con- test outcomes: we collect tweets about each con- tender written before the date of the event, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and use TwiVer to measure the veridicality of users' predictions toward the events. Then, for each con- tender, we count the number of tweets that are la- beled as positive with a confidence above 0.64, as well as the number of tweets with positive veridi- cality for all other contenders. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 11</ref> illustrates these counts for one contest, the Oscars Best Ac- tress in 2014.</p><p>We then compute a simple prediction score, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">score = (|T c | + 1)/(|T c | + |T O | + 2) (1) Event Veridicality Sentiment Frequency #predictions P R F1 P R F1 P R F1</formula><p>Oscars 80.6 80.6 80.6 52.9 87.1 63.5 54.7 93.5 69.0 151 Ballon d'Or 100.0 100.0 100.0 85.7 100.0 92.2 85.7 100.0 92.2 18 Eurovision 83.3 71.4 76.8 38.5 71.4 50.0 50.0 57.1 53.3 87 Tennis Grand Slam 50.0 100.0 66.6 50.0 100.0 66.6 50.0 100.0 66.6 52 Rugby World Cup 100.0 100.0 100.0 50.0 100.0 66.6 50.0 100.0 66.  where |T c | is the set of tweets mentioning positive veridicality predictions toward candidate c, and |T O | is the set of all tweets predicting any oppo- nent will win.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Sentiment Baseline</head><p>We compare the performance of our approach against a state-of-the-art sentiment baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Mohammad et al., 2013)</ref>. Prior work on social media analysis used sentiment to make predictions about real-world outcomes. We use a re-implementation of (Mohammad et al., 2013)'s system 14 to estimate sentiment for tweets in our corpus. We run the tweets obtained for every contender through the sentiment analysis system to obtain a count of positive labels. Senti- ment scores are computed analogously to veridi- cality using Equation (1). For each contest, the contender with the highest sentiment prediction <ref type="bibr">14</ref> https://github.com/ntietz/tweetment score is predicted as the winner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Frequency Baseline</head><p>We also compare our approach against a simple frequency (tweet volume) baseline. For every con- tender, we compute the number of tweets that has been retrieved. Frequency scores are computed in the same way as for veridicality and sentiment us- ing Equation (1). For every contest, the contender with the highest frequency score is selected to be the winner. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 8</ref> gives the precision, recall and max-F1 scores for veridicality, sentiment and volume- based forecasts on all the contests. The veridicality-based approach outperforms senti- ment and volume-based approaches on 9 of the 10 events considered. For the Tennis Grand Slam, the three approaches perform poorly. The differ- ence in performance for the veridicality approach is quite lower for the Tennis events than for the other events. It is well known however that win- ners of tennis tournaments are very hard to predict.   of the match are decisive, and even professionals have a difficult time predicting tennis winners. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref> shows the 10 top predictions made by the veridicality and sentiment-based systems on two of the events we considered -the Oscars and the presidential primaries, highlighting correct predictions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Surprise Outcomes</head><p>In addition to providing a general method for fore- casting contest outcomes, our approach based on veridicality allows us to perform several novel analyses including retrospectively identifying sur- prise outcomes that were unexpected according to popular beliefs.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>, we see that the veridicality-based approach incorrectly predicts The Revenant as winning Best Film in 2016. This makes sense, because the film was widely expected to win at the time, according to popular belief. Numerous sources in the press, 15,16,17 qualify The Revenant not winning an Oscar as a big surprise.</p><p>Similarly, for the primaries, the two incorrect predictions made by the veridicality-based ap- proach were surprise losses.

For a given account, we can collect tweets about past contests, and ex- tract those which exhibit positive veridicality to- ward the outcome, then simply count how often User account Accuracy(%) User account Accuracy(%)</p><p>User 1 100 (out of 6) twitreporting 100 (out of 3) Cr7Prince4ever 100 (out of 6) User 3 100 (out of 3) goal ghana 100 (out of 4) Naijawhatsup 100 (out of 3) User 2 100 (out of 4) 1Mrfutball 90 (out of 10) breakingnewsnig 100 (out of 4) User 4 77 (out of 13) <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 12</ref>: List of users sorted by how accurate they were in their Ballon d'Or predictions.</p><p>the accounts were correct in their predictions.</p><p>As proof of concept, we retrieved within our dataset, the user names of accounts whose tweets about Ballon d'Or contests were classified as hav- ing positive veridicality. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 12</ref> gives accounts that made the largest number of correct predictions for Ballon d'Or awards between 2010 to 2016, sorted by users' prediction accuracy. Usernames of non-public figures are anonymized (as user 1, etc.) in the table. We did not extract more data for these users: we only look at the data we had already retrieved. Some users might not make pre- dictions for all contests, which span 7 years.</p><p>Accounts like "goal ghana", "breakingnews- nig" and "1Mrfutball", which are automatically identified by our analysis, are known to post tweets predominantly about soccer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we presented TwiVer, a veridicality classifier for tweets which is able to ascertain the degree of veridicality toward future contests. We showed that veridical statements on Twitter pro- vide a strong predictive signal for winners on dif- ferent types of events, and that our veridicality- based approach outperforms a sentiment and fre- quency baseline for predicting winners. Further- more, our approach is able to retrospectively iden- tify surprise outcomes. We also showed how our approach enables an intuitive yet novel method for evaluating the reliability of information sources.</p><p>An experiment in text regression.
