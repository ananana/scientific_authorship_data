				<p>We study the problem of identifying individuals based on their characteristic gaze patterns during reading of arbitrary text. The motivation for this problem is an unobtrusive biomet-ric setting in which a user is observed during access to a document, but no specific challenge protocol requiring the user&apos;s time and attention is carried out. Existing models of individual differences in gaze control during reading are either based on simple aggregate features of eye movements, or rely on paramet-ric density models to describe, for instance, saccade amplitudes or word fixation durations. We develop flexible semiparametric models of eye movements during reading in which densities are inferred under a Gaussian process prior centered at a parametric distribution family that is expected to approximate the true distribution well.</p>

Eye movements are driven both by low-level visual cues and high-level linguistic and cognitive processes related to text understanding; as a reflection of the interplay between vision, cog- nition, and motor control during reading they are frequently studied in cognitive psychology ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kliegl et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rayner, 1998)</ref>. Computational mod- els ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Engbert et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reichle et al., 1998</ref>) as well as models based on machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Matties and Søgaard, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hara et al., 2012</ref>) have been devel- oped to study how gaze patterns arise based on text content and structure, facilitating the understanding of human reading processes.</p><p>A central observation in these and earlier psycho- logical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Huey, 1908;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dixon, 1951)</ref> is that eye movement patterns strongly differ between individu- als. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Holland et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref> have developed models of individual differences in eye movement patterns during reading, and studied these models in a biometric problem setting where an individual has to be identified based on observing her eye movement patterns while reading arbitrary text. Using eye movements during reading as a bio- metric feature has the advantage that it suffices to observe a user during a routine access to a device or document, without requiring the user to react to a specific challenge protocol. If the observed eye movement sequence is unlikely to be generated by an authorized individual, access can be terminated or an additional verification requested. This is in con- trast to approaches where biometric identification is based on eye movements in response to an artificial visual stimulus, for example a moving ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kasprowski and Ober, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Komogortsev et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rigas et al., 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang and Juhola, 2012</ref>) or fixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bednarik et al., 2005</ref>) dot on a computer screen, or a specific image stimulus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rigas et al., 2012a</ref>).</p><p>The model studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Holland &amp; Komogortsev (2012)</ref> uses aggregate features (such as average fixation duration) of the observed eye movements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref> showed that readers can be identified more accurately with a model that cap- tures aspects of individual-specific distributions over eye movements, such as the distribution over fixa- tion durations or saccade amplitudes for word refix- ations, regressions, or next-word movements. Some of these distributions need to be estimated from very few observations; a key challenge is thus to design models that are flexible enough to capture character- istic differences between readers yet robust to sparse data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref> used a fully paramet- ric approach where all densities are assumed to be in the gamma family; gamma distributions were shown to approximate the true distribution of interest well for most cases (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>). This model is robust to sparse data, but might not be flexible enough to capture all differences between readers.</p><p>The model we study in this paper follows ideas developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref>, but em- ploys more flexible semiparametric density models. Specifically, we place a Gaussian process prior over densities that concentrates probability mass on den- sities that are close to the gamma family. Given data, a posterior distribution over densities is de- rived. If data is sparse, the posterior will still be sharply peaked around distributions in the gamma family, reducing the effective capacity of the model and minimizing overfitting. However, given enough evidence in the data, the model will also deviate from the gamma-centered prior-depending on the kernel function chosen for the GP prior, any density function can in principle be represented. Integrating over the space of densities weighted by the posterior yields a marginal likelihood for novel observations from which predictions are inferred. We empirically study this model in the same setting as studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref>, but using an order of mag- nitude more individuals. Identification error is re- duced by more than a factor of three compared to the state of the art.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After defining the problem setting in Section 2, Section 3 presents the semiparametric probabilis- tic model. Section 4 discusses inference, Section 5 presents an empirical study on reader identification.</p></div>

Here, r is a variable indicating the reader generating the sequence, and Γ is a true but unknown model that defines all reader-specific distributions.

At test time, we observe novel eye movement patterns ¯ S = { ¯ S 1 , . . . , ¯ S m } on a novel set of texts ¯ X = { ¯ X 1 , . . . , ¯ X m } generated by an unknown reader r ∈ R. We assume a uniform prior over readers, that is, each r ∈ R is equally likely to be observed at test time. The goal is to infer the most likely reader to have generated the novel eye move- ment patterns. In a Bayesian setting, this means in- ferring the most likely reader given the training ob- servations (X , S (1:R) ) and test observation ( ¯ X , ¯ S):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r * = arg max r∈R p(r| ¯ X , ¯ S, X , S (1:R) ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We can rewrite Equation 2 to</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">r * = arg max r∈R p( ¯ S|r, ¯ X , X , S (1:R) ) (3) = arg max r∈R p( ¯ S|r, ¯ X , Γ)p(Γ|X , S (1:R) )dΓ = arg max r∈R p( ¯ S| ¯ X , γ r )p(γ r |X , S (r) )dγ r (4)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p( ¯ S| ¯ X , γ r ) = m i=1 p( ¯ S i | ¯ X i , γ r )<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">p(γ r |X , S (r) ) ∝ p(γ r ) n i=1 p(S (r) i |X i , γ r ).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In Equation 3 we exploit that readers are uniformly chosen at test time, and in Equation 4 we exploit the factorization p(Γ) = R r=1 p(γ r ) of the prior, which together with Equation 1 entails a factoriza- tion p(Γ|X , S (1:R) ) = R r=1 p(γ r |X , S (r) ) of the posterior. Note that Equation 4 states that at test time we predict the reader r for which the marginal likelihood (that is, after integrating out the reader- specific model γ r ) of the test observations is high- est. The next section discusses the reader-specific models p(S|X, γ r ) and prior distributions p(γ r ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Probabilistic Model</head><p>The probabilistic model we employ follows the gen- eral structure proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref>, but employs semiparametric density models and al- lows for fully Bayesian inference. To reduce nota- tional clutter, let γ ∈ {γ 1 , . . . , γ R } denote a par- ticular reader-specific model, and let X ∈ X de- note a text. An eye movement pattern is a sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S = ((s 1 , d 1 ), . . . , (s T , d T )</formula><p>) of gaze fixations, con- sisting of a fixation position s t (position in text that was fixated) and duration d t ∈ R (length of fixation in milliseconds). In our experiments, individual sen- tences are presented in a single line on screen, thus we only model a horizontal gaze position s t ∈ R. We model p(S|X, γ) as a dynamic process that suc- cessively generates fixation positions s t and dura- tions d t in S, reflecting how a reader generates a se- quence of saccades in response to a text stimulus X:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p(S|X, γ) = p(s 1 , d 1 |X, γ) T t=2 p(s t , d t |s t−1 , X, γ),</formula><p>where p(s t , d t |s t−1 , X, γ) models the generation of the next fixation position and duration given the old fixation position s t−1 . In the psychological litera- ture, four different saccade types are distinguished: a reader can refixate the current word (refixation), fixate the next word in the text (next word move- ment), move the fixation to a word after the next word, that is, skip one or more words (forward skip), or regress to fixate a word occurring earlier in the text (regression), see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Heister et al. (2012)</ref>. We observe empirically that for each saccade type, there is a characteristic distribution over saccade am- plitudes and fixation durations, and that both ap- proximately follow gamma distributions-see    ure 1. We therefore model p(s t , d t |s t−1 , X, γ) us- ing a mixture over distributions for the four different saccade types. At each time t, the model first draws a saccade type u t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, and then draws a saccade amplitude a t and fixation duration d t from type-specific distributions p(a|u t , s t−1 , X, γ) and p(d|u t , γ). More formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u t ∼ p(u|π) (7) a t ∼ p(a|u t , s t−1 , X, α) (8) d t ∼ p(d|u t , δ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where γ = (π, α, δ) is decomposed into compo- nents π, α, and δ. Afterwards, the model updates the fixation position according to s t = s t−1 + a t , concluding the definition of p(s t , d t |s t−1 , X, γ). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a slice in the dynamical model. The distribution p(u|π) over saccade types (Equation 7) is multinomial with parameter vector π ∈ R 4 . The distributions over amplitudes and du- rations (Equations 8 and 9) are modeled semipara- metrically as discussed in the following subsections.</p></div>

Finally, the distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">p(s 1 |X, α) = α 0 (s 1 )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>over the initial fixation position is given by another density function α 0 . The variables µ, α 0 , α 1 , ¯ α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , and α 4 are aggregated into model compo- nent α. For resolving the most likely reader at test time (Equation 4), densities in α will be integrated out under a prior based on Gaussian processes (Sec- tion 3.3) using MCMC inference (Section 4).</p><p>Given the old fixation position s t−1 , the text X, and the chosen saccade type u t , the amplitude is constrained to fall within a specific interval. For in- stance, for a refixation the amplitude has to be cho- sen such that the novel fixation position lies within the beginning and the end of the currently fixated word; a regression implies an amplitude that is neg- ative and makes the novel fixation position lie be- fore the beginning of the currently fixated word.</p><p>These constraints imposed by the text structure de- fine the conditional distribution p(a|u t , s t−1 , X, α).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Prior Distributions</head><p>The prior distribution over the entire model γ fac- torizes over the model components as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">p(γ|λ, ρ, κ) = (22) p(π|λ)p(µ|ρ)p(¯ α 1 |κ) 4 i=0 p(α i |κ) 4 i=0 p(δ i |κ)</formula><p>where p(π) = Dir(π|λ) is a symmetric Dirich- let prior and p(µ) = Beta(µ|ρ) is a Beta prior.</p><p>The key challenge is to develop appropriate pri- ors for the densities defining saccade amplitude (p(¯ α 1 |κ), p(α i |κ)) and fixation duration (p(δ i |κ)) distributions. Empirically, we observe that ampli- tude and duration distributions tend to be close to gamma distributions-see the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. Our goal is to exploit the prior knowledge that distributions tend to be closely approximated by gamma distributions, but allow the model to devi- ate from the gamma assumption in case there is enough evidence in the data. To this end, we de- fine a prior over densities that concentrates probabil- ity mass around the gamma family. For all densities f ∈ {¯ α 1 , α 0 , ..., α 4 , δ 0 , ..., δ 4 }, we employ identical prior distributions p(f |κ). Intuitively, the prior is given by first drawing a density function from the gamma family and then drawing the final density from a Gaussian process (with covariance function κ) centered at this function. More formally, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">G(x|η) = exp(η T u(x)) exp(η T u(x ))dx<label>(23)</label></formula><p>denote the gamma distribution in exponential family form, with sufficient statistics u(x) = (log(x), x) T and parameters η = (η 1 , η 2 ). Let p(η) denote a prior over the gamma parameters, and define</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">p(f |κ) = p(η)p(f |η, κ)dη<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where p(f |η, κ) is given by drawing</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">g ∼ GP(0, κ)<label>(25)</label></formula><p>from a Gaussian process prior GP(0, κ) with mean zero and covariance function κ, and letting</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">f (x) = exp(η T u(x) + g(x)) exp(η T u(x ) + g(x ))dx .<label>(26)</label></formula><p>Note that decreasing the variance of the Gaussian process means regularizing g(x) towards zero, and therefore Equation 26 towards Equation 23. This concludes the specification of the prior p(γ|λ, ρ, κ). The density model defined by Equations 24 to 26 draws on ideas from the large body of literature on GP-based density estimation, for example by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Leonard (1978)</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tokdar et al.

However, note that existing density estimation approaches are not applicable off- the-shelf as in our domain distributions are truncated differently at each observation due to constraints that arise from the way eye movements interact with the text structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Equations 16 to 19</ref>).</p></div>

We obtain samples from the posterior given by Equation 28 from a Metropolis-Hastings sampler that explores the space of densities f : R → R, generating density samples f (1) , ..., f <ref type="bibr">(K)</ref> . A density f is given by a combination of gamma parameters η ∈ R 2 and function g : R → R; specifically, f is obtained by multiplying the gamma distribution with parameters η by exp(g) and normalizing appropri- ately (Equation 26). During sampling, we explicitly represent a density sample f (k) by its gamma param- eters η (k) and function g <ref type="bibr">(k)</ref> . The proposal distribu- tion of the Metropolis-Hastings sampler is</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">q(η (k+1) , g (k+1) |η (k) , g (k) ) = p(g (k+1) |κ)N (η (k+1) |η (k) , σ 2 I)</formula><p>where p(g (k+1) |κ) is the probability of g (k+1) ac- cording to the GP prior GP(0, κ) (Equation 25), and N (η (k+1) |η (k) , σ 2 I) is a symmetric proposal that randomly perturbs the old state η (k) accord- ing to a Gaussian. In every iteration k a proposal η , g ∼ q(η, g|η (k) , g <ref type="bibr">(k)</ref> ) is drawn based on the old state (η (k) , g <ref type="bibr">(k)</ref> ). The acceptance probability is A(η , g |η (k) , g (k) ) = min(1, Q) with</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">Q = q(η (k) , g (k) |η , g )p(η )p(g |κ)p(y|f , l, r) q(η , g |η (k) , g (k) )p(η (k) )p(g (k) |κ), p(y|f (k) , l, r) .</formula><p>Here, p(η ) is the prior probability of gamma pa- rameters η (Section 3.3) and p(y|f , l, r) is given by Equation 27 where f is obtained from η , g according to Equation 26. To compute the likelihood terms p(y|f (k) , l, r) (Equation 27) and also to compute the likelihood of test data under a model (Equation 5), the den- sity f : R → R needs to be evaluated. Accord- ing to Equation 26, f is represented by parame- ter vector η together with the nonparametric func- tion g : R → R. As usual when working with distributions over functions in a Gaussian process framework, the function g only needs to be repre- sented at those points for which we need to evalu- ate it. Clearly, this includes all observations of sac- cade amplitudes and fixation durations observed in the training and test set. However, we also need to evaluate the normalizer in Equation 26, and (for f ∈ {α 1 , ¯ α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , α 4 }) the additional normalizer required when truncating the distribution (see Equa- tion 15). As these integrals are one-dimensional, they can be solved relatively accurately using nu- merical integration; we use 2-point Newton-Cotes quadrature. Newton-Cotes integration requires the evaluation (and thus representation) of g at an addi- tional set of equally spaced supporting points.</p><p>When the set of test observations ¯ S, ¯ X is large, the need to evaluate p( ¯ S| ¯ X , γ (k) ) for all γ k and all test observations leads to computational challenges.</p><p>In our experiments, we use a heuristic to reduce computational load. While generating samples, den- sities are only represented at the training observa- tions and the supporting points needed for Newton- Cotes integration. We then estimate the mean of the posterior byˆγbyˆ byˆγ = 1 K K k=1 γ (k) , and approximate</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">1 K K k=1 p( ¯ S| ¯ X , γ (k) ) ≈ p( ¯ S| ¯ X , ˆ γ). To evaluate p( ¯ S| ¯ X , ˆ γ)</formula><p>, we infer the approximate value of the densityˆγdensityˆ densityˆγ at a test observation by linearly interpo- lating based on the available density values at the training observations and supporting points.</p></div>

There are 144 sentences in the corpus, which we split into equally sized sets of training and test sentences. Individu- als read between 100 and 144 sentences, the training (testing) observations for one individual are the ob- servations on those sentences in the training (testing) set of sentences that the individual has read. Results are averaged over 10 random train-test splits. Each sentence is shown as a single line on the screen.</p><p>We study the semiparametric model discussed in Section 3 with MCMC inference as presented in Section 4 (denoted Semiparametric 1 ). We employ a squared exponential covariance function κ(x, x ) =</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">α exp − x−x 2 2σ 2</formula><p>, where the multiplicative con- stant α is tuned on the training data by cross- 1 An implementation is available at github.com/ abdelwahab/SemiparametricIdentification validation and the bandwidth σ is set to the av- erage distance between points in the training data. The Beta and Dirichlet parameters λ and ρ are set to one (Laplace smoothing), the prior p(η) for the Gamma parameters is uninformative. We use backoff-smoothing as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref>. We initialize the sampler with the maximum-likelihood Gamma fit and perform 10000 sampling iterations, 5000 of which are burn-in it- erations. As a baseline, we study the model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014) (Landwehr et al.)</ref> and sim- plified versions proposed by them that only use sac- cade type and amplitude <ref type="bibr">(Landwehr et al.

We also study the weighted and unweighted version of the feature- based model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Holland &amp; Komogortsev (2012)</ref> with a feature set adapted to the Potsdam Sentence Cor- pus data as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al.

(2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdulin &amp; Komogortsev (2015)</ref>) that are unfortunately not applicable in our empirical setting but might yield improved results in other scenarios. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rigas et al.

Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdulin &amp; Komogortsev (2015)</ref> only report accuracy improvements for their method in a setting where individuals have to be identified in the future based on data collected in the past (aging test), which is not the focus of our study.</p><p>We first study multiclass identification accuracy. All test observations of one particular individual constitute one test example; the task is to infer the individual that has generated these test observations. Multiclass identification accuracy is the fraction of cases in which the correct individual is identified. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows multiclass identification accuracy for all methods, including variants of Semiparametric discussed below. We observe that Semiparametric outperforms Landwehr et al., reducing the error by more than a factor of three. Consistent with results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Holland &amp; K. (unweighted)</ref> is less accurate than Landwehr et al., but more accurate than the simplified variants. We next study how the amount of data available at test time-that is, the amount of time we can observe a reader before having to make a decision-influences accuracy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3 (left)</ref> shows identification accu- racy as a function of the fraction of test data avail- able, obtained by randomly removing a fraction of sentences from the test set. We observe that iden- tification accuracy steadily improves with more test observations for all methods. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3 (right)</ref> shows identification accuracy when varying the number R of individuals that need to be distinguished.

As expected, accuracy im- proves if fewer individuals need to be distinguished. We next study a binary setting in which for each individual and each set of test observations a deci- sion has to be made whether or not the test observa- tions have been generated by that individual. This setting more closely matches typical use cases for the deployment of a biometric system. Let ¯ X de- note the text being read at test time, and let ¯ S de- note the observed eye movement sequences. Our model infers for each reader r ∈ R the marginal likelihood p( ¯ S|r, ¯ X , X , S (1:R) ) of the eye move- ment observations under the reader-specific model (Equation 3). The binary decision is made by dividing this marginal likelihood by the average marginal likelihood assigned to the observations by all reader-specific models, and comparing the result to a threshold τ . <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the fraction of false accepts as a function of false rejects as the thresh- old τ is varied, averaged over all individuals.

Finally, <ref type="bibr">Holland &amp; K. (unweighted) and Holland &amp; K. (weighted)</ref> compute a similarity measure for each combination of individual and set of test ob- servations, which we normalize and threshold anal- ogously. We observe that Semiparametric accom- plishes a false-reject rate of below 1% at virtually no false accepts; Landwehr et al. and variants tend to perform better than <ref type="bibr">Holland &amp; K. (unweighted)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Holland &amp; K. (weighted)</ref> . <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> shows the error under the curve for the experiment shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, as well as for variants of Semiparametric discussed below.</p><p>We finally study the contribution of the individual model components for saccade type, saccade am- plitude, and fixation duration (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) by re- moving the corresponding model components, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al. (2014)</ref>. By Semiparametric (TD) we denote a variant of Semiparametric in which the variable a t and the corresponding distribution is re- moved, that is, only the distribution over the sac- cade type and duration is modeled. Semiparamet- ric (TA) denotes a variant in which the variable d t and the corresponding distribution is removed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> shows identification accuracy as a func- tion of the fraction of test data available for model variants Semiparametric (TD) and Semiparametric (TA) in comparison to Semiparametric; results for these variants are also included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> shows the fraction of false accepts as a function of  false rejects in the binary classification setting dis- cussed above for these two model variants; <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> includes area under the curve results for the experi- ment shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>. We observe that accuracy is substantially reduced when removing any model component. Note that if both the amplitude and du- ration components of the model are removed, it be- comes identical to the model <ref type="bibr">Landwehr et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We have studied the problem of identifying read- ers unobtrusively during reading of arbitrary text. For fitting reader-specific distributions, we employ a Bayesian semiparametric approach that infers den- sities under a Gaussian process prior centered at the gamma family of distributions, striking a balance be- tween robustness to sparse data and modeling flex- ibility. In an empirical study with 251 individuals, the model was shown to reduce identification er- ror by more than a factor of three compared to ear- lier approaches to reader identification proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Landwehr et al.
