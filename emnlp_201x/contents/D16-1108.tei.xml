			<abstract>
				<p>This work investigates style and topic aspects of language in online communities: looking at both utility as an identifier of the community and correlation with community reception of content. Style is characterized using a hybrid word and part-of-speech tag n-gram language model, while topic is represented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experiments with several Reddit forums show that style is a better indicator of community identity than topic, even for communities organized around specific topics. Further, there is a positive correlation between the community reception to a contribution and the style similarity to that community, but not so for topic similarity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Online discussion forums provide a rich source of data for studying people's language usage patterns. Discussion platforms take on various forms: arti- cles on many news sites have a comment section, many websites are dedicated to question answer- ing (www.quora.com), and other platforms let users share personal stories, news, and random dis- coveries (www.reddit.com). Like their offline counterparts, online communities are often com- prised of people with similar interests and opinions. Online communication, however, differs from in- person communication in an interesting aspect: ex- plicit and quantifiable feedback. Many discussion forums give their users the ability to upvote and/or downvote content posted by another user. These ex- plicit reward/penalty labels provide valuable infor- mation on the reaction of users in a community. In this work, we take advantage of the available user response to explore the relationship between com- munity reception and the degree of stylistic/topical coherence to such communities. Using hybrid n- grams and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models to represent style and topic for a series of classification tasks, we confirm that there exists a community language style, which is not simply char- acterized by the topics that online communities are organized around. Moreover, we show that language style is better at discriminating communities, espe- cially between different communities that happen to discuss similar issues. In addition, we found a posi- tive, statistically significant, correlation between the community feedback to comments and their style, but interestingly not with their topic. Finally, we analyze community language on the user level and show that more successful users (in terms of positive community reception) tend to be more specialized; in other words, analogous to offline communities, it is rare for a person to be an expert in multiple areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>It is well known that conversation partners become more linguistically similar to each other as their dia- logue evolves, via many aspects such as lexical, syn- tactic, as well as acoustic characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Levitan et al., 2011</ref>). This pattern is observed even when the conversation is fictional (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011), or happening on social media (Danescu-Niculescu- Mizil et al., 2011). Regarding the language of on- line discussions in particular, it has been shown that individual users' linguistic patterns evolve to match those of the community they participate in, reaching "linguistic maturity" over time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nguyen and Rosé, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013)</ref>. In a multi-community setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tan and Lee (2015)</ref> found that users tend to explore more in different commu- nities as they mature, adopting the language of these new communities. These works have mainly fo- cused on the temporal evolution of users' language. Our work differs in that we use different language models to explore the role of topic and style, while also considering users in multiple communities. In addition, we look at community language in terms of its correlation with reception of posted content.</p><p>Other researchers have looked at the role of lan- guage in combination with other factors in Reddit community reception. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lakkaraju et al. (2013)</ref> pro- posed a community model to predict the popularity of a resubmitted content, revealing that its title plays a substantial role. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jaech et al. (2015)</ref> considered timing and a variety of language features in ranking comments for popularity, finding significant differ- ences across different communities. In our work, we focus on community language, but explore different models to account for it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Reddit is a popular forum with thousands of sub- communities known as subreddits, each of which has a specific theme. We will refer to subreddits and communities interchangeably. Redditors can submit content to initiate a discussion thread whose root text we will refer to as a post. Under each post, users can discuss the post by contributing a comment. Both posts and comments can be upvoted and downvoted, and the net feedback is referred to as karma points.</p><p>We use eight subreddits that reflect Reddit's di- verse topics, while limiting the amount of data to a reasonable size. In addition, we create an artificial distractor merged others that serves as an open class in our classification tasks and for normalizing scores in correlation analysis. Statistics are listed in Ta- ble 1. The merged others set includes 9 other sub- reddits that are similar in size and content diversity to the previous ones: books, chicago, nyc, seattle, explainlikeimfive, science, running, nfl, and today- ilearned. Among these extra subreddits, the small- est in size is nyc (1.5M tokens, 76K comments), and subreddit # posts # cmts % k ≤ 0 askmen 4.5K the largest is todayilearned (88M tokens, 5M com- ments). All data is from the period between January 1, 2014 and January 31, 2015. In each subreddit, 20% of the threads are held out for testing.</p><p>We use discussion threads with at least 100 com- ments, hypothesizing that smaller threads will not elicit enough community personality for our study.</p><p>(Virtually all threads kept had only upvotes.) For training our models, we also exclude individual comments with non-positive karma (k ≤ 0) in or- der to learn only from content that is less likely to be downvoted by the Reddit communities; percent- ages are noted in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Models</head><p>We wish to characterize community language via style and topic. For modeling style, a popular ap- proach has been combining the selected words with part-of-speech (POS) tags to construct models for genre detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Stamatatos et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Feldman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bergsma et al., 2012</ref>) and data selec- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Iyer and Ostendorf, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Axelrod, 2014)</ref>. For topic, a common approach is Latent Dirichlet Allo- cation (LDA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003</ref>). We follow such approaches in our work, acknowledging the chal- lenge of completely separating style/genre and topic factors raised previously ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Iyer and Ostendorf, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sarawgi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Petrenz and Webber, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Axelrod, 2014</ref>), which also comes out in our analysis. Generative language models are used for character- izing both style and topic, since they are well suited to handling texts of widely varying lengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Representing Style</head><p>Replacing words with POS tags reduces the possi- bility that the style model is learning topic, but re-placing too many words loses useful community jar- gon. To explore this tradeoff, we compared four tri- gram language models representing different uses of words vs. POS tags in the vocabulary:</p><p>• word_only: a regular token-based language model (vocabulary: 156K words) • hyb-15k: a hybrid word-POS language model over a vocabulary of 15K most frequent words across all communities in our data; all other words are converted to POS tags (vocabulary: 15K words + 38 tags) • hyb-500.30: a hybrid word-POS language model over a vocabulary of 500 most frequent words in a subset of data balanced across com- munities, combined with the union of the 30 next most common words from each of the 17 subred- dits; all other words are converted to POS tags (vocabulary: 854 words + 38 tags) • tag_only: a language model using only POS tags as its vocabulary (vocabulary: 38 tags) The hybrid models represent two intermediate sam- ple points between the extremes of word-only and tag-only n-grams. For the hyb-500.30 model, the mix of general and community-specific words was designed to capture distinctive community jar- gon. The general words include punctuation, func- tion words, and words that are common in many subreddits (e.g., sex, culture, see, dumb, simply). The subreddit-specific words seem to reflect both broad topical themes and jargon or style words, as in (themes vs. style/jargon): askmen: wife, single vs. whatever, interested askwomen: mom, husband vs. especially, totally askscience: particle, planet vs. basically, x fitness: exercises, muscles vs. cardio, reps, rack Tokenization and tagging are done using Stan- ford coreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Manning et al., 2014</ref>). Punctuation is separated from the words and treated as a word. All language models are trigrams trained using the SRILM toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Stolcke, 2002</ref>); modified Kneser- Ney smoothing is applied to the word_only lan- guage model, while Witten-Bell smoothing is ap- plied to the tag_only and both hybrid models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Representing Topic</head><p>We train 100-and 200-dimensional LDA topic mod- els ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003</ref>  words) and use tf-idf normalized word counts in each comment (as documents). The vocabulary con- sists of 156K words, similar to the vocabulary of the word_only language model. The topic mod- els were trained on a subset of the training data, us- ing all collected subreddits but randomly excluding roughly 15% of the training data of larger subreddits worldnews, todayilearned, and nfl.</p><p>The topics learned exhibit a combination of ones that reflect general characteristics of online discus- sions or topics that arise in many forums, some that have more specific topics, and others that do not seem particularly coherent. Topics (from LDA-100) that consistently have high probability in all subred- dits are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> with their top 10 words by frequency (normalized by the topic average). Topic 19 is likely capturing Reddit's writing conventions and formatting rules. Broadly used topics reflect women's issues <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> and news events <ref type="bibr">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr">34)</ref>.</p><p>Online communities are typically organized around a common theme, but multiple topics might fall under that theme, particularly since some of the "topics" actually reflect style. A subreddit as a whole is characterized by a distribution of topics as learned via LDA, but any particular discussion thread would not necessarily reflect the full distri- bution. Therefore, we characterize each subreddit with multiple topic vectors. Specifically, we com- pute LDA topic vectors for each discussion thread in a subreddit, and learn 50 representative topic vec- tors for each subreddit via k-means clustering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Community Classification</head><p>One method for exploring the relative importance of topic vs. style in online communication is through community classification experiments: given a dis- cussion thread (or a user's comments), can we iden-tify the community that it comes from more easily using style characteristics or topic characteristics? We formulate this task as a multi-class classification problem <ref type="bibr">(8 communities and "other")</ref>, where sam- ples are either at the discussion thread level or the user level. At the thread level, all comments (from multiple people) and the post in a discussion thread are aggregated and treated as a document to be clas- sified. At the user level, we aggregate all comments made by a user in a certain subreddit and treat the collection (which may reflect multiple topics) as a document to be classified.</p><p>We classify document d i to a subreddit according tô j = arg max j s i,j , where s i,j is a score of the sim- ilarity of d i to community j. For the style models, s i,j is the log-probability under the respective tri- gram language model of community j. For the topic model, s i,j is computed using d i 's topic vector v i as follows. For a subreddit j, we compute the cosine similarities sim j,k between v i and the subreddit's topic vectors w j,k for k = 1, . . . , 50. The final topic similarity score s i,j is the mean of the top 3 highest similarities: s i,j = (sim j, <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> +sim j, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> +sim j, <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> )/3, where [·] denotes the sorted cosine similarities' in- dices. The top-3 average captures the most promi- nent subreddit topics (as in a nearest-neighbor clas- sifier). Averaging over all 50 sim j,k is ill suited to subreddits with broad topic coverage, and leads to poor classification results. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarizes the community classification results (as average accuracy across all subreddits) for each model described in Section 4. While all models beat the random baseline of 11%, the poor performance of the tag_only model confirms that POS tags alone are insufficient to characterize the community. Both for classifying threads and au- thors, hyb-500.30 yields the best average classi- fication accuracy, due to its ability to generalize POS structure while covering sufficient lexical content to capture the community's jargon and key topical themes. Neither topic model beats hyb-500.30, indicating that topic alone is not discriminative enough for community identification, even though specific communities coalesce around certain com- mon topics. The word_only and hyb-15k mod- els have performance on the threads that is similar to the topic models, since word features are sensitive to topic, as shown in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Petrenz and Webber, 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>by thread by author random 11.1% 11.1% word only 68.9% 46.8% tags only 27.6% 18.8% hyb-15k 69.4% 46.6% hyb-500. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> 86.5% 51.0% topic-100 71.1% 27.5% topic-200 69.6% 27.7% <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Average accuracy for classifying by posts and authors</p><p>Classifying authors is harder than classifying threads. Two factors are likely to contribute. First, treating a whole discussion thread as a document yields more data to base the decision on than a col- lection of author comments, since there are many authors who only post a few comments. Second, au- thors that have multi-community involvement may be less adapted to a specific community. The fact that word-based style models outperform topic mod- els may be because the comments are from different threads so not matching typical topic distributions.</p><p>Subreddit confusion statistics indicate that cer- tain communities are easier to identify than others. Both style and topic models do well in recognizing askscience: classification accuracy for threads is as much as 97%. Communities that were most confus- able are intuitively similar: politics and worldnews, askmen and askwomen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Community Feedback Correlation</head><p>In this section, we investigate whether the style and/or topic scores of a discussion or user are cor- related with community response. For thread-level feedback, we use karma points of the discussion thread itself; for the user-level feedback, we com- pute each user's subreddit-dependent k-index ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jaech et al., 2015)</ref>, defined similarly to the well-known h- index <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hirsch, 2005)</ref>. Specifically, a user's k-index k j in subreddit j is the maximum integer k such that the user has at least k comments with karma greater than k in that subreddit. User k-index scores have Zipfian distribution, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for the worldnews subreddit.</p><p>We compute a normalized community similarity score˜sscore˜ score˜s i,j = s i,j − s i,m , where s i,m is the corre- sponding score from the subreddit merged others. The correlation betweeñ s i,j and community feed- back is reported for three models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> for the    thread level, and in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> for the user level. On the thread level, the hyb-500.30 style model consis- tently finds positive, statistically significant, correla- tion between the post's stylistic similarity score and its karma. This result suggests that language style adaptation does contribute to being well-received by the community. None of the other models ex- plored in the previous section had this property, and for the topic models the correlation is mostly neg- ative. On the user level, all correlations between a user's k-index and their style/topic match are statis- tically significant, though the hyb-500.30 style model shows more positive correlation than other models. In both cases, the word_only model gives results between the style and topic models. The hyb-15k model has results that are similar to the word_only model, and the tag_only model has mostly negative correlation.</p><p>Examining users' multi-community involvement, we also find that users with high k-indices tend to participate in fewer subreddits. Among relatively   active users (having at least 100 comments), those with a max k-index of at least 100 participated in a median of 3 communities, while those with a max k-index of at most 5 participated in a median of 6 subreddits. Of the 42 users with max k-index of at least 100, only 4 achieve a k-index of at least 50 in one other community, and only 6 achieve a k-index of at least 20 in one other community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we use hybrid n-grams and topic mod- els to characterize style and topic of language in on- line communities. Since communities center on a common theme, topic characteristics are reflected in language style, but we find that the best model for determining community identity uses very few words and mostly relies on POS patterns. Using Reddit's community response system (karma), we also show that discussions and users with higher community endorsement are more likely to match the language style of the community, where the lan- guage model that best classifies the community is also most correlated with community response. In addition, online users tend to have more positive community response when they specialize in fewer subreddits. These results have implications for de- tecting newcomers in a community and the popular- ity of posts, as well as for language generation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Distribution (log base 10 counts) of user k-index scores for the worldnews subreddit.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="5,91.80,57.82,187.19,156.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
