				<p>Language transfer, the characteristic second language usage patterns caused by native language interference, is investigated by Second Language Acquisition (SLA) researchers seeking to find overused and underused linguistic features. In this paper we develop and present a methodology for deriving ranked lists of such features. Using very large learner data, we show our method&apos;s ability to find relevant candidates using sophisticated linguistic features. To illustrate its applicability to SLA research, we formulate plausible language transfer hypotheses supported by current evidence. This is the first work to extend Native Language Identification to a broader linguistic interpretation of learner data and address the automatic extraction of underused features on a per-native language basis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>It has been noted in the linguistics literature since the 1950s that speakers of particular languages have characteristic production patterns when writ- ing in a second language. This language transfer phenomenon has been investigated independently in a number of fields from different perspectives, including qualitative research in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and more recently though pre- dictive computational models in NLP.</p><p>Motivated by the aim of improving foreign lan- guage teaching and learning, such analyses are of- ten done manually in SLA, and are difficult to perform for large corpora. Smaller studies yield poor results due to the sample size, leading to extreme variability <ref type="bibr">(Ellis, 2008)</ref>. Recently, re- searchers have noted that NLP has the tools to use large amounts of data to automate this analysis, using complex feature types. This has motivated studies in Native Language Identification (NLI), a subtype of text classification where the goal is to determine the native language (L1) of an author using texts they have written in a second language (L2) .</p><p>Despite the good results in predicting L1s, few attempts have been made to interpret the features that distinguish L1s. This is partly because no methods for an SLA-oriented feature analysis have been proposed; most work focuses on testing fea- ture types using standard machine learning tools.</p><p>The overarching contribution of this work is to develop a methodology that enables the transfor- mation of the NLI paradigm into SLA applications that can be used to link these features to their un- derlying linguistic causes and explanations. These candidates can then be applied in other areas such as remedial SLA strategies or error detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>SLA research aims to find distributional differ- ences in language use between L1s, often referred to as overuse, the extensive use of some linguis- tic structures, and underuse, the underutilization of particular structures, also known as avoidance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gass and Selinker, 2008)</ref>. While there have been some attempts in SLA to use computational ap- proaches on small-scale data, 1 these still use fairly elementary techniques and have several shortcom- ings, including in the manual approaches to an- notation and the computational artefacts derived from these.</p><p>Conversely, NLI work has focused on automatic learner L1 classification using Machine Learning with large-scale data and sophisticated linguistic features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tetreault et al., 2012</ref>). Here, feature ranking could be performed with relevancy meth- ods such as the F-score:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F (j) ≡ ¯ x (+) j − ¯ x j 2 + ¯ x (−) j − ¯ x j 2 1 n+−1 n+ i=1 x (+) i,j − ¯ x (+) j 2 + 1 n−−1 n− i=1 x (−) i,j − ¯ x (−) j 2 (1)</formula><p>The F-score (Fisher score) measures the ratio between the intraclass and interclass variance in the values of feature j, where x represents the fea- ture values in the negative and positive examples. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> More discriminative features have higher scores.</p><p>Another alternative method is Information Gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Yang and Pedersen, 1997</ref>). As defined in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2)</ref>, it measures the entropy gain associated with feature t in assigning the class label c.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G(t) = − m i=1 Pr (ci) log Pr (ci) + Pr (t) m i=1</formula><p>Pr (ci|t) log Pr (ci|t)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">+ Pr ( ¯ t) m i=1</formula><p>Pr (ci| ¯ t) log Pr (ci| ¯ t)</p><p>However, these methods are limited: they do not provide ranked lists per-L1 class, and more impor- tantly, they do not explicitly capture underuse.</p><p>Among the efflorescence of NLI work, a new trend explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Swanson and Charniak (2014)</ref> aims to extract lists of candidate language transfer features by comparing L2 data against the writer's L1 to find features where the L1 use is mirrored in L2 use. This allows the detection of obvious ef- fects, but Jarvis and Crossley (2012) note (p. 183) that many transfer effects are "too complex" to ob- serve in this manner. Moreover, this method is un- able to detect underuse, is only suitable for syn- tactic features, and has only been applied to very small data (4,000 sentences) over three L1s. Ad- dressing these issues is the focus of the present work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Setup</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Corpus</head><p>We use TOEFL11, the largest publicly available corpus of English L2 texts ( , containing 11 L1s with 1,100 texts each. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Features</head><p>Adaptor grammar collocations Per <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wong et al. (2012)</ref>, we utilize an adaptor grammar to discover arbitrary length n-gram collocations. We explore both the pure part-of-speech (POS) n-grams as well as the more promising mixtures of POS and function words. We derive two adaptor grammars where each is associated with a different set of vo- cabulary: either pure POS or the mixture of POS and function words. We use the grammar pro- posed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Johnson (2010)</ref> for capturing topical col- locations: Stanford dependencies We use Stanford de- pendencies as a syntactic feature: for each text we extract all the basic dependencies re- turned by the Stanford Parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">de Marneffe et al., 2006</ref>). We then generate all the variations for each of the dependencies (grammatical rela- tions) by substituting each lemma with its cor- responding POS tag. For instance, a gram- matical relation of det(knowledge, the) yields the following variations: det(NN, the), det(knowledge, DT), and det(NN, DT).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Sentence → Doc j j ∈ 1, . . . , m Doc j → j j ∈ 1, . . . , m Doc j → Doc j T opic i i ∈ 1, . . . , t; j ∈ 1, . . . , m T opic i → W ords i ∈ 1, . . . , t W ords → W ord W ords → W ords W ord W ord → w w ∈ V pos ; w ∈ V pos+f</formula><p>Lexical features Content and function words are also considered as two feature types related to learner's vocabulary and spelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Extracting Linear SVM Feature Weights</head><p>Using the extracted features, we train linear Sup- port Vector Machine (SVM) models for each L1. We use a one-vs-rest approach to find fea- tures most relevant to each native language. L2- regularization is applied to remove noisy features and reduce the size of the candidate feature list. More specifically, we employ the LIBLINEAR SVM package <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fan et al., 2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">5</ref> as it is well- suited to text classification tasks with large num- bers of features and texts as is the case here.</p><p>In training the models for each feature, the SVM weight vector <ref type="bibr">6</ref> is calculated according to <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">w = i α i y i x i<label>(3)</label></formula><p>After training, the positive and negative weights are split into two lists and ranked by weight. The positive weights represent overused features, while features whose absence (i.e. underuse) is indicative of an L1 class will have large negative weights. This yields two candidate language trans- fer feature lists per L1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>We now turn to an analysis of the output from our system to illustrate its applicability for SLA re- search. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists some elements from the un- deruse and overuse lists for various L1s. The lists are of different feature types. They have been cho- sen to demonstrate all feature types and also a va- riety of different languages. For reasons of space, only several of the top features are analysed here.</p><p>Hindi L1 writers are distinguished by certain function words including hence, thus, and etc, and a much higher usage rate of male pronouns. It has been observed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sanyal, 2007</ref>, for example) that the English spoken in India still re- tains characteristics of the English that was spoken during the time of the Raj and the East India Com- pany that have disappeared from other English va- rieties, so it sounds more formal to other speakers, or retains traces of an archaic business correspon- dence style; the features noted fit that pattern.</p><p>The second list includes content words overused by Arabic L1 learners. Analysis of content words here, and for other L1s in our data, reveals very frequent misspellings which are believed to be due to orthographic or phonetic influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tsur and Rappoport, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Odlin, 1989)</ref>. Since Arabic does not share orthography with English, we believe most of these are due to phonetics. Looking at items 1, 3 and 5 we can see a common pattern: the English letter u which has various phonetic re- alizations is being replaced by a vowel that more often represents that sound. Items 2 and 5 are also phonetically similar to the intended words.</p><p>For Spanish L1 authors we provide both under- use and overuse lists of syntactic dependencies. The top 3 overuse rules show the word that is very often used as the subject of verbs. This is almost certainly a consequence of the prominent syntac- tic role played by the Spanish word que which, de- pending on the context, is equivalent to the English words whom, who, which, and most commonly, that. The fourth rule shows they often use this as a determiner for plural nouns. A survey of the cor- pus reveals many such errors in texts of Spanish learners, e.g. this actions or this emissions. The fifth rule shows that the adjectival modifier of a plural noun is often being incorrectly pluralised to match the noun in number as would be required in Spanish, for example, differents subjects.</p><p>Turning to the underused features in Spanish L1 texts, we see that four related features rank highly, showing that these is not commonly used as a de- terminer for plural nouns and which is rarely used as a subject. The final feature shows that no is avoided as a determiner. This may be because while no mostly has the same role in Spanish as it does in English, it cannot be used as a determiner; ningún must be used instead. We hypothesize that this construction is being avoided as placing no be- fore a noun in Spanish is ungrammatical. This ex- ample demonstrates that our two list methodology can not only help identify overused structures, but also uncovers the related constructs that are being underutilized at their expense.</p><p>The final list in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> is of underused Adap- tor Grammar patterns by Chinese learners. The first three features show that these writers signif- icantly underuse determiners, here an, other and these before nouns. This is not unexpected since Chinese learners' difficulties with English articles are well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Robertson, 2000</ref>). More inter- estingly, we find underuse of features like even if and might, along with others not listed here such as could VB 7 plus many other variants related to the subjunctive mood. One explanation is that lin- guistic differences between Chinese and English in expressing counterfactuals could cause them to avoid such constructions in L2 English. Previous research in this area has linked the absence of sub- junctive linguistic structures in Chinese to differ- ent cognitive representations of the world and con- sequences for thinking counterfactually <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bloom, 2014)</ref>, although this has been disputed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Au, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Garbern Liu, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Adaptor Grammars also reveal frequent use of the "existential there" 8 in German L1 data while</p></div>

Lexical analysis also revealed Spanish-English orthographic transfer, listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. This list includes many cognates, in contrast with the Ara- bic L1 data where most misspellings were pho- netic in nature.</p><p>We also observe other patterns which remain unexplained. For instance, Chinese, Japanese and Korean speakers make excessive use of phrases such as however, first and second. One possibil- ity is that this relates to argumentation styles that are possibly influenced by cultural norms. More broadly, this effect could also be teaching rather than transfer related. For example, it may be case that a widely-used text book for learning English in Korea happens to overuse this construction.</p><p>Some recent findings from the 2013 NLI Shared Task found that L1 Hindi and Telugu learners of English had similar transfer effects and their writ- ings were difficult to distinguish. It has been posited that this is likely due to shared culture and teaching environments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Malmasi et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Despite some clearcut instances of overuse, 9 more research is required to determine the causal factors. We hope to expand on this in future work using more data. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> More than half of the Korean scripts contained a sentence-initial however.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>Using the proposed methodology, we generated lists of linguistic features overused and underused by English learners of various L1 backgrounds. Through an analysis of the top items in these ranked lists, we demonstrated the high applicabil- ity of the output by formulating plausible language transfer hypotheses supported by current evidence. We also showcased the method's generalizability to numerous linguistic feature types.</p><p>Our method's output consists of two ranked lists of linguistic features: one for overuse and the other for underuse, something which had not been addressed by research to date. We also found Adaptor Grammar collocations to be highly infor- mative for this task.</p><p>This work, an intersection of NLP, Machine Learning and SLA, illustrates how the various dis- ciplines can complement each other by bringing together theoretical, experimental and computa- tional issues. NLP provides accurate and auto- mated tagging of large corpora with sophisticated features not available in corpus linguistics, e.g. with state-of-the-art dependency parsing. Sophis- ticated machine learning techniques then enable the processing of large quantities of data (thou- sands of times the size of manual studies) in a way that will let SLA researchers explore a variety of assumptions and theoretical analyses. And con- versely, NLP can benefit from the long-term study and language acquisition insights from SLA.</p><p>In terms of NLI, this work is the first attempt to expand NLI to a broad linguistic interpretation of the data, including feature underuse. NLI systems achieve classification accuracies of over 80% on this 11-class task, leading to theoretical questions about the features that make them so effective. This work also has a backwards link in this regard by providing qualitative evidence about the under- pinning linguistic theories that make NLI work.</p><p>The work presented here has a number of ap- plications; chief among them is the development of tools for SLA researchers. This would enable them to not just provide new evidence for previ- ous findings, but to also perform semi-automated data-driven generation of new and viable hypothe- ses. This, in turn, can help reduce expert effort and involvement in the process, particularly as such studies expand to more corpora and emerging lan- guage like Chinese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Malmasi and Dras, 2014b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Arabic (Malmasi and Dras, 2014a</ref>).</p><p>The brief analysis included here represents only a tiny portion of what can be achieved with this methodology. We included but a few of the thou- sands of features revealed by this method; prac- tical SLA tools based on this would have a great impact on current research.</p><p>In addition to language transfer hypotheses, such systems could also be applied to aid devel- opment of pedagogical material within a needs- based and data-driven approach. Once language use patterns are uncovered, they can be assessed for teachability and used to create tailored, L1- specific exercises and teaching material.</p><p>From the examples discussed in Section 4 these could include highly specific and targeted student exercises to improve spelling, expand vocabulary and enrich syntactic knowledge -all relative to their mother tongue. Such exercises can not only help beginners improve their fundamental skills and redress their errors but also assist advanced learners in moving closer to near-nativeness.</p><p>The extracted features and their weights could also be used to build statistical models for gram- matical error detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Leacock et al., 2014</ref>). Contrary to the norm of developing error checkers for native writers, such models could be specifi- cally targeted towards learners or even particular L1-L2 pairs which could be useful in Computer- Assisted Language Learning (CALL) systems.</p><p>One limitation here is that our features may be corpus-dependent as they are all exam essays. This can be addressed by augmenting the data with new learner corpora, as they become available. While a strength here is that we compared each L1 against others, a paired comparison only against native texts can be insightful too.</p><p>There are several directions for future work. The first relates to clustering the data within the lists. Our intuition is that there might be coher- ent clusters of related features, with these clusters characterising typical errors or idiosyncrasies, that are predictive of a particular L1. As shown in our results, some features are highly related and may be caused by the same underlying transfer phe- nomena. For example, our list of overused syntac- tic constructs by Spanish learners includes three high ranking features related to the same transfer effect. The use of unsupervised learning meth- ods such as Bayesian mixture models may be ap- propriate here. For parse features, tree kernels could help measure similarity between the trees and fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Collins and Duffy, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Another avenue is to implement weight-based ranking methods to further refine and re-rank the lists, potentially by incorporating the measures mentioned in Section 2 to assign weights to fea- tures. As the corpus we used includes learner proficiency metadata, it may also be possible to create proficiency-segregated models to find the features that characterise errors at each language proficiency level. Finally, the use of other lin- guistic features such as Context-free Grammar phrase structure rules or Tree Substitution Gram- mars could provide additional insights.</p><p>In addition to these further technical investiga- tions, we see as a particularly useful direction the development of an SLA research tool to conduct a large SLA study with a wide range of experts. We believe that this study makes a contribution to this area and hope that it will motivate future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>w V pos contains 119 distinct POS tags based on the Brown tagset and V pos+f w is extended with 398 function words.
