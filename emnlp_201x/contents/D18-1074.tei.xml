				<p>Categorizing a patient&apos;s intentions during clinical interactions in general and within motiva-tional interviewing specifically may improve decision making in clinical treatments. Within this paper, we propose a method that models the temporal flow of a conversation and the transition between topics by using domain adaptation on a clinical dialogue corpus comprising Motivational Interviewing (MI) sessions. We deploy Bi-LSTM and topic models jointly to learn theme shifts across different time stages within these hour-long MI sessions to assess the patient&apos;s intent to change their habits or to sustain them respectively. Our experiments show promising results and improvements after considering temporality in the classification task over our baseline. This result confirms and extends related literature that has manually identified that certain phases within MI sessions are more predictive of patient outcomes than others.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Motivational Interviewing (MI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Miller and Rollnick, 2012</ref>) is a collaborative communication style used to address a variety of health problems such as alcohol and drug use. Accurately under- standing the patient's intentions to change from his/her speech during the session could greatly en- hance the efficacy of MI. Motivational Interview- ing Skill Code (MISC) is a coding system that captures client language, specifically change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Miller et al., 2008)</ref>. However, reliable MISC coding is labor-intensive and requires domain expertise. Recent computa- tional annotation methods have been proposed to automatically classify patients' behaviors within MI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xiao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pérez-Rosas et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gibson et al., 2017)</ref>. To this end, Recurrent Neu- ral Networks (RNN) that capture sequential infor- mation are applied for the classification of patient behavior.</p><p>Recent research shows that themes and words within a conversation change across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dufour et al., 2016)</ref>. Similarly within MI, topics and the patient's attitude towards their willingness to change might shift. Within this work, we investi- gate how shifts in themes across time affects per- formance of the intention classifications for the di- alogue.</p><p>Specifically, we focus on the patient intent clas- sification task and propose a method that adopts the temporal factor by domain adaptation to im- prove performance of the classifiers. We eval- uate our approach on a dataset of college alco- holism <ref type="bibr">(Carey et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Borsari et al., 2012)</ref>, containing transcripts of MI conducted with U.S. college students. Specifically, we first explore the theme shift and give a brief analysis by topic modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>. We then uti- lize Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi- LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005</ref>) to en- code utterances from both word and topic embed- dings. Next, we concatenate both contextual in- formation with the encoded utterance representa- tions. Finally, we jointly train a unified represen- tation of utterance by domain adversarial training and patient intent classification. We show that this approach can lead to improvements in classifica- tion performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Dataset</head><p>We conduct our experiments on a clinical dataset of college student alcoholism <ref type="bibr">(Carey et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Borsari et al., 2012</ref>), where we obtain 193 MI tran- scripts with a total of 83677 utterances. Each of the MI session ranged between 60 and 90 min- utes. Each client utterance was coded using the MISC. In this paper, we focus on classifying pa- tient behavior on the utterance-level. Specifically, we classify patient behavior on collapsed MISC <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Examples of utterances in Alcoholism Treatment. "I" stands for interventionist and "P" for patient. MISC codes are provided in the third column. P and I codes are coded following MISC. Change talk (CT), sustain talk (ST), and follow neutral (FN) codes are also provided. annotation codes into with three categories: "CT": Change talk indicates utterances that reflect moti- vating factors related to change; "ST": Sustain talk indicate the patient has no intentions to change; "FN": Follow neutral means there is no indica- tion of patient inclination. An example conver- sation snippet, highlighting all three sources of information is provided in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The inten- tion labels (o+3, o-3) are only available for pa- tients, whose '+' and '-' refer to change vs sus- tain talk (CT vs ST) and the number measures the "strength of client language," which represents a subjective assessment by human annotators, and the 'quo' and 'quc' refer to "open question" and "closed questions", which are only for interven- tionist (see ( <ref type="bibr">Borsari et al., 2015</ref>) for details regard- ing the coding strategy). While the MISC codes of client utterances within MISC are more complex and comprise other types of annotations, we focus on human intention modeling (i.e., CT vs. ST vs. FN) only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role</head><p>How the theme of dialogue shift overtime? We qualitatively examined how the distribution of content changes across different time stages. To measure the distribution of content, we trained a topic model with 10 topics using Gensim <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Rehůřek and Sojka, 2010</ref>) with default parameters. The data doesn't have associated timestamps, thus we empirically split each MI transcript by the number of patient utterances equally into three time stages, stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3. We calculated the proportion of each topic within the same time pe- riod by take the average of all transcripts. We then normalized the topic distributions and finally vi- sualize the extent to which distributions of the 10 topics varies by time.</p><p>We can observe the varied topic distributions across different stages of conversations, where the topic distributions are plotted from the bot- tom to the top. There are some topics have more variations, such as topic 4, and some top- ics are very stable such as topic 1 <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Recent research shows the performance of classification tasks might be impacted by the temporal charac- ter of language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Huang and Paul, 2018)</ref>. Thus, it might be desirable to model the temporality in the computational classifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model</head><p>The architecture of the proposed model is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. We feed four types of information to the model: topic-and word-level data of the utterance (content), preceding interventionist ver- bal behavior (context) and prior MISC annotations of utterances (MISC). Particularly, we empirically extracted previous 5 utterances as context and 10 previous codes as MISC 2 , where we set "unk" as the default.</p><p>Embeddings. We built two types of embed- dings, word embedding and topic embedding. We created word embeddings from Googles pre- trained Word2Vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) and cre- ated topic embeddings from a trained LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003</ref> <ref type="bibr">- vastava et al., 2014</ref>) are applied on the outputs of Bi-LSTM.

Dropouts (Sri</note><p>Joint Learning. We apply domain adversarial training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ganin et al., 2016</ref>) only on the topic in- puts from learned topic representations. Our in- tuition is that the topic distributions across differ- ent stages of the MI session could track the vari- ations of patients' intents. We empirically split the conversation into three time stages: Stage 1- 3 (i.e, beginning, middle, and end). The goal of domain adversarial training is converted to a time stage prediction task, which aims to differentiate topic themes both locally and globally. We used one-hot encoding to represent labels of the predic- tion tasks. We deploy softmax functions for both time stage and intention predictions. We use cate- gorical cross entropy to jointly optimize the train- ing process of the two classification tasks: domain classification and patient intent classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Each utterance is lowercased and tokenized by NLTK ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bird et al., 2009</ref>). We filter out the utter- ances that are shorter than 5 tokens and then re- move punctuations. Finally, we obtain 22432 pa-tient utterances. The dataset is stratified and split into training set (80%), validation set (10%) and testing set (10%), as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. We train our models on the training set and run grid search to find the optimal parameters on the validation set by the weighted F1 score. The details of optimized parameters are listed as follows. The models were trained for 15 epochs with a batch size of 64. Each utterance and its context are padded to 50 words. The utter- ance's previous MISC codes are padded to 10. We pad the sequences with an "unknown"-token. The size of LSTMs was tuned in the range of <ref type="bibr">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr">150,</ref><ref type="bibr">200]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) with a fixed learning rate of 0.001.

There are two major differences between their method and ours: first, they did not consider tempo- rality in their model, second, they did not use the previous MISC sequences as inputs. They used Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chung et al., 2014</ref>) as the RNN cell.</p><p>We use the "Co", "Ct", "MISC" to denote the utterance (content), preceding interventionist ver- bal behavior (context) and prior MISC annotations of utterances (MISC) respectively.

In addition, the contextual information ("Ct") is quite useful to identify the patients' current intentions, and the sequential information through time stages has strong indications of human intentions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance Analysis</head><p>We conducted significance analysis to compare Xiao2016 and our proposed method. Because Xiao2016 only used content and context inputs, in this analysis, we train our method with the same inputs (Co+Ct). We followed the method of boot- strap samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2012</ref>) to create 50 pairs of training and test datasets with replacement, where we keep the sizes the same in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. We keep the same experimental steps and use the parameters that achieved the best per- formances in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> to train the models.</p><p>To compare the two approaches, we conduct a paired t-test comparing the achieved F1 scores of both models. We used a two-tail test instead of one tail test used in the paper due to its increased rigor and lack of prior assumptions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dror et al., 2018)</ref>. The test reveals a significant result with t(85) = 3.084 and p = 0.00275. The result shows that we can reject the null hypothesis that our pro- posed method is not better than Xiao2016.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we focus on the temporal charac- teristics of the MI corpus and propose a simple method that models the temporal factor within a single MI session. We jointly learn the utterance representation via time stage and intention predic- tions and the proposed model improves the per- formance of the classification task. The identified intent of clients could help therapists adjust their treatment strategy. In future work, we will inves- tigate other external sources of knowledge, such as acoustic cues and videos to further improve the performance of the model.</p></div>
