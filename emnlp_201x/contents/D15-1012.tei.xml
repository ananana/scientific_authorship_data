				<p>The task of cross-language document summarization is to create a summary in a target language from documents in a different source language. Previous methods only involve direct extraction of automatically translated sentences from the original documents. Inspired by phrase-based machine translation, we propose a phrase-based model to simultaneously perform sentence scoring, extraction and compression. We design a greedy algorithm to approximately optimize the score function. Experimental results show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art extractive systems while maintaining similar grammatical quality.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of cross-language summarization is to produce a summary in a target language from documents written in a different source language. This task is particularly useful for readers to quickly get the main idea of documents written in a source language that they are not familiar with. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wan (2011)</ref>, we focus on English-to- Chinese summarization in this work.</p><p>The simplest and the most straightforward way to perform cross-language summarization is pipelining general summarization and machine translation. Such systems either translate all the documents before running generic summarization algorithms on the translated documents, or sum- marize from the original documents and then only translate the produced summary into the target lan- guage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wan (2011)</ref> show that such pipelining ap- proaches are inferior to methods that utilize in- formation from both sides. In that work, the au- thor proposes graph-based models and achieves fair amount of improvement. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work of this task tries to focus on summarization beyond pure sen- tence extraction.</p><p>On the other hand, cross-language summariza- tion can be seen as a special kind of machine trans- lation: translating the original documents into a brief summary in a different language. Inspired by phrase-based machine translation models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koehn et al., 2003)</ref>, we propose a phrase-based scoring scheme for cross-language summarization in this work.</p><p>Since our framework is based on phrases, we are not limited to produce extractive summaries. We can use the scoring scheme to perform joint sentence selection and compression. Unlike typi- cal sentence compression methods, our proposed algorithm does not require additional syntactic preprocessing such as part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing. We only utilize information from translated texts with phrase alignments. The scoring function consists of a submodular term of compressed sentences and a bounded distortion penalty term. We design a greedy procedure to efficiently get approximate solutions.</p><p>For experimental evaluation, we use the DUC2001 dataset with manually translated refer- ence Chinese summaries. Results based on the ROUGE metrics show the effectiveness of our pro- posed methods. We also conduct manual evalua- tion and the results suggest that the linguistic qual- ity of produced summaries is not decreased by too much, compared with extractive counterparts. In some cases, the grammatical smoothness can even be improved by compression.</p><p>The contributions of this paper include:</p><p>• Utilizing the phrase alignment information, we design a scoring scheme for the cross- language document summarization task.</p><p>• We design an efficient greedy algorithm to generate summaries. The greedy algorithm is partially submodular and has a provable con- stant approximation factor to the optimal so- lution up to a small constant.</p><p>• We achieve state-of-the-art results using the extractive counterpart of our compressive summarization framework. Performance in terms of ROUGE metrics can be significantly improved when simultaneously performing extraction and compression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Document summarization can be treated as a spe- cial kind of translation process: translating from a bunch of related source documents to a short tar- get summary. This analogy also holds for cross- language document summarization, with the only difference that the languages of source documents and the target summary are different.</p><p>Our design of sentence scoring function for cross-language document summarization purpose is inspired by phrase-based machine translation models. Here we briefly describe the general idea of phrase-based translation. One may refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Koehn (2009)</ref> for more detailed description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Phrase-based Machine Translation</head><p>Phrase-based machine translation models are cur- rently giving state-of-the-art translations for many pairs of languages and dominating modern statis- tical machine translation. Classical word-based IBM models cannot capture local contextual in- formation and local reordering very well. Phrase- based translation models operate on lexical entries with more than one word on the source language and the target language. The allowance of multi- word expressions is believed to be the main rea- son for the improvements that phrase-based mod- els give. Note that these multi-word expressions, typically addressed as phrases in machine transla- tion literature, are essentially continuous n-grams and do not need to be linguistically integrate and meaningful constituents.</p><p>Define y as a phrase-based derivation, or more precisely a finite sequence of phrases p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p L . For any derivation y we use e(y) to refer to the target-side translation text defined by y. This translation is derived by concatenat- ing the strings e(p 1 ), e(p 2 ), . . . , e(p L ). The scor- ing scheme for a phrase-based derivation y from the source sentence to the target sentence e(y) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f (y) = L k=1 g(p k ) + LM (e(y)) + L−1 k=1 η|start(p k+1 ) − 1 − end(p k )|</formula><p>where LM (·) is the target-side language model score, g(·) is the score function of phrases, η &lt; 0 is the distortion parameter for penalizing the dis- tance between neighboring phrases in the deriva- tion. Note that the phrases addressed here are typically continuous n-grams and need not to be grammatical linguistic phrasal units. Later we will directly use phrases provided by modern machine translation systems. Searching for the best translation under this score definition is difficult in general. Thus approximate decoding algorithms such as beam search should be applied. Meanwhile, several con- straints should be satisfied during the decoding process. The most important one is to set a con- stant limit of the distortion term |start(p k+1 ) − 1 − end(p k )| ≤ δ to exhibit derivations with dis- tant phrase translations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Phrase-based Cross-Language Summarization</head><p>Inspired by the general idea of phrase-based machine translation, we describe our proposed phrase-based model for cross-language summa- rization in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Phrase-based Sentence Scoring</head><p>In the context of cross-language summarization, here we assume that we can also have phrases in both source and target languages along with phrase alignments between the two sides. For summarization purposes, we may wish to se- lect sentences containing more important phrases. Then it is plausible to measure the scores of these aligned phrases via importance weighing. Inspired by phrase-based translation models, we can assign phrase-based scores to sentences from the translated documents for summarization pur- poses. We define our scoring function for each sentence s as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F (s) = p∈s d 0 g(p) + bg(s) +η dist(y(s))</formula><p>Here in the first term g(·) is the score of phrase p, which can be simply set to document frequency. The phrase score is penalized with a constant damping factor d 0 to decay scores for repeated phrases. The second term bg(s) is the bigram score of sentence s. It is used here to simu- late the effect of language models in phrase-based translation models. Denoting y(s) as the phrase- based derivation (as mentioned earlier in the previ- ous section) of sentence s, the last distortion term dist(y(s)) = L k=1 |start(p k+1 ) − 1 − end(p k )| is exactly the same as the distortion penalty term in phrase-based translation models. This term can be used as a reflection of complexity of the trans- lation. All the above terms can be derived from bilingual sentence pairs with phrase alignments.</p><p>Meanwhile, we may also wish to exclude unim- portant phrases and badly translated phrases. Our definition can also be used to guide sentence com- pression by trying to remove redundant phrase.</p><p>Based on the definition over sentences, we de- fine our summary scoring measure over a sum- mary S:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F (S) = p∈S count(p,S) i=1 d i−1 g(p) + s∈S bg(s) +η s∈S dist(y(s))</formula><p>where d is a predefined constant damping factor to penalize repeated occurrences of the same phrases, count(p, S) is the number of occurrences in the summary S for phrase p. All other terms are in- herited from the sentence score definition.</p><p>In the next section we describe our framework to efficiently utilize this scoring function for cross- language summarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">A Greedy Algorithm for Compressed Sentence Selection</head><p>Utilizing the phrase-based score definition of sen- tences, we can use greedy algorithms to simulta- neously perform sentence selection and sentence compression. Assuming that we have a predefined budget B (e.g. total number of Chinese charac- ters allowed) to restrict the total length of a gen- erated summary. We use C(S) to denote the cost of a summary S, measured by the number of Chi- nese characters contained in total. The greedy al- gorithm we will use for our compressive summa- rization is listed in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1 A greedy algorithm for phrase-based summarization</head><p>1: S ← ∅ 2: i ← 1 3: single best = argmax s∈U,C({s})≤B F ({s}) 4: while U = ∅ do 5:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s i = argmax s∈U F (S i−1 ∪{s})−F (S i−1 ) C({s}) r 6:</formula><p>if C(S i−1 ∪ {s}) ≤ B then 7:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S i ← S i−1 ∪ {s} 8: i ← i + 1 9:</formula><p>end if 10:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">U ← U \ {s i } 11: end while 12: return S * = argmax S∈{single best,S i } F (S)</formula><p>The space U denotes the set of all possible com- pressed sentences. In each iteration, the algorithm tries to find the compressed sentence with maxi- mum gain-cost ratio (Line 5, where we will fol- low previous work to set r = 1), and merge it to the summary set at the current iteration (denoted as S i ). The target is to find the compression with maximum gain-cost ratio. This will be discussed in the next section. Note that the algorithm is also naturally applicable to extractive summarization. For extractive summarization, Line 5 corresponds to direct calculations of sentence scores based on our proposed phrase-based function and U will de- note all full sentences from the original translated documents.</p><p>The outline of this algorithm is very similar to the greedy algorithm used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Morita et al. (2013)</ref> for subtree extraction, except that in our context the increase of cost function when adding a sen- tence is exactly the cost of that sentence.</p><p>When the distortion term is ignored (η = 0), the scoring function is clearly submodular 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lin and Bilmes, 2010</ref>) in terms of the set of compressed sentences, since the score now only consists of functional gains of phrases along with bigrams of a compressed sentence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Morita et al. (2013)</ref> have proved that when r = 1, this greedy algo- rithm will achieve a constant approximation factor 1 2 (1 − e −1 ) to the optimal solution. Note that this only gives us the worst case guarantee. What we can achieve in practice is usually far better.</p><p>On the other hand, setting η &lt; 0 will not affect the performance guarantee too much. Intuitively this is because in most phrase-based translation models a distortion limit constraint |start(p k+1 )− 1 − end(p k )| ≤ δ will be applied on distor- tion terms, while performing sentence compres- sion can never increase distortion. The main con- clusion is formulated as:</p><p>Theorem 1. If Algorithm 1 outputs S greedy while the optimal solution is OP T , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">F (S greedy ) ≥ 1 2 (1 − e −1 )F (OP T ) + 1 2 ηγ.</formula><p>Here γ &gt; 0 is a constant controlled by distor- tion difference between sentences, which is rel- atively small in practice compared with phrase scores. η &lt; 0 is the distortion parameter. Note that when η is set to be 0, the scoring function is submodular and then we recover the 1 2 (1 − e −1 ) approximation factor as studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Morita et al. (2013)</ref>. We leave the proof of Theorem 1 to sup- plementary materials due to space limit. The sub- modularity term in the score plays an important role in the proof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Finding the Maximum Density Compression</head><p>In Algorithm 1, the most important part is the greedy selection process (Line 5). The greedy se- lection criteria here is to maximize the gain-cost ratio. For compressive summarization, we are try- ing to compress each unselected sentence s tõ s, aiming at maximizing the gain-cost ratio, where the gain corresponds to</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F (S i−1 ∪ {s}) − F (S i−1 ) = p∈s count(p,S) i=1 d i−1 g(p) + bg(s) + ηdist(s),</formula><p>and then add the compressed sentence˜ssentence˜ sentence˜s with max- imum gain-cost ratio to the summary. We will also address the compression process for each sentence as finding the maximum density compression. The whole framework forms a joint selection and com- pression process.</p><p>In our phrase-based scoring for sentences, al- though there exist no apparent optimal substruc- ture available for exact dynamic programming due to nonlocal distortion penalty, we can have a tractable approximate procedure since the search space is only defined by local decisions on whether a phrase should be kept or dropped.</p><p>Our compression process for each sentence s is displayed in Algorithm 2. It gradually expands the set of phrases to be kept in the final compression, from the initial set of large density phrases (Line 4, assuming that phrases with large scores and small costs will always be kept), we can recover the compression with maximum density. The function dist(·, ·) is the unit distortion penalty defined as dist(a, b) = |start(b) − 1 − end(a)|. We define p.score to be the sum of damped phrase score for phrase p, i.e. p.score = count(p,S i−1 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">i=1 d i−1 g(p)</formula><p>, when the current partial summary is S i−1 . There- fore during each iteration of the greedy selection process, the compression procedure will also be affected by sentences that have already been in- cluded. Define p.cost as the number of words p contains.</p><p>Algorithm 2 A growing algorithm for finding the maximum density compressed sentence</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1: function GET MAX DENSITY COMPRESSION(s, Si−1) 2: queue Q ← ∅, kept ← ∅ 3:</formula><p>for each phrase p in s.phrases do 4:</p><p>if p.score/p.cost &gt; 1 then 5:</p><p>kept ← kept ∪{p} 6:</p><p>Q </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20: end function</head><p>Empirically we find this procedure gives al- most the same results with exhaustive search while maintaining efficiency. Assuming that sentence length is no more than L, then the asymptotic com- plexity of Algorithm 2 will be O(L) since the al- gorithm requires two passes of all phrases. There- fore the whole framework requires O(kN L) time for a document cluster containing N sentences in total to generate a summary with k sentences.</p><p>In the final compressed sentence we just leave the selected phrases continuously as they are, rely- ing on bigram scores to ensure local smoothness. The task is after all a summarization task, where bigram scores play a role of not only controlling grammaticality but keeping main information of the original documents.</p><p>Later we will see that this compression process will not hurt grammatical fluency of translated sentences in general. In many cases it may even improve fluency by deleting redundant parenthe- ses or removing incorrectly reordered (unimpor- tant) phrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data</head><p>Currently there are not so many available datasets for our particular setting of the cross-language summarization task. Hence we only evaluate our method on the same dataset used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wan (2011)</ref></p><note type="other">. The dataset is created by manually translating the reference summaries into Chinese from the origi- nal DUC 2001 dataset in English. We will refer to this dataset as the DUC 2001 dataset in this paper. There are 30 English document sets in the DUC 2001 dataset for multi-document summarization. Each set contains several documents related to the same topic. Three generic reference English sum- maries are provided by NIST annotators for each document set. All these English summaries have been translated to Chinese by native Chinese an- notators.</note><p>All the English sentences in the original docu- ments have been automatically translated into Chi- nese using Google Translate. We also collect the phrase alignment information from the responses of Google Translate (stored in JSON format) along with the translated texts. We use the Stanford Chi- nese Word Segmenter 2 for Chinese word segmen- tation.</p><p>The parameters in the algorithms are simply set to be r = 1, d = 0.5, η = −0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation</head><p>We will report the performance of our compres- sive solution, denoted as PBCS (for Phrase-Based Compressive Summarization), with comparisons of the following systems:</p><p>• PBES: The acronym comes from Phrase- Based Extractive Summarization. It is the extractive counterpart of our solution without calling Algorithm 2.</p><p>• Baseline (EN): This baseline relies on merely the English-side information for En-glish sentence ranking in the original doc- uments. The scoring function is designed to be document frequencies of English bi- grams, which is similar to the second term in our proposed sentence scoring function in Section 3.1 and is submodular. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The ex- tracted English summary is finally automati- cally translated into the corresponding Chi- nese summary. This is also known as the summary translation scheme.</p><p>• Baseline (CN): This baseline relies on merely the Chinese-side information for Chi- nese sentence ranking. The scoring function is similarly defined by document frequency of Chinese bigrams. The Chinese summary sentences are then directly extracted from the translated Chinese documents. This is also known as the document translation scheme.</p><p>• CoRank: We reimplement the graph-based CoRank algorithm, which gives the state-of- the-art performance on the same DUC 2001 dataset for comparison.</p><p>• Baseline (ENcomp): This is a compressive baseline where the extracted English sen- tences in Baseline (EN) will be compressed before being translated to Chinese. The com- pression process follows from an integer lin- ear program as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Clarke and Lapata (2008)</ref>. This baseline gives strong per- formance as we have found on English DUC 2001 dataset as well as other monolingual datasets.</p><p>We experiment with two kinds of summary bud- gets for comparative study. The first one is limit- ing the summary length to be no more than five sentences. The second one is limiting the total number of Chinese characters of each produced summary to be no more than 300. They will be addressed as Sentence Budgeting and Character Budgeting in the experimental results respectively.</p><p>Similar to traditional summarization tasks, we use the ROUGE metrics for automatic evalua- tion of all systems in comparison. The ROUGE metrics measure summary quality by counting overlapping word units (e.g. n-grams) between the candidate summary and the reference sum- mary. Following previous work in the same task, we report the following ROUGE F-measure scores: ROUGE-1 (unigrams), ROUGE-2 (bi- grams), ROUGE-W (weighted longest common subsequence; weight=1.2), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequences), and ROUGE-SU4 (skip bigrams with a maximum distance of 4). Here we investigate two kinds of ROUGE metrics for Chinese: ROUGE metrics based on words (after Chinese word segmentation) and ROUGE metrics based on singleton Chinese characters. The latter metrics will not suffer from the problem of word segmentation inconsistency.</p><p>To compare our method with extractive base- lines in terms of information loss and grammati- cal quality, we also ask three native Chinese stu- dents as annotators to carry out manual evalua- tion. The aspects considered during evaluation include Grammaticality (GR), Non-Redundancy (NR), Referential Clarity (RC), Topical Focus (TF) and Structural Coherence (SC). Each aspect is rated with scores from 1 (poor) to 5 (good) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . This evaluation is performed on the same random sample of 10 document sets from the DUC 2001 dataset. One group of the gold-standard sum- maries is left out for evaluation of human-level performance. The other two groups are shown to the annotators, giving them a sense of topics talked about in the document sets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1 and Table 2</ref> display the ROUGE results for our proposed methods and the baseline methods, including both word-based and character-based evaluation. We also conduct pairwise t-test and find that almost all the differences between PBCS and other systems are statistically significant with p 0.01 5 except for the ROUGE-W metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>We have the same observations with previous work on the inferiority of using information from only one-side, while using Chinese-side infor- mation only is more beneficial than English-side only. The CoRank algorithm utilizes both sides of information together and achieves significantly better performance over Baseline(EN) and Base- line(CN). Our compressive system outperforms the CoRank algorithm 6 in all metrics.</p><p>Also our system overperforms the compressive pipelining system (Baseline(ENcomp)) as well. Note that the latter only considers information from the source language side. Meanwhile sen- tence compression may sometimes causes worse translations compared with translating the full original sentence.</p><p>For manual evaluation, the average score and standard deviation for each metric is displayed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. From the comparison between com- pressive summarization and the extractive ver- sion, there exist slight improvements of non- redundancy. This exactly matches what we can expect from sentence compression that keeps only important part and drop redundancy. We also ob- serve certain amount of improvements on refer- ential clarity. This may be a result of deletions of some phrases containing pronouns, such as he said. Most of such phrases are semantically unim- portant and will be dropped during the process of finding the maximum density compression.</p><p>Despite not directly using syntactic informa- tion, our compressive summaries do not suffer too much loss of grammaticality. This suggest that bigrams can be treated as good indicators of lo- cal grammatical smoothness. We reckon that sen- tences describing the same events may partially share descriptive bigram patterns, thus sentences selected by the algorithm will consist of mostly important patterns that appear repeatedly in the original document cluster. Only those words that are neither semantically important nor syntacti- cally pivotal will be deleted. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> lists the summaries for the first docu- ment set D04 in the DUC 2001 dataset produced by the proposed compressive system. The Chi- nese side sentences have been split with spaces ac- cording to phrase alignment results. Phrases that have been compressed are grayed out. We also include original English sentences for reference, with deletions according to word alignments from the Chinese sentences. We can observe that our compressive system tries to compress sentences by removing relatively unimportant phrases. The ef- fect of translation errors (e.g. the word watch in on storm watch has been incorrectly translated in the example) can also be reduced since those incor- rectly translated words will be dropped for having low information gains. In some cases the gram- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wan (2011)</ref>. We believe that this comes from different ma- chine translation results output by Google Translate.    <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Manual evaluation results matical fluency can even be improved from sen- tence compression, as redundant parentheses may sometimes be removed. We leave the output sum- maries from all systems for the same document set to supplementary materials.</p></div>

Before Wan (2011)'s work that explicitly utilizes bilingual information in a graph-based framework, earlier methods often use information only from one language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">de Chalendar et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pingali et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Orasan and Chiorean, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Litvak et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>This work is closely related to greedy algo- rithms for budgeted submodular maximization. Many studies have formalized text summarization tasks as submodular maximization problems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lin and Bilmes, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lin and Bilmes, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Morita et al., 2013)</ref>. A more recent work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dasgupta et al., 2013</ref>) discussed the problem of maximiz- ing a function with a submodular part and a non- submodular dispersion term, which may appear to be closer to our scoring functions.</p><p>In recent years, some research has made progress beyond extractive summarization, espe- the original maximization problem with pruned brute-force enumeration and therefore exactly optimal but too costly.</p><p>8 http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/ cially in the context of compressive summariza- tion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zajic et al. (2006)</ref> tries a pipeline strat- egy with heuristics to generate multiple candidate compressions and extract from this compressed sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2011)</ref> cre- ate linear models of weights learned by struc- tural SVMs for different components and tried to jointly formulate sentence selection and syntax tree trimming in integer linear programs. Wood- send and Lapata (2012) propose quasi tree sub- stitution grammars for multiple rewriting oper- ations. All these methods involve integer lin- ear programming solvers to generate compressed summaries, which is time-consuming for multi- document summarization tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Almeida and Martins (2013)</ref> form the compressive summariza- tion problem in a more efficient dual decomposi- tion framework. Models for sentence compression and extractive summarization are trained by multi- task learning techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wang et al. (2013)</ref> ex- plore different types of compression on constituent parse trees for query-focused summarization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al. (2013)</ref> propose a guided sentence compres- sion model with ILP-based summary sentence se- lection. Their following work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li et al., 2014</ref>) in- corporate various constraints on constituent parse trees to improve the linguistic quality of the com- pressed sentences. In these studies, the best- performing systems require supervised learning for different subtasks. More recent work tries to formulate document summarization tasks as opti- mization problems and use their solutions to guide sentence compression( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Li et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Yao et al., 2015)</ref>.  employ integer linear programming for conducting phrase selection and merging simultaneously to form compressed sen- tences after phrase extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we propose a phrase-based frame- work for the task of cross-language document summarization. The proposed scoring scheme can be naturally operated on compressive summariza- tion. We use efficient greedy procedure to ap- proximately optimize the scoring function. Exper- imental results show improvements of our com- pressive solution over state-of-the-art systems.</p><p>Even though we do not explicitly use any syntactic information, the generated summaries of our sys- tem do not lose much grammaticality and fluency. The scoring function in our framework is in- Figure 2: Experimental analysis spired by earlier phrase-based machine translation models. Our next step is to try more fine-grained scoring schemes using similar techniques from modern approaches of statistical machine transla- tion. To further improve grammaticality of gener- ated summaries, we may try to sacrifice the time efficiency for a little bit and use syntactic informa- tion provided by syntactic parsers. Our framework currently uses only the single best translation. It will be more powerful to inte- grate machine translation and summarization, uti- lizing multiple possible translations.</p><p>Currently many successful statistical machine translation systems are phrase-based with align- ment information provided and we utilize this fact in this work. It is interesting to explore how will the performance be affected if we are only pro- vided with parallel sentences and then alignments can only be derived using an independent aligner.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>雨果飓风 ， 袭击 东海岸 在 1989年9月 ， 花费了 保险业 约 42亿 美元 。 Hurricane Hugo, which hit the east coast in September 1989, cost the insurance industry about Dollars 4.2bn. 美国城市 沿 墨西哥湾的 阿拉巴马州 到得克萨斯州 东部 是 在 风暴 手表 昨晚 安 德鲁 飓风 向西 横跨 佛罗里达州南部 席卷 后 ，造成 至少 八人死亡 和严重的 财 产损失 。 US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. 过去的 严重 飓风 美国 ，雨果 ， 袭击 南卡罗来纳州 于1989年 ， 耗资 从 保险 损失 行业 42亿 美元 ，但 造成的 总伤害 的 估计 60亿 美元 和 100亿 美元 之间 不等 。 The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989, cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn. 最初的 报道称， 至少有一人 已经 死亡 ， 75 人受伤 ，数千 取得 沿着 路易斯安 那州海岸 无家可归 ， 14 证实 在佛罗里达州和 死亡 三 巴哈马群岛 后 。 Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas.</figDesc></figure>
