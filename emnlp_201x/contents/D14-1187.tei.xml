				<p>When Part-of-Speech annotated data is scarce, e.g. for under-resourced languages , one can turn to cross-lingual transfer and crawled dictionaries to collect partially supervised data. We cast this problem in the framework of ambiguous learning and show how to learn an accurate history-based model. Experiments on ten languages show significant improvements over prior state of the art performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the past two decades, supervised Machine Learning techniques have established new perfor- mance standards for many NLP tasks. Their suc- cess however crucially depends on the availability of annotated in-domain data, a not so common sit- uation. This means that for many application do- mains and/or less-resourced languages, alternative ML techniques need to be designed to accommo- date unannotated or partially annotated data.</p><p>Several attempts have recently been made to mitigate the lack of annotated corpora using par- allel data pairing a (source) text in a resource-rich language with its counterpart in a less-resourced language. By transferring labels from the source to the target, it becomes possible to obtain noisy, yet useful, annotations that can be used to train a model for the target language in a weakly super- vised manner. This research trend was initiated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yarowsky et al. (2001)</ref>, who consider the trans- fer of POS and other syntactic information, and further developed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hwa et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ganchev et al., 2009</ref>) for syntactic dependencies, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Padó and Lapata, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kozhevnikov and Titov, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">van der Plas et al., 2014</ref>) for semantic role la- beling and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kim et al., 2012</ref>) for named-entity recognition, to name a few.</p><p>Assuming that labels can actually be projected across languages, these techniques face the issue of extending standard supervised techniques with partial and/or uncertain labels in the presence of alignment noise. In comparison to the early ap- proach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yarowsky et al. (2001)</ref> in which POS are directly transferred, subject to heuristic fil- tering rules, recent works consider the integra- tion of softer constraints using expectation regu- larization techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wang and Manning, 2014)</ref>, the combination of alignment-based POS transfer with additional information sources such as dic- tionaries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2012;</ref>) (Section 2), or even the simultaneous use of both techniques ( .</p><p>In this paper, we reproduce the weakly super- vised setting of <ref type="bibr">Täckström et al. (2013)</ref>. By re- casting this setting in the framework of ambiguous learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cour et al., 2011</ref>) (Section 3), we propose an alternative learning methodology and show that it improves the state of the art performance on a large array of languages (Section 4). Our analysis of the remaining errors suggests that in cross-lingual settings, improve- ments of error rates can have multiple causes and should be looked at with great care (Section 4.2).</p><p>All tools and resources used in this study are available at http://perso.limsi.fr/ wisniews/ambiguous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Projecting Labels across Aligned Corpora</head><p>Projecting POS information across languages re- lies on a rather strong assumption that morpho- syntactic categories in the source language can be directly related to the categories in the tar- get language, which might not always be war- ranted ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Evans and Levinson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Broschart, 2009</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Interplay between token and type constraints on our training parallel corpora.

(punctuation marks) and X (a catch-all for other categories). These labels have been chosen for their stability across languages and for their usefulness in various mul- tilingual applications. In the rest of this work, all annotations are mapped to this universal tagset.</p><p>Transfer-based methods have shown to be very effective, even if projected labels only deliver a noisy supervision, due to tagging (of the source language) and other alignment errors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yarowsky et al., 2001</ref>). While this uncertainty can be ad- dressed in several ways, recent works have pro- posed to combine projected labels with monolin- gual information in order to filter out invalid la- bel sequences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Das and Petrov, 2011;</ref>. In this work we follow <ref type="bibr">Täckström et al. (2013)</ref> and use two families of constraints:</p><p>Token constraints rely on word alignments to project labels of source words to target words through alignment links. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows that, de- pendening on the language, only 50−80% of the target tokens would benefit from label transfer.</p><p>Type constraints rely on a tag dictionary to define the set of possible tags for each word type. Type constraints reduce the possible la- bels for a given word and help filtering out cross- lingual transfer errors (up to 20%, as shown in Ta- ble 1). As in ( <ref type="bibr">Täckström et al., 2013</ref>), we con- sider two different dictionaries. The first one is extracted automatically from Wiktionary, 1 us- ing the method of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2012</ref>). The second tag dictionary is built by using for each word the two most frequently projected POS labels from the training data. 2 In contrast to <ref type="bibr">Täckström et al. (2013)</ref> we use the intersection 3 of the two type constraints instead of their union. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the precision and recall of the resulting constraints on the test data.</p><p>These two information sources are merged ac- cording to the rules of <ref type="bibr">Täckström et al. (2013)</ref>. These rules assume that type constraints are more reliable than token constraints and should take precedence: by default, a given word is associated to the set of possible tags licensed type constraints; additionally, when a POS tag can be projected through alignment and also satisfies the type con- straints, then it is actually projected, thereby pro- viding a full (yet noisy) supervision.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, token and type con- straints complement each other effectively and greatly reduce label ambiguity. However, the transfer method sketched above associates each target word with a set of possible labels, of which only one is true. This situation is less favorable than standard supervised learning in which one unique gold label is available for each occurrence. We describe in the following section how to learn from this ambiguous supervision information. position in the sequence, a multiclass classifier is used to make a decision, using features that describe both the input structure and the history of past decisions (i.e. the partially annotated se- quence). Let x = (x i ) n i=1 denote the observed sequence and Y be the set of possible labels (in our case the 12 universal POS tags). Inference consists in predicting labels one after the other using, for in- stance, a linear model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y * i = arg max y∈Y w|φ(x, i, y, h i )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ·|·· is the standard dot product operation, y * i the predicted label for position i, w the weight vector, h i = y * 1 , ..., y * i−1 the history of past de- cisions and φ a joint feature map. Inference can therefore be seen as a greedy search in the space of the # {Y} n possible labelings of the input se- quence. Trading off the global optimality of in- ference for additional flexibility in the design of features and long range dependencies between la- bels has proved useful for many sequence labeling tasks in NLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tsuruoka et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>The training procedure, sketched in Algo- rithm 1, consists in performing inference on each input sentence and correcting the weight vector each time a wrong decision is made. Impor- tantly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ross and Bagnell, 2010)</ref>, the history used during training has to be made of the previous pre- dicted labels so that the training samples reflect the fact that the history will be imperfectly known at test time.</p><p>This reduction of sequence labeling to multi- class classification allows us to learn a sequence model in an ambiguous setting by building on the theoretical results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al. (2010) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cour et al. (2011)</ref>. The decision about the correctness of a prediction and the weight updates can be adapted to the amount of supervision information that is available.</p><p>Full Supervision In a fully supervised setting, the correct label is known for each word token: a decision is thus considered wrong when this gold label is not predicted. In this case, a standard per- ceptron update is performed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w t+1 ← w t −φ (x, i, y * i , h i )+φ (x, i, ˆ y i , h i )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where y * i andˆyandˆ andˆy i are the predicted and the gold la- bel, respectively. This update is a stochastic gra- dient step that increases the score of the gold label while decreasing the score of the predicted label.</p><p>Ambiguous Supervision During training, each observation i is now associated with a set of possi- ble labels, denoted byˆYbyˆ byˆY i . In this case, a decision is considered wrong when the predicted label is not inˆYinˆ inˆY i and the weight vector is updated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w t+1 ← w t −φ (x, i, y * i , h i )+ ˆ y i ∈ ˆ Y i φ (x, i, ˆ y i , h i )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Compared to (2), this rule uniformly increases the scores of all the labels inˆYinˆ inˆY i .</p><p>It can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bordes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cour et al., 2011</ref>), under mild assumptions (namely that two labels never systematically co-occur in the supervision information), that the update rule (3) enables to learn a classifier in an ambiguous set- ting, as if the gold labels were known. Intuitively, as long as two labels are not systematically co- occurring inˆYinˆ inˆY, updates will reinforce the correct labels more often than the spurious ones; at the end of training, the highest scoring label should therefore be the correct one.</p><p>Algorithm 1 Training algorithm.

The English side of the bitext is tagged using a standard linear CRF trained on the Penn Treebank. Tags are then transferred to the target language us- ing the procedure described in Section 2. For each language, we train a tagger using the method de- scribed in Section 3 with T = 100 000 iterations 6 using a feature set similar to the one of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Täckström et al. (2013)</ref>. The baseline system is our reimplementation of the partially observed CRF model of <ref type="bibr">Täckström et al. (2013)</ref>. Evaluation is carried out on the test sets of tree- banks for which manual gold tags are known.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Discussion</head><p>The performance of our new method still falls short of the performance of a fully supervised POS tagger: for instance, in Spanish, full supervision reduces the error rate by a factor of 4. A fine- grained error analysis shows that many errors of HBAL directly result from the fact that, contrary to the fully supervised learner HBSL, our am- biguous setting suffers from a train/test mismatch, which has two main consequences. First, the train and test sets do not follow exactly the same nor- malization and tokenization conventions, which is an obvious source of mistakes. Second, and more importantly, many errors are caused by systematic differences between the test tags and the super- vised tags (i.e. the English side of the bitext and Wiktionary). While some of these differences are linguistically well-justified and reflect funda- mental differences in the language structure and usage, others seem to be merely due to arbitrary annotation conventions.</p><p>For instance, in Greek, proper names are labeled either as X (when they refer to a foreigner and are not transliterated) or as NOUN (in all other cases), while they are always labeled as NOUN in English. In French and in Greek, contractions of a prepo- sition and a determiner such as 'στο' ('σε το', meaning 'to the') or 'aux' ('à les' also meaning 'to the') are labeled as ADP in the Universal De- pendency Treebank but as DET in Wiktionary and are usually aligned with a determiner in the parallel corpora. In the Penn Treebank, quanti- fiers like 'few' or 'little' are generally used in con- junction with a determiner ('a few years', 'a little parable', ...) and labeled as ADJ; the correspond- ing Spanish constructions lack an article ('mucho tempio', 'pocos años', ...) and the quantifiers are therefore labeled as DET. Capturing such subtle differences is hardly possible without prior knowl- edge and specifically tailored features.</p><p>This annotation mismatch problem is all the more important in settings like ours, that rely on several, independently designed, information sources, which follow contradictory annotation conventions and for which the mapping to the uni- versal tagset is actually error-prone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhang et al., 2012</ref>). To illustrate this point, we ran three ad- ditional experiments to assess the impact of the train/test mismatch.</p><p>We first designed a control experiment in which the type constraints were manually completed with the gold labels of the most frequent errors of HBAL. These errors generally concern function words and can be assumed to result from system- atic differences in the annotations rather than pre- diction errors. For instance, for French the type constraints for 'du', 'des', 'au' and 'aux' were cor- rected from DET to ADP. The resulting model, denoted 'HBAL + matched POS' in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, sig- nificantly outperforms HBAL, stressing the diver- gence in the different annotation conventions.</p><p>Additionally, in order to approximate the am- biguous setting train/test mismatch, we learn two fully supervised Spanish taggers on the same train- ing data as HBAL, using two different strategies to obtain labeled data. We first use HBSL (which was trained on the treebank) to automatically la- bel the target side of the parallel corpus. In this setting, the POS tagger is trained with data from a different domain, but labeled with the same an- notation scheme as a the test set. Learning with this fully supervised data yields an error rate of 4.2% for Spanish, almost twice as much as HBSL, bringing into light the impact of domain shift. We then use a generic tagger, FREELING, 10 to label the training data, this time with possible addi- tional inconsistent annotations. The correspond- ing error rate for Spanish was 6.1%, to be com- pared with the 8.2% achieved by HBAL. The last two control experiments show that many of the re- maining labeling errors seem to be due to domain and convention mismatches rather to the trans- fer/ambiguous setting, as supervised models also suffer from very similar conditions. These observations show that the evaluation of transfer-based methods suffer from several biases. Their results must therefore be interpreted with great care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a novel learning methodology to learn from ambiguous supervision information, and used it to train several POS tag- gers. Using this method, we have been able to achieve performance that surpasses the best re- ported results, sometimes by a wide margin. Fur- ther work will attempt to better analyse these re- sults, which could be caused by several subtle differences between HBAL and the baseline sys- tem. Nonetheless, these experiments confirm that cross-lingual projection of annotations have the potential to help in building very efficient POS taggers with very little monolingual supervision data. Our analysis of these results also suggests that, for this task, additional gains might be more easily obtained by fixing systematic biases intro- duced by conflicting mappings between tags or by train/test domain mismatch than by designing more sophisticated weakly supervised learners.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2" validated="false"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Error rate (in %) achieved by the method described in Sec. 3 trained in an ambiguous (HBAL)

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Modeling Sequences under Ambiguous Supervision We use a history-based model (Black et al., 1992) with a LaSO-like training method (Daumé and Marcu, 2005). History-based models reduce structured prediction to a sequence of multi-class classification problems. The prediction of a complex structure (here, a sequence of POS tags) is thus modeled as a sequential decision problem: at each (2013) filter the tag distribution with a threshold to build the projected type constraints. 3 If the intersection is empty we use the constraints from Wiktionary first, if also empty, the projected constraints then, and by default the whole tag set.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> The test sets are only the same for Czech, Greek and Swedish. 9 The partially observed CRF is the best model in (Täckström et al., 2013) only for German (de), Greek (el) and Swedish (sv), and uses only type constraints extracted from Wiktionary.</note>
