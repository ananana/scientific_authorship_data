				<p>This paper presents a corpus and experimental results to extract possession relations over time. We work with Wikipedia articles about artworks, and extract possession relations along with temporal information indicating when these relations are true. The annotation scheme yields many possessors over time for a given artwork, and experimental results show that an LSTM ensemble can automate the task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>All languages have a way to express possessive re- lationships ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2012)</ref>. Pos- session is an asymmetric semantic relation be- tween two entities, where one entity (the pos- sessee) belongs to the other entity (the possessor) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Stassen, 2009)</ref>. When it comes to defining pos- session, belongs includes a wide range of relation- ships, including kinship (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[my]</ref> possessor oldest <ref type="bibr">[son]</ref> possessee ), part-whole (e.g., the <ref type="bibr">[car]</ref> possessor 's <ref type="bibr">[dashboard]</ref> possessee ), possession of something in- tangible (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[John]</ref> possessor got the [flu] possessee last year), proximity (e.g., The <ref type="bibr">[shelf]</ref> possessor has a [glass sculpture] possessee ), physical and temporary possession (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> possessor have John's <ref type="bibr">[book]</ref> possessee ), and ownership (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[John]</ref> possessor bought a <ref type="bibr">[house]</ref> possessee last year).</p><p>Possession relations can be divided into alien- able (also referred to as acquired, transferable, non-intimate, etc.) and inalienable (also referred to as inherent, inseparable, intimate, etc.). Pos- sessees that can be separated from their posses- sors are alienable, and possessees that cannot nor- mally be separated from their possessors are in- alienable <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Heine, 1997)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">[John]</ref> x 's <ref type="bibr">[condo]</ref> y is alienable, and <ref type="bibr">[John]</ref> x 's <ref type="bibr">[arm]</ref> y is in- alienable (some previous works would call the lat- ter a part-whole relation instead). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tham (2004)</ref> In 1530 the painting was inherited by Margaret's niece Mary of Hungary, who <ref type="bibr">[. . . ]</ref>. It is clearly described in an inventory taken after her death in 1558, when it was inherited by Philip II of Spain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mary of Hungary: 1530-1558</head><p>Philip II of Spain: after 1558 defines control possession as a relation in which the possessor has temporary control of the pos- sessee, but does not necessarily alienably possess it (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[John]</ref> x borrowed the <ref type="bibr">[car]</ref> y for the <ref type="bibr">weekend)</ref>. Following the aforecited works, possession goes beyond ownership of property.</p><p>Virtually all possessees change possessors over time, especially if possession relationships are un- derstood in a broad sense as outlined above. Con- sider the excerpt of the Wikipedia article about the Arnolfini Portrait in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. From this excerpt, we know that the painting had at least two posses- sors <ref type="bibr">(Mary of Hungary and Philip II of Spain)</ref>, and that they were the possessors from 1530 to 1558 and after 1558 respectively.</p><p>In this paper, we track possessors of selected possessees over time. Unlike most previous works (Section 3), we (a) start with a document rele- vant to the possessee of interest, (b) select plau- sible possessors and years without syntactic re- strictions and including inter-sentential pairs, and then (c) determine whether the plausible posses- sors are actual possessors with respect to the years. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) 88 Wikipedia articles about artworks annotated with their possessors over time; 1 (b) a detailed cor- pus analysis (e.g., unique possessors, years and possessor-year pairs); and (c) experimental re- sults showing that an LSTM ensemble outper- forms SVM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Previous Work</head><p>We briefly summarize work on possession rela- tionships from a theoretical perspective, and then move to work in computational linguistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Possession relations</head><p>The very definition of possession is not set in stone. Aikhenvald (2013) distinguishes three core meanings for possessive noun phrases that occur across languages: ownership (of property), whole- part (often referred to as part-whole), and kin- ship. Following a cross-linguistic perspective, she discusses possessions and time (present and for- mer possession relationships, e.g., my tooth vs. my former axe), temporary and permanent pos- session (e.g., borrow vs. acquire) and others. Heine (1997) classifies possession relationships depending on the possessor and possessee. First, he makes a distinction between human (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> x have a [house] y ) and non-human possessors (e.g.</p><p>[This house] x has [two bedrooms] y ). Second, he differentiates three kinds of possession depend- ing on the possessee: concrete possession (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> x have [two cats] y ), social possession (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> x have [two sisters] y ), and abstract possession (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref> x have [an idea] y ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976)</ref> differentiate between three kinds of pos- session: inherent, accidental, and physical; and provide the following example: He owns an um- brella (inherent), but she's borrowed it (acciden- tal), though she doesn't have it with her (physical).</p><p>Possession relations have also been defined in terms of parameters. For example, Stassen (2009) considers two parameters (permanent contact and control) and Heine (1997) defines five parame- ters (human possessor, concrete possessee, spatial proximity, temporal permanence, and control).</p><p>While we do not closely follow any of these pre- vious works, we borrow from them the broad def- inition of possession relations, and the motivation to work with possessions over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Computational Linguistics</head><p>Within computational linguistics, possession re- lations have been mostly studied as one of the many relations encoded in a given syntactic con- struction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tratz and Hovy (2013)</ref> extract semantic relations within English posses- sives. They propose a set of 18 relations, e.g. temporal (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[today]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 's [rates] y ), extent (e.g., [6 hours] y ' [drive] x ). Their controller / owner</formula><p>/ user relation (one relation with three aliases) is the closest relation to the possession rela- tions we target in this paper. Extracting seman- tic relations between noun compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Nakov and Hearst, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Tratz and Hovy, 2010</ref>) usu- ally includes extracting possession relations, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[family]</ref> x [estate] y . These previous works extract all semantic relations-including possessions- between arguments that follow a syntactic con- struction.</p><p>In our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chinnappa and Blanco, 2018)</ref>, we identify possession relations between a deterministically chosen person (possessor) and a concrete object (possessee) within a sentence. If a possession relation exists, we also identify the possession type (alienable or control). Finally, we temporally anchor the possession relation with re- spect to the verb of which the possessor is the sub- ject. In this paper, we take a complementary ap- proach. We start with text relevant to the possessee of interest-specifically, its Wikipedia article- and then extract its possessors without any re- strictions beyond considering as possessors only named entities. Furthermore, we specify in which years the possessions were true.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banea et al. (2016)</ref> is the only one on extract- ing possession relations without imposing syntac- tic constraints. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Banea and Mihalcea (2018)</ref> build a corpus working with personal blogs, and present results on automatic extraction of possession using a naive bayes approach. They consider as posses- sors the author of a blog, and as possessees con- crete nouns in blog posts. Regarding time, they annotate possessions at the time of the utterance (when the blog posts were published). Unlike them, we work with one possessee per Wikipedia article (i.e., the artwork the article is about), and then find possessors in the article. Additionally, we extract when a possessor-possessee relation is true with respect to the years in the article, and present results using SVM and end-to-end neural networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Annotating Possessions Over Time</head><p>In this section, we detail the methodology to create a corpus of possession relations over time. We first discuss the selection of source documents and pos- sessees of interest. Then, we detail what is consid- ered as a potential possessor, and how these pos- sessors are paired with years. Finally, we describe # % the annotation process (is the potential possessor an actual possessor with respect to the years?) and analyze the resulting corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Selecting Source Documents</head><p>Our goal is to target possessors of a given pos- sessee over time. A natural choice is to work with documents about specific objects, as they are likely to describe the history and key events in- volving the objects. We decided to work with Wikipedia articles about important artworks. The methodology presented here, however, is not lim- ited to artworks, and we believe it is applicable to any article about an object of interest. We selected 100 artworks using online content, including Google queries for famous artwork and famous paintings, and online lists. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Then, we downloaded the full content of the corresponding Wikipedia articles. Some of the selected artworks are The Third of May 1808, Philosopher in Med- itation, and Saturn Devouring His Son. The final corpus has 88 articles because we discarded arti- cles if we could not select at least three (potential possessor, year) pairs (see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Selecting Potential Possessors and Years</head><p>Once possessees and their Wikipedia articles were selected, we identified potential possessors and years following the five steps below for each sec- tion in each Wikipedia article:</p><p>1. Run the named entity recognizers in spaCy <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and Stanford CoreNLP ( ). 2. Select as potential possessors all instances of the following named entities: PERSON, OR- GANIZATION, LOCATION, and GPE. 3. Select as years all sequences of four digits in- side a DATE named entity. 4. Remove all duplicate potential possessors and years from steps 2 and 3. 5. Generate all pairs of potential possessors and years. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents basic counts and percentages of the potential possessors and years after remov- ing duplicates (Step 4), and the pairs generated (Step 5) for all documents. There are 3,230 po- tential possessors and 940 years, and 12,913 (po- tential possessor, year) pairs. The most common named entity of potential possessors is PERSON (48%), followed by ORG (30.5%) and GPE / LOC (21.5%). The percentage of (potential possessor, year) pairs depending on the named entity of the potential possessor almost follows an identical dis- tribution (48.8%, 29.7% and 21.4%). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the distributions of unique po- tential possessors, years and (potential possessor, year) pairs generated per article (or equivalently, per possessee). While the distributions are far from uniform, the boxplots show that most articles have a substantial number of potential possessors, years and pairs. The minimum number of poten- tial possessors is 4, of years 2, and of pairs 7. But Cohen's κ Before 0.69 During 0.59 After 0.77 All 0.70 over 75% of articles have at least 19 unique po- tential possessors, 5 years and 46 pairs; and over 50% of articles have at least 28 unique potential possessors, 8 years and 86 pairs. In other words, our corpus takes into account many potential pos- sessors and years for the vast majority of articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Validating Possessors and Years</head><p>After (potential possessor, year) pairs were gener- ated, they were validated manually. To do so, we asked the following questions to annotators:</p><p>• Did a possession relation exist between the potential possessor and the possessee at any point of time before year? • Did a possession relation exist between the potential possessor and the possessee at any point of time during year? • Did a possession relation exist between the potential possessor and the possessee at any point of time after year? In all questions, possessee refers to the artwork the Wikipedia article is about. Annotators had to choose from two answers: yes or no, where no indicates all cases in which there is not enough in- formation to determine that a possession relation exists at any point of time before / during / after year. In other words, no does not mean that the potential possessor did not possess the possessee, and it may mean that there is no information about whether a possession relations exists.</p><p>The annotation interface showed the title of the article and the section to which the potential pos- sessor and year belong to (section title + text). An- notators were instructed to first read the section and then answer all questions. Thus, annotators re- veal possession information involving possessors and years that are potentially far away (different clauses, sentences, etc.). Recall that all potential possessors and years within a section are paired, thus we allow to cross sentence boundaries. Annotation Quality. Annotations were done in- house by two graduate students. Both of them annotated 25% of the articles individually. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Ta- ble 2</ref> shows inter-annotator agreements (Cohen's kappa) for each question. Overall, inter-annotator agreement is 0.70 (values between 0.60 and 0.80 are considered substantial <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref>). Agreements are higher for Before and Af- ter than During (0.69 and 0.77 vs. 0.59). The re- maining articles were annotated once. Annotation Examples. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the an- notations for one paragraph of the Wikipedia arti- cle about Girl with a Pearl Earring (more specif- ically, from the section titled Ownership and dis- play). The figure shows the annotations on top of a screenshot of the article for clarity purposes, but the annotation interface only showed one section at a time along with all the generated pairs (Sec- tion 3.3, equivalent to pre-drawing edges).</p><p>Five potential possessors and two years were se- lected, thus ten (potential possessor, year) pairs were generated. The annotations reveal the intu- itive possession information contained within the paragraph. First, Victor de Stuers was an advi- sor to Arnoldus Andries des Tombe, so there is no evidence that he was a possessor at any point of time (missing label edges). Second, Vermeer is the artist who made Girl with a Pearl Earring, so there are possession relations before 1881 and 1902. Third, Arnoldus purchased the piece in The Hague in 1881, and in 1902 it was donated to Mauritshuis. So Arnoldus was a possessor in 1881 and after 1881 (until 1902), The Hague in 1881 (recall that non-humans can be possessors, spatial proximity is also considered possession, Section 2.1), and Mauritshuis during and after 1902. We discuss the limitation of the annotation approach in Section 3.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Annotation Analysis.</head><p>Counts of yes labels for the three questions (be- fore, during and after) are rather low (17%, 9% and 19%, <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). This is not surprising, as any PERSON, ORG, LOC and GPE named entity is con- sidered as potential possessors. We note, however, that we annotated a possession relation (yes label) in 35% of (potential possessor, year) pairs gener- ated (either before, during or after year). <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> depicts the distribution of labels per ar- ticle for (potential possessor, year) pairs generated from the same and different sentences. It is worth noting a couple of interesting patterns. First, the annotations contain many more possessions be- cause we pair potential possessors and years that  Possessor and year from the same sentence Possessor and year from different sentences <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Distribution of yes label per article. We provide distributions for each temporal anchor (at some point of time before, during or after year) and for all anchors, and distinguish between possessors and years belonging to the same sentence (left) or different sentences (right). Each boxplot shows the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.</p><p>belong to different sentences (note the different scales in the y-axis). Second, for pairs gener- ated from different sentences, yes label for during questions is much less likely than for the labels before and after.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> shows the distribution of yes label for all generated pairs. At a minimum, each possessee has at least two possession relations. There are a few outliers articles in which anno- tators identified over 150 possessors in time. The</p><p>From the possessor and year: the concatenation of tokens; binary flags for each token; the syntactic head (token, lemma and part-of-speech tag); and the named entity type.</p><p>From the sentences to which the possessor and year belong to: for (a) a window of 4 tokens to the left and right, (b) all the verbs to the left and right, (c) all the verbs that are ancestors or children in the depedency tree, and (d) all the left and right siblings in the dependency tree, the tokens, lemmas and part-of-speech tags.</p><p>Other and Wikipedia article: whether the possessor and year belong to the same sentence, whether the possessor appears before or after the year, the Wikipedia article tile (concatenation of tokens and binary flags for each token), and the section title (concatenation of tokens and binary flags for each token).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Limitations</head><p>While the proposed procedure successfully iden- tifies possession relations over time, we acknowl- edge limitations in both the possessors and tempo- ral information considered.</p><p>First, we only consider named entities as po- tential possessors, so it is possible we miss some possessors (e.g., pronouns, the artist, his son). Because of the source documents we work with (Wikipedia articles about artwork) and the fact that we pair all potential possessors and years within a section, this is not a big issue: most Wikipedia sec- tions do not have mentions that cannot be resolved to a named entity within the same section. We note, however, that coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pradhan et al., 2011)</ref> would alleviate this problem.</p><p>Second, we only consider four digits within a DATE named entity as temporal information. This means that temporal information encoded in rel- ative dates (e.g., four years later) or historical events (e.g. after World War II) is disregarded. Additionally, we cannot distinguish between sev- eral possessors within a year, finer-grained times would be required to do so. To address these is- sues, temporal parsers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lee et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Strötgen and Gertz, 2015)</ref> and anchoring events in time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Reimers et al., 2016</ref>) are required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and Results</head><p>We experiment with traditional Support Vector Machines and neural networks. We divided the articles (and the corresponding (potential posses- sor, year) pairs) into train (80%) and test (20%), and report results obtained with the test split. Note that splitting pairs randomly would be unsound, as possession relations for the same possessee would be in the train and test splits. We build three clas- sifiers with both SVMs and neural networks (one per question: before, during and after), and all of them predict two labels: yes or no.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Support Vector Machines</head><p>We trained the three classifiers using the SVM implementation in scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref>, and tuned hyper-parameters C and γ us- ing 10-fold cross-validation with the train split. We used features extracted from the possessor, the year, and the sentences they belong to. Addition- ally, we also included the Wikipedia article title and the section title from which the possessor and year were selected. The full feature set is de- scribed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> and we do not elaborate fur- ther. Our motivation to try SVMs is to establish a strong supervised baseline, and to compare with neural networks that take as input only plain text.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Neural Networks</head><p>We use the implementations provided by the Keras neural network API ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chollet et al., 2015</ref>) with TensorFlow backend ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abadi et al., 2015)</ref>. Ad- ditionally, we use GloVe embeddings with 300 dimensions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) 4 to trans- form words into their distributed representations, the Adam optimizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) and categorical cross entropy as a loss function. We train the network with batch size 16 for up to 200 epochs, but stop earlier if no improvement is ob- served in the validation set for 5 epochs. We re- serve 20% of the train split for validation.</p><p>The neural network is composed of four Long Short-Term Memory networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>) with 200 units. The outputs of the LSTMs are concatenated along with the em- beddings of the possessor and year, and the final output is calculated with a Softmax layer. Each LSTM has as its input a different chunk of text:</p><p>• The first LSTM takes as input the sequence of tokens in the sentence containing the pos- sessor (top left in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>). Each token is represented by the corresponding word em- bedding, and an additional embedding (also with 300 dimensions) for the possessor and all other tokens (there are only two unique ad- ditional embeddings, white and light gray in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>). Unlike the word embedding from GloVe, the additional embeddings are initial- ized randomly and are updated during the training process. Our rationale to add the ad- ditional embeddings is to provide the LSTM with information to learn which tokens sur- rounding the possessor are more important. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Available at https://nlp.stanford.edu/ projects/glove/, file glove/glove.6B.300.txt</p><p>• The second LSTM takes as input the sentence containing the year (top right in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>). The input representation is very similar to the one used in the first LSTM, the only differ- ence is that the additional embeddings (white and dark grey) indicate the year and any other token. Again, our rationale for the additional embeddings is to provide the LSTM with in- formation to learn which tokens surrounding the year are more important.</p><p>• The third LSTM (bottom left in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7)</ref> takes as input the Wikipedia article (i.e., the name of the possessee). The input words are represented with their GloVe embeddings.</p><p>• The fourth LSTM (bottom right) takes as in- put the section title from which the posses- sor and year were selected. The input words are also represented with their GloVe embed- dings and no additional information. Our ra- tionale is that some sections are less likely to contain valid possessors (e.g., Cultural Im- pact (low likelihood) vs. Ownership and dis- play (high likelihood).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>Results obtained with the test set are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. F-measures are always higher for no than yes, but recall that only yes label allows us to ex- tract valid possession relations. Baselines. The majority baseline always predicts no label for all temporal tags (before, during and after, see percentages in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>), thus it fails to extract any possession information. SVMs. SVMs obtain higher-than-chance results, but F-scores with yes label are relatively low (be- fore: 0.33, during: 0.31 and after: 0.44   We also experimented with modifications of the full neural network to provide insights into which components are more useful. Specifically, we report results not using the additional embed- dings for the possessor and year, and disabling the LSTMs for the article title and section title. Note that while yes F-scores for during barely vary re- gardless of the modifications to the network, we found interesting patterns for before and after. All F-scores discussed below are for yes label, the only label that is useful to extract possession re- lations.</p><p>• First, the additional embeddings for the pos- sessor and year are beneficial for after (0.47 vs 0.53, +12.8%) and during (0.29 vs 0.32, +10.3%), and neutral for before. This leads to the conclusion that the LSTM learns the contexts surrounding the possessor and year successfully only for after and during. Note that the additional embeddings provides in- formation regarding the position of the pos- sessor and year within their sentences.</p><p>• Second, the LSTM that takes as its input the article title is beneficial for before (0.37 vs. 0.40, +8.1%) and after (0.46 vs 0.53, +15.2%), and barely for during (0.31 vs. 0.32, +3.1%). Thus we can conclude that the article title contains useful information to de- termine the existence of possession relations, and that pretrained word embeddings capture this information.</p><p>• Third, the LSTM that takes as its input the section title is beneficial for after (0.48 vs 0.53, +10.4%), detrimental for before (0.45 vs. 0.40, -11.1%) and barely detrimental for during (0.32 vs. 0.33, -3.0%). These results lead to the conclusion that the section title only contains useful information to determine possession relations in future years with re- spect to the years mentioned in the section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Possession is an asymmetric semantic relation be- tween two entities, where one entity (the pos- sessee) belongs to the other entity (the possessor). Following theoretical works, we understand be- longs in a broad sense, including physical, tem- poral, and control possessions.</p><p>In this paper, we track possession relations over time. Specifically, we work with Wikipedia arti- cles about artworks, and extract their possessors as well as temporal information with respect to the years explicitly mentioned (before, during or af- ter). We have presented an approach to extract po- tential possessors and pair them with years, and an annotation scheme to validate them. Overall inter- annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa) is 0.70, and the resulting corpus has substantial information re- garding possessors over time: in 75% of articles we validate at least 14 (possessor, year) pairs, and in 50%, at least 30 pairs.</p><p>Experimental results show that the task can be automated, although we obtain moderate results. We present an LSTM ensemble that outperforms a traditional SVM. Disabling certain components of the full network show that the article title and sec-tion title benefit different temporal tags, and that the additional embeddings for the possessor and year are beneficial for during.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Excerpt from the Wikipedia article about Arnolfini Portrait and its possessors over time.</figDesc></figure>
