				<p>The multilingual Paraphrase Database (PPDB) is a freely available automatically created resource of paraphrases in multiple languages. In statistical machine translation, paraphrases can be used to provide translation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) phrases. In this paper, we show that a graph propagation approach that uses PPDB paraphrases can be used to improve overall translation quality. We provide an extensive comparison with previous work and show that our PPDB-based method improves the BLEU score by up to 1.79 percent points. We show that our approach improves on the state of the art in three different settings: when faced with limited amount of parallel training data; a domain shift between training and test data; and handling a morphologically complex source language. Our PPDB-based method outperforms the use of distributional profiles from monolin-gual source data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Translation coverage is a major concern in statis- tical machine translation (SMT) which relies on large amounts of parallel, sentence-aligned text. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Callison-Burch et al., 2006</ref>), even with a training data size of 10 million word tokens, source vocab- ulary coverage in unseen data does not go above 90%. The problem is worse with multi-word OOV phrases. Copying OOVs to the output is the most common solution. However, even noisy transla- tions of OOVs can improve reordering and lan- guage model scores ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>. Translit- eration is useful but not a panacea for the OOV problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2014b</ref>). We find and remove the named entities, dates, etc. in the source and focus on the use of paraphrases to help translate the remaining OOVs. In Sec. 5.2 we show that handling such OOVs correctly does im- prove translation scores.</p><p>In this paper, we build on the following re- search: Bilingual lexicon induction is the task of learning translations of words from monolin- gual data in source and target languages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Koehn and Knight, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haghighi et al., 2008</ref>). The distributional pro- file (DP) approach uses context vectors to link words as potential paraphrases to translation can- didates <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rapp, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Koehn and Knight, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haghighi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Garera et al., 2009</ref>). DPs have been used in SMT to assign translation can- didates to <ref type="bibr">OOVs (Marton et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Daumé and Jagarlamudi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2014a</ref>). Graph-based semi- supervised methods extend this approach and propagate translation candidates across a graph with phrasal nodes connected via weighted para- phrase relationships ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saluja et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zhao et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saluja et al. (2014)</ref> extend paraphrases for SMT from the words to phrases, which we also do in this work. Bilin- gual pivoting uses parallel data instead of con- text vectors for paraphrase extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mann and Yarowsky, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">CallisonBurch et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhao et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">CallisonBurch, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ganitkevitch and Callison-Burch (2014)</ref> published a large-scale multilingual Para- phrase Database (PPDB) http://paraphrase. org which includes lexical, phrasal, and syntactic paraphrases (available for 22 languages with up to 170 million paraphrases each).</p><p>To our knowledge, this paper is the first com- prehensive study of the use of PPDB for statistical machine translation model training. Our frame- work has three stages: 1) a novel graph con- struction approach for PPDB paraphrases linked with phrases from parallel training data. 2) Graph propagation that uses PPDB paraphrases. 3) An SMT model that incorporates new translation can- didates. Sec. 3 explains these three stages in detail.</p><p>Using PPDB has several advantages: 1) Re- sources such as PPDB can be built and used for many different tasks including but not limited to SMT. 2) PPDB contains many features that are useful to rank the strength of a paraphrase con- nection and with more information than distribu- tional profiles. 3) Paraphrases in PPDB are often better than paraphrases extracted from monolin- gual or comparable corpora because a large-scale multilingual paraphrase database such as PPDB can pivot through a large amount of data in many different languages. It is not limited to using the source language data for finding paraphrases which distinguishes it from previous uses of para- phrases for SMT.</p><p>PPDB is a natural resource for paraphrases. However, PPDB was not built with the specific ap- plication to SMT in mind. Other applications such as text-to-text generation have used PPDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ganitkevitch et al., 2011</ref>) but SMT brings along a specific set of concerns when using paraphrases: translation candidates should be transferred suit- ably across paraphrases. There are many cases, e.g. when faced with different word senses where transfer of a translation is not appropriate. Our proposed methods of using PPDB use graph prop- agation to transfer translation candidates in a way that is sensitive to SMT concerns.</p><p>In our experiments (Sec. 5) we compare our approach with the state-of-the-art in three differ- ent settings in SMT: 1) when faced with limited amount of parallel training data; 2) a domain shift between training and test data; and 3) handling a morphologically complex source language. In each case, we show that our PPDB-based approach outperforms the distributional profile approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Paraphrase Extraction</head><p>Our goal is to produce translations for OOV phrases by exploiting paraphrases from the mul- tilingual PPDB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ganitkevitch and Callison-Burch, 2014</ref>) by using graph propagation. Since our ap- proach relies on phrase-level paraphrases we com- pare with the current state of the art approaches that use monolingual data and distributional pro- files to construct paraphrases and use graph prop- agation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saluja et al., 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Paraphrases from Distributional Profiles</head><p>A distributional profile (DP) of a word or phrase was first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rapp, 1995)</ref> for SMT. Given a word f , its distributional profile is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">DP (f ) = {{A(f, w i ) | w i ∈ V }</formula><p>V is the vocabulary and the surrounding words w i are taken from a monolingual corpus using a fixed window size. We use a window size of 4 words based on the experiments in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013)</ref>. DPs need an association measure A(·, ·) to compute distances between potential paraphrases. A comparison of different association measures appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Marton et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saluja et al., 2014</ref>) and our preliminary ex- periments validated the choice of the same asso- ciation measure as in these papers, namely Point- wise Mutual Information (Lin, 1998) (PMI). For each potential context word w i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A(f, w i ) = log 2 P (f, w i ) P (f )P (w i )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>To evaluate the similarity between two phrases we use cosine similarity. The cosine coefficient of two phrases f 1 and f 2 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(f 1 , f 2 ) = cos(DP (f 1 ), DP (f 2 )) = w i ∈V A(f 1 , w i )A(f 2 , w i ) w i ∈V A(f 1 , w i ) 2 w i ∈V A(f 2 , w i ) 2 (2)</formula><p>where V is the vocabulary. Note that in Eqn. (2) w i 's are the words that appear in the context of f 1 or f 2 , otherwise the PMI values would be zero. Considering all possible candidate paraphrases is very expensive. Thus, we use the heuristic ap- plied in previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Marton et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saluja et al., 2014</ref>) to reduce the search space. For each phrase we keep candidate paraphrases which appear in one of the surround- ing context (e.g. Left Right) among all occur- rences of the phrase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Paraphrases from bilingual pivoting</head><p>Bilingual pivoting uses parallel corpora between the source language, F , and a pivot language T . If two phrases, f 1 and f 2 , in a same language are paraphrases, then they share a translation in other languages with p(f 1 |f 2 ) as a paraphrase score:  where t is a phrase in language T . p(f 1 |t) and p(t|f 2 ) are taken from the phrase table extracted from parallel data for languages F and T . In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005)</ref> we see that paraphrase pairs like (in check, under con- trol) can be extracted by pivoting over the German phrase unter kontrolle.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S(f 1 , f 2 ) = p(f 1 |f 2 ) = t p(f 1 |t)p(t|f 2 )<label>(</label></formula><p>The multilingual Paraphrase Database (PPDB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ganitkevitch and Callison-Burch, 2014</ref>) is a published resource for paraphrases extracted using bilingual pivoting. It leverages syntactic information and other resources to filters and scores each paraphrase pair using a large set of features. These features can be used by a log linear model to score paraphrases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhao et al., 2008)</ref>. We used a linear combination of these fea- tures using the equation in Sec. 3 of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ganitkevitch and Callison-Burch, 2014</ref>) to score paraphrase pairs. PPDB version 1 is broken into different levels of coverage. The smaller sizes contain only better-scoring, high-precision paraphrases, while larger sizes aim for high coverage. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>After paraphrase extraction we have paraphrase pairs, (f 1 , f 2 ) and a score S(f 1 , f 2 ) we can in- duce new translation rules for OOV phrases us- ing the steps in Algo. (1): 1) A graph of source phrases is constructed as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013</ref>); 2) translations are propagated as labels through the graph as explained in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>; and 3) new trans- lation rules obtained from graph-propagation are integrated with the original phrase table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Graph Construction</head><p>We construct a graph G(V, E, W ) over all source phrases in the paraphrase database and the source language phrases from the SMT phrase table ex- tracted from the available parallel data. V cor- responds to the set of vertices (source phrases), E is the set of edges between phrases and W is weight of each using the score function S defined in Sec. 2. V has two types of nodes: seed (labeled) nodes, V s , from the SMT phrase table, and regu- lar nodes, V r . Note that in this step OOVs are part of these regular nodes, and we try to find transla- tion in the propagation step for all of these regu- lar nodes. In graph construction and propagation, we do not know which phrasal nodes correspond to OOVs in the dev and test set. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows a small slice of the actual graph used in one of our experiments; This graph is constructed using the paraphrase database on the right side of the figure. Filled nodes have a distribution over translations (the possible "labels" for that node). In our setting, we consider the translation e to be the "label" and so we propagate the labeling distribution p(e|f ) which is taken from the feature function for the SMT log-linear model that is taken from the SMT phrase table and we propagate this distribution to unlabeled nodes in the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Graph Propagation</head><p>Considering the translation candidates of known phrases in the SMT phrase table as the "labels" we apply a soft label propagation algorithm in order to assign translation candidates to "unlabeled" nodes in the graph, which include our OOV phrases. As described by the example in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> we wish two outcomes: 1) transfer of translations (or "la- bels") to unlabeled nodes (OOV phrases) from la- beled nodes, and 2) smoothing the label distribu- tion at each node. We use the Modified Adsorption (MAD) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Talukdar and Crammer, 2009)</ref> for graph propagation. Suppose we have m dif- ferent possible labels plus one dummy label, a soft labeî Y ∈ ∆ m+1 is a m + 1 dimension probabil- ity vector. The dummy label is used when there is low confidence on correct labels. Based on MAD, we want to find soft label vectors for each node by optimizing the objective function below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">minˆY minˆ minˆY µ 1 v∈Vs P 1,v ||Y v − ˆ Y || 2 2 + µ 2 v∈V,u∈N (v) P 2,v W v,u ||ˆY||ˆ ||ˆY v − ˆ Y u || 2 2 + µ 3 v∈V P 3,v ||ˆY||ˆ ||ˆY v − R v || 2 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In this objective function, µ i and P i,v are hyper- parameters (∀v : Σ i P i,v = 1). R v ∈ ∆ m+1 is our prior belief about labeling. First component of the function tries to minimize the difference of new distribution to the original distribution for the seed nodes. The second component insures that nearby neighbours have similar distributions, and the final component is to make sure that the dis- tribution does not stray from a prior distribution.</p><p>At the end of propagation, we wish to find a la- bel distribution for our OOV phrases. We describe in Sec. 4.2.2 the reasons for choosing MAD over other graph propagation algorithms. The MAD graph propagation generalizes the approach used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013</ref>). The Structured Label Propagation algorithm (SLP) was used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saluja et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zhao et al., 2015</ref>) which uses a graph structure on the target side phrases as well. How- ever, we have found that in our diverse experimen- tal settings (see Sec. 5) MAD had two properties we needed compared to SLP: one was the use of graph random walks which allowed us to control translation candidates and MAD also has the abil- ity to penalize nodes with a large number of edges (also see Sec. 4.2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Phrase Table Integration</head><p>After propagation, for each potential OOV phrase we have a list of possible translations with corre- sponding probabilities. A potential OOV is any phrase which does not appear in training, but could appear in unseen data. We do not look at the dev or test data to produce the augmented phrase ta- ble. The original phrase table is now augmented with new entries providing translation candidates for potential OOVs; Last column in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows how many entries have been added to the phrase table for each experimental settings. A new fea- ture is added to the standard SMT log-linear dis- criminative model and introduced into the phrase table. This new feature is set to either 1.0 for the phrase table entries that already existed; or i which is the log probability (from graph propaga- tion) for the translation candidate i for potential OOVs. In case the dummy label exists with high probability or the label distribution is uniform, an identity rule is added to the phrase table (copy over source to target).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis of the Framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Propagation of poor translations</head><p>Automatic paraphrase extraction generates many possible paraphrase candidates and many of them are likely to be false positives for finding transla- tion candidates for OOVs. Distributional profiles rely on context information which is not sufficient to derive accurate paraphrases for many phrases and this results in many low quality paraphrase candidates. Bilingual pivoting uses word align- ments which can also introduce errors depending on the size and quality of the bilingual data used. Alignment errors also introduce poor translations.</p></div>

We have built similar graphs for French and Arabic.</p><p>In graph propagation, these errors may be propa- gated and result in poor translations for OOVs. We could address this issue by aggressively pruning the potential paraphrase candidates to im- prove the precision. However, this results in a dra- matic drop in coverage and many OOV phrases do not obtain any translation candidates. We use a combination of the following three steps to aug- ment our graph propagation framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Graph pruning and PPDB sizes</head><p>Pruning the graph avoids error propagation by re- moving unreliable edges. Pruning removes edges with an edge weight lower than a minimum thresh- old or by limiting the number of neighbours to the top-K edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Talukdar, 2009)</ref>. PPDB has different sizes with different levels of accuracy and cover- age. We can do graph pruning simply by choosing to use different sizes of PPDB. As we can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> results vary from language to language de- pending on the pruning used. For instance, the L size results in the best score for French-English. We choose the best size of PPDB for each lan- guage based on a separate held-out set and inde- pendently from each of the SMT-based tasks in our experimental results. Our conclusion from our ex- periments with the different sizes of PPDB is that removing phrases (or nodes in our graph) is not desirable. However, removing unreliable edges is useful. As seen in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, increasing the size of PPDB leads to a rapid increase in nodes fol- lowed by a larger number of edges in the very large PPDB sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Pruning the translation candidates</head><p>Another solution to the error propagation issue is to propagate all translation candidates but when providing translations to OOVs in the final phrase table to eliminate all but the top L translations for each phrase (which is the usual ttable limit in phrase-based SMT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Koehn et al., 2003)</ref>). Based on a development set, separate from the test sets we used, we found that the best value of L was 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">External Resources for Filtering</head><p>Applying more informative filters can be also used to improve paraphrase quality. This can be done through additional features for paraphrase pairs. For example, edit distance can be used to capture misspelled paraphrases. We use a Named Entity Recognizer to exclude names, numbers and dates from the paraphrase candidates. Even after remov- ing these tokens, 3.32% of tokens of test set are still OOVs . In addition, we use a list of stop words to remove nodes which have too many connec- tions. These two filters improve our results (more in Sec. 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Path sensitivity</head><p>Graph propagation has been used in many NLP tasks like POS tagging, parsing, etc. but propa- gating translations in a graph as labels is much more challenging. Due to huge number of pos- sible labels (translations) and many low quality edges, it is very likely that many wrong transla- tions are rapidly propagated in few steps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al. (2013)</ref> show that unlabeled nodes in- side the graph, called bridge nodes, are useful for the transfer of translations when there is no other connection between an OOV phrase and a node with known translation candidates. However, they show that using the full graph with long paths of bridge nodes hurts performance. Thus the propa- gation has to be constrained using path sensitivity. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows this issue in a part of an English para- Figure 4: Sensitivity issue in graph propagation for translations. "Lager" is a translation candidate for "stock", which is transferred to "majority" af- ter 3 iterations.</p><p>phrase graph. After three iterations, German trans- lation "Lager" reaches "majority" which is totally irrelevant as a translation candidate. Transfer of translation candidates should prefer close neigh- bours and only with a very low probability to other nodes in the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Pre-structuring the graph</head><p>Razmara et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2013)</ref> avoid a fully connected graph structure. They pre-structure the graph into bipartite graphs (only connections between phrases with known translation and OOV phrases) and tripartite graphs (connections can also go from a known phrasal node to an OOV phrasal node through one node that is a paraphrase of both but does not have translations, i.e. it is an unla- beled node). In these pre-structured graphs there are no connections between nodes of the same type (known, OOV or unlabeled). We apply this method in our low resource setting experiments (Sec. 5.3) to compare our bipartite and tripartite results to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al. (2013)</ref>. In the rest of the experiments we use the tripartite approach since it outperforms the bipartite approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Graph random walks</head><p>Our goal is to limit the number of hops in the prop- agation of translation candidates preferring closely connected and highly probable edge weights. Op- timization for the Modified Adsorption (MAD) objective function in Sec. 3.2 can be viewed as a controlled random walk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Talukdar et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Talukdar and Crammer, 2009)</ref>. This is formal- ized as three actions: inject, continue and aban- don with corresponding pre-defined probabilities P inj , P cont and P abnd respectively as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Talukdar and Crammer, 2009)</ref>. A random walk through the graph will transfer labels from one node to an- other node, and probabilities P cont and P abnd con- trol exploration of the graph. By reducing the val- ues of P cont and increasing P abnd we can control the label propagation process to optimize the qual- ity of translations for OOV phrases. Again, this is done on a held-out development set and not on the test data. The optimal values in our experiments for these probabilities are P inj = 0.9, P cont = 0.001, P abnd = 0.01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Early stopping of propagation</head><p>In Modified Adsorption (MAD) (see Sec. 3.2) nodes in the graph that are closely linked will tend to similar label distributions as the number of it- erations increase (even when the path lengths in- crease). In our setting, smoothing the label distri- bution helps in the first few iterations, but is harm- ful as the number of iterations increase due to the factors shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. We use early stopping which limits the number of iterations. We varied the number of iterations from 1 to 10 on a held-out dev set and found that 5 iterations was optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>We first show the effect of OOVs on translation quality, then evaluate our approach in three dif- ferent SMT settings: low resource SMT, domain shift, and morphologically complex languages.</p><p>In each case, we compare results of using para- phrases extracted by Distributional Profile (DP) and PPDB in an end-to-end SMT system. Important: no subset of the test data sentences are used in the bilingual corpora for paraphrase ex- traction process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>We use CDEC 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dyer et al., 2010)</ref> as an end- to-end SMT pipeline with its standard features 2 . fast align <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dyer et al., 2013</ref>) is used for word alignment, and weights are tuned by minimizing BLEU loss on the dev set using MIRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Crammer and Singer, 2003)</ref>. This setup is used for most of our experiments: oracle (Sec. 5.2), do- main adaptation (Sec. 5.4) and morphologically complex languages (Sec. 5.5  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Statistics of settings in Sec. 5. Last col- umn shows how many rules added in the phrase table integration step.</p><p>KenLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heafield, 2011</ref>) is used to train a 5- gram language model on English Gigaword (V5: LDC2011T07). For scalable graph propagation we use the Junto framework 3 . We use maximum phrase length 10. For our experiments we use the Hadoop distributed computing framework ex- ecuted on a cluster with 12 nodes (each node has 8 cores and 16GB of RAM). Each graph propaga- tion iteration takes about 3 minutes.</p><p>For French, we apply a simple heuristic to de- tect named entities: words that are capitalized in the original dev/test set that do not appear at the beginning of a sentence are named entities. Based on eyeballing the results, this works very well in our data. For Arabic, AQMAR is used to exclude named-entities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mohit et al., 2012</ref>). For each of the experimental settings below we show the OOV statistics in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Impact of OOVs: Oracle experiment</head><p>This oracle experiment shows that translation of OOVs beyond named entities, dates, etc. is poten- tially very useful in improving output translation. We trained a SMT system on 10K French-English sentences from the Europarl corpus(v7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Koehn, 2005)</ref>. WMT 2011 and WMT 2012 are used as dev and test data respectively. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the results in terms of BLEU on dev and test. The first row is baseline which simply copies OOVs to output. The second and third rows show the re- sult of augmenting phrase-table by adding transla- tions for single-word OOVs and phrases contain- ing OOVs. The last row shows the oracle result where dev and test sentences exist inside the train- ing data and all the OOVs are known (Fully ob- servers cannot avoid model and search errors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Case 1: Limited Parallel Data</head><p>In this experiment we use a setup similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Razmara et al., 2013</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: The impact of translating OOVs.</p><p>we use 10K French-English parallel sentences, randomly chosen from Europarl to train trans- lation system, as reported in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Razmara et al., 2013)</ref>. ACL/WMT 2005 4 is used for dev and test data. We re-implement their paraphrase extraction method (DP) to extract paraphrases from French side of Europarl (2M sentences). We use unigram nodes to construct graphs for both DP and PPDB. In bipartite graphs, each node is connected to at most 20 nodes. For tripartite graphs, each node is connected to 15 labeled and 5 unlabeled nodes.</p><p>For intrinsic evaluation, we use Mean- Reciprocal-Rank (MRR) and Recall. MRR is the mean of reciprocal rank of the candidate list compared to the gold list (Eqn. 5). Recall shows percentage of gold list covered by the candidate list (Eqn. 6). Gold translations for OOVs are given by concatenating the test data to training and running a word aligner.   to show how well our PPDB approach does com- pared to the DP approach in terms of MRR and recall; and 3) to show applicability of our ap- proach for a low-resource language. However we used French instead of a language which is truly resource-poor due to the lack of available para- phrases for a true resource poor language, e.g. Malagasy.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">MRR = 1 |O| |O| i=1 1 rank i for O = {OOVs} (5) Recall = |{gold list} ∩ {candidate list}| |{gold list}| (6)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Case 2: Domain Adaptation</head><p>Domain adaptation is another case that suffers from massive number of OOVs. We compare our approach with Marginal Matching <ref type="table">(Irvine et al</ref>   Marginal Matching performs better in science do- main but graph-propagation approach with PPDB outperforms it in medical domain getting a +1.79 BLEU score improvement over the baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Case 3: Morphologically Rich Languages</head><p>Both Distribution Profiling and Bilingual Pivot- ing propose morphological variants of a word as paraphrase pairs. Even more so in PPDB due to pivoting over English. We choose Arabic-English task for this experiment. We train the SMT system on 685K sentence pairs (randomly selected from LDC2007T08 and LDC2008T09) and use NIST OpenMT 2012 for dev and test data. Arabic side of 1M sentences of LDC2007T08 and LDC2008T09 is used to extract unigram paraphrases for DP. Ta- ble 7 shows that PPDB (large; with phrases) re- sulted in +1.53 BLEU score improvement over DP which only slightly improved over baseline.</p></div>

In experiments (Sec. 5) we obtained comparable BLEU score improve- ment on Arabic-English by using bilingual pivot- ing only on source phrases. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saluja et al., 2014</ref>) also use methods similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Habash, 2008</ref>) that expand the phrase table with spelling and morpho- logical variants of OOVs in test data.

How- ever, most of these methods focus on frequent words or an available bilingual phrase table ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zhang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gao et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mikolov et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future work</head><p>In future work, we would like to include transla- tions for infrequent phrases which are not OOVs. We would like to explore new propagation meth- ods that can directly use confidence estimates and control propagation based on label sparsity. We also would like to expand this work for mor- phologically rich languages by exploiting other resources like morphological analyzer and cam- pare our approach to the current state of art ap- proaches which are using these types of resources. In conclusion, we have shown significant improve- ments to the quality of statistical machine transla- tion in three different cases: low resource SMT, domain shift, and morphologically complex lan- guages. Through the use of semi-supervised graph propagation, a large scale multilingual paraphrase database can be used to improve the quality of sta- tistical machine translation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: English paraphrases extracted by pivoting over German shared translation (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,4.10,300.75,302.87,82.98" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Figure 2: A small sample of the real graph constructed from the Arabic PPDB for Arabic to English translation. Filled nodes 

(1 and 6) are phrases from the SMT phrase table (unfilled nodes are not). Edge weights are set using a log-linear combination 
of scores from PPDB. Phrase #6 has different senses ('gold' or 'left'); and it has a paraphrase in phrase #7 for the 'gold' sense 
and a paraphrase in phrase #2 for the 'left' sense. After propagation, phrase #2 receives translation candidates from phrase #6 
and phrase #1 reducing the probability of translation from unrelated senses (like the 'gold' sense). Phrase #8 is a misspelling 
of phrase #7 and is also captured as a paraphrase. Phrase #6 propagates translation candidates to phrase #8 through phrase 
#7. Morphological variants of phrase #6 (shown in bold) also receive translation candidates through graph propagation giving 
translation candidates for morphologically rich OOVs.
