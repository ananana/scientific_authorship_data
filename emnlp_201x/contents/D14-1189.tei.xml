				<p>We propose a simple unsupervised approach to detecting non-compositional components in multiword expressions based on Wiktionary. The approach makes use of the definitions, synonyms and translations in Wiktionary, and is applicable to any type of MWE in any language, assuming the MWE is contained in Wiktionary. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves higher F-score than state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A multiword expression (MWE) is a combina- tion of words with lexical, syntactic or seman- tic idiosyncrasy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Sag et al., 2002</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldwin and Kim, 2009</ref>). An MWE is considered (semanti- cally) "non-compositional" when its meaning is not predictable from the meaning of its compo- nents. Conversely, compositional MWEs are those whose meaning is predictable from the meaning of the components. Based on this definition, a component is compositional within an MWE, if its meaning is reflected in the meaning of the MWE, and it is non-compositional otherwise.</p><p>Understanding which components are non- compositional within an MWE is important in NLP applications in which semantic information is required. For example, when searching for spelling bee, we may also be interested in docu- ments about spelling, but not those which contain only bee. For research project, on the other hand, we are likely to be interested in documents which contain either research or project in isolation, and for swan song, we are only going to be interested in documents which contain the phrase swan song, and not just swan or song.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an unsupervised ap- proach based on Wikitionary for predicting which components of a given MWE have a composi- tional usage. Experiments over two widely-used datasets show that our approach outperforms state- of-the-art methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Previous studies which have considered MWE compositionality have focused on either the iden- tification of non-compositional MWE token in- stances <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kim and Baldwin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fazly et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Forthergill and Baldwin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Muzny and Zettlemoyer, 2013)</ref>, or the prediction of the com- positionality of MWE types <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Reddy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al., 2014</ref>). The identification of non-compositional MWE tokens is an important task when a word combination such as kick the bucket or saw logs is ambiguous between a compositional (generally non-MWE) and non-compositional MWE usage. Approaches have ranged from the unsupervised learning of type-level preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fazly et al., 2009</ref>) to su- pervised methods specific to particular MWE con- structions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kim and Baldwin, 2007)</ref> or applica- ble across multiple constructions using features similar to those used in all-words word sense disambiguation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Forthergill and Baldwin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Muzny and Zettlemoyer, 2013)</ref>. The prediction of the compositionality of MWE types has tradi- tionally been couched as a binary classification task (compositional or non-compositional: <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baldwin et al. (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bannard (2006)</ref>), but more re- cent work has moved towards a regression setup, where the degree of the compositionality is pre- dicted on a continuous scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Reddy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al., 2014</ref>). In ei- ther case, the modelling has been done either over the whole MWE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Reddy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook, 2013)</ref>, or relative to each component within the MWE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baldwin et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bannard, 2006)</ref>. In this paper, we focus on the binary classification of MWE types relative to each component of the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MWE.</head><p>The work that is perhaps most closely related to this paper is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al. (2014)</ref>, who use translation data to predict the compositionality of a given MWE rel- ative to each of its components, and then combine those scores to derive an overall compositionality score. In both cases, translations of the MWE and its components are sourced from PanLex ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baldwin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kamholz et al., 2014)</ref>, and if there is greater similarity between the translated components and MWE in a range of languages, the MWE is predicted to be more compositional. The basis of the similarity calculation is unsuper- vised, using either string similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Salehi and Cook, 2013)</ref> or distributional similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al., 2014</ref>). However, the overall method is su- pervised, as training data is used to select the languages to aggregate scores across for a given MWE construction. To benchmark our method, we use two of the same datasets as these two pa- pers, and repurpose the best-performing methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al. (2014)</ref> for classification of the compositionality of each MWE component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>Our basic method relies on analysis of lexical overlap between the component words and the def- initions of the MWE in Wiktionary, in the man- ner of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lesk (1986)</ref>. That is, if a given component can be found in the definition, then it is inferred that the MWE carries the meaning of that compo- nent. For example, the Wiktionary definition of swimming pool is "An artificially constructed pool of water used for swimming", suggesting that the MWE is compositional relative to both swimming and pool. If the MWE is not found in Wiktionary, we use Wikipedia as a backoff, and use the first paragraph of the (top-ranked) Wikipedia article as a proxy for the definition.</p><p>As detailed below, we further extend the basic method to incorporate three types of information found in Wiktionary: (1) definitions of each word in the definitions, (2) synonyms of the words in the definitions, and (3) translations of the MWEs and components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Definition-based Similarity</head><p>The basic method uses Boolean lexical overlap be- tween the target component of the MWE and a definition. A given MWE will often have multiple definitions, however, begging the question of how to combine across them, for which we propose the following three methods.</p><p>First Definition (FIRSTDEF): Use only the first-listed Wiktionary definition for the MWE, based on the assumption that this is the predom- inant sense.</p><p>All Definitions (ALLDEFS): In the case that there are multiple definitions for the MWE, cal- culate the lexical overlap for each independently and take a majority vote; in the case of a tie, label the component as non-compositional.</p><p>Idiom Tag (ITAG): In Wiktionary, there is fa- cility for users to tag definitions as idiomatic. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> If, for a given MWE, there are definitions tagged as idiomatic, use only those definitions; if there are no such definitions, use the full set of definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Synonym-based Definition Expansion</head><p>In some cases, a component is not explicitly men- tioned in a definition, but a synonym does occur, indicating that the definition is compositional in that component. In order to capture synonym- based matches, we optionally look for synonyms of the component word in the definition, 2 and ex- pand our notion of lexical overlap to include these synonyms.</p><p>For example, for the MWE china clay, the defi- nition is kaolin, which includes neither of the com- ponents. However, we find the component word clay in the definition for kaolin, as shown below.</p><p>A fine clay, rich in kaolinite, used in ce- ramics, paper-making, etc.</p><p>This method is compatible with the three definition-based similarity methods described above, and indicated by the +SYN suffix (e.g. FIRSTDEF+SYN is FIRSTDEF with synonym- based expansion).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Translations</head><p>A third information source in Wiktionary that can be used to predict compositionality is sense-level translation data. Due to the user-generated na- ture of Wiktionary, the set of languages for which ENC EVPC WordNet 91.1% 87.5% Wiktionary 96.7% 96.2% Wiktionary+Wikipedia 100.0% 96.2% <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Lexical coverage of WordNet, Wik- tionary and Wiktionary+Wikipedia over our two datasets.</p><p>translations are provided varies greatly across lexi- cal entries. Our approach is to take whatever trans- lations happen to exist in Wiktionary for a given MWE, and where there are translations in that lan- guage for the component of interest, use the LCS- based method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref> to mea- sure the string similarity between the translation of the MWE and the translation of the compo- nents. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref>, however, we do not use development data to select the opti- mal set of languages in a supervised manner, and instead simply take the average of the string simi- larity scores across the available languages. In the case of more than one translation in a given lan- guage, we use the maximum string similarity for each pairing of MWE and component translation.</p><p>Unlike the definition and synonym-based ap- proach, the translation-based approach will pro- duce real rather than binary values. To combine the two approaches, we discretise the scores given by the translation approach. In the case of dis- agreement between the two approaches, we label the given MWE as non-compositional. This re- sults in higher recall and lower precision for the task of detecting compositionality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">An Analysis of Wiktionary Coverage</head><p>A dictionary-based method is only as good as the dictionary it is applied to. In the case of MWE compositionality analysis, our primary concern is lexical coverage in Wiktionary, i.e., what propor- tion of a representative set of MWEs is contained in Wiktionary. We measure lexical coverage rela- tive to the two datasets used in this research (de- scribed in detail in Section 4), namely 90 En- glish noun compounds (ENCs) and 160 English verb particle constructions (EVPCs). In each case, we calculated the proportion of the dataset that is found in Wiktionary, Wiktionary+Wikipedia (where we back off to a Wikipedia document in the case that a MWE is not found in Wiktionary) and WordNet <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>. The results are found in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and indicate perfect coverage in Wik- tionary+Wikipedia for the ENCs, and very high coverage for the EVPCs. In both cases, the cov- erage of WordNet is substantially lower, although still respectable, at around 90%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Datasets</head><p>As mentioned above, we evaluate our method over the same two datasets as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref> (which were later used, in addition to a third dataset of German noun compounds, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al. (2014)</ref>): (1) 90 binary English noun com- pounds (ENCs, e.g. spelling bee or swimming pool); and (2) 160 English verb particle construc- tions (EVPCs, e.g. stand up and give away). Our results are not directly comparable with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al. (2014)</ref>, however, who evaluated in terms of a regression task, modelling the overall compositionality of the MWE. In our case, the task setup is a binary clas- sification task relative to each of the two compo- nents of the MWE.</p><p>The ENC dataset was originally constructed by The EVPC dataset was constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bannard (2006)</ref>, and manually annotated for com- positionality on a binary scale for each of the head verb and particle. For the 160 EVPCs, 76% are verb-compositional and 48% are particle- compositional. On average, each EVPC in this dataset has 3.0 senses (definitions) in Wiktionary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>The baseline for each dataset takes the form of looking for a user-annotated idiom tag in the Wik- tionary lexical entry for the MWE: if there is an id- iomatic tag, both components are considered to be non-compositional; otherwise, both components are considered to be compositional. We expect this method to suffer from low precision for two  reasons: first, the guidelines given to the annota- tors of our datasets might be different from what Wiktionary contributors assume to be an idiom. Second, the baseline method assumes that for any non-compositional MWE, all components must be equally non-compositional, despite the wealth of MWEs where one or more components are com- positional (e.g. from the Wiktionary guidelines for idiom inclusion, 3 computer chess, basketball player, telephone box).</p><note type="other">81.2 88.1 84.5 87.3 80.6 73.3 ITAG+SYN COMB(LCS+DS+DSL2) 81.0 88.1 84.1 88.0 81.1 73.9</note><p>We also compare our method with: (1) "LCS", the string similarity-based method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref>, in which 54 languages are used; (2) "DS", the monolingual distributional similarity method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al. (2014)</ref>; (3) "DS+DSL2", the multilingual distributional similarity method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al. (2014)</ref>, including supervised lan- guage selection for a given dataset, based on cross- validation; and (4) "LCS+DS+DSL2", whereby the first three methods are combined using a su- pervised support vector regression model. In each case, the continuous output of the model is equal-width discretised to generate a binary classification. We additionally present results for the combination of each of the six methods pro- posed in this paper with LCS, DS and DSL2, us- ing a linear-kernel support vector machine (rep- resented with the suffix " COMB(LCS+DS+DSL2) " for a given method). The results are based on cross- 3 http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ Wiktionary:Idioms_that_survived_RFD validation, and for direct comparability, the parti- tions are exactly the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al. (2014)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 2 and 3</ref> provide the results when our pro- posed method for detecting non-compositionality is applied to the ENC and EVPC datasets, respec- tively. The inclusion of translation data was found to improve all of precision, recall and F-score across the board for all of the proposed methods. For reasons of space, results without translation data are therefore omitted from the paper.</p><p>Overall, the simple unsupervised methods pro- posed in this paper are comparable with the unsu- pervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salehi and Cook (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Salehi et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Error Analysis</head><p>We analysed all items in each dataset where the system score differed from that of the human annotators. For both datasets, the majority of incorrectly-labelled items were compositional but predicted to be non-compositional by our sys- tem, as can be seen in the relatively low preci- sion scores in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 2 and 3</ref>. In many of these cases, the prediction based on definitions and syn- onyms was compositional but the prediction based on translations was non-compositional. In such cases, we arbitrarily break the tie by labelling the instance as non-compositional, and in doing so favour recall over precision. Some of the incorrectly-labelled ENCs have a gold-standard annotation of around 2.5, or in other words are semi-compositional. For exam- ple, the compositionality score for game in game plan is 2.82/5, but our system labels it as non- compositional; a similar thing happens with figure and the EVPC figure out. Such cases demonstrate the limitation of approaches to MWE composi- tionality that treat the problem as a binary clas- sification task.</p><p>On average, the EVPCs have three senses, which is roughly twice the number for ENCs. This makes the prediction of compositionality harder, as there is more information to combine across (an effect that is compounded with the addition of syn- onyms and translations). In future work, we hope to address this problem by first finding the sense which matches best with the sentences given to the annotators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed an unsupervised approach for predicting the compositionality of an MWE rel- ative to each of its components, based on lexi- cal overlap using Wiktionary, optionally incorpo- rating synonym and translation data. Our experi- ments showed that the various instantiations of our approach are superior to previous state-of-the-art supervised methods.

The sampling was random in an attempt to make the dataset bal- anced, with 48% of compositional English noun compounds, of which 51% are compositional in the first component and 60% are compositional in the second component. We generate discrete la- bels by discretising the component-wise composi- tionality scores based on the partitions [0, 2.5] and (2.5, 5]. On average, each NC in this dataset has 1.4 senses (definitions) in Wiktionary.</figDesc></figure>
