				<p>In this paper we present PaCCSS-IT, a Parallel Corpus of Complex-Simple Sentences for ITalian. To build the resource we develop a new method for automatically acquiring a corpus of complex-simple paired sentences able to intercept structural transformations and particularly suitable for text simplification. The method requires a wide amount of texts that can be easily extracted from the web making it suitable also for less-resourced languages. We test it on the Italian language making available the biggest Italian corpus for automatic text simplification.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The availability of monolingual parallel corpora is a prerequisite for research on automatic text sim- plification (ATS), i.e. the task of reducing sentence complexity by preserving the original meaning. This has been recently shown for different languages, e.g. English ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wubben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Siddharthan and Angrosh, 2014</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Spanish (Bott and Saggion, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bott and Saggion, 2014</ref>), French ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brouwers et al., 2014</ref>), Portuguese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Caseli et al., 2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Danish (Klerke and SÃ¸gaard, 2012</ref>), Italian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brunato et al., 2015)</ref>. While English can rely on large datasets like the well-known Parallel Wikipedia Simplification cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coster and Kauchak, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhu et al., 2010)</ref> and, more recently, the Newsela corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>, for other languages similar resources are dif- ficult to acquire and tend to be very small, thus pre- venting the application of data-driven techniques to automatically induce simplification operations. This is true for the language we are considering, i.e. Italian, where the only documented corpus for text simplification contains approximately 1,000 aligned original and manually simplified sentences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brunato et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we present PaCCSS-IT, a Parallel Corpus of Complex-Simple Aligned Sentences for ITalian. To build the resource we developed a new approach for automatically acquiring a large corpus of paired sentences containing structural transfor- mations which can be used as a developmental re- source for text simplification systems. The proposed approach relies on monolingual sentence alignment techniques which have been exploited in different scenarios such as e.g. paraphrase detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barzilay and Lee, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dolan et al., 2004</ref>) and evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen and Dolan, 2011</ref>), question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fader et al., 2013)</ref>, textual en- tailment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bosma and Callison-Burch, 2007)</ref>, ma- chine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Marton et al., 2009</ref>), short answer scoring ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Koleva et al., 2014</ref>), domain adaptation of dependency parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Choe and McClosky, 2015)</ref>. Specifically in ATS, these techniques are typically applied to already existing parallel corpora; in this case the task of aligning the original sentence to its corresponding simple version can be tackled by ap- plying similarity metrics that consider the TF/IDF score of the words in the sentence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nelken and Shieber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coster and Kauchak, 2011</ref>) or methods taking into account also the order in which information is presented ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bott and Saggion, 2011</ref>).</p><p>Differently from these methods, our approach contains two important novelties: the typology of the starting data and consequently the methodol- ogy developed to build the complex-simple aligned corpus. To overcome the scarcity of large paral- lel corpora of complex and simple texts in less- resourced languages like Italian, we started from a wide amount of texts that can be easily extracted from the web for all languages. This makes our method less expensive since it does not need a man- ually created corpus of aligned documents.</p><p>The proposed alignment method has been strongly shaped by the perspective from which we investigate text simplification, i.e. syntactic rather than lexical simplification. While lexical simplifi- cation aims at the substitution of complex words by simpler synonyms, syntactic simplification attempts to reduce complexity at grammatical level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bott and Saggion, 2014)</ref>. As shown by comparative analy- ses of monolingual parallel corpora in many lan- guages, syntactic simplification concerns transfor- mations affecting e.g. verbal features, the order of phrases or the deletion of redundant or unnecessary words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brunato et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bott and Saggion, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coster and Kauchak, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Caseli et al., 2009)</ref>. Fol- lowing this second perspective we define a method for bootstrapping and pairing sentences that inter- cepts simplification operations at morpho-syntactic and syntactic level typically used by human experts when simplify real texts.</p><p>Section 2 illustrates the approach to automatically acquire the corpus of complex-simple aligned sen- tences. In Section 3, the approach is tested and tuned on a development corpus. In Section 4, our approach is applied on a large corpus thus obtaining the final corpus of paired sentences, named PaCCSS-IT. In this last section, we also provide a global evaluation of the whole process and a qualitative analysis of the linguistic phenomena related to sentence complexity that we intercepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Approach</head><p>Our approach for automatically acquiring the collec- tion of paired sentences combines three steps. In a first step, we devised an unsupervised methodol- ogy i) to collect pools of sentences from a large cor- pus with overlapping lexicon but possible different structures; ii) to rank the resulting candidate sen- tences according to a similarity metric intended to bootstrap lexical-equivalent pairs undergoing struc- tural transformations. In the second step, the top-list of the ranked pairs was manually revised and used to develop a classifier based on lexical, morpho- syntactic and syntactic features to detect the sen- tences correctly paired. In the third step, the indi- vidual sentences of each pair were ordered with re- spect to linguistic complexity computed by using an automatic readability assessment tool.</p><p>This approach has been tuned on PAIS`APAIS` PAIS`A 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lyding et al., 2014</ref>) and tested on ItWaC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni et al., 2009</ref>). The two analysed corpora were auto- matically POS tagged by the Part-Of-Speech tagger described in Dell'Orletta (2009) and dependency- parsed by the DeSR parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Attardi et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>PAIS`APAIS` PAIS`A is a freely distributed corpus of texts with Creative Commons license automatically harvested from the web. This corpus includes approximately 388,000 documents for a total of 250 millions of tokens and it is a large existing corpus of authen- tic contemporary texts in Italian which is free of copyright restrictions. ItWaC is the largest exist- ing corpus of authentic contemporary texts in Ital- ian. It is a 2 billion word corpus constructed from the Web limiting the crawl to the .it domain and us- ing medium-frequency words from La Repubblica journalistic corpus and Basic Italian Vocabulary lists as seeds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Unsupervised Step</head><p>The first step is aimed at clustering all sentences contained in a large corpus. To be included in the same cluster, the sentences have to share all lem- mas tagged with the Part-Of-Speech (POS) "noun", "verb", "numeral", "personal pronoun" and "nega- tive adverb". Nouns and verbs were selected be- cause they capture the informational content of a sentence. The other functional categories have also to be shared, otherwise the meaning of the sentence would be altered. For example, the deletion of the negative adverb non (not) in one of the two follow- ing sentences would convey the opposite meaning: Non farei mai una cosa del genere! (I would never do something like that) Non potevo fare una cosa del genere. (I could not do something like that). In the overlapping process we did not take into account the linear order of the considered lemma POS. This was meant to capture lexically-equivalent sentences undergoing potential structural transformations (e.g. passivization, topicalization).</p><p>All sentences within the same cluster were paired and the pairs were ranked for similarity by calcu- lating the cosine distance between the sentence vec- tors. Each vector is constituted by the frequencies in the cluster of all lemma of the sentence. The co- sine similarity served to discard different and equal or quasi-equal sentences.</p><p>The whole unsupervised step was used to select the set of candidate pairs reducing the number of pairs on which the following supervised step had been applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Supervised Step</head><p>The supervised step is meant to classify whether candidate pairs were correctly or incorrectly aligned. To this end, we built a classifier based on Support Vector Machines with a quadratic kernel using LIB- SVM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang and Lin, 2001</ref>) that was trained on a corpus of paired sentences correctly aligned. The classifier used different types of linguistic features, i.e. lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic, meant to mainly capture structural transformations occur- ring in the paired sentences.</p><p>These features were extracted both calculating their distribution in each sentence and consider- ing their overlap between the two paired sentences. They can be classified into the following types: cosine similarity feature: it refers to the cosine value calculated for each pair of sentences; raw text feature: it refers to the sentence length cal- culated in terms of i) tokens of each of the two paired sentences and ii) the different number of tokens be- tween the two sentences; lexical features: they refer to i) the lemma uni- grams contained in the two sentences excluding the PoS already considered in the pairing process (i.e. nouns, verbs, numerals, personal pronouns, negative adverbs); ii) the distribution of word unigrams over- lapping between the two paired sentences consider- ing all PoS. morpho-syntactic feature: it refers to the distribu- tion of up to 4-grams of coarse grained Parts-Of- Speech; syntactic features: they refer to i) the distribution of up to 4-grams of dependency types calculated with respect to the hierarchical parse tree structure and the surface linear ordering of words; ii) the distribu- tion of up to 4-grams of coarse grained Parts-Of- Speech of a dependent (d) involved in a dependency relation and the dependency relation type (t) with re- spect to the hierarchical parse tree structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Readability Assessment Step</head><p>In the third step, the individual sentences of each classified pair were ordered with respect to linguistic complexity computed by using an automatic read- ability assessment tool. In text simplification re- search it is widely accepted the use of readability as- sessment metrics for evaluating the transformations that reduce sentence complexity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vajjala and Meurers, 2016)</ref>. Since our approach is devoted to building re- sources for developing ATS systems, we relied on readability assessment techniques to rank the indi- vidual sentences of the pair. To this aim, we used READ-IT (Dell'Orletta et al., 2011), the only exist- ing NLP-based readability assessment tool devised for Italian. It operates on syntactically parsed texts and assigns to each sentence a score quantifying its readability. The assigned readability score ranges between 0 (easy-to-read) and 1 (difficult-to-read) referring to the percentage probability for the docu- ments or sentences to belong to the class of difficult- to-read documents. The two poles were defined on two typologies of texts belonging to the same tex- tual genre (i.e. newswire texts) but intended for dif- ferent users: adults with a rudimentary literacy level or with mild intellectual disabilities for the easy-to- read pole and readers of a national daily newspaper considered of medium difficulty for â¼70% of Italian laymen for the difficult-to-read pole.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tuning Process and Evaluation</head><p>In order to tune and evaluate each step of the pro- posed approach, we tested it on PAIS`APAIS` PAIS`A. We first pruned from the corpus the sentences with a num- ber of tokens &lt;5 and &gt;40. The resulting sentences were then grouped with respect to their shared POS (i.e. nouns, verbs, numerals, personal pronouns and negative adverbs) and paired using cosine similarity.  We obtained 256,383 clusters containing at least two sentences. In order to discard different and equal or quasi-equal sentences we empirically set two cosine pruning thresholds: we discarded pairs with cosine below 0.4 since they were too lexically different and above 0.93 since they were too identical.</p><p>To build the training set for the supervised step we selected a subset of pairs resulting from the un- supervised step at different cosine similarity scores. This subset was manually reviewed by two native- speaker linguists with a background in text sim- plification. Specifically, they reviewed a subset of 10,543 pairs at different cosine similarity scores, i.e. those comprised between 0.92 and 0.83. In order to evaluate sentence similarity at lower values we also selected cosine scores 0.71 and 0.70. In the end, we obtained 4,327 correct pairs (i.e. about 41% of the whole set of candidate sentence pairs) distributed as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>This manually revised set of pairs was then used to test the classifier in two different experimental scenarios. In the first one, named Known Cosine, KC, we tested the classifier in a five-fold cross val- idation process where pairs of sentences belonging to all the cosine scores were contained in each train- ing and test set. In the second experiment, named Unknown Cosine, UC, the manually-revised corpus was differently split. In this case, the test set was composed by pairs of sentences with a cosine simi- larity score not contained in the training set and con- sequently twelve classification runs were performed.</p><p>In order to assess the discriminating power of the linguistic features used in the classification, we car- ried out an Information Gain analysis. This analy- sis showed the effectiveness of all the selected fea- tures in both experiments (i.e. KC, UC). In particu- lar, we observed that the best ranked features are the morpho-syntactic and syntactic ones. This might suggest that our classification approach is intercept- ing pairs of sentences undergoing different typolo- gies of structural transformations involving e.g. the use of verbal features or the order of phrases. Sen- tence length and lexical features play a lower dis- criminative role with respect to the grammatical fea- tures; this follows from the constraints we put on the unsupervised sentence pairing process. As it can be expected, the best ranked features are those provid- ing information about the overlapping characteris- tics of the paired sentences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and 2 report the results for each cosine threshold considered in the manual revision of the two experiments respectively in terms of i) Accu- racy in the classification of the correct and incorrect alignments, and of ii) Precision, Recall of the classi- fication of the correct alignments. As it can be noted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, in both experiments the classifier is able to outperform the process of sentence pairing based only on the cosine (i.e. line Cosine, that represents the unsupervised step of the pairing process). As we can expect, Precision, Recall and Accuracy of the KC experiment are higher than the classification re- sults obtained in the UC. The latter represents a more challenging experimental scenario where the classi- fier is tested on a cosine threshold unseen in training. The overall results for the KC and the UC experi- ments are respectively 73.95% and 58.71% in terms of Precision, 70.3% and 68.1% in terms of Recall; and respectively 77.64% and 67.2% in terms of Ac- curacy. These results are significantly higher when compared with the accuracy of 41% reported for the unsupervised alignment (i.e. line Cosine). Interest- ingly, in the KC experiment, Precision and Recall lines are close and they remain stable with respect to all cosines even if the distribution of correct pairs varies in the different cosine values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the accuracy of our classifier at different confidence thresholds (i.e. the probability assigned by the classifier for the correct alignments) for both the KC and UC experiments. Note that for each confidence intervals we have a different num- ber of total pairs, and of gold-correct alignments and gold-incorrect alignments. As expected, the perfor- mance grows as the confidence grows. Interestingly, in the KC scenario, the classifier reached up to 90% of accuracy in discriminating the correct from the incorrect alignments when the classifier has a confi- dence score â¥0.90. These results look very promis- ing if we consider that 30% of the pairs of the whole test set classified as correct alignments is comprised in the subset for which the classifier is more con- fident. This is also the case of the UC experiment, where, even if with lower accuracies, more than 56% of the correct alignments occurs when the classifier has a confidence score â¥0.90.</p><p>We carried out a last evaluation to estimate the classifier performance in the UC scenario for low cosine ranges not comprised in the manually revised portion of the corpus (from 0.45 to 0.75, exclud- ing cosines 0.70 and 0.71). We considered only the pairs classified as correct with a confidence score of â¥85%. As expected, the system performance grows as the cosine grows: only few correct pairs occur at cosine &lt;0.60, at cosine 0.60-0.65 the classifier as- signs the correct class 237 times with an accuracy of 62.97%, at 0.65-0.69 330 times with 71.82% and at 0.72-0.75 256 times with an accuracy of 87.89%. According to these evaluations, we extracted from PAISÂ´APAISÂ´ PAISÂ´A those pairs with a confidence score â¥ 85% and cosine similarity between 0.6 and 0.93, resulting in a collection of about 20,000 pairs. In the last step, the sentences in each pair were ranked according to the readability score automat- ically assigned by READ-IT making a collection of complex-simple aligned sentences. However, the average difference of the readability score between the complex and simple sentences is only 0.13, mak- ing this collection not so useful for ATS. For this reason, we selected only pairs with a difference of readability score higher than a significant threshold set at 0.2. We defined this threshold on the basis of previous empirical experiments carried out using READ-IT on different typologies of texts. Lower variations of READ-IT score are scarcely perceived by human subjects. Since the construction of this resource has been specifically designed to develop ATS systems for human target, this READ-IT varia- tion is a fundamental parameter of PaCCSS-IT. We thus obtained about 4,450 pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PaCCSS-IT</head><p>The unsupervised step applied to ItWaC resulted in â¼28 million of clusters with overlapping lexicon for a total of â¼35 million of single sentences. From this initial set we pruned sentences with a number of tokens &lt;5 and &gt;40 and clusters containing less than two sentences. We obtained 419,252 clusters for a total of â¼8,5 million of single sentences and an average number of pairs in each cluster of 1,613. Filtering the pairs according to the cosine similarity range defined in the development step, we obtained a subset of 73,142 clusters with an average of â¼112 pairs for each. The classifier with the same model tested on PAISÂ´APAISÂ´ PAISÂ´A recognised about 1 million of cor- rect aligned pairs. Excluding pairs below the confi- dence score â¥ 85% we obtained â¼284,000 pairs. This collection was further pruned selecting only those pairs with at least 0.2 points in terms of vari- ation in readability score. PaCCSS-IT is the result- ing resource. It is a freely available resource 2 com- posed of â¼63,000 pairs of sentences (â¼126k sen- tences) ranked with respect to the readability score of the two sentences. For each pair the cosine sim- ilarity, the probability score of the classifier and the readability level of the sentences are provided.</p><p>The following sections report the evaluation and the qualitative analysis we carried out on PaCCSS- IT. The evaluation was performed to assess the re- liability of sentence alignment and of the sentence ranking with respect to readability level. The qual- itative analysis was focused on studying which lin- guistic phenomena typically related to text simplifi- cation are successfully intercepted by our approach in order to show the applicability of the resource in a ATS scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation</head><p>The evaluation process was intended to calculate the accuracy of i) the automatic classification process in predicting correct sentence alignments and ii) the automatic readability ranking of each pair.</p><p>The alignment evaluation was carried out by two trained linguists who manually revised 40 pairs of randomly selected sentences for each cosine score (1,088 paired sentences). It resulted that 85% of pairs were correctly classified (i.e. 921 pairs) and precision increases as cosine grows (from 73.2% at cosine 0.65-0.69 to 90.8% at cosine 0.90-0.92).</p><p>The subset of 921 pairs correctly classified was further investigated with respect to the readability level automatically assigned. To this aim we elicited human judgements through the crowdsourcing plat- form CrowdFlower <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . We collected judgements from 7 workers that were asked to rate for each pair which of the two individual sentences was simpler. We considered the majority label to be true label for each pair. Comparing the score obtained by our sys- tem with the human judgements we obtained an ac- curacy of 74%. Restricting the evaluation only to pairs with the same label assigned by at least five out seven annotators (i.e. 79% of the whole pairs), the system achieved an accuracy of 78%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Qualitative Analysis</head><p>Two qualitative analyses were carried out on PaCCSS-IT. The first analysis took into account the subset of 921 revised pairs with the aim of manu- ally investigating what kinds of sentence transfor- mations previously observed in the literature on text simplification were intercepted by our approach. In the second one, the whole resource was automati- cally investigated to study how the alignment pro- cess impacts on the distribution of multi-level lin- guistic features correlated to sentence complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Analysis of Simplification Operations</head><p>Following the classification of simplification op- erations proposed in the literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brunato et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bott and Saggion, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coster and Kauchak, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Caseli et al., 2009</ref>), we identified the major types of operations occurring in the subset of revised pairs 4 , namely:</p><p>Deletion: the second sentence (S) does not con- tain one or more than two words occurring in the first one (C):</p><p>â¢ C: Ma c'` e un altro problema, ancorapÃ¬ u grave.</p><p>[Lit: But there is another problem, even more serious.]</p><p>â¢ S: Poi c'` e un altro problema.</p><p>[Lit: Then there is another problem.]</p><p>Verbal Features: the two sentences differ with respect to verbal mood and tense:</p><p>â¢ C: I suoi libri sono stati tradotti in molte lingue.</p><p>[Lit: His books have been translated in many languages.]</p><p>â¢ S: I suoi libri sono tradotti in diverse lingue.</p><p>[Lit: His books have been translated in differ- ent languages.]</p><p>Lexical Substitution: the two sentences contain synonyms of words tagged with POS which were not considered in the clustering step based on POS over- lapping, e.g. adjectives, adverbs:</p><p>â¢ C: Il colorÃ¨ e un rosso rubino fittissimo, quasi impenetrabile, limpido.</p><p>[Lit: The color is a rubyred very dense, almost impenetrable, clear.]</p><p>â¢ S: Il colorÃ¨ e un rosso rubino vivo quasi impen- etrabile.</p><p>[Lit: The color is a bright red ruby almost impenetrable.]</p><p>Reordering: the two sentences contain a differ- ent word order both at single word (e.g. subject in pre-vs. post-verbal position) and phrase level (e.g a subordinate clause proceeds vs. follows the main clause):</p><p>â¢ C: Ringraziandola per la sua cortese atten- zione, resto in attesa di risposta.</p><p>[Lit: Thank- ing you for your kind attention, I look forward to your answer.]</p><p>â¢ S: Resto in attesa di una risposta e ringrazio vivamente per l'attenzione.</p><p>[Lit: I look forward to your answer and I thank you greatly for your attention.]</p><p>Insertion: the second sentence contains one or n- words more than the first one:</p><p>â¢ C: In attesa di un sollecito riscontro, distinti saluti.</p><p>[Lit: Waiting for an early reply, yours faithfully.]</p><p>â¢ S: In attesa di un riscontro porgiamo distinti saluti.</p><p>[Lit: Waiting for a reply, we offer our regards.]</p><p>Sentence Type: the two sentences differ with re- spect to their form (i.e. affirmative vs. interroga- tive):</p><p>â¢ C: Quale consiglio darebbe ai genitori? [Lit:</p><p>Which advice would you give to parents?]</p><p>â¢ S: Diamo un consiglio ai genitori.</p><p>[Lit: Let's give an advice to parents.]</p><p>For each operation there can be different degrees of sentence transformation. For example, focusing on Verbal Feature, the example reported above rep- resents a "light" transformation while a "stronger" transformation can occur when the verb changes from the conditional to the indicative mood (or vice versa), as in the following pair:</p><p>â¢ C: Sarebbe un grave un errore.</p><p>[Lit: It would be a serious error.]</p><p>â¢ S: MÃ  e un grave errore.</p><p>[Lit: But it is a serious error.] <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> reports the distribution of these sentence operations in the manually revised portion of the corpus. The distribution in All cosines shows that the two most frequent operations are deletion (30.74%) and changes affecting verbal features (26.30%). Ac- cording to the literature, the deletion of redundant information (e.g. adjectives, adverbs) is one of the main phenomena typically related to reduction of complexity. Also transformations of verbal fea- tures are likely to intercept simplification operations in a language like Italian with a rich inflectional paradigm. The third most frequent operation is lexi- cal substitution (15.52%). According to the POS fil- ter used in the unsupervised step of sentence align- ment, this operation affects morpho-syntactic cate- gories such as e.g. adverbs, adjectives, conjunctions or prepositions which are substituted with a sim- pler synonym. Reordering and insertion of words or phrases are respectively the fourth and the fifth types of transformation. Reordering can be ex- pected as a simplification strategy especially when it yields a more canonical word order. The dis- tribution of reordering here reported, i.e. 14.24%, is quite high if compared to the distribution of the same operation found in hand-crafted simplified cor- pora where it represents about 8% of sentence oper- ations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brunato et al., 2015)</ref>. This result gives ev- idence that our approach succeeds in automatically intercepting this kind of syntactic transformation. In the manually revised portion of PaCCSS-IT inser- tion represents 12.72% of the whole operations. De- spite inserting words or phrases could make more complex a sentence, this operation is used in the simplification process e.g. when it makes explicit missing arguments in elliptical clauses more fre- quently used in non-standard language varieties or sublanguages such as legal language. This is the case of the heterogeneous nature of the corpus from which PaCCSS-IT derives, where documents char- acterized by non-canonical languages (e.g. blogs, e-mails) or domain-specific documents (e.g. ad- ministrative acts) are mixed to texts representative of more standard varieties, e.g. newspapers, novels.</p><p>Let us consider the relation between simplifica- tion operations, cosine values and readability levels. For what concerns the distribution of the operations at different cosines <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4)</ref>, we observe that dele- tion is the most frequent operation at all cosines, in particular at lower cosines i.e. &lt;.70. At high cosines, i.e. &gt;.90, operations affecting word order and verbal features increase. The relation between readability score and sentence operations is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. Specifically, we calculated how the dis- tribution of operations changes with increasing dif- ferences between the readability score assigned to the complex and the simple sentence of each pair. Although it is difficult to study the effect of each sin- gle operation on the readability score variation since these operations are usually applied in combination, we observe some clear tendencies. In particular, operations concerning deletion and verbal features are the most frequent ones both at lower and higher readability scores differences. However, they have an opposite distribution: transformations of verbal features increase at higher readability differences (&gt;0.6) while deletions decrease. For what concerns the other operations, the trend is quite homogeneous along with the different readability scores. In par- ticular, this is the case of reordering thus showing the proposed approach is able to intercept syntactic transformations which impact at different readabil- ity variations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Analysis of Linguistic Phenomena</head><p>The second qualitative analysis focused on the whole resource which was searched for linguistic phenomena correlating with the process of sentence alignment. To this end, we compared the distribu- tion of a set of different linguistic features, i.e. raw text, lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic, auto- matically extracted from the set of complex and sim- ple sentences of PaCCSS-IT, which was previously tagged and dependency-parsed. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> we report a selection of the features with a statistically signifi- cant variation <ref type="bibr">5</ref> between the complex and the simple sentences. As expected, the average sentence length (feature <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>) of the Simple sentence is lower than the Complex one. The higher distribution of adjec- tives <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, adverbs <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> and determiners <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> might be related to the insertion of simple lexicon belonging to the Basic Italian Vocabulary <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(De Mauro, 2000</ref>). The distribution of verbal moods is also significantly correlated to a higher readability level: simple sen- tences have a higher percentage of indicatives <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> (a simple mood indicating a state of being or reality) and less participles <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> and gerundives <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> which are non finite moods and thus can be more ambiguous with respect to the reference. In addition, sentences classified as complex have higher parse trees <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, longer dependency links <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> and longer embedded complement chains modifying a noun <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, all fea- tures correlated with syntactic complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gibson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lin, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frazier, 1985)</ref>. On the contrary, sentences classified as simple are characterised by a more canonical word order (Subject-Verb-Object in Italian) i.e. a lower distribution of post-verbal sub- jects <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> and of pre-verbal objects <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. These sen- tences also contain a higher distribution of subordi- nate clauses following the main clause <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>, an order easier to process.</p><p>Since syntactic features intercepting the structure of the sentence (e.g. parse tree depth and depen- dency length) heavily depend on the overall sentence length, we carried out an analysis only on pairs of sentences where the complex and the simple sen- tence have the same number of tokens (i.e. 15,958 pairs in PaCCSS-IT) and we compared how linguis- tic features vary between the complex and the sim- ple sentences of these pairs. We observed that sim- ple sentences have a more canonical position of the subject (i.e. a lower percentage distribution of post- verbal subjects: C: 18.14%, S: 15.72%) and of the object (i.e. a lower percentage distribution of pre- verbal objects: C: 1.52%, S: 1.18%). Simple sen- tences have also lower parsed trees (C: 2.42, S: 2.37) and shorter embedded complement chains modify- ing a noun (C: 0.27, S: 0.26). Since these variations cannot be due to sentence shortening, they rather fol- low from reordering phenomena e.g. changing from active to passive voice.</p><p>The distribution of linguistic features here re- ported has already been observed in hand-crafted corpora of complex and simple sentences for Italian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brunato et al., 2015)</ref>. This is a further evidence of the reliability of our method for automatically creat- ing corpora of complex-simple sentences.</p><p>Feature Complex Simple Variation <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> 8.98 7.80 0.97 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> 4.10 7.90 -3.80 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> 9.10 10.0 -0.85 <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> 0.34 1.43 -1.10 <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> 10.70 20.30 -9.61 <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> 5.20 2.72 2.49 <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> 0.47 0.04 0.42 <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> 2.89 4.29 -1.40 <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> 79.18 80.91 -1.73 <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> 1.33 1.57 -0.24 <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> 2.03 2.14 -0.10 <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> 8.35 7.33 0.5 <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> 2.88 2.70 0.18 <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> 1.76 1.63 0.12 <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> 0.44 0.41 0.02 <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> 15.37 14.37 1.00 <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> 2.03 1.38 0.65 <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> 3.29 4.17 -0.90  <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> are absolute values, the others are percentage distributions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have presented PaCCSS-IT, a cor- pus of complex-simple aligned sentences for Italian containing â¼63,000 paired sentences. To our knowl- edge, PaCCSS-IT is the biggest corpus of complex- simple aligned sentences, with the exception of En- glish. It resulted from a new method for automat- ically acquiring corpora of parallel sentences able to capture structural transformations and particularly suitable for text simplification systems. A compara- tive analysis of the multi-level linguistic features in the complex and simple sentences showed that this method intercepts linguistic phenomena character- ising simplification operations previously observed in manually-created complex-simple corpora. A main novelty of the proposed approach is that it does not rely on a large pre-existing corpus of aligned complex-simple documents like e.g. the English and Simple English Wikipedia. This makes it very ap- propriate for less-resourced languages. In addition, since the method does not need parallel corpora, the dimension of the web is the only limitation to the size of the corpus that could be created.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Accuracy of the KC and UC experiments compared with the distribution of correctly paired sentences at different cosine similarity scores.</figDesc></figure>
