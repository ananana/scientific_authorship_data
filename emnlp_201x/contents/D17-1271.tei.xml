				<p>This paper addresses the automatic recognition of telicity, an aspectual notion. A telic event includes a natural endpoint (she walked home), while an atelic event does not (she walked around). Recognizing this difference is a prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In En-glish, this classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category. In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb&apos;s meaning and even available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows. We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context information, improving automatic telicity classification for English significantly compared to previous work. We also create a new data set of English texts manually annotated with telicity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper addresses the computational modeling of telicity, a linguistic feature which represents whether the event type evoked by a sentence's verb constellation (i.e., the verb and its arguments and modifiers) has a natural endpoint or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Comrie, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Smith, 1997)</ref>, see (1a) and (1b). Automatic recognition of telicity is a neces- sary step for natural language understanding tasks that require reasoning about time, e.g., natural language generation, summarization, question an- swering, information extraction or machine trans- lation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moens and Steedman, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Siegel and McKeown, 2000</ref>). For example, there is an en- tailment relation between English Progressive and Perfect constructions (as shown in <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>), but only for atelic verb constellations. |= He has swum across the lake.</p><p>We model telicity at the word-sense level, cor- responding to the fundamental aspectual class of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Siegel and McKeown (2000)</ref>, i.e., we take into ac- count the verb and its arguments and modifiers, but no additional aspectual markers (such as the Progressive). In (2) we classify whether the event types "swim in the lake" and "swim across the lake" have natural endpoints. This is defined on a linguistic level rather than by world knowledge requiring inference. "Swimming in the lake" has no natural endpoint, as also shown by the linguis- tic test presented in <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. In contrast, "swimming across the lake" will necessarily be finished once the other side is reached.</p><p>In English, the aspectual notion of telicity is a covert category, i.e., a semantic distinction that is not expressed overtly by lexical or morphological means. As illustrated by (2) and (3), the same verb type (lemma) can introduce telic and atelic events to the discourse depending on the context in which it occurs. In Slavic languages, aspect is a component of verb meaning. Most verb types are either perfec- tive or imperfective (and are marked as such in dictionaries). For example, the two occurrences of "drink" in (3) are translated into Czech using the imperfective verb "pil" and the perfective verb "vypil," respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Filip, 1994)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">: 1 (4) (a) Pil kávu. (imperfective)</formula><p>He was drinking (some) coffee.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(b) Vypil kávu. (perfective)</formula><p>He drank up (all) the coffee.</p><p>Our contributions are as follows: (1) using the English-Czech part of InterCorp <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Cermák and Rosen, 2012</ref>) and a valency lexicon for Czech verbs <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Zabokrtsk´yZabokrtsk´y and Lopatková, 2007)</ref>, we cre- ate a large silver standard with automatically de- rived annotations and validate our approach by comparing the labels given by humans versus the projected labels; (2) we provide a freely available data set of English texts taken from MASC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ide et al., 2010</ref>) manually annotated for telicity; (3) we show that using contextual features and the sil- ver standard as additional training data improves computational modeling of telicity for English in terms of F 1 compared to previous work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Siegel and McKeown (2000, henceforth SMK2000) present the first machine-learning based approach to identifying completedness, i.e., telicity, determining whether an event reaches a culmination or completion point at which a new state is introduced. Their approach describes each verb occurrence exclusively using features reflect- ing corpus-based statistics of the corresponding verb type. For each verb type, they collect the co-occurrence frequencies with 14 linguistic markers (e.g., present tense, perfect, combination with temporal adverbs) in an automatically parsed background corpus. They call these features linguistic indicators and train a variety of machine learning models based on 300 clauses, of which roughly 2/3 are culminated, i.e., telic. Their test set also contains about 300 clauses, corresponding to 204 distinct non-stative verbs. Their data sets are not available, but as this work is the most closely related to ours, we reimplement their approach and compare to it in Section 5.</p><p>Samardži´Samardži´c and Merlo (2016) create a model for real-world duration of events (as short or long) of English verbs as annotated in TimeBank ( <ref type="bibr">Pustejovsky et al., 2003)</ref>. The model is informed by temporal boundedness information collected from parallel English-Serbian data. Their only features are how often the respective verb type was aligned to Serbian verbs carrying certain affixes that indi- cate perfectiveness or imperfectiveness. Their us- age of "verb type" differs from ours as they do not lemmatize, i.e., they always predict that "falling" is a long event, while "fall" is short. Our approach shares the idea of projecting aspectual information from Slavic languages to English, but in contrast to classifying verb types, we classify whether an event type introduced by the verb constellation of a clause is telic or atelic, making use of a machine- readable dictionary for Czech instead of relying on affix information.</p><p>Loáiciga and Grisot <ref type="formula">(2016)</ref> create an automatic classifier for boundedness, defined as whether the endpoint of an event has occurred or not, and show that this is useful for picking the correct tense in French translations of the English Simple Past. Their classifier employs a similar but smaller fea- ture set compared to ours. Other related work on predicting aspect include systems aiming at identi- fying lexical aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Siegel and McKeown, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Friedrich and Palmer, 2014</ref>) or habituals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mathew and Katz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Cross-linguistic annotation projection ap- proaches mostly make use of existing manually created annotations in the source language; similar to our approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Diab and Resnik (2002)</ref> and Marasovi´c <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marasovi´c et al. (2016)</ref> leverage properties of the source language to automatically induce annotations on the target side.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data sets and annotation projection</head><p>We conduct our experiments based on two data sets: (a) English texts from MASC manually an- notated for telicity, on which we train and test our computational models, and (b) a silver standard automatically extracted via annotation projection from the Czech-English part of the parallel cor- pus InterCorp, which we use as additional training data in order to improve our models. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Gold standard: MASC (EN)</head><p>We create a new data set consisting of 10 En- glish texts taken from MASC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ide et al., 2010)</ref>, annotated for telicity. Texts include two essays, a journal article, two blog texts, two history texts from travel guides, and three texts from the fic-MASC (gold standard) InterCorp (silver standard) intersection <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">clauses (instances)  1863  457,000  - % telic  82  55  - % atelic  18  45  -  distinct verb types (lemmas)  567  2262  510  ambiguous verb types  70  1130  69   Table 1</ref>: Corpus statistics.</p><p>tion genre. Annotation was performed using the web-based SWAN system ( <ref type="bibr">Gühring et al., 2016)</ref>. Annotators were given a short written manual with instructions. We model telicity for dynamic (even- tive) verb occurrences because stative verbs (e.g., "like") do not have built-in endpoints by defini- tion. Annotators choose one of the labels telic and atelic or they skip clauses that they consider to be stative. In a first round, each verb occurrence was labeled by three annotators (the second author of this paper plus two paid student assistants). They unanimously agreed on telicity labels for 1166 verb occurrences; these are directly used for the gold standard. Cases in which only two annota- tors agreed on a telicity label (the third annotator may have either disagreed or skipped the clause) are labeled by a fourth independent annotator (the first author), who did not have access to the la- bels of the first rounds. This second annotation round resulted in 697 further cases in which three annotators gave the same telicity label. Statistics for our final gold standard, which consists of all instances for which at least three out of the four annotators agreed, are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>; "ambigu- ous" verb types are those for which the gold stan- dard contains both telic and atelic instances. 510 of the 567 verb types also occur in the InterCorp silver standard, which provides training instances for 69 out of the 70 ambiguous verb types. Finally, there are 446 cases for which no three annotators supplied the same label. Disagreement and skipping was mainly observed for verbs in- dicating attributions ("critics claim" or "the film uses"), which can be perceived either as statives or as instances of historic present. Other difficult cases include degree verbs ("increase"), aspectual verbs ("begin"), perception verbs ("hear"), itera- tives ("flash") and the verb "do." For these cases, decisions how to treat them may have to be made depending on the concrete application; for now, they are excluded from our gold standard. Another source of error is that despite the training, anno- tators sometimes conflate their world knowledge (i.e., that some events necessarily come to an end eventually, such as the "swimming in the lake" in (2)) with the annotation task of determining telic- ity at a linguistic level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Silver standard: InterCorp (EN-CZ)</head><p>We create a silver standard of approximately 457,000 labeled English verb occurrences (i.e., clauses) extracted from the InterCorp parallel cor- pus project <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Cermák and Rosen, 2012</ref>). We lever- age the sentence alignments, as well as part-of- speech and lemma information provided by In- terCorp. We use the data from 151 sentence- aligned books (novels) of the Czech-English part of the corpus and further align the verbs of all 1:1-aligned sentence pairs to each other using the verbs' lemmas, achieving high precision by mak- ing sure that the translation of the verbs is licensed by the free online dictionary Glosbe. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We then look up the aspect of the Czech verb in Vallex 2.8.3 ( ˇ Zabokrtsk´yZabokrtsk´y and Lopatková, 2007), a va- lency lexicon for Czech verbs, and project the la- bel telic to English verb occurrences correspond- ing to a perfective Czech verb and the label atelic to instances translated using imperfective verbs.</p><p>Our annotation projection approach leverages the fact that most perfective Czech verbs will be translated into English using verb constellations that induce a telic event structure, as they describe one-time finished actions. Imperfective verbs, in contrast, are used for actions that are presented as unfinished, repeated or extending in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Vintr, 2001</ref>). They are often, but not always, translated using atelic verb constellations. A notable excep- tion is the English Progressive: "John was read- ing a book" signals an ongoing event in the past, which is telic at the word-sense level but would require translation using the imperfective Czech verb "ˇ cetl." The initial corpus contained 4% sen- tences in the Progressive, out of which 89% were translated using imperfectives. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Due to the above described mismatch, we remove all English Pro- gressive sentences from our silver standard. Statis- tics for the final automatically created silver stan- dard are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>For validation, we sample 2402 instances from the above created silver standard and have our three annotators from the first annotation round mark them in the same way as the MASC data. Sampling picked one instance per verb type but was otherwise random. A majority agreement among the three annotators can be reached in 2126 cases (due to allowing skipping). <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In this sam- ple, 77.8% of the instances received the label telic from the human annotators, 61.5% received the la- bel telic from the projection method. The accuracy of our projection method can be estimated as about 78%; F 1 for the telic class is 0.84, F 1 for atelic is 0.65. Errors made by the projection include for instance habituals, which use the imperfective in Czech but are not necessarily atelic at the event type level as in "John cycles to work every day."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Computational modeling</head><p>In this section, we describe the computational models for telicity classification, which we test on the MASC data and which we improve by adding the InterCorp silver standard data.</p><p>Features. We model each instance by means of a variety of syntactic-semantic features, using the toolkit provided by . <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Pre- processing is done using Stanford CoreNLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chen and Manning, 2014</ref>) based on dkpro <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Eckart de Castilho and Gurevych, 2014</ref>). For the verb's lemma, the features include the WordNet <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998</ref>) sense and supersense and linguistic indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Siegel and McKeown, 2000</ref>) extracted from GigaWord ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Graff et al., 2003)</ref>. Using only the latter as features corresponds to the system by SMK2000 as described in Section 2. The fea- ture set also describes the verb's subject and ob- jects; among others their number, person, count- ability 7 , their most frequent WordNet sense and the respective supersenses, and dependency rela- tions between the argument and its governor(s). In addition, tense, voice and whether the clause is in the Perfect or Progressive aspect is reflected, sample only 66% of Progressives received the label atelic. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Of the 2402 cases, annotators completely agreed on 1577 cases <ref type="bibr">(1114 telic, 203 atelic, 260 skipped</ref> as well as the presence of clausal (e.g., temporal) modifiers. For replicability we make the configu- ration files for the feature set available.</p><p>Classifier. We train L1-regularized multi-class logistic regression models using LIBLINEAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fan et al., 2008</ref>) with parameter settings ε=0.01 and bias=1. For each instance described by fea- ture vector x, the probability of each possible label y (here telic or atelic) is computed according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (y| x) = 1 Z( x) exp m i=1 λ i f i (y, x)</formula><p>, where f i are the feature functions, λ i are the weights learned for each feature function, and Z( x) is a normalization constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Klinger and Tomanek, 2007</ref>). The feature functions f i indi- cate whether a particular feature is present, e.g., whether the tense of the verb is "past."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>Experimental settings. We evaluate our models via 10-fold cross validation (CV) on the MASC data set. We split the data into folds by documents in order to make sure that no training data from the same document is available for each instance in order to avoid an unfair bias. We report re- sults in terms of accuracy, F 1 per class and macro- average F 1 (the harmonic mean of macro-average precision and recall). We test significance between differences in F 1 (for each class) using approxi- mate randomization <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Yeh, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Padó, 2006</ref>) with p &lt; 0.1 and significance between differences in accuracy using McNemar's test <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McNemar, 1947)</ref> with p &lt; 0.01. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows our results: signif- icantly different scores are marked with the same symbol where relevant (per column).</p><p>Results. A simple baseline of labeling each in- stance with the overall majority class (telic) has a very high accuracy, but the output of this baseline is uninformative and results in a low F 1 . Rows ti- tled "verb type" use the verb's lemma as their sin- gle feature and thus correspond to the informed baseline of using the training set majority class for each verb type. Rows labeled "+IC" indicate that the full set of instances with projected la- bels extracted from InterCorp has been added as additional training data in each fold; in rows ti- tled "+ICs," the telic instances in InterCorp have been upsampled to match the 80:20 distribution in MASC. Our model using the full set of features significantly outperforms the verb type baseline as well as SMK2000 (see † ‡ * ). Using the ad- ditional training data from InterCorp results in a large improvement in the case of the difficult (be- cause infrequent) atelic class (see ), leading to the best overall results in terms of F 1 . The best re- sults regarding accuracy and F 1 are reached using the sampled version of the silver standard; the dif- ferences compared to the respective best scores in each column (in bold) are not significant.</p><p>Ablation experiments on the MASC data show that features describing the clause's main verb are most important: when ablating part-of-speech tag and tense and aspect (Progressive or Perfect), per- formance deteriorates by 1.8% in accuracy and 5% F 1 , hinting at a correlation between telicity and choice of tense-aspect form. Whether this is due to an actual correlation of how telic and atelic verbs are used in context or merely due to annotation er- rors remains to be investigated in future work.</p><p>In sum, our experiments show that using anno- tations projected onto English text from parallel Czech text as cheap additional training data is a step forward to creating better models for the task of classifying telicity of verb occurrences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>Our model using a diverse set of features repre- senting both verb-type relevant information and the context in which a verb occurs strongly out- performed previous work on predicting telicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Siegel and McKeown, 2000</ref>). We have shown that silver standard data induced from parallel Czech- English data is useful for creating computational models for recognizing telicity in English. Our new manually annotated MASC data set is freely available; the projected annotations for InterCorp are published in a stand-off format due to license restrictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Future work</head><p>Aspectual distinctions made by one language rarely completely correspond to a linguistic phe- nomenon observed in another language. As we have discussed in Section 3.2, telicity in English and perfectiveness in Czech are closely related. As shown by our experiments, the projected la- bels cover useful information for the telicity clas- sification task. One idea for future work is thus to leverage additional projected annotations from similar phenomena in additional languages, pos- sibly improving overall performance by combin-  ing complementary information. Clustering more than two languages may also enable us to induce clusters corresponding to the different usages of imperfective verbs in Czech.</p><p>The presence of endpoints has consequences for the temporal interpretation of a discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Smith, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Smith and Erbaugh, 2005</ref>), as endpoints introduce new states and therefore signal an ad- vancement of time. In English, boundedness, i.e., whether an endpoint of an event has actually oc- curred, is primarily signaled by the choice of tense and Progressive or Perfect aspect. In tense-less languages such as Mandarin Chinese, bounded- ness is a covert category and closely related to telicity. We plan to leverage similar ideas as pre- sented in this paper to create temporal discourse parsing models for such languages.</p><p>When translating, telic and atelic constructions also require different lexical choices and appropri- ate selection of aspectual markers. Hence, telic- ity recognition is also relevant for machine trans- lation research and could be a useful component in computer aided language learning systems, help- ing learners to select appropriate aspectual forms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(a) Mary ate an apple.
