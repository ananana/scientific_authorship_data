				<p>In this paper, we present our work in emotion cause extraction. Since there is no open dataset available, the lack of annotated resources has limited the research in this area. Thus, we first present a dataset we built using SINA city news. The annotation is based on the scheme of the W3C Emotion Markup Language. Second, we propose a 7-tuple definition to describe emotion cause events. Based on this general definition, we propose a new event-driven emotion cause extraction method using multi-kernel SVMs where a syntactical tree based approach is used to represent events in text. A convolution kernel based multi-kernel SVM are used to extract emotion causes. Because traditional convolution kernels do not use lexical information at the terminal nodes of syntactic trees, we modify the kernel function with a synonym based improvement. Even with very limited training data, we can still extract sufficient features for the task. Evaluations show that our approach achieves 11.6% higher F-measure compared to refer-enced methods. The contributions of our work include resource construction, concept definition and algorithm development.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the rapid growth of Internet, people can easily share experiences and emotions through this power- ful medium anywhere and anytime. How to analyze the emotions of individuals through their writings becomes a new challenge for NLP. In recent years, s- * corresponding author tudies in emotion analysis focus on emotion classifi- cation including detection of emotions expressed by writers of text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gao et al., 2013</ref>) as well as predic- tion of reader emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chang et al., 2015)</ref>. There are also some information extraction tasks in emo- tion analysis, such as extracting the feeler of emo- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010)</ref>. However, these methods need to observe emotion linked ex- pressions. Sometimes, however, we care more about the stimuli, or the cause of an emotion. For instance, manufacturers want to know why people love, or hate a certain product. The White House may al- so prefer to know the cause of the emotional text "Let us hit the streets" rather than the distribution of different emotions.</p><p>There are three main challenges in the study of e- motion cause extraction. The first is that, up to now, there is no open dataset available for emotion cause extraction. This may explain why there are only few studies on emotion causes. The second is that, there is no formal definition about event in emotion cause extraction even though some researches claim that they extract events of emotion causes ( ). The third is that, due to the complexity in annotation, the size of corpus for emotion cause extraction is usually very small. Due to this limitation, many machine learning method- s are not suited for emotion cause detection. How to mine deep knowledge of a language for emotion causes is another thorny issue.</p><p>In this paper, we first present an annotated dataset for emotion cause extraction to be released to the public. We then propose to use a 7-tuple to define emotion cause events. Based on this general defi-nition, we then present a new event-driven emotion cause extraction method. The basic idea is to ex- tract events in the context of emotional text through dependency parsing. Then, a syntactic structure is used to represent nearby events. Based on this struc- tured representation of events, a modified convolu- tion kernel which also takes lexical features(as ter- minal nodes) is used to determine whether an event is emotion cause relevant. This method can detect all possible combinations of syntactic structures to obtain sufficient features for emotion analysis us- ing a limited training set. Compared to existing methods, which either use manual rules or com- monsense knowledge to extend information, our ap- proach is completely machine learning based and it still achieves state-of-the-art performance. The con- tributions of this work include both resource devel- opment and algorithm development.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec- tion 2 provides a review of related works on emotion analysis. Section 3 presents emotion cause relat- ed definitions and the construction of emotion cause extraction corpus. Section 4 gives the event-driven emotion cause extraction method and section 5 is the evaluations and discussions. Section 6 concludes this work and gives the future directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Works</head><p>Identifying emotion categories in text is an essen- tial subject in NLP and its applications ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, emotion causes can provide important in- formation on why there is any emotion changes. In this section, we introduce related works on the emo- tion analysis and emotion cause extraction.</p><p>The first issue in emotion analysis is to determine the taxonomy of emotions. Researchers have pro- posed a list of primary emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Plutchik, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ekman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Turner, 2000)</ref>. In this study, we adop- t Ekman's emotion classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ekman, 1984)</ref>, which identifies six primary emotions, namely hap- piness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust and surprise, known as the "Big6" 1 scheme in the W3C Emotion Markup Language. This list is agreed upon by most previous works in Chinese emotion analysis.</p><p>The second issue is how to do emotion clas- sification and emotion information extraction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beck (Beck et al., 2014</ref>) proposed a Multi-task Gaussian-process based method for emotion clas- sification. Xu ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) used a coarse to fine method to classify emotions in Chinese blog. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gao (Gao et al., 2013</ref>) proposed a joint model to co- train a polarity classifier and an emotion classifier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chang (Chang et al., 2015)</ref> used linguistic template to predict reader's emotions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Das (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010</ref>) used an unsupervised method to extract emotion feelers from Bengali blog. There are other studies focused on joint learning with sen- timent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Luo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mohtarami et al., 2013</ref>), emotion in tweets or blog <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hasegawa et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Qadir and Riloff, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ou et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Quan and Ren, 2009)</ref>, and emotional lexicon construction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Staiano and Guerini, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mohammad and Turney, 2013)</ref>. However, these related works all focused on analysis of emo- tion expressions rather than emotion causes.. Sophia M. Y. Lee first proposed a task on emotion cause extraction ( . They manual- ly constructed a corpus from Academia Sinica Bal- anced Chinese Corpus. Based on this corpus, Chen and Lee (  proposed a rule based method to detect emotion causes. The basic idea is to make linguistic rules for cause extraction. Some studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gui et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li and Xu, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gao et al., 2015</ref>) extended the rule based method to in-formal text in Weibo text (Chinese tweets).</p><p>Other than rule based methods, Ghazi <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ghazi et al., 2015</ref>) used CRFs to extract emotion caus- es. However, it requires emotion cause and emo- tion keywords to be in the same sentence. I. Rus- so <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Russo et al., 2011</ref>) proposed a crowd-sourcing method to obtain emotion cause related common- sense knowledge. But it is challenging to extend the commonsense knowledgebase automatically.</p><p>Resources used in the above works are not pub- licly accessible. Most of the methods used are rule based. Learning based methods are quite limited be- cause annotated data is quite small in size due to high cost for annotation. Thus, rule based meth- ods seem to be the easiest way to achieve acceptable performance. Since machine learning methods re- quire more knowledge, which is difficult to general- ize. So automatic methods only focused on simple text genre.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Construction of Emotion Cause Corpus</head><p>In this section, we first describe the linguistic phe- nomenon in emotion expressions. It serves as the in- spiration to develop the annotated dataset. We then introduce details of the annotation scheme, followed by the construction of the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linguistic Phenomenon of Emotion Causes</head><p>Emotion causes play an important role in emotion expressions. An emotion cause reveals the stimulus of an emotion. Considering linguistic phenomenon of emotion causes, we follow three basic principles in corpus construction: (1) Keep the whole context of emotion expression; (2) The basic processing unit is at the clause level; and (3) Use of formal text.</p><p>In written text, there is an emotion keyword, which is used to express an emotion, in the context of the emotion cause. Thus, finding the appropri- ate context of emotion keywords in the annotation is the pre-requisite to identify its cause. It is the reason why we keep the whole context of emotion keywords.</p><p>Another important kind of cues is the presence of conjunctions and prepositions. These words indi- cate the discourse information between clauses. In order to make use of discourse information, the ba- sic analysis unit should be at clause level rather than at sentence level.</p><p>In the third principle, we choose the formal tex- t in corpus construction. According to the related works, emotion expressions can have overlapping e- motion cause and emotion target ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gui et al., 2014</ref>) in informal text. This is why some studies even in- corporate cause extraction with target identification to improve performance. However, our focus is on emotion cause identification. We use formal news text to avoid the potential mix up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Collection and Annotation</head><p>We first take 3 years (2013-15) Chinese city news from NEWS SINA 2 containing 20,000 articles as the raw corpus. Based on a list of 10,259 Chinese pri- mary emotion keywords (keywords for short) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2008)</ref>, we extract 15,687 instances by key- word matching from the raw data. Here, we call the presence of an emotion keyword as an instance in the corpus. For each matched keyword, we extract three preceding clauses and three following clauses as the context of an instance. If a sentence has more than 3 clauses in each direction, the context will in- clude the rest of the sentence to make the context complete. For simplicity, we omit cross paragraph context.</p><p>Note that the presence of keywords does not nec- essarily convey emotional information due to differ- ent possible reasons such as negative polarity and sense ambiguity. For example, " /wishes" is an emotion word of "happiness". It can also be the name of a song. Also, the presence of emotion keywords does not necessarily guarantee the exis- tence of emotional cause neither. After removing those irrelevant instances, there are 2,105 instances remain. For each emotional instance, two annotators manually annotate the emotion categories and the cause(es) in the W3C Emotion Markup Language (EML) format. Ex1 shows an example of an anno- tated emotional sentence in the corpus, presented by the original simplified Chinese, followed by its En- glish translation. To save space, we remove the xml tags in the annotation. The original annotated data is in a subsidiary file <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The basic analysis unit is a clause. Emotion cause is marked by &lt;cause&gt;, and the emotion keyword is marked by &lt;keywords&gt;. E- motion type, POS, position and the length of anno- tation are also annotated in Emotionml format. <ref type="bibr">Ex.1: 55 1979</ref><ref type="bibr">Ex.1: 55 1936</ref>" "&lt;cause POS="v" Dis="-1"&gt; &lt;/cause&gt; &lt;keywords type=happiness&gt;&lt;/keywords&gt; Mr. Zhu is 55 years old. He started working in 1979 as a barber when he was 19 , and has 36 years of experience. "I was assigned to work at the Barbershop in Danyang, Nanjing. It is the largest barbershop in Danyang. I won many awards and honors there." &lt;cause POS="v" Dis="-1"&gt;Talking about his honors&lt;/cause&gt;, Mr. Zhu is so &lt;keywords type="happiness"&gt; proud &lt;/keywords&gt;.</p><p>Ex.1 only contains one cause. However, one key- word may have more than one corresponding emo- tion causes. In Ex.2, there are two relevant causes  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Instance  2,105  Clauses  11,799  Emotion Cause  2,167  Document with 1 emotion  2,046  Document with 2 emotion  56  Document with 3 emotion  3   Table 1</ref>: Details of the Dataset for one keyword. In our dataset, only 59 instances have two or more causes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ex.2:</head><p>&lt;cause POS="v" Dis="-2"&gt; &lt;/cause&gt;&lt;cause POS="v" Dis="-1"&gt; &lt;/cause&gt;&lt;keywords type=sadness&gt; &lt;/keywords&gt; During persuasion, firemen realized that the woman attempted suicide because of &lt;cause POS="v" Dis="- 2"&gt;the hold back of wages by the employer&lt;/cause&gt;, and &lt;cause POS="v" Dis="-1"&gt;her family asked for money urgently&lt;/cause&gt;, she feels &lt;keywords type=sadness&gt;helpless&lt;/keywords&gt; and thus</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Details of Dataset and Its Annotations</head><p>Each instance in our dataset contains only one emo- tion keyword and at least one emotion cause. It is ensured that the keyword instance and the causes are relevant. The number of extracted instances, claus- es, and emotion causes are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Note that 97.2% of the instances has only one emotion cause, and instances that have two and three emo- tion causes hold 2.6% and 0.2% respectively. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  2</ref> shows the distribution of emotion types and Ta- ble 3 shows the distribution of cause positions. In the latter we can see that 78% emotion causes ad- join the emotion keywords at the clause level. Ap- parently, position plays a very important role in e- motion cause extraction. Thus, using distance based features for emotion cause extraction is rational and necessary. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> lists the phrase types of emotion causes. Verbs and verb phrases cover 93% of al- l cause events. Thus, our learning algorithm mainly focus on them.</p><p>Two annotators work independently during the annotation process. The key point is to distinguish clause level and phrase level in cause annotation. The clause level labels the clause which contains the emotion cause. The phrase level determines the boundary of an emotion cause. When two annota-   tors have different opinion on one instance at clause level, we involve a third annotator as the arbitrator.</p><p>In the phrase level, we use the larger boundary of the two annotations when they have the same anno- tation at the clause level. We reach 0.9287 for the kappa value on clause level annotation which con- firmed the reliability of our annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Event-Driven Emotion Cause Extraction</head><p>Due to the complexity of annotation in emotion cause identification, the size of annotated corpus is usually small. Since we aim to use machine learning methods to automatically learn and identify caus- es, we use a convolution kernel to detect all pos- sible combinations in the syntactic structure. This allows learning from syntactic representations for e- motion cause extraction. The basic idea of our pro- posed method is to use a tree-structure representa- tion to capture features for emotion cause identifica- tion. For training data, we extract all valid tree struc- tures for each event, referred to as the ETs (Even- t Trees  multi-kernel SVMs using the training set to classi- fy candidate ETs in the testing set. Since more than 97% emotion keywords only have one cause, and more than 95% causes are near the emotion key- words, candidate ETs are extracted from the context of emotion keywords. We only choose the ET with the highest probability in the classification result as the emotion cause.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Event Tree Construction</head><p>Even though there are related works on event identi- fication in emotion cause detection, there is no for- mal definition of events In area of artificial intelli- gence (AI), researchers, such as Radinsky (Radinsky et al., 2012), gave a formal definition of an even- t as "action, actor, object, instrument, location and time". In our work, we need to give clear definition of event first.</p><p>In emotion cause extraction, the components of an event should be simpler. We are only interested in the action, the actor and the object, which are de- noted as P , O 1 , O 2 , respectively, following the con- ventions in AI. Since Chinese is a SVO language, the actor is the subject and the action is the verb. The subject and the object of a sentence may have attributes and a predicate may have adverbial and complement. Since these components may also be helpful in emotion cause extraction, we formally de- fine an emotion cause event as a 7-tuple:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e = (Att O 1 , O 1 , Adv, P, Cpl, Att O 2 , O 2 ).</formula><p>Here, Att O 1 is the attribute of O 1 Att O 2 is the attribute of O 2 Adv is the adverbial of the predi- cate P and Cpl is P 's complement. In case syn- tactic components are not present, NIL values are used. Note that the main cue in an event is P , the ac- tion. So, in our algorithm, we extract all verbs from the text, and use dependency parsing <ref type="bibr">4</ref> to extract all relevant syntactic components specified in e. Then, we can construct an ET.</p><p>An ET has has a fixed height of four levels. The top level is the root node. Since Chinese is a SVO language, the descendant of the root is S(subject), V(verb), and O(object). Then, the seven even- t components can be categorized and filled up in the relevant slots.  to O. Then we can get the ET based on the definition of an event.</p><p>Let us review Ex.1 and Ex.2 again. There are three emotion cause events below with their corre- sponding ETs shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1.</ref> 1."/Talking about his honors" 2."/ the hold back wages by employ- ers" 3."/ her family asked for money ur- gently"</p><p>After the construction of the ETs, emotion cause extraction becomes a classification problem. If an ET is an emotion cause, the label should be positive. Otherwise, the label should be negative. A binary classifier should be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Emotion Cause Extraction</head><p>After the construction of ETs, we obtain positive and negative ET samples. Due to small amount of train- ing samples, it is necessary to capture all features in the ETs. We choose convolution kernel based SVMs because it can search all possible syntactic features under a tree structure.</p><p>Convolution kernel function</p><p>The convolution kernel, also known as the tree k- ernel ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Collins and Duffy, 2002)</ref>, is widely used in many NLP tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Srivastava et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moschitti, 2006</ref>). For any two inputs T 1 and T 2 based on a tree structure , the kernel is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">K(T 1 , T 2 ) = n 1 ∈T 1 n 2 ∈T 2 δ(n 1 , n 2 ).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, n 1 and n 2 are tree nodes. δ is a function defined recursively: 1.δ(n 1 , n 2 ) = 0 if the productions of n 1 and n 2 are different; 2.Else, δ(n 1 , n 2 ) = 1 if n 1 and n 2 are matching in pre-terminals; 3.Otherwise,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">δ(n 1 , n 2 ) = i (1 + δ(c(n 1 , i), c(n 2 , i))).</formula><p>Here, c(n, i) is the i-th node of n.</p><p>However, the above tree kernel definition does not consider terminals, which means that the actual words in a sentence are ignored. As emotions causes are semantically meaningful, we need to incorporate lexical information into the convolution kernel.</p><p>Modified kernel function In order to distinguish different ETs, we need to modify the definition of the tree kernel to include lexical words in a clause. So we add one more defi- nition to include the terminals: 4.If n 1 and n 2 are terminal nodes, δ(n 1 , n 2 ) = 1 if and only if n 1 and n 2 are synonyms. Otherwise δ(n 1 , n 2 ) = 0.</p><p>Here a synonym is defined in Tongyici Cilin (Ex- tended). 5 which has 17,817 synonyms and 77,343 words. We use the synonym rather than word match- ing because the size of the corpus is limited. simple word matching is quite sparse.</p><p>Let K ET −O denote the original kernel and K ET −M denote the modified kernel, respectively. It can be easily proven that K ET −M is a valid ker- nel function. Following the notation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collins and Duffy, 2002</ref>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K ET −O = i h i (T 1 ) · h i (T 2 )</formula><p>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h i (T 1 ) = n 1 ∈N 1 I i (n 1 ), h i (T 2 ) = n 2 ∈N 2 I i (n 2 ) and</formula><p>the function I i (n) is 1 if the sub-tree i is rooted at node n and 0 otherwise. So the original tree k- ernel is an inner product and the kernel matrix is <ref type="bibr">5</ref> http://ir.hit.edu.cn/demo/ltp/Sharing Plan.htm semi-definite. In our modified kernel, the func- tion I i (n) is more complicated. Beside the defi- nition above, it has the following additional defi- nition : I i (n) is 1 if i is a terminal node and it is a synonym of n. The new indicator is marked as I i (n). Then we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">K ET −M (T 1 , T 2 ) = n 1 ∈T 1 n 2 ∈T 2 i I i (n 1 )I i (n 2 )</formula><p>. This means that the modified kernel is symmetrical and the kernel matrix is semi-definite. In our work, K ET −M uses SVM optimization and the code is from SVM-light-TK <ref type="bibr">6</ref> .</p><p>Multi-kernel function Since there are only syntactic information and synonyms in the convolution kernel based method, we need to add some lexical features. Given a 7- tuple event e, we obtain the bag-of-words based or word embedding based representation for each com- ponent in e, and the distance between a component and emotion keywords are used as the features, re- spectively. Let the features of each component in e be R i , for every i ∈ e. Then, we can capture the feature set, F , of an ET by a joint operation, called the ET features:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">F = {R Att O 1 ⊕ R O 1 ⊕ ... ⊕ R Att O 2 }.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We can join the ET features with syntactic informa- tion by a multi-kernel function. For any two ETs T 1 and T 2 , with the respective features F 1 and F 2 , the two new multi-kernels can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Knew+O(T1, T2) = KET −O (T1, T2) + Kvec(F1, F2), (3) Knew * O(T1, T2) = KET −O (T1, T2) × Kvec(F1, F2), (4) Knew+M (T1, T2) = KET −M (T1, T2) + Kvec(F1, F2), (5) Knew * M (T1, T2) = KET −M (T1, T2) × Kvec(F1, F2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>In the experiments, we stochastically select 90% of the dataset as training data and 10% as testing da- ta. In order to obtain statistically credible results, we evaluate our methods and the reference methods 25 times. We conduct two sets of experiments. The first one evaluates the performance at the clause lev- el to identify the clauses that contain emotion caus- es. The second one evaluates emotion causes using verb classification. This is because 93.21% of emo- tion causes are verb/verb phrase and verbs serve as the action component in event definition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Emotion Cause Extraction</head><p>We use the commonly accepted measure proposed by Lee ( ) for emotion cause extrac- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li and Xu, 2014)</ref>. In this measure, if a roposed emotion cause covers the an- notated answer, the sequence is considered correct. Te precision, recall, and F-measure are defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P recision = correct cause1 proposed cause1 , Recall = correct cause1 annotated cause1 , F − measure = 2 × P recision × Recall P recision + Recall .</formula><p>In the experiment, evaluation is conducted for the following works: 1.RB(Rule based method): Among several rule based methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gui et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li and Xu, 2014</ref>). We use lee2010's rules (listed in Appendix of this paper).    <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> to <ref type="formula">(6)</ref>. The performance result is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>. A- mong all methods, K new * M achieves the top perfor- mance in F-measure. Compared to other methods, the improvement is significant with p-value less than 0.01 in t-test.</p><note type="other">K ET −O 0.3982 0.4134 0.4057 K ET −M 0.4583 0.4745 0.4662 K new+O 0.6446 0.6779 0.6608 K new * O 0.6492 0.6701 0.6595 K new+M 0.6588 0.6927 0.6752 K new * M 0.6673 0.6841 0.6756</note><p>Even though RB achieves the top precision, its F- measure is limited by the low recall. Since CB is opposite to RB, the performance by RB+CB is im- proved. However, the improvement is quite limited, at 0.0127 in F-measure. The F-measure of our re- produced RB is similar to mentioned result of other references ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gui et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li and Xu, 2014</ref>). They repeat Lee's ( ) method and achieve the F-measure with 0.55 more or less.</p><p>(  reported that by using hand- crafted rules as features to train a classifier with some additional features such as conjunction, action and epistemic verbs, performance can be improved significantly. In our experiment, the result is oppo- site to this claim. The main reason is the samples in ( ) are less complex. About 85% of the emotion causes are in the same clause where the emotion keywords are. Our corpus is quite dif- ferent. The percentage of causes in the same clause where the emotion keyword itself is has only about <ref type="bibr">23.6%. (Chen et al., 2010)</ref>'s method does not han- dle long distance relations well. This explains why it does not work well for our dataset. Although (RB+CB+ML) does not perform well, there is still 0.0334 improvement in F-measure compare to RB. Among our proposed methods, K vec on the ET fea- ture achieves 0.4285 in F-measure. Compare to CB and ML, the performance is not satisfactory. How- ever, as a simple feature to represent lexical informa- tion, the performance is acceptable. word2vec also yield similar result. Maybe the joint operation is too simple to handle composition.</p><p>For the modified tree kernel K ET −M , the perfor- mance is 0.0605 higher than the original tree ker- nel K ET −O in F-measure. It means that the consid- eration of terminal node improves the performance of the tree kernel significantly. The modified tree kernel K ET −M is also 0.0377 higher than K vec , and 0.0526 higher than K word2vec in F-measure. This means kernel based syntactic representation does have better generalization ability. The origi- nal kernel function K ET −O has syntactic informa- tion but no lexicon, and it not only underperforms compared to K ET −M but also K vec and K word2vec . This demonstrates our modified kernel function can effectively turn an inferior method into a superior one. Compared to rule based method, the perfor- mance still needs to be enhanced and a multi-kernel is necessary. After the combination with ET feature using a multi-kernel, the performance of K new * M achieves a higher level with 0.6756 in F-measure. Compare to RB, the improvement in F-measure is 0.1513. Compare to the combination of existing methods, the improvement is 0.1159. The reason is that our method represents events at the syntactic level. Synonym information gives the model more generalization ability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Verb Classification for Emotion Cause</head><p>In this section, we examine the performance of ETs classification with respect to verbs identified in the emotion clauses.</p><p>ETs Classification Our method is based on ETs classification to choose the candidate ET with the highest probabili- ty. The performance is measured by the verbs in the identified ET. Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>Note that K word2vec performs much better than</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Method Precision Recall F-measure K vec 0.3500 0.2951 0.3192 K word2vec 0.3200 0.4833 0.3848 K ET −O 0.3906 0.2773 0.3228 K ET −M 0.3978 0.3303 0.3473 K new+O 0.4211 0.7219 0.5319 K new * O 0.4197 0.7305 0.5331 K new+M 0.4407 0.7694 0.5651 K new * M</formula><p>0.4532 0.7504 0.5646 <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Performance on ETs Classification K vec in verb identification, contrary to their simi- lar performance in clause identification. The rea- son is that extraction result is based on ranking and only top ranked event affects the performance. In other words, precision is more important than re- call here. For the same reason, K new+M is better than K new * M in classification of ETs, although on- ly marginally. Nonetheless, using revised convolu- tion kernel with multi-kernel training is still signifi- cantly better than the original kernel K new * M which achieves the best performance in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>. When the precision of the two methods are similar, such as K ET −O and K ET −M , the effect of recall becomes important.</p><p>The multi-kernel not only achieves the best per- formance on both precision and recall, the increase in performance is also significant with at least 0.2173 (between K ET −M and K new * M ). Obvious- ly, multi-kernel is not just a simple voting or joint for the components, it benefits from two kernels to achieve better performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Error Analysis</head><p>There are mainly three types of errors in our model. We use case examples to show them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a) Cascading Events</head><p>In some cases, events may happen like a chain re- action. An event that leads to an emotion may be the consequent of another event. Identifying the right event in a chain is more challenging. In the follow- ing example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Ex.3: ·&lt;cause&gt; &lt;/cause&gt;&lt;keywords&gt; &lt;/keywords&gt;· ""</formula><p>John Watson fell into icy water. &lt;cause&gt;The chilly water&lt;/cause&gt; made him feel so cold and &lt;keywords&gt;scared&lt;/keywords&gt; John Watson had to use his broken Chinese to call for help.</p><p>the emotion cause should be " /the chilly water". Our method output " /fell into icy water" as the emotion cause with probability 60.83%. The probability of the correc- t cause is 58.89%. As a probability based method, our method does not have the ability to analyze the sequence of events nor the relation between them.</p><p>b) Sensory verbs Sensory verbs usually indicate the emotion cause. There are exceptional cases as shown below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Ex.4: &lt;keywords&gt; &lt;/keywords&gt; &lt;cause&gt;&lt;/cause&gt;</formula><p>After investigation on bullying, the head says that the students realized their mistake and were also &lt;keywords&gt;scared&lt;/keywords&gt;. They &lt;cause&gt; may need to do community service&lt;/cause&gt;</p><p>In this case, the cause of "scared" is the punish- ment of community service. But the template of " …/realized ... and felt" usually indicate that there is an emotion cause between the two senso- ry verbs. Our algorithm gives "/ realized their mistake" a probability of 61.65% as a cause, al- though this is incorrect. But, this actually indicates that our method can learn latent patterns in text.</p><p>c) Coverage of cause candidates In the construction of ETs, we use actions as the cue to construct candidate events. However, 6.78% of our clauses do not have action words. So, these clauses are not selected as candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present our work on emotion cause extraction. Due to the lack of open resources for this area of study, we first construct an annotated dataset from news text which will be released for public use. We also propose an event-driven emotion cause ex- traction method to capture the triggering events e- motion changes. In this method, we propose a 7- tuple representation of events using syntactic struc- tures to identify events. Based on this structured rep- resentation of events and the inclusion of lexical fea- tures, a convolution kernel based learning method is designed to train a multi-kernel classifier to identify emotion cause events. Compared to manually con- structed rules and commonsense knowledge based methods, our proposed model can automatically ob- tain structure features and lexical features to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this dataset  Here, C = Cause event; E = Experiencer; K = Key- word/emotion verb; B = Clause before the focus clause; F = Focus clause/the clause containing the emotion ver- b; A = Clause after the focus clause; I to VII are cue words in ( ; Na/Nb/Nc/Nh is common noun/proper noun/place noun/pronoun.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(Att O 1 ,O 1 ) belongs to S(O 1 ), (Adv,P ,Cpl) belong to V , and (Att O 2 ,O 2 ) belongs 4 https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp</figDesc></figure>
