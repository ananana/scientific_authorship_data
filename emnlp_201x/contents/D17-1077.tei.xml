				<p>We introduce the task of book structure labeling: segmenting and assigning a fixed category (such as TABLE OF CONTENTS, PREFACE, INDEX) to the document structure of printed books. We manually annotate the page-level structural categories for a large dataset totaling 294,816 pages in 1,055 books evenly sampled from 1750-1922, and present empirical results comparing the performance of several classes of models. The best-performing model, a bidirectional LSTM with rich features, achieves an overall accuracy of 95.8 and a class-balanced macro F-score of 71.4.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The availability of large-scale book corpora (such as those created by Google Books, the Inter- net Archive and the HathiTrust) has driven a flurry of work in cultural analytics over the past decade, in which the text contained in historical books has provided the raw material for the analy- sis of genre <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Underwood, 2016)</ref>, literary charac- ter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bamman et al., 2014</ref>), geographic attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wilkens, 2013)</ref>, fame ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Michel et al., 2010)</ref>, and much more.</p><p>Books, however, are not undifferentiated streams of text in the same way that born-digital documents like tweets or emails are; they are phys- ical objects with materiality <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Werner, 2012)</ref> and are arranged in a complex structure steeped in a long design tradition, with the core content of the work placed between structured frontmatter (such as a table of contents and introduction) and back- matter (such as an appendix and index). Not all of this content is desirable for all analyses; as we show below, 11% of all pages in books belong to the peritext <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Genette, 1987)</ref> that surrounds the core content, with wide variability from book to book. For other analyses, such as those addressing ques- tions in book history <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kirschenbaum and Werner, 2014)</ref>, isolating this structure in a consistent way across historical documents can enable research into how the form of the printed book has, for ex- ample, changed over time.</p><p>While other work has focused on extracting the idiosyncratic structure inherent in each book, such as recognizing chapter boundaries in order to au- tomatically generate a table of contents, or link a parsed table of contents to positions in a book <ref type="bibr">Meunier, 2005, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gao et al., 2009)</ref>, labeling document segments with a fixed typology has complementary bene- fits, allowing researchers to identify consistent cat- egories in all books regardless of the names as- signed by a specific author or publisher, or popular at a given time. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> At the same time, book structure labeling presents real challenges to automatic identifica- tion. While large-scale digital collections origi- nate in page scans of the books, the most com- mon form of access by researchers is through the output of OCR; raw image files are prohibitively expensive both in terms of disk space (15.1 mil- lion books from the HathiTrust consumes 677 ter-  abytes of space 2 ) and in the resources required for computational processing. While people are able to distinguish the different sections of a book with ease, the degraded nature of the OCR output (es- pecially for historical books) blurs the clear mark- ers that signal the category to human readers- both in terms of the lexical signals like "Pref- ace" or "Index" that head a page, and its visual structure as well. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> illustrates an exam- ple of three pages from a single book drawn from the HathiTrust; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 2</ref> displays the correspond- ing OCR output; the degradation introduced by OCR affects not only the accuracy of character and word identification, but also the structural layout as well.</p><p>To address these limitations and enable research that depends on reasoning over fine-grained docu- ment structure within books, we introduce the task of labeled segmentation, and make the following contributions:</p><p>• We create an human-annotated gold standard of 294,816 pages in 1,055 printed books drawn from the HathiTrust Digital Library.</p><p>• We approach this problem in the most common resource-deficient scenario researchers most frequently encounter: with access only to the pre-existing output of OCR.</p><p>• We compare several different classes of mod- els, including a fast independent predictor (a random forest), a simple linear sequence labeling model (CRF), and a sequence la- beling bidirectional LSTM that can capture non-linearities in the feature space. All data and pre-trained models are openly available to the public at https://github.com/ dbamman/book-segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>In order to support the analysis and prediction of labeled document structure, we present a manu- ally annotated dataset of 1,055 books, where each page has been labeled according to one of 10 cat- egories described in §2.1 below. All books orig- inate in the HathiTrust Digital Library. In order to capture historically representative phenomena, we use the decade-stratified sample of 1,075 books from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bamman et al. (2017)</ref>, in which each decade from 1750-1922 is roughly equally represented. From this sample of 1,075 apparent books, we exclude all non-book records (including digitized newspaper clippings, unbound pamphlets and re- ports, opera programs, etc.) to yield a total labeled dataset of 294,816 pages in 1,055 books.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Categories</head><p>While there is no codified form of the standard categories that are present in print books, modern book designers generally adhere to a tradition in- volving a typical sequence of parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wilson, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee, 2009)</ref>. We draw on this tradition to inform our set of the following ten categories; to contex- tualize its prevalence, each category is listed with its description and the fraction of the 1,055 books  in our dataset in which it appears (for example, 47.8% of books have an annotated preface).</p><p>• TITLE PAGE (93.0%), which lists the title of the work and (optionally) other information including the names of the author, translator, and others involved in its creation. In this cat- egory we group the primary title page along with the HALF-TITLE (a page that generally only presents the title of the work, often pre- ceding the main title page or first chapter).</p><p>• AD CARD (18.1%), which lists other works by the author or publisher; or, more generally, any other object that is advertised for sale.</p><p>• PUBLISHER (39.9%), which includes the mod- ern COPYRIGHT page (typically on the verso side of the title page) and also the COLOPHON (an imprint often appearing at the end of a work).</p><p>• DEDICATION (17.5%), an inscription by the au- thor dedicating the work to another.</p><p>• PREFACE (47.8%), which includes a FORE- WORD, PREFACE, and INTRODUCTION. While modern designers articulate prescrip- tive distinctions among these categories pri- marily in their subject matter and authorial voice, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> we do not find a strong distinction among these sub-categories evident when la- beling the text. We therefore follow Genette <ref type="bibr">(1987)</ref> in grouping all together as prefatory <ref type="bibr">3</ref> "A preface is written by the author and is generally about the writing of the book. A foreword is a comment on the book and/or the author by another person. An introduction, which may by the author or another, may contain such matter, but it's primarily a preparation for, or explanation of, the content" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lee, 2009)</ref> material.</p><p>• TABLE OF CONTENTS (46.8%), which includes "an accurate listing of all textual matter which follows it and the page on which the parts of the book commence" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wilson, 1993</ref>).</p><p>• TEXT (99.3%), which includes the main con- tents of the book. TEXT is naturally the most frequent category, but only accounts for 89.4% of pages in all books in our dataset.</p><p>We also see wide variability from book to book; the average TEXT ratio in books is 0.82, with a standard deviation of 0.18.</p><p>• APPENDIX (14.4%) includes a heterogeneous mix of other minor categories that appear in- frequently in different books. These include: NOTES (1.1%) (which "have the character of footnotes which, because of their extent, are placed at the back of the book" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wilson, 1993)</ref>); BIBLIOGRAPHY (1.7%), "a listing of the books and periodicals, etc., which the au- thor has used as source material or which he recommends as supplementary reading mat- ter" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wilson, 1993)</ref>; GLOSSARY (0.6%), "a list of definitions of terms used in the text" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wilson, 1993)</ref>, ERRATA (4.1%), mistakes corrected in the printing of the book, and SUBSCRIBERS (1.7%), a list of individuals who have committed to purchasing the work in advance (a historical category not fre- quently seen in modern texts). We annotate each of these subcategories individually for future work, but collapse them into the single category of APPENDIX for the work below.</p><p>• INDEX (19.2%), which "serves to catalogue, with page indications, all the references which an author wishes to identify" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wilson, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>• N/A. For each of the nine categories above, we annotate the beginning and end pages present in a book; any page not contained within a labeled section receives the label N/A.</p><p>As Genette (1987) articulates, each of these structural categories mediates the relationship be- tween the text and its audience, and each serves a different illocutionary purpose. The TITLE is ad- dressed to the general public (not necessarily the readers) and is not only informational (informing of the name of the work), but also serves as im- portant marketing material as well; PREFACES are addressed to readers, and may be written either by the author of the core content (authorial) or by another (allographic) and communicate the inten- tion or interpretation of the work; the illocutionary force of a DEDICATION, in contrast, is performa- tive: its very presence is a speech act that serves to dedicate the work to another. For all categories, we label based on the tenor of the category's meaning, and not on the title of the section that may appear on the page. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> illustrates one such example of this distinction- a page whose function is to serve as a table of contents but is headed as an "Index" (and also ap- pears at the back of the book, like contemporary indices); rather than functioning as an index in providing references to concepts within the text, it outlines the organizational structure of the sec- tions (as a table of contents does).</p><p>Human judgments of these ten categories are relatively uncontroversial; to calculate the coher- ence of the task, we calculated the inter-annotator agreement rate for two annotators on 25 books, and find a chance-corrected Cohen's κ = 0.83, suggesting a very high level of agreement. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> All books then receive a single judgment of page-level annotations by a single annotator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>To explore our ability to label book structure auto- matically, we test three different feature-rich clas- sifiers. All make use of the same set of features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Features</head><p>Keywords. Most words on a page are not pre- dictive of the category to which it belongs; a word like Britain in a biography of Churchill may dis- tinguish that book from other books, but will also equally be found on the title page, table of con- tents, preface, content, index, or any other cate- gory. Some words, however, are discriminative, such as the titles of the categories ("index," "pref- ace," "dedication," etc.). To identify these terms, we train a unigram logistic regression classifier on the training-only partition of the data (described in section 4 below) and manually select keywords with high face validity. We create two sets of fea- tures from these keywords: presence of a keyword in the header of the page (the first four lines) and the presence of a keyword anywhere on the page.</p><p>Longest increasing subsequence. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 3</ref> shows, tables of contents are distinguished from indices in that the page numbers generally increase from the top of the page to the bottom, correspond- ing to the linear order of the book. To capture this, we create a feature for the longest increasing sub- sequence (LIS) of numbers on the page. The LIS for any set of n randomly permuted numbers con- verges to a Tracy-Widom distribution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baik et al., 1999</ref>); to enable feature value comparisons across pages with different total numbers, we conduct a permutation test by shuffling the numbers on the page and recalculating the LIS for that resample; we set the feature value to be 1 only when the ob- served LIS is greater than 5% of the LIS scores for the permutations (i.e., p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Alphabetical sort. Indices, in contrast, are dis- tinguished from tables of contents in that their lines are sorted alphabetically (from the top to the bottom of the page). To capture this, we create a feature measuring the degree to which the lines on a page are sorted, operationalized as the Spear- man rank correlation coefficient (ρ) between the set of lines in their original order and the lines in sorted order. Perfectly sorted lines have a ρ = 1; inversely sorted lines have ρ = −1 and randomly ordered lines have an expected ρ = 0. To account for random sorting that take place by chance, we set this feature value to be ρ only when its p value (rejecting H 0 ≡ ρ = 0) &lt; 0.01.</p><p>Letter distribution. In addition to measuring the degree which the full page is alphabetized, we can also capture important structural qualities of indices by measuring the degree to which initial letters in words are overrepresented on the page. We calculate this by measuring the empirical dis- tribution of initial downcased letters [a-z] for all words in the book, and measure the degree to which the empirical distribution on the page over- represents any individual letter. Rather than com- parison the full distributions (using e.g., Jensen- Shannon divergence), we calculate the number of letters whose frequency on the page deviates from the book frequency for that letter by a z-score (ac- counting for the number of times we observe the letter) corresponding to a critical value α ≤ 0.05.</p><p>Roman numerals. Frontmatter preceding the main content is often paginated with roman nu- merals, rather than the arabic numerals found in the content. To capture this, we create a binary feature identifying the presence of roman numer- als in the first four lines (header) or last four lines (footer) of the page, using the resources of Under- wood (2017).</p><p>Page density. Content pages are relatively dense with characters (both letters and numbers); title pages and tables of contents are defined by greater volume of whitespace. To capture this differential, we introduce features for the ratio of words and numbers among all (whitespace-delimited) tokens and for the overall number of tokens observed.</p><p>Position. We create a set of binary features marking the position of the page within the book (appearance in the first ten pages, last ten pages, and in which quintile it appears), and its real- valued positional ratio within the book (page num- ber divided by the total pages).</p><p>Page Sequence. Not all books distinguish front- matter from the main content with roman numer- als; to address this, we identify the page with the first marked page number and create a feature that captures whether a page appears before or after that first marked page.</p><p>TextTiling While all words are not indicative of the categories on their own, they can provide a natural segmentation of the book into discrete dis- course chunks, in that the language that character- izes a given main content section may differ from that within an introduction (and certainly from more structured sections like indices or tables of contents). To capture this, we create a feature for each page derived from TextTiling (Hearst, 1997): for a given page at position i, we calculate the cosine similarity between the intervals [page 1 ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">page i−1 ] and [page i , page n ].</formula><p>The feature classes above total 172 features for each individual page. When representing a page as input to the models below, we also conjoin infor- mation about all pages within a window of three pages around the target page; each page is thus represented by a total of 7 × 172 distinct fea- tures. All non-binary features are standardized to standard normals, whose means and variances are estimated using the distribution observed in the training-only partition of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Models</head><p>We compare three different model classes: a ran- dom forest <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Breiman, 2001)</ref>, which can capture complex nonlinearities in the feature space but is constrained to make independent predictions; an 2 -regularized conditional random field (Laf- ferty et al., <ref type="bibr">2001</ref>), which can account for tem- poral dependencies in the predictions but is lim- ited to linear relationships; and a bidirectional se- quence labeling LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Graves, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ma and Hovy, 2016)</ref>, which can reason over sequential information while also capturing more complex non-linearities. The observed input to all meth- ods for each page x i is the same feature represen- tation f (x i ); the CRF also includes information about label transition features, decoding the entire sequence using Viterbi decoding; and the bidirec- tional LSTM captures persistent state information for each page as two H-dimensional hidden lay- ers, one for the forward direction h f and one for </p><note type="other">Method Accuracy Macro precision Macro recall Macro F Majority</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>We compare the performance of the three mod- els described above at the task of page-level la- beling: both the multiclass classification problem of predicting which of the 10 labels applies to each page, and the binary task of {TEXT, NON- TEXT} prediction, in which the nine front-and backmatter labels are collapsed into the single la- bel NON-TEXT; while the former allows access to fine-grained categories of (e.g.) indices and tables of contents, the latter covers the common scenario where researchers are interested only in isolating where the core text begins and ends. Experimentally, we divide the full training data into two partitions: a training-only partition of 400 books, on which we experiment with feature and model development, and a test partition of the re- maining 655 books. All results presented below are the result of tenfold cross-validation on the test partition. Each fold trains on <ref type="bibr">8</ref> 10 of the test data, uses <ref type="bibr">1</ref> 10 of the 655 books as development for model selection (e.g., to optimize the 2 regularization parameter for the CRF, terminate training for the BiLSTM, and optimize the depth of the random forest), and uses 1 10 of the 655 for test. We supple- ment each training fold with the 400 books from the training-only partition, but this data is never used for evaluation below.</p><p>In total, we evaluate the performance on 655 books and calculate 95% confidence intervals for each metric using the non-parametric bootstrap, drawing B = 10, 000 resamples of books (not in- dividual pages) in order to account for the statisti- cal dependence between page-level predictions. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the results for full multiclass seg- ment labeling. To contextualize these results, we also provide a simple baseline of predicting the majority class (TEXT) for all pages; since most pages in a book are core content, this yields a high absolute accuracy against which to compare, but a low macro precision/recall/F score (which evenly weights the importance of each class).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Full segment labeling</head><p>All three methods achieve relatively similar per- formance when measured by absolute accuracy (though the room for improvement over the base- line is small). When treating all classes as equally important and measuring by the macro F score, both sequence labeling methods (CRF and bidi- rectional LSTM) show slight improvements over the independent predictions of a random forest, but not significantly so, suggesting that the feature representation of the book (which they all share as identical input) is perhaps a strong enough signal that mitigates the label dependencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Category</head><p>Precision   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> lists the precision, recall and F- score results by category for the best-performing model (bidirectional LSTM). Several categories are worth calling out: the precision and recall for recognizing table of contents is high (≥ 0.84 for both metrics), suggesting that this method may provide a solid foundation for work in book struc- ture extraction that relies on an identified table of contents in order to recognize the idiosyncratic structure of books. Title page and index recogni- tion are also relatively high (0.89 precision/0.63 recall); what these three categories have in com- mon are strong structural features (the distribution of ink and whitespace on the page; regularities in the numbers and the degree of alphabetization).</p><p>While dedications and publication information  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Content/non-content labeling, along with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.</p><note type="other">Method Accuracy Macro P Macro R Macro F Majority class 0.</note><p>are both relatively infrequent (often occupying a single page in a book), the greatest point of con- fusion is in separating the main content from the structurally similar pages that typically precede it (in the preface) and follow it (in the appendix).</p><p>While confusion between PREFACE/TEXT and APPENDIX/TEXT account for most of the errors, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">figure 4</ref> illustrates several difficult cases and ex- emplary mistakes in the other categories: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">fig. 4a</ref> is a page that blurs the line between an index and table of contents; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">fig. 4b</ref> is an advertisement for a book "in the press and speedily will be published"; and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">fig. 4c</ref> is a dedication that, without strong lex- ical indicators, is mistaken for a title page. In order to understand the contribution that indi- vidual features make on the predictions, we carry out an ablation test for each feature class, in which we remove a feature class from the model and per- form exactly the same training and test procedure as described in section 4: we train a model on the training fold supplemented with the 400 books in the training partition, perform hyperparameter op- timization on development data, and report accu- racy on the held-out test fold, repeating ten times, once for each fold in cross-validation.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Feature ablation results for the BiLSTM model, illustrating the change in macro F-score that results by removing a given feature class from the full model.</p><p>The simplest features are the most informative: the small set of keywords learned from the training partition (which include common section labels like preface, content, index, advertisement, other informative markers such as dedicated, copyright, and currency markers like $, £), the position of the page in the book, and the density of characters (in- cluding words and numbers) on the page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Content/non-content segment labeling</head><p>In order to assess the ability of these different fea- tures and models to demarcate the core text of a work, we binarize the multiclass label, assigning TEXT to all pages labeled TEXT in the multiclass setting, and NON-TEXT to all other pages. We train all three classifiers again on these binarized labels and repeat the training procedure for each model outlined in section 4. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the results for the binary task of {TEXT, NOT-TEXT} prediction. Here again we contextualize these results with two simpler base- lines: a simple majority class predictor (always predict TEXT), and a model that identifies the av- erage start and end positions in a book for the first and last text page (respectively) within the train- ing data, and predicts TEXT for pages within that range (roughly within the [0.10, 0.94] interval), and NON-TEXT for all pages outside of it. This corresponds to a heuristic that chops off the first 10% of a book and the last 6% as NON-TEXT.</p><p>The chop heuristic performs worse than the ma- jority class predictor in terms of absolute accu- racy, but improves over the class-balanced macro scores. All three feature-rich models show sub- stantial improvements over all metrics, but are in- distinguishable from each other, each achieving nearly identical performance. For this reduced purpose, any of the three classifiers are sufficient for segmenting TEXT from NON-TEXT, even a random forest making independent predictions for each page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related work</head><p>The work described here has points of intersec- tion with several other threads of research. The most direct originates in work that grows out of the INEX and ICDAR book structure extraction com-  petitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kazai et al., , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Doucet et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Doucet et al., , 2013</ref>, in which participants are challenged to recognize the fine-grained structure present in documents (recognizing, for example, that the cur- rent article has sections entitled "Abstract," "In- troduction," "Data, "References," etc.). The most successful systems recognize structure by parsing the table of contents <ref type="bibr">Meunier, 2005, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gao et al., 2009</ref>) rather than relying on the content of the book itself. Our work primarily differs in the fundamental design choice of prescribing a fix set of categories into which we classify pages (in order to enable comparison across documents) rather than prioritizing the id- iosynractic structure of a book (which is useful for generating new tables of contents).</p><p>Given the relatively constant page-level cate- gories that printers use to describe book design, we formulate our problem as a classification task into a set of pre-established categories. An alterna- tive is to take an unsupervised approach, and learn the set of categories empirically from the data; this general problem of book segmentation in its unlabeled form shares functional similarity with other work in general unsupervised topic or dis- course segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hearst, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Utiyama and Isahara, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 2009</ref>)-most notably, the work of Eisenstein and Barzilay (2008) (for whom the section labels may be considered a form of "cue words" akin to discourse markers). Given the amount of data in large-scale book collections, we see this as an interesting path forward (either in a fully unsupervised or semi-supervised setting); an unsupervised approach that includes aspects of metadata such as country of publication or pub- lisher may also be fruitful in accommodating vari- ation in printer's rules as a function of time and geographical location (books by French publish- ers, for example, often place the table of contents at the back of the book).</p><p>As figure 2 illustrates, one of the primary chal- lenges that we face with the labeled segmenta- tion of books is the degraded nature of the in- put; unlike contemporary business documents for which OCR is largely a solved problem, histori- cal books present several challenges due to their binding, age, and significant variation in font and printing. Much work has focused on overcom- ing these limitations from several perspectives, in- cluding creating ground truth for historical books <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Papadopoulos et al., 2013)</ref>, bootstrapping their alignment with existing resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feng and Manmatha, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Yalniz and Manmatha, 2011)</ref>, ex- ploiting the fact that books often have multiple scans or printings that could be leveraged <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Smith et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wemhoener et al., 2013)</ref> or develop- ing methods that account for variation in the print- ing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">BergKirkpatrick and Klein, 2014</ref>).</p><p>Large-scale book corpora are increasingly be- ing used as the raw material for linguistic anal- ysis, especially those focused on measuring his- torical change <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton et al., 2016a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kulkarni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mitra et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kim et al., 2014</ref>). These studies use not only the observed word frequencies pro-vided by the Google Ngram dataset, but also in- creasingly structured representations of language as well ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldberg and Orwant, 2013)</ref>. The task of labeled book segmentation may be helpful in reducing the noise inherent in the use of statistics aggregated from these large datasets- both in terms of filtering out the 11% of all pages that are not the core content (e.g., such as indices), and also in grounding the text at the appropriate date for historical analysis (such as deriving statis- tics only from the core content, and not from an introduction written years afterward).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We introduce in this work the task of book struc- ture labeling, the problem of assigning to each page in a printed book its membership in one of a set of predetermined categories. In annotating a large dataset of books, we are able to empirically assess the ability to accurately segment and label books from a range of historical time periods.</p><p>The ten categories that form our typology are drawn from printers' guides and informed by con- temporary criticism, but still reflect our historical present; while we have in part let our categories be shaped by our experience labeling texts (so that we have preserved in our annotations historical cat- egories not in contemporary use, such as SUB- SCRIBERS), we recognize that the act of catego- rization glosses over meaningful distinctions-for example, while we have grouped sections marked ADVERTISEMENT, TO THE READER, PREFACE, INTRODUCTION, FOREWORD and others into the single category of PREFACE, such labels may have historically significant differences that may be worth preserving for some analyses. Never- theless, we expect the coarse distinctions we out- line here to occasion research that requires access to those broad categories. Potential uses of this work include using the categories directly to an- swer questions in book history (e.g., charting the historical prevalence of advertisements and their variation across time), improving the task of id- iosyncratic structure detection by identifying ta- bles of contents, and identifying the fine-grained topics of books by parsing recognized indices.</p><p>In this work, we deliberately focus on the resource-deficient scenario most commonly en- countered by researchers working with large book corpora, in which books are represented as the out- put of errorful OCR. In providing a labeled dataset for others to use, we hope to encourage other work that reasons about the structure present in alterna- tive representations (such as images) as well.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An Account of the War in India, Between the English and French (1761).
