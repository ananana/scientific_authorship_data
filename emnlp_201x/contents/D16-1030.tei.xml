				<p>We describe TweeTIME, a temporal tagger for recognizing and normalizing time expressions in Twitter. Most previous work in social media analysis has to rely on temporal resolvers that are designed for well-edited text, and therefore suffer from reduced performance due to domain mismatch. We present a minimally supervised method that learns from large quantities of unlabeled data and requires no hand-engineered rules or hand-annotated training corpora. TweeTIME achieves 0.68 F1 score on the end-to-end task of resolving date expressions, outperforming a broad range of state-of-the-art systems. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Temporal expressions are words or phrases that re- fer to dates, times or durations. Resolving time ex- pressions is an important task in information ex- traction (IE) that enables downstream applications such as calendars or timelines of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Do et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ritter et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ling and Weld, 2010)</ref>, knowledge base population <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ji et al., 2011</ref>), information re- trieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alonso et al., 2007)</ref>, automatically schedul- ing meetings from email and more. Previous work in this area has applied rule-based systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mani and Wilson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bethard, 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chambers, 2013)</ref> or supervised machine learning on small collections of hand-annotated news documents ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angeli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al., 2014</ref>).  Social media especially contains time-sensitive information and requires accurate temporal anal- ysis, for example, for detecting real-time cyber- security events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ritter et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang et al., 2016)</ref>, disease outbreaks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kanhabua et al., 2012)</ref> and extracting personal information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schwartz et al., 2015)</ref>. However, most work on social media simply uses generic temporal resolvers and therefore suffers from suboptimal performance. Recent work on tem- poral resolution focuses primarily on news articles and clinical texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(UzZaman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bethard and Savova, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Resolving time expressions in social media is a non-trivial problem. Besides many spelling varia- tions, time expressions are more likely to refer to future dates than in newswire. For the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we need to recognize that Monday refers to the upcoming Monday and not the previous one to resolve to its correct normalized date (5/9/2016). We also need to identify that the word Sun is not re- ferring to a Sunday in this context.</p><p>In this paper, we present a new minimally super- vised approach to temporal resolution that requires no in-domain annotation or hand-crafted rules, in- stead learning from large quantities of unlabeled text in conjunction with a database of known events. Our approach is capable of learning robust time expres- sion models adapted to the informal style of text found on social media.</p><p>For popular events, some related tweets (e.g</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Fig- ure 2) may contain explicit or other simple time mentions that can be captured by a generic temporal</head><p>tagger. An open-domain information extraction sys- tem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ritter et al., 2012)</ref> can then identify events (e.g. <ref type="bibr">[Mercury, 5/9/2016]</ref>) by aggregating those tweets. To automatically generate temporally annotated data for training, we make the following novel distant su- pervision assumption: 2 Tweets posted near the time of a known event that mention central entities are likely to contain time expressions that re- fer to the date of the event.</p><p>Based on this assumption, tweets that contain the same named entity (e.g. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) are heuristically labeled as training data. Each tweet is associated with multiple overlapping labels that indicate the day of the week, day of the month, whether the event is in the past or future and other time properties of the event date in relation to the tweet's creation date. In order to learn a tagger that can recognize temporal expressions at the word-level, we present a multiple- instance learning approach to model sentence and word-level tags jointly and handle overlapping la- bels. Using heuristically labeled data and the tem- poral tags predicted by the multiple-instance learn- ing model as input, we then train a log-linear model that normalizes time expressions to calendar dates.</p><p>Building on top of the multiple-instance learn- ing model, we further improve performance using a missing data model that addresses the problem of errors introduced during the heuristic labeling pro- cess. Our best model achieves a 0.68 F1 score when resolving date mentions in Twitter. This is a 17% increase over SUTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chang and Manning, 2012)</ref>, outperforming other state-of-the-art time expression resolvers HeidelTime <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2013)</ref>, TempEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mani and Wilson, 2000</ref>) and UWTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al., 2014</ref>) as well. Our approach also pro- duces a confidence score that allows us to trade re- call for precision. To the best of our knowledge, TweeTIME is the first time resolver designed specif- ically for social media data. 3 This is also the first time that distant supervision is successfully applied for end-to-end temporal recognition and normaliza- tion. Previous distant supervision approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angeli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angeli and Uszkoreit, 2013)</ref> only address the normalization problem, assuming gold time mentions are available at test time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Overview</head><p>Our TweeTIME system consists of two major com- ponents as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>    proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ritter et al. (2012)</ref>. Each event con- sists of one or more named entities, in addition to the date on which the event takes place, for exam- ple <ref type="bibr">[Mercury, 5/9/2016]</ref>. Tweets are first processed by a Twitter named entity recognizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ritter et al., 2011)</ref>, and a generic date resolver <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mani and Wilson, 2000</ref>). Events are then extracted based on the strength of association between each named entity and calendar date, as measured by a G 2 test on their co-occurrence counts. More details of the Event Ex- tractor can be found in Section 5.1. The following two sections describe the details of our Temporal Recognizer and Temporal Normal- izer separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Distant Supervision for Recognizing Time Expressions</head><p>The goal of the recognizer is to predict the tempo- ral tag of each word, given a sentence (or a tweet) w = w 1 , . . . , w n . We propose a multiple-instance learning model and a missing data model that are capable of learning word-level taggers given only sentence-level labels.</p><p>Our recognizer module in is built using a database of known events as distant supervision. We assume tweets published around the time of a known event that mention a central entity are also likely to contain time expressions referring to the event's date. For each event, such as [Mercury, 5/9/2016], we gather all tweets that contain the central entity Mercury and are posted within 7 days of 5/9/2016. We then la- bel each tweet based on the event date in addition to the tweet's creation date. The sentence-level tempo- ral tags for the tweet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> are: TL=f uture, DOW=M on, DOM=9, MOY=M ay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Multiple-Instance Learning Temporal</head><p>Tagging Model (MultiT)</p><p>Unlike supervised learning, where labeled instances are provided to the learner, in multiple instance learning scenarios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dietterich et al., 1997</ref>), the learner is only provided with bags of instances la- beled as either positive (where at least one instance is positive) or all negative. This is a close match to our problem setting, in which sentences are labeled with tags that should be assigned to one or more words.</p><p>We represent sentences and their labels using a graphical model that is divided into word-level and sentence-level variables (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4</ref>). Unlike the standard supervised tagging prob- lem, we never directly observe the words' tags (z = z 1 , . . . , z n ) during learning. Instead, they are la- tent and we only observe the date of an event men- tioned in the text, from which we derive sentence- level binary variables t = t 1 , . . . , t k corresponding to temporal tags for the sentence. Following previ- ous work on multiple-instance learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoffmann et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</ref>), we model the connec- tion between sentence-level labels and word-level tags using a set of deterministic-OR factors φ sent . The overall conditional probability of our model is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">z 1 z 2 … Watch Mercury Pass In Front Of Sun Monday z 3 z 4 z 5 z 6 z 7 z 8 t 1 t 2 t k</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (t, z|w; θ r ) = 1 Z k i=1 φ sent (t i , z) × n j=1 φ word (z j , w j ) = 1 Z k i=1 φ sent (t i , z) × n j=1 e θ r ·f(z j ,w j ) (1)</formula><p>where f(z j , w j ) is a feature vector and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">φ sent (t i , z) =      1 if t i = true ∧ ∃j : z j = i 1 if t i = f alse ∧ ∀j : z j = i 0 otherwise (2)</formula><p>We include a standard set of tagging features that includes word shape and identity in addition to pre- fixes and suffixes. To learn parameters θ r of the Temporal Tagger, we maximize the likelihood of the sentence-level heuristic labels conditioned on ob- served words over all tweets in the training corpus. Given a training instance w with label t, the gradient of the conditional log-likelihood with respect to the parameters is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (t|w) = z P (z|w, t; θ r ) · f(z, w) − t,z P (t, z|w; θ r ) · f(z, w)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This gradient is the difference of two conditional ex- pectations over the feature vector f: a "clamped" ex- pectation that is conditioned on the observed words and tags (w, t) and a "free" expectation that is only conditioned on the words in the text, w, and ignores the sentence-level labels. To make the inference tractable, we use a Viterbi approximation that re- places the expectations with maximization. Because each sentence corresponds to more than one tempo- ral tag, the maximization of the "clamped" maxi- mization is somewhat challenging to compute. We use the approximate inference algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hoffmann et al. (2011a)</ref>, that views inference as a weighted set cover problem, with worst case running time (|T | · |W |), where |T | is the number of all pos- sible temporal tag values and |W | is the number of words in a sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Missing Data Temporal Tagging Model (MiDaT)</head><p>While the multiple-instance learning assumption works well much of the time, it can easily be vio- lated -there are many tweets that mention entities involved in an event but that never explicitly men- tion its date. The missing data modeling approach to weakly supervised learning proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ritter et. al. (2013)</ref> addresses this problem by relaxing the hard con- straints of deterministic-OR factors, such as those described above, as soft constraints. Our missing- data model for weakly supervised tagging splits the sentence-level variables, t into two parts : m which represents whether a temporal tag is mentioned by at least one word of the tweet, and t which represents whether a temporal tag can be derived from the event date. A set of pairwise potentials ψ(m j , t j ) are in- troduced that encourage (but don't strictly require) agreement between m j and t j , that is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ψ(m j , t j ) = α p , if t j = m j α r , if t j = m j<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here, α p (Penalty), and α r (Reward) are param- eters for the MiDaT model. α p is the penalty for extracting a temporal tag that is not related to the event-date and α r is the reward for extracting a tag that matches the date.</p><p>During learning, if the local classifier is very con- fident, it is possible for a word to be labeled with a tag that is not derived from the event-date, and also for a sentence-level tag to be ignored, although ei- ther case will be penalized by the agreement poten- tials, ψ(m j , t j ), in the global objective. We use a local-search approach to inference that was empiri- cally demonstrated to nearly always yield exact so- lutions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ritter et. al. (2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">A Log-Linear Model for Normalizing Time Expressions</head><p>The Temporal Normalizer is built using a log-linear model which takes the tags t produced by the Tem- poral Recognizer as input and outputs one or more dates mentioned in a tweet. We formulate date nor- malization as a binary classification problem: given a tweet w published on date d pub , we consider 22 candidate target dates (w, d cand l ) such that d cand l = d pub + l, where l = −10, . . . , −1, 0, +1, . . . , +10, limiting the possible date references that are consid- ered within 10 days before or after the tweet creation date, in addition to d cand l = null (the tweet does not mention a date). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> While our basic approach has the limitation, that it is only able to predict dates within ±10 days of the target date, we found that in prac- tice the majority of date references on social media fall within this window. Our approach is also able to score dates outside this range that are generated by traditional approaches to resolving time expressions, as described in Section 5.3.3. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Although the temporal recognizer is trained with tweets from ±7 days around the event date, we found that extending the candidate date range to ±10 days for the temporal normal- izer increased the performance of TweeTIME in the dev set.</p><p>The normalizer is similarly trained using the event database as distant supervision. The probability that a tweet mentions a candidate date is estimated using a log-linear model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (d cand |w, d pub ) ∝ e θ n ·g(w,d pub ,t)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where θ n and g are the parameter and feature vector respectively in the Temporal Normalizer. For every tweet and candidate date pair (w, d cand l ), we extract the following set of features:</p><p>Temporal Tag Features that indicate whether the candidate date agrees with the temporal tags extracted by the Temporal Recognizer. Three cases can happen here: The recognizer can extract a tag that can not be derived from the candidate date;</p><p>The recognizer can miss a tag derived from the candidate date; The recognizer can extract a tag that is derived from the candidate date.</p><p>Lexical Features that include two types of binary features from the tweet: 1) Word Tag features consist of conjunctions of words in the tweet and tags associated with the candidate date. We remove URLs, stop words and punctuation; 2) Word POS features that are the same as above, but include conjunctions of POS tags, words and temporal tags derived from the candidate date.</p><p>Time Difference Features are numerical features that indicate the distance between the creation date and the candidate date. They include difference of day ranges form -10 to 10 and the difference of week ranges from -2 to 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In the following sub-sections we present experi- mental results on learning to resolve time expres- sions in Twitter using minimal supervision. We start by describing our dataset, and proceed to present our results, including a large-scale evaluation on heuristically-labeled data and an evaluation compar- ing against human judgements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data Collection</head><p>We collected around 120 million tweets posted in a one year window starting from April 2011 to May 2012. These tweets were automatically annotated with named entities, POS tags and TempEx dates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ritter et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>From this automatically-annotated corpus we ex- tract the top 10, 000 events and their correspond- ing dates using the G 2 test, which measures the strength of association between an entity and date using the log-likelihood ratio between a model in which the entity is conditioned on the date and a model of independence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ritter et al., 2012</ref>). Events extracted using this approach then simply consist of the highest-scoring entity-date pairs, for example <ref type="bibr">[Mercury, 5/9/2016]</ref>.</p><p>After automatically extracting the database of events, we next gather all tweets that mention an entity from the list that are also written within ±7 days of the event. These tweets and the dates of the known events serve as labeled examples that are likely to mention a known date.</p><p>We also include a set of pseudo-negative exam- ples, that are unlikely to refer to any event, by gath- ering a random sample of tweets that do not men- tion any of the top 10, 000 events and where TempEx does not extract any date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Large-Scale Heuristic Evaluation</head><p>We first evaluate our tagging model, by testing how well it can predict the heuristically generated labels. As noted in previous work on distant supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mintz et al., 2009a</ref>), this type of evaluation usu- ally under-estimates precision, however it provides us with a useful intrinsic measure of performance.</p><p>In order to provide even coverage of months in the training and test set, we divide the twitter corpus into 3 subsets based on the mod-5 week of each tweet's creation date. To train system we use tweets that are created in 1st, 2nd or 3rd weeks. To tune pa- rameters of the MiDaT model we used tweets from 5th weeks, and to evaluate the performance of the trained model we used tweets from 4th weeks.  The performance of the MiDaT model varies with the penalty and reward parameters. To find a (near) optimal setting of the values we performed a grid search on the dev set and found that a penalty of −25 and reward of 500 works best. A comparison of MultiT and MiDaT's performance at predicting heuristically generated labels is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Precision Recall F-value</head><p>The word level tags predicted by the temporal rec- ognizer are used as the input to the temporal normal- izer, which predicts the referenced date from each tweet. The overall system's performance at predict- ing event dates on the automatically generated test set, compared against SUTime, is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Evaluation Against Human Judgements</head><p>In addition to automatically evaluating our tagger on a large corpus of heuristically-labeled tweets, we also evaluate the performance of our tagging and date-resolution models on a random sample of tweets taken from a much later time period, that were manually annotated by the authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Word-Level Tags</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the MiDaT-tagger we randomly selected 50 tweets and labeled each word with its corresponding tag. Against this hand annotated test set, MiDaT achieves Precision=0.54, Recall=0.45 and F-value=0.49. A few examples of word-level tags predicted by MiDaT are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. We found that because the tags are learned as latent variables inferred by our model, they some- times don't line up exactly with our intuitions but still provide useful predictions, for example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table  4</ref>, Christmas is labeled with the tag MOY=dec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">End-to-end Date Resolution</head><p>To evaluate the final performance of our system and compare against existing state-of-the art time resolvers, we randomly sampled 250 tweets from 2014-2016 and manually annotated them with nor- malized dates; note that this is a separate date range from our weakly-labeled training data which is taken from 2011-2012. We use 50 tweets as a develop- ment set and the remaining 200 as a final test set.</p><p>Tweets and their corresponding word tags (word tag )</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Im N A hella N A excited f uture for N A tomorrow f uture Kick N A off N A the N A New f uture Year f uture Right N A @ N A #ClubLacura N A #FRIDAY f ri !

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">System Combination with SUTime</head><p>As our basic TweeTIME system is designed to predict dates within ±10 days of the creation date, it fails when a tweet refers to a date outside this range. To overcome this limitation we append the date predicted by SUTime in the list of candidate days.

For ex- ample, a large number of variations of the word to- morrow can be found in tweets, including 2morrow, 2mrw, tmrw, 2mrow and so on. Previous temporal resolvers often fail in these cases, while TweeTIME significantly reduces such errors. Ambiguity: In many cases, temporal words like Fri- day in the tweet Is it Friday yet? may not refer to any specific event or date, but are often predicted in- correctly. Also included in this category are cases where the future and past are confused. For exam- ple, predicting the past Friday, when it is actually the coming Friday.</p><p>Missing Rule: Cases where specific temporal key- words, such as April Fools, are not covered by the rule-based systems. Tokenization: Traditional systems tend to be very sensitive to incorrect tokenization and have trouble to handle expressions such as 9th-december, May 9,2015 or Jan1. For the following Tweet:</p><p>JUST IN Delhi high court asks state gov- ernment to submit data on changes in pol- lution level since #OddEven rule came into effect on Jan1</p><p>TweeTIME is able to correctly extract 01/01/2016, whereas HeidelTime, SUTime, TempEX and UW- Time all failed to extract any dates.</p><p>Hashtag: Hashtags can carry temporal information, for example, #September11. Only our system that is adapted to social media can resolve these cases. Out of Range: TweeTIME only predicts dates within 10 days before or after the tweet. Time ex- pressions referring to dates outside this range will not be predicted correctly. System combination with SUTime (Section 5.3.3) only partially addressed this problem.</p><p>Over-Prediction: Unlike rule-based systems, Twee- TIME has a tendency to over-predict when there is no explicit time expression in the tweets, possibly because of the presence of present tense verbs. Such mistakes could also happen in some past tense verbs. Because TweeTIME resolves time expressions us- ing a very different approach compared to traditional methods, its distribution of errors is quite distinct, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Temporal Resolvers primarily utilize either rule- based or probabilistic approaches. Notable rule- based systems such as <ref type="bibr">TempEx (Mani and Wilson, 2000</ref>), SUTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chang and Manning, 2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2013</ref>) pro- vide particularly competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Probabilistic approaches use supervised classifiers trained on in-domain annotated data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kolomiyets and Moens, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bethard, 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Filannino et al., 2013)</ref> or hybrid with hand-engineered rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(UzZaman and Allen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al., 2014</ref>). UWTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al., 2014</ref>) is one of the most recent and com- petitive systems and uses Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).</p><p>Although the recent research challenge TempEval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">UzZaman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bethard and Savova, 2016)</ref> offers an evaluation in the clinical domain besides newswire, most participants used the provided anno- tated corpus to train supervised models in addition to employing hand-coded rules. Previous work on adapting temporal taggers primarily focus on scal- ing up to more languages. HeidelTime was extended to multilingual <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2015)</ref>, collo- quial (SMS) and scientific texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2012</ref>   <ref type="bibr">reit, 2013</ref>), but for normalization only, assuming gold time mentions as input. They used an EM-style bootstrapping approach and a CKY parser. Distant Supervision has recently become popu- lar in natural language processing. Much of the work has focused on the task of relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Craven and Kumlien, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bunescu and Mooney, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mintz et al., 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Riedel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hoffmann et al., 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Surdeanu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ritter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angeli et al., 2014</ref>). Recent work also shows exciting results on extracting named entities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ritter et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Plank et al., 2014</ref>), emotions (Purver and Battersby, 2012), sentiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marchetti-Bowick and Chambers, 2012)</ref>, as well as finding evidence in medical publications ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wallace et al., 2016)</ref>. Our work is closely related to the joint word-sentence model that exploits multiple-instance learning for paraphrase identification ( <ref type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</ref>) in Twit- ter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we showed how to learn time re- solvers from large amounts of unlabeled text, us- ing a database of known events as distant supervi- sion. We presented a method for learning a word- level temporal tagging models from tweets that are heuristically labeled with only sentence-level labels. This approach was further extended to account for the case of missing tags, or temporal properties that are not explicitly mentioned in the text of a tweet. These temporal tags were then combined with a va- riety of other features in a novel date-resolver that predicts normalized dates referenced in a Tweet. By learning from large quantities of in-domain data, we were able to achieve 0.68 F1 score on the end-to-end time normalization task for social media data, sig- nificantly outperforming SUTime, TempEx, Heidel- Time and UWTime on this challenging dataset for time normalization.</p><p>supervision of relation extraction.
