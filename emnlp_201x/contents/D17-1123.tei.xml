				<p>A taxonomy is a semantic hierarchy, consisting of concepts linked by is-a relations. While a large number of taxonomies have been constructed from human-compiled resources (e.g., Wikipedia), learning tax-onomies from text corpora has received a growing interest and is essential for long-tailed and domain-specific knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we overview recent advances on taxonomy construction from free texts, reorganizing relevant sub-tasks into a complete framework. We also overview resources for evaluation and discuss challenges for future research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A taxonomy is a semantic hierarchy that organizes concepts by is-a relations, which exhibits the capa- bility of improving many NLP and IR tasks, such as query understanding <ref type="bibr">(Hua et al., 2017)</ref>, per- sonalized recommendation ( ), question answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yang et al., 2017)</ref>, etc. It also supports a variety of real-world applica- tions, including information management <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nickerson et al., 2013</ref>), e-commerce ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aanen et al., 2015)</ref> and biomedical systems <ref type="bibr">(Köhler et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>With massive Web data available, a num- ber of taxonomies are constructed from human- compiled resources such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Suchanek et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Flati et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mahdisoltani et al., 2015)</ref>. But even large taxonomies may lack domain- specific and long-tailed knowledge. Recently, sev- eral methods have been developed to induce tax- onomies from text corpora ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Yang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2014</ref>). However, this task is far from being solved for three reasons: i) Text * Corresponding author. corpora may vary in size, topic and quality. It is unlikely to develop a "one-size-fits-all" solu- tion for all scenarios. For example, given an ex- tremely large corpus, Hearst-pattern based method is employed to build Probase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2012</ref>). For domain-specific corpora, learning hypernymy embedding is more suitable ( <ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2016b)</ref>.</p><p>ii) The accuracy of free-text taxonomies is usu- ally lower than many Wikipedia-based taxonomies because it is difficult to extract knowledge com- pletely from texts; iii) The task of taxonomy learn- ing is still insufficiently studied a) in emerging and specific domains and b) for non-English or under- resourced languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wei et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Alfarone and Davis, 2015;</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we overview recent advances on taxonomy construction from text corpora, reorga- nizing relevant subtasks into a complete frame- work. The subtasks include hyponym acquisi- tion, hypernym prediction, taxonomy induction, etc. We also summarize resources, evaluation met- rics and state-of-the-art results. We also discuss issues and directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Taxonomy Construction Techniques</head><p>Although workflows of different methods vary, a free text-based taxonomy construction system typ- ically operates in two steps: i) extracting is-a rela- tions using pattern-based (Sect. 2.1) or distribu- tional methods (Sect. 2.2); ii) constructing a com- plete taxonomy from is-a relations (Sect. 2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Pattern-based Methods</head><p>Traditional pattern based methods predict that there is an is-a relation between a term pair (x, y), if x and y appear in the same sentence and satisfy a particular pattern. The earliest and most influen- tial work in this field is <ref type="bibr">Hearst (1992)</ref>, which hand- crafts several lexical patterns to harvest is-a rela- tions. A typical pattern is " <ref type="bibr">[C]</ref> such as <ref type="bibr">[E]</ref>", where <ref type="bibr">[C]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[E]</ref> are placeholders of noun phrases that are regarded as the hypernym (class) y and the hy- ponym (entity) x respectively for an is-a relation <ref type="bibr">(x, y)</ref>. Based on Hearst patterns, Probase is con- structed from billions of Web pages. It consists of 2.65 million concepts and 20.76 million is-a re- lations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2012</ref>). Similar approaches are presented in <ref type="bibr">Etzioni et al. (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kozareva and Hovy (2010)</ref>, which employ Hearst patterns to in- duce taxonomies from Web pages.</p><p>Despite the successful applications, these pat- terns are too specific to cover all linguistic cir- cumstances, thus recall is sacrificed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2012)</ref>. Simple pattern matching is prone to error due to idiomatic expressions, parsing errors, in- complete/uninformative extractions and ambigu- ous issues ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kozareva et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Etzioni et al., 2004</ref>). In the next part, we summarize key tech- niques to improve precision and recall for pattern- based methods. Note that a robust is-a relation ex- traction system may combine multiple techniques to achieve high precision and recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Methods Improving Recall</head><p>Pattern Generalization Several approaches ei- ther extend original Hearst patterns by linguistic rules or learn more generalized lexico-syntactic patterns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ritter et al. (2009)</ref> increase recall by re- placing the noun phrase " <ref type="bibr">[E]</ref>" (i.e., candidate hy- ponym) in Hearst patterns with a list of k noun phrases. <ref type="bibr">Luu et al. (2014)</ref> design more flexible patterns where a few words in such patterns are in- terchangeable. Automatic methods mine is-a pat- terns given a collection of seed instances as in- put. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Snow et al. (2004)</ref> use the dependency path of two terms to represent the pattern, where both syntactic and lexical connections of two terms can be modeled. This practice is more resistent to noise than surface matching and is employed by a number of relation extraction systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Snow et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Banko et al., 2007;</ref>.</p><p>The number of patterns generated from a text corpus is sufficiently large, causing the feature sparsity problem. Learning more abstract patterns from these "raw" patterns can improve the gen- erality of these patterns, hence increases recall. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Navigli and Velardi (2010)</ref> introduce the concept "star pattern" (which use wildcards to replace non- frequent words in sentences). More general pat- terns are created by clustering star patterns. In the PATTY system ( <ref type="bibr">Nakashole et al., 2012</ref>), a subset of words along the dependency path are replaced by their POS tags, ontological types or wildcards.</p><p>Iterative Extraction Incorrect relations are fre- quently extracted from overly generalized pat- terns due to language ambiguity and semantic drift <ref type="bibr">(Carlson et al., 2010)</ref>. In contrast to above- mentioned approaches, an opposite idea is to use extremely specific patterns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kozareva et al. (2008)</ref> employ "doubly-anchored" patterns (e.g., "cars such as Ford and *") to harvest hyponyms for a particular hypernym and expand both hyponyms and hypernyms by a bootstrapping loop. It uses each pattern as a query and takes search engine results as a Web corpus. Another advantage is that the ambiguity of terms can be eliminated by "doubly-anchored" patterns. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kozareva and Hovy (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Carlson et al. (2010)</ref>, new is-a relations and hypernym patterns are iteratively ex- tracted in an automatic manner.</p><p>Hypernym Inference This type of methods overcome the limitation where x and y must ap- pear in the same sentence. The idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ritter et al. (2009)</ref> is that if y is a hypernym of x and another term x is sufficiently similar to x, there is a high probability that y is a hypernym of x . They train an HMM to learn a better similarity measure than vector-based approaches. In the Syntactic Con- textual Subsumption (SCS) method ( <ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2014</ref>), given a non-taxonomic relation r, denote S r (x) as the collection of objects such that for each s ∈ S r (x), x and s has the relation r. If S r (y) mostly contains S r (x) but not vice versa, we can infer y is a hypernym of x.</p><p>Syntactic inference on hyponym modifiers can generate additional is-a relations. For example, the machine can infer a grizzly bear is a bear based on the evidence that the head word of "grizzly bear" is "bear". In Taxify (Alfarone and Davis, 2015), the system adds the linguistic head of a multi-word term as its direct hypernym if the term is added to the taxonomy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Suchanek et al. (2007)</ref> link con- ceptual Wikipedia categories to WordNet synsets based on category head words. <ref type="bibr">Gupta et al. (2016)</ref> introduce linguistic heuristics to derive is-a rela- tions from Wikipedia category network. Besides English, a similar observation also holds for Chi- nese, as shown in <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Li et al. (2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Methods Improving Precision</head><p>Confidence Assessment After candidate is-a pairs (x, y) are extracted, statistical measures can be used to estimate confidence scores. Relations with low scores are discarded. In KnowItAll <ref type="bibr">(Etzioni et al., 2004</ref>), the system estimates the point- wise mutual information (PMI) of x and y by search engine hit counts. Probase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2012)</ref> employs the ratio of likelihood to determine the most possible hypernym y for a concept x, and re- versely the most possible hyponym x for a concept y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al. (2012)</ref> further calculate the plausibil- ity of extracted is-a pairs based on a Naive Bayes classifier. Besides statistics from extraction re- sults, <ref type="bibr">Luu et al. (2014</ref><ref type="bibr">Luu et al. ( , 2015</ref> consider external fac- tors, such as the inclusion of concepts in WordNet and dictionaries, as well as the trustworthiness of data sources (e.g. Web pages). The experience of building Google's Knowledge Vault ( <ref type="bibr">Dong et al., 2014)</ref> shows that assessing confidence scores is essential for acquiring and fusing knowledge from different extractors.</p><p>It is worth nothing that the negative evidence can be also employed to estimate confidence scores. A recent approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang and He, 2016)</ref> uses statistics of both hypernym and co-hyponym patterns to give each pair a positive score and a negative score. Experiments show that using neg- ative scores improves precision by discarding co- hyponym relations that are incorrectly predicted as is-a relations by their model.</p><p>Classification-based Validation These meth- ods train a classifier f to predict the correctness of an extracted pair (x, y). Models of choice typi- cally include SVM, logistic regression and neural nets. The features for f can be roughly divided into following categories: surface name, syntax, statistics, external resources, etc. In the literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Snow et al. (2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Snow et al. ( , 2006</ref>) use the dependency paths between x and y as features in the corresponding lexico-syntactic patterns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ritter et al. (2009)</ref> in- troduce a list of features based the frequency of matches between a pair and Hearst patterns, such as the number of matches for "x is a y" in a cor- pus. Surface name features ( <ref type="bibr">Bansal et al., 2014</ref>) consider the word formation of x and y, includ- ing whether x and y are capitalized, whether x ends with y. <ref type="bibr">Bansal et al. (2014)</ref> further employ statistics derived from matches of Hearst patterns in the corpus and Wikipedia abstracts. This is be- cause abstracts in Wikipedia contain definitions and summaries about concepts that can be used for inferring is-a relations.</p><p>Using both pattern-based and distributional rep- resentations of x and y can also enhance the per- formance of the classifier, as shown in . This technique can be viewed as a combination of pattern-based and distributional methods, which will be discussed in details in Sect. 2.2.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Distributional Methods</head><p>Distributional methods predict is-a relations be- tween terms based on their distributional rep- resentations, by either unsupervised measures (Sect. 2.2.2) or supervised models (Sect. 2.2.3). Because they directly predict is-a relations instead of extracting all is-a relations in a corpus, we briefly introduce how to obtain key terms to form term pairs as candidate is-a relations (Sect. 2.2.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Key Term Extraction</head><p>The first step for predicting is-a relations is to gen- erate candidate hyponyms/hypernyms. For free texts, they are usually key terms, which are nouns, noun phases and/or named entities that frequently appear in the corpus. The key terms can be iden- tified by applying POS tagging or NER tools to the corpora and then using rule-based extractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Yang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zhu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2014</ref>). Existing keyword or key phrase extractors can be also used to recognize these terms automati- cally <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Navigli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Qureshi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">da Silva Conrado et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>For learning domain-specific taxonomies, an important post-processing step after extracting key terms is domain filtering. This filters out terms not in the domain of interest, improving the taxon- omy precision. A term can be filtered by statistics- based cuts, which include TF, TF-IDF, domain rel- evance, domain consensus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Navigli and Velardi, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">de Knijff et al., 2013</ref>) and domain specificity scores ( <ref type="bibr">Alfarone and Davis, 2015)</ref>. To ensure the extracted terms are important concepts in a partic- ular domain, several methods only harvest terms from domain definitive sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Navigli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Velardi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anke et al., 2016b</ref>). Specially, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Navigli et al. (2011)</ref> propose to use do- main weights to select sentences that define unam- biguous terms pertained to the domain of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Unsupervised Measures</head><p>We first survey various unsupervised measures for is-a relation identification. After that, feature rep- resentations are introduced for these measures.</p><p>Distributional Similarity Measures Early work of distributional similarity measures mostly focuses on symmetric measures such as cosine, Jaccard, Jensen-Shannon divergence and the widely cited LIN measure <ref type="bibr">(Lin, 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">LIN(x, y) = f ∈Fx∩Fy w x (f ) + w y (f ) f ∈Fx w x (f ) + f ∈Fy w y (f )</formula><p>where x and y are candidate hyponyms and hyper- nyms respectively. F x and F y are features of x and y. w x (f ) is the weight of feature f for word x. But they only learn semantic similarity of words.</p><p>Asymmetric measures model the asymmetric property of is-a relations, following the Distribu- tional Inclusion Hypothesis (DIH) <ref type="bibr">(Geffet and Dagan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2009)</ref>. It assumes that a hyponym only appears in some of its hypernym's contexts, but a hypernym appears in all contexts of its hyponyms. For example, the concept "fruit" has a broader spectrum of contexts than its hyponyms, such as "apple", "banana" and "pear". As an example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Weeds et al. (2004)</ref> pro- pose a simple measure WeedsPrec to compute the weighted inclusion of features of y within features of x:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">WeedsPrec(x, y) = f ∈Fx∩Fy w y (f ) f ∈Fy w y (f )</formula><p>Other asymmetric measures are introduced in a variety of research, e.g., <ref type="bibr">WeedsRec (Weeds et al., 2004</ref>), <ref type="bibr">BalAPInc (Kotlerman et al., 2010)</ref>, ClarkeDE (Clarke, 2009), cosWeeds, in- vCL ( <ref type="bibr">Lenci and Benotto, 2012)</ref>, WeightedCo- sine ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rei and Briscoe, 2014)</ref>. Detailed summa- rization of distributional similarity measures can be found in an early survey on vector space se- mantic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Turney and Pantel, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, several studies suggest that DIH is not correct for all the cases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Santus et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rimell, 2014)</ref>. For example, "American" is a hypernym of "Barack Obama" but the (politics- related) contexts of "Barack Obama" cannot be covered by those of "American". Most contexts of a hypernym are less informative and more general than those of its hyponyms. To solve this prob- lem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Santus et al. (2014)</ref> propose an entropy-based measure SLQS for hypernym detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roller et al. (2014)</ref> introduce the Selective Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis, which means the original DIH is correct, but only for relevant dimensions.</p><p>Features For each term x, a collection of fea- tures F x are generated from the text corpus, where each feature f ∈ F x represents a contextual word with which x co-occurs <ref type="bibr">(Lin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Weeds et al., 2004</ref>). In some work, f also specifies the syn- tactic relation between x and f (Lin, 1998). As stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Padó and Lapata (2003)</ref>, the usage of syntactic-based vector space model can better dis- tinguish different lexical relations than the sim- ple "Bag-of-Words" co-occurrence model. In ad- dition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schütze (1993)</ref> use the context word and the position relative to the target term as features. <ref type="bibr">Baroni and Lenci (2010)</ref> propose a Distributional Memory framework to generate word-link-word features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yamada et al. (2009)</ref> use raw verb- noun dependencies and cluster such dependencies to generate feature vectors</p><p>The value of each feature is determined by a weight function w x (f ), which quantifies the statis- tical association between the feature f and the cor- responding word x. Choices of w x (f ) include the (point-wise) Mutual Information (PPMI) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Weeds et al., 2004</ref>), Local Mutual Information (LMI) <ref type="bibr">(Evert, 2005)</ref>. Dimension reduction methods such as SVD can be employed to create dense vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Roller and Erk, 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Supervised Models</head><p>With training sets available, classification/ranking methods train a model to predict hypernymy based on the representations of a term pair (x, y). Hy- pernym generation approaches directly model how to "generate" hypernyms based on the representa- tions of hyponyms in the embedding space.</p><p>Classification In classification methods, the most popular representations for x and y are word embeddings generated by pre-trained neural lan- guage models such as <ref type="bibr">Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>), GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) and ivLBL <ref type="bibr">(Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013)</ref>. SensEmbed (Ia- cobacci et al., 2015) generates different embed- dings for different senses of the same word.</p><p>The concat model combines term-pair vectors by x ⊕ y where x is the embedding vector of word x, then trains an off-the-shelf classifier such as SVM ( <ref type="bibr">Baroni et al., 2012)</ref>. This model is regarded as a strong baseline in some papers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kruszewski et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mirza and Tonelli, 2016)</ref>. Recent work points out that it has a serious problem of lexical memorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Roller et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Levy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Weeds et al., 2014</ref>). It means that the classifier learns the semantics of terms rather than the relations between the terms. Consequently, when the training sets and testing sets are significantly different, the model suffers from a poor performance.</p><p>To over this problem, the diff model uses vector offsets as features, represented as y − x ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rimell, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Weeds et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fu et al., 2014</ref>). The asym model is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roller et al. (2014)</ref>, using both vector difference and squared vector difference features. The simDiff model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Turney and Mohammad, 2015)</ref> employs the difference of two word-context matrices (i.e., domain matrix and function matrix) as features for relation classi- fication. Additionally, other combinations of vec- tors are mentioned in the literature, such as vec- tor sum x + y, and dot-product x · y ( . <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Roller and Erk (2016)</ref> exploit Hearst patterns in distributional vectors and introduce a PCA-like iterative procedure to learn concat clas- sifiers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kruszewski et al. (2015)</ref> learn mappings from distributional vectors to boolean-valued vec- tors, where the output vectors correspond to en- tailment between words.</p><p>In neural language models ( <ref type="bibr">Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, words that occur in similar contexts have similar embeddings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yu et al. (2015)</ref> argue that this modeling technique is not strong enough to learn term embeddings for is-a relation prediction. For each word x, they learn two types of embeddings x o and x e , rep- resenting the embeddings of x when x functions as a hyponym and a hypernym, respectively. The embeddings are generated by training a distance- margin based neural net. <ref type="bibr">Luu et al. (2016b)</ref> fur- ther extend this approach by modeling the con- texts between hypernyms and hyponyms in a dy- namic weighting neural net. <ref type="bibr">Li et al. (2016)</ref> de- sign a joint model based on negative sampling to embed entities and categories jointly into the same semantic space. The high performance shows that using task-specific embeddings is more effective than general-purpose embeddings.</p><p>Hypernym Generation Hypernym generation approaches make prediction for a pair (x, y) by whether the model can map x to a vector close to y. <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2014)</ref> is a pioneer work in this field, which employs uniform linear projection and piecewise linear projection to map the embeddings of a hyponym to its hypernym. After that, three approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang and He, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yamane et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tan et al., 2015)</ref> have been proposed to ex- tend <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang and He (2016)</ref> up- date transition matrices and extract new is-a rela- tions iteratively. They improve the performance of the piecewise projection model when training sets and test sets have little overlap in the seman- tic space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yamane et al. (2016)</ref> learn the number of clusters and transition matrices jointly by dy- namically clustering is-a pairs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tan et al. (2015)</ref> replace the transition matrix with the embedding of "is-a". As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yamane et al. (2016)</ref>, these methods are comparable to state-of-the-art classi- fication approaches in terms of F-measure. Addi- tionally, by domain clustering, the approach ( <ref type="bibr">Fu et al., 2014</ref>) is modified to a transfer learning ver- sion that is sensitive to target data sources for do- main adaptation <ref type="bibr">(Anke et al., 2016a</ref>).</p><p>The negative sampling technique proves ef- fective to enhance projection learning. This is because the representations of hypernymy rela- tions are sometimes confused with synonymy, co-hyponymy and meronymy. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ustalov et al. (2017)</ref>, an additional regularization term is added to the model of <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2014)</ref> to take the advan- tage of the semantics of not-is-a relations.  explicitly learn the representations of not-is-a relations so that the true hypernymy rela- tions are better distinguished. This method con- siders the representations of both is-a and not-is-a relations, hypernym-level similarity and linguistic rules in a transductive learning setting.</p><p>Ranking As an alternative approach, <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2013)</ref> present a ranking model to select the most probable hypernym for an entity. Replacing a clas- sification model with a ranking model is not a common practice for extracting is-a relations, due to its low recall. However, this method is specif- ically engineered for the Chinese language. As shown in ( <ref type="bibr">Fu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang and He, 2016)</ref>, learning Chinese is-a relations is fundamentally challenging due to flexible language expressions. Thus it is necessary to train a ranking model to extract Chinese is-a re- lations with high precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Discussion</head><p>In the literature, there are some disagreements on which methods are more effective for is-a re- lation prediction. For example,  claim that distributional methods outper- form pattern-based approaches, while <ref type="bibr">Levy et al. (2015)</ref> hold the opinion that distributional meth- ods do not even work. We overview major view-points in the research community and analyze pros and cons for both types of methods.</p><p>Pattern-based methods extract is-a relations (x, y) based on the lexico-syntactic paths connect- ing x and y in a corpus, which explicitly express the relation. The original Hearst patterns <ref type="bibr">(Hearst, 1992)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang and He (2016)</ref>, they suffer from ex- tremely low recall for the Chinese language.</p><note type="other">and more generalized patterns have been used in a large number of taxonomies (Wu et al., 2012; Navigli et al., 2011). A disadvantage is that using patterns as features may result in the sparsity of the feature space (Nakashole et al., 2012). Most methods require x and y to co-occur in the same sentence. Hence, the recall is limited. Besides, they are overly language-dependent and difficult to use if there are few Hearst-like patterns in other languages. For example, as shown in Fu et al. (2014);</note><p>In contrast, distributional approaches use word representations derived from contexts, indepen- dent of its hyponym or hypernym. The usage of word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) allows machines to make predictions based on the entire corpus. However, distributional methods are less precise in detecting specific, strict is-a relations and tend to discover broad semantic similarity be- tween terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yu et al., 2015)</ref>. As Weeds et al. (2014) discover, some terms de- tected by distributional methods are co-hyponyms and meronyms, rather than hypernyms. Another drawback is that the representations are domain dependent and the models are heavily related to the training set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roller et al., 2014</ref>). Yet a further criticism is pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Levy et al. (2015)</ref>. They find that supervised distributional methods actu- ally learn whether y is a "prototypical hypernym", instead of the relation between x and y. This is because the features x and y are generated inde- pendently. They integrate the intra-pair similarity with the diff model by kernel functions but only achieves an incremental improvement.</p><p>Despite their own disadvantages, pattern-based and distributional methods have been considered complementary. The idea of integrating them has been proposed early ( <ref type="bibr">Mirkin et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2008</ref>) but have not drawn much at- tention over the years. Recently, the HyperNET system ( ) represents a pair (x, y) by both distributional and pattern-based fea- tures. Each pattern is represented by a dependency path, and embedded by an LSTM model <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref>. Experiments show that the joint representation improves the perfor- mance notably, having F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.700 over two large datasets. In contrast, the best pattern-based method (i.e., an extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Snow et al. (2004)</ref>) has the performance of 0.761 and 0.660. The best distributional approach based on the concat model has the performance of 0.746 and 0.637. An extension of the previous model named <ref type="bibr">LexNET (Shwartz and Dagan, 2016</ref>) is proposed to recognize multiple relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Taxonomy Induction</head><p>In this part, we summarize techniques for creating taxonomies from is-a relations.</p><p>Incremental Learning Several methods con- struct an entire taxonomy from a "seed" taxon- omy via incremental learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Snow et al. (2006)</ref> enrich WordNet by maximizing the probability of an extended taxonomy based on the evidence of is-a and cousin relations harvested from texts. They focus on extracting new entities and attach- ing them to the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shen et al. (2012)</ref> observe that the extracted terms can either refer to existing entities in the taxonomy or new ones, and propose a graph-based method to link these terms to the taxonomy or insert new entities into the taxonomy. While these methods rely heavily on existing taxonomies, Kozareva and Hovy (2010) take a root concept as input only and iteratively extract is-a relations to expand the tax- onomy. Alfarone and Davis (2015) further con- sider the problem that a "seed" taxonomy cannot be obtained in a specific domain. They construct the "seed" taxonomy by Hearst pattern matching and heuristic rules.</p><p>Clustering Taxonomy learning can be modeled as a clustering problem where similar terms clus- tered together may share the same hypernym. Hi- erarchical clustering is employed to cluster simi- lar terms into a taxonomy <ref type="bibr">(Hjelm and Buitelaar, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">de Knijff et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Meijer et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Song et al. (2015)</ref> improve the hierarchical clus- tering technique by scalable Bayesian Rose Trees. A similar idea is also introduced in <ref type="bibr">Alfarone and Davis (2015)</ref> where the lowest common ancestor of a collection of terms clustered by K-Medoids is inferred as their common hypernym. The SCS method ( <ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2014</ref>) (see Sect. 2.1.1) is also related to clustering because it groups simi-lar terms by non-taxonomic relations, and infer its hypernyms to improve the taxonomy coverage.</p><p>Graph-based Induction Graph-based ap- proaches are naturally suitable for this task be- cause taxonomies are generally graphs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kozareva and Hovy (2010)</ref> derive the path from the root to a target term by finding the longest path in a raw graph where edges represent noisy is-a relations. <ref type="bibr">Anke et al. (2016b)</ref> calculate the path weights by multiplying the domain pertinence scores of its edges. Another frequently used algorithm is the optimal branching algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Velardi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2014</ref>). It first assigns edge weights based on graph connectivity (e.g., in-degree, be- tweenness, etc.), and finds an optimal branching based on Chu-Liu/Edmonds's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Karp, 1971)</ref>. After noisy edge removal, a rooted tree is constructed with maximum weights. <ref type="bibr">Bansal et al. (2014)</ref> employ a factor graph model to represent terms and is-a relations. The learning of a taxonomy is regarded as a structured learning problem for the model, solved by loopy belief propagation.</p><p>Taxonomy Cleansing The final step of taxon- omy learning is taxonomy cleansing, which re- moves wrong is-a relations to improve the qual- ity. A recent study on Probase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2012)</ref> shows that incorrect is-a relations may exist in taxonomies in the form of cycles ( <ref type="bibr">Liang et al., 2017a)</ref>. By eliminating cycles, 74K wrong is-a re- lations are detected. This cycle removal process is also applied in <ref type="bibr">Deshpande et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Fu et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Li et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>Another issue is entity ambiguity. As discussed in <ref type="bibr">Liang et al. (2017b)</ref>, the transitivity property does not necessarily hold in automatically con- structed taxonomies. For example, the facts "(Al- bert Einstein, is-a, professor)" and "(professor, is- a, position)" do not mean that "(Albert Einstein, is-a, position)". The ambiguity issue has been addressed in a few systems (Anke et al., 2016b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009</ref>) by word sense disambiguation. However, it is not fully solved. While learning multiple senses of the word "bank" (a financial institution or river- side) is easy nowadays, it is more challenging to distinguish whether the word "professor" refers to a particular person or a job title in the taxonomy learning process. Based on <ref type="bibr">Liang et al. (2017b)</ref>, we can safely conclude that there is a long way Contributor/Paper #Positive #Negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kotlerman et al. (2010)</ref> 1,068 2,704 <ref type="bibr">Baroni and Lenci (2011)</ref> 1,337 13,210 <ref type="bibr">Baroni et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Resources and Analysis</head><p>In this section, we summarize resources and met- rics for taxonomy learning. Results and recom- mendations for future research are also discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Resources</head><p>There have been a variety of resources for the re- search of is-a relation prediction.  <ref type="bibr">Flati et al., 2016)</ref>). We need to point out that these systems are not necessarily all taxonomies but contain rich type hierarchical knowledge. We also summarize some recent (2010∼) test sets and statistics in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>  In TExEval, the goal is to construct taxonomies in four target domains (i.e. chemicals, equipment, food and science), each with gold-standard pro- vided. The setting is expanded to cover four Euro- pean languages (i.e., English, Dutch, French and Italian) in TExEval-2. In this task, the partici- pants are encouraged to use the Wikipedia cor- pus as input but there are no restrictions on the data sources. In previous studies, several domain- specific corpora have also been employed as inputs for taxonomies, including AI papers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Velardi et al., 2013)</ref>, biomedical corpora ( <ref type="bibr">Alfarone and Davis, 2015)</ref>, Web pages related to animals, plants and vehicles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kozareva et al., 2008</ref>) and MH370 ( <ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2016a</ref>), terrorism reports ( <ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2014)</ref>, disease reports and emails ( <ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2016a)</ref> and Wikipedia corpora related to specific topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>Evaluating hypernymy prediction algorithms is by no means easy. Given a collection of is-a and not- is-a term pairs as ground truth, standard relation classification metrics such as Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-score (F) can be employed to make the comparison ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, evaluating the quality of an entire tax- onomy is a non-trivial task due to i) the large size of a taxonomy, ii) the difficulty of obtaining gold standard and iii) the existence of multiple as- pects that should be considered such as topology, correctness and coverage. If gold standard tax- onomies are available, denote S = (V S , E S ) and G = (V G , E G ) as the extracted and gold standard taxonomies where V S and V G are node sets, E S and E G are edge sets. Evaluation metrics intro- duced in the two shared tasks ( <ref type="bibr">Bordea et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Bordea et al., , 2016</ref> are briefly summarized as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">• Node coverage: |V S ∩ V G |, |V S ∩ V G |/|V G |; • Edge coverage: |E S ∩ E G |, |E S ∩ E G |/|E G |, (|E S | − |E S ∩ E G |)/|E G |;</formula><p>• Edge correctness:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P = |E S ∩E G |/|E S |, R = |E S ∩ E G |/|E G |, F = 2(P · R)/(P + R);</formula><p>• Cumulative Fowlkes&amp;Mallows (Cumulative F&amp;M) measure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Velardi et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>The second type of metrics compares tax- onomies generated by different methods. Size (|V S | and |E S |) and quality are two factors to be considered. Human assessment is required to estimate the accuracy by sampling and labeling edges. Additionally, topological statistics, includ- ing the numbers of simple directed cycles, con- nected components and intermediate nodes, can check whether the taxonomy is a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and well-structured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Result Analysis and Discussion</head><p>While we have discussed is-a relation prediction in Sect. 2.2.4, we mostly focus on the overall per- formance for taxonomy learning in this part.</p><p>We first analyze results of the two shared tasks ( <ref type="bibr">Bordea et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Bordea et al., , 2016</ref> as they re- port performance of a variety of methods. In both task, two pattern-based methods (i.e., <ref type="bibr">INRIASAC (Grefenstette, 2015</ref>) in TExEval and TAXI <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Panchenko et al., 2016</ref>) in TExEval-2) consistently outperform others. INRIASAC uses frequency-based co-occurrence statistics, and sub- string inclusion heuristics to extract a set of hy- pernyms for hyponyms. TAXI crawls a domain- specific corpora and employs lexico-syntactic pat- terns and substrings for domain is-a relation ex- traction. However, the potential of distributional methods is not fully exploited as only one sys- tem uses such techniques. Besides, different sys- tems may use their own corpora in these tasks and hence the results do not directly reflect the "goodness" of these algorithms. In multilingual tasks, there is a large decrease in performance w.r.t. other languages in TAXI. The research ( <ref type="bibr">Fu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang and He, 2016)</ref> shares a similar experience when several effective algorithms for English do not really work for Chinese. This phe- nomenon calls for language-specific algorithms for non-English language sources.</p><p>For other works, although knowledge sources and domains may differ, we notice that they suf- fer from the low recall problem. For example, recall values of <ref type="bibr">Bansal et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Luu et al. (2014);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Navigli et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kozareva and Hovy (2010)</ref> are lower than 50% in most cases and do- mains. While improving precision is relatively easy by imposing constraints, increasing recall is more challenging because we aim to identify all is-a relations, no matter whether the relations are expressed explicitly or implicitly, in one or multi- ple sentences . This problem becomes severe when less focused and dynamic domains are considered <ref type="figure">(Velardi et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Our Recommendations</head><p>Based on our analysis, we discuss our recommen- dations to improve the performance of taxonomy learning that have not been sufficiently addressed.</p><p>Ensemble Representations and Deep Architec- tures  show that combin- ing pattern-based and distributional methods can improve the performance of is-a relation extrac- tion. We suggest that the performance can be fur- ther improved by studying how the two types of approaches reinforce each other. Neural network models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luu et al., 2016b</ref>) are ef- fective to learn deeper representations of both fea- tures. In our opinion, It is also possible to solve the problem put forward by <ref type="bibr">Levy et al. (2015)</ref> by adding the information of semantic relatedness between term pairs mined from patterns to dis- tributed representations.</p><p>Another related topic is that despite several em- bedding learning methods mentioned above, there is only limited success of deep learning paradigms for the taxonomy induction. We believe this is mostly because it is difficult to design a single objective for neural networks to optimize for this task. Hence how to take advantage of the deep learning boom for taxonomy induction is worth re- searching in the future.</p><p>Benchmarks and Evaluation Benchmarks for taxonomy learning are crucial to quantify the per- formance of state-of-the-arts. Benchmarks should contain text corpora, gold standards and evalua- tion metrics. <ref type="bibr">Bordea et al. (2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Bordea et al. ( , 2016</ref> have pro- vided some gold standard taxonomies in several domains and languages but do not require all the systems to run over the same corpus. Other works use standard test sets and data sources, as we have summarized in Sect. 3.1.</p><p>Several issues in current benchmarks and meth- ods have already been pointed out by previous works. <ref type="bibr">Levy et al. (2015)</ref> show that supervised systems actually over-perform due to the lexical memorization problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shwartz et al. (2017)</ref> sug- gest that unsupervised approaches are more robust than supervised methods but supervised meth- ods outperform unsupervised ones. Camacho- Collados (2017) discuss whether the hypernymy detection task is indeed an appropriate task for evaluating is-a relations in the context of taxon- omy learning systems or their integration in down- stream applications. We can see that more in- depth research should be done towards a complete, widely-accepted benchmark for evaluation.</p><p>Unambiguous and Canonicalized Terms For lexical taxonomies, a term may have multiple surface forms and senses. The ambiguity issue makes taxonomy-based applications prone to er- ror ( <ref type="bibr">Liang et al., 2017b)</ref>. It is desirable to con- struct taxonomies where each node represents an unambiguous term associated with its possible sur- face forms and their contexts. In this way, the taxonomy automatically supports entity linking and is beneficial for IR applications (e.g., Web search) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Shen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hua et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Incorporating Domain Knowledge Domain knowledge is essential for term and relation ex- traction in domain-specific corpora but it is dif- ficult to obtain from such limited corpora. By exploiting facts derived from domain knowledge bases, a domain taxonomy would be learned via distant supervision and have higher coverage than existing methods <ref type="bibr">(Alfarone and Davis, 2015)</ref>. Thus, it is an important task to construct a taxon- omy based on a text corpus and a knowledge base of a specific domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-English and Under-resourced Languages</head><p>The task addressed in this paper has not been ex- tensively studied for under-resourced languages. Specifically, pattern-based methods, although ef- fective for English, are language-dependent to a large extent. How to apply existing approaches to languages that are significantly different from En- glish (e.g., Chinese, Arabic and Japanese) is wor- thy of research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present a survey on taxonomy learning from text corpora. We overview pattern- based and distributional methods to learn hyper- nymy from texts, and discuss how to induce tax- onomies from is-a relations. While there is signifi- cant success, this task is still far from being solved. By addressing the issues discussed in this paper, we suggest that high-quality taxonomies can be constructed in more domains and languages, hav- ing a greater influence in NLP and IR research.
