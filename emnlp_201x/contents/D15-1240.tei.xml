				<p>Usernames are ubiquitous on the Internet, and they are often suggestive of user de-mographics. This work looks at the degree to which gender and language can be inferred from a username alone by making use of unsupervised morphology induction to decompose usernames into sub-units. Experimental results on the two tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed morphological features compared to a character n-gram baseline.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>There is much interest in automatic recognition of demographic information of Internet users to improve the quality of online interactions. Re- searchers have looked into identifying a variety of factors about users, including age, gender, lan- guage, religious beliefs and political views. Most work leverages multiple sources of information, such as search query history, Twitter feeds, Face- book likes, social network links, and user profiles. However, in many situations, little of this infor- mation is available. Conversely, usernames are al- most always available.</p><p>In this work, we look specifically at classify- ing gender and language based only on the user- name. Prior work by sociologists has established a link between usernames and gender ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cornetto and Nowak, 2006</ref>), and studies have linked user- names to other attributes, such as individual be- liefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Crabill, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hassa, 2012)</ref> and shown how usernames shape perceptions of gender and eth- nicity in the absence of common nonverbal cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Pelletier, 2014)</ref>. The connections to ethnicity mo- tivate the exploration of language identification.</p><p>Gender identification based on given names is very effective for English ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Liu and Ruths, 2013)</ref>, since many names are strongly associated with a particular gender, like "Emily" or "Mark". Unfor- tunately, the requirement that each username be unique precludes use of given names alone. In- stead, usernames are typically a combination of component words, names and numbers. For ex- ample, the Twitter name @taylorswift13 might decompose into "taylor", "swift" and "13". The sub-units carry meaning and, importantly, they are shared with many other individuals. Thus, our ap- proach is to leverage automatic decomposition of usernames into sub-units for use in classification.</p><p>We use the Morfessor algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Creutz and Lagus, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Virpioja et al., 2013</ref>) for unsuper- vised morphology induction to learn the decom- position of the usernames into sub-units. Morfes- sor has been used successfully in a variety of lan- guage modeling frameworks applied to a number of languages, particularly for learning concatena- tive morphological structure. The usernames that we analyze are a good match to the Morfessor framework, which allows us to push the boundary of how much can be done with only a username.</p><p>The classifier design is described in the next section, followed by a description of experiments on gender and language recognition that demon- strate the utility of morph-based features com- pared to character n-gram features. The paper closes with a discussion of related work and a summary of key findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">General Classification Approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Unsupervised Morphology Learning</head><p>In linguistics, a morpheme is the "minimal lin- guistic unit with lexical or grammatical meaning" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Booij, 2012)</ref>. Morphemes are combined in vari- ous ways to create longer words. Similarly, user- names are frequently made up of a concatenated sequence of smaller units. These sub-units will be referred to as u-morphs to highlight the fact that they play an analogous role to morphemes but for purposes of encoding usernames rather than stan- dard words in a language. The u-morphs are sub- units that are small enough to be shared across dif- ferent usernames but retain some meaning.</p><p>Unsupervised morphology induction using Morfessor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Creutz and Lagus, 2006</ref>) is based on a minimum description length (MDL) objective, which balances two competing goals: maximizing both the likelihood of the data and of the model. The likelihood of the data is maximized by longer tokens and a bigger lexicon whereas the likeli- hood of the model is maximized by a smaller lexi- con with shorter tokens. A parameter controls the trade-off between the two parts of the objective function, which alters the average u-morph length. We tune this parameter on held-out data to opti- mize the classification performance of the demo- graphic tasks.</p><p>Maximizing the Morfessor objective exactly is computationally intractable. The Morfessor algo- rithm searches for the optimal lexicon using an iterative approach. First, the highest probability decomposition for each training token is found given the current model. Then, the model is up- dated with the counts of the u-morphs. A u- morph is added to the lexicon when it increases the weighted likelihood of the data by more than the cost of increasing the size of the lexicon.</p><p>Usernames can be mixed-case, e.g. "JohnDoe". The case change gives information about a likely u-morph boundary, but at the cost of doubling the size of the character set. To more effectively lever- age this cue, all characters are made lowercase but each change from lower to uppercase is marked with a special token, e.g. "john$doe". Using this encoding reduces the u-morph inventory size, and we found it to give slightly better results in lan- guage identification.</p><p>Character 3-grams and 4-grams are used as baseline features. Before extracting the n-grams a "#" token is placed at the start and end of each username. The n-grams are overlapping to give them the best chance of finding a semantically meaningful sub-unit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Classifier Design</head><p>Given a decomposition of the username into a se- quence of u-morphs (or character n-grams), we represent the relationship between the observed features and each class with a unigram language model. If a username u has decomposition m 1 , . . . , m n then it is assigned to the class c i for which the unigram model gives it the highest pos- terior probability, or equivalently:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">argmax i p C (c i ) n k=1 p(m k |c i ),</formula><p>where p C (c i ) is the class prior and p(m k |c i ) is the class-dependent unigram. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For some demographics, the class prior can be very skewed, as in the case of language detec- tion where English is the dominant language. The choice of smoothing algorithm can be important in such cases, since minority classes have much less training data for estimating the language model and benefit from having more probability mass as- signed to unseen words. Here, we follow the ap- proach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Frank and Bouckaert, 2006</ref>) that normalizes the token count vectors for each class to have the same L 1 norm, specifically:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(m k |c i ) = 1 Z 1 + β · n(m k , c i ) n(c i ) ,</formula><p>where n(·) indicates counts and β controls the strength of the smoothing. Setting β equal to the number of training examples approximately matches the strength of the smoothing to the add- one-smoothing algorithm. Z = β + |M | is a con- stant to make the probabilities sum to one. Only a small portion of usernames on the In- ternet come with gender labels. In these situa- tions, semi-supervised learning algorithms can use the unlabeled data to improve the performance of the classifier. We use a self-training expectation- maximization (EM) algorithm similar to that de- scribed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nigam et al., 2000</ref>). The algorithm first learns a classifier on the labeled data. In the E-step, the classifier assigns probabilistic labels to the unlabeled data. In the M-step, the labeled data and the probabilistic labels are combined to learn a new classifier. These steps are iterated until con- vergence, which usually requires three iterations for our tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nigam et al. (2000)</ref> call their method EM-λ be- cause it uses a parameter λ to reduce the weight of the unlabeled examples relative to the labeled data. This is important because the independence assumptions of the unigram model lead to over- confident predictions. We used another method that directly corrects the estimated posterior prob- abilities. Using a small validation set, we binned the probability estimates and calculated the true class probability for each bin. The EM algorithm used the corrected probabilities for each bin for the unlabeled data during the maximization step. Samples with a prediction confidence of less than 60% are not used for training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Gender Identification</head><p>Data was collected from the OkCupid dating site by downloading up to 1,000 profiles from 27 cities in the United States, first for men seeking women and again for women seeking men to obtain a bal- anced set of 44,000 usernames. The data is parti- tioned into three sets with 80% assigned to train- ing and 10% each to validation and test. We also use 3.5M usernames from the photo messaging app Snapchat (McCormick, 2014): 1.5M are used for u-morph learning and 2M are for self-training. All names in this task used only lower case, due to the nature of the available data. The top features ranked by likelihood ratios are given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The u-morphs clearly carry semantic meaning, and the trigram features ap- pear to be substrings of the top u-morph fea- tures. The trigram features have an advantage when the u-morphs are under-segmented such as if the u-morph "niceguy" or "thatguy" is included in the lexicon. Conversely, the n-grams can suf- fer from over-segmentation. For example, the tri- gram "guy" is inside the surname "Nguyen" even though it is better to ignore that substring in this context. Many other tokens suffer from this prob- lem, e.g. "miss" is in "mission".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Male</head><p>The variable-length u-morphs are longer on av- erage than the character n-grams (4.9 characters). The u-morph inventory size is similar to that for 3-grams but 5-10 times smaller than the 4-gram inventory, depending on the amount of data used since the inventory is expanded in semi-supervised training. By using the MDL criterion in unsuper- vised morphology learning, the u-morphs provide a more efficient representation of usernames than n-grams and make it easier to control the trade- off between vocabulary size and average segment length. The smaller inventory is less sensitive to sparse data in language model training.  The experiment results are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. For the supervised learning method, the character 3-gram and 4-gram features give equivalent per- formance, and the u-morph features give the low- est error rate by a small amount (3% relative). More significantly, the character n-gram systems do not benefit from semi-supervised learning, but the u-morph features do. The semi-supervised u-morph features obtain an error rate of 25.8%, which represents a 10% relative reduction over the baseline character n-gram results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Language Identification on Twitter</head><p>This experiment takes usernames from the Twitter streaming API. Each username is associated with a tweet, for which the Twitter API identifies a lan- guage. The language labels are noisy, so we re- move approximately 35% of the tweets where the Twitter API does not agree with the langid.py clas- sifier ( <ref type="bibr">Lui and Baldwin, 2012)</ref>. Both training and test sets are restricted to the nine languages that comprise at least 1% of the training set. These languages cover 96% of the observed tweets (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). About 110,000 usernames were reserved for testing and 430,000 were used for training both u-morphs and the classifier. Semi-supervised methods are not used because of the abundant la- beled data. For each language, we train a one-vs.- all classifier. The mixed case encoding technique (see sec. 2.1) gives a small increase (0.5%) in the  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Precision, recall and F1 score for lan- guage identification using the 4-gram, u-morph representations and a combination system, averag- ing over all users.</p><p>accuracy of the model and reduces the u-morph model size by 5%.</p><p>The results in <ref type="table">Tables 3 and 4</ref> contrast sys- tems using 4-grams, u-morphs, and a combina- tion model, showing precision-recall trade-offs for all users together and F1 scores broken down by specific languages, respectively. The combina- tion system simply uses the average of the pos- terior log-probabilities for each class giving equal weight to each model. While the overall F1 scores are similar for the 4-gram and u-morph systems, their precision and recall trade-offs are quite dif- ferent, making them effective in combination. The 4-gram system has higher recall, and the u-morph system has higher precision. With the combina- tion, we obtain a substantial gain in precision over the 4-gram system with a modest loss in recall, re- sulting in a 3% absolute improvement in average F1 score. Looking at performance on the different lan- guages, we find that the F1 score for the combi- nation model is higher than the 4-gram for every language, with precision always improving. For the dominant languages, the difference in recall is negligible. The infrequent languages have a 4- 8% drop in recall, but the gains in precision are substantial for these languages, ranging from 50- 100% relative. The greatest contrast between the 4-gram and the combination system can be seen for the least frequent languages, i.e. the languages with the least amount of training data. In partic- ular, for French, the precision of the combination system (0.36) is double that of the 4-gram model (0.18) with only a 34% loss in recall (0.24 to 0.16).</p><p>Looking at the most important features from the classifier highlights the ability of the mor- phemes to capture relevant meaning. The pres- ence of the morpheme "juan", "jose" or "flor" in- crease the probability of a Spanish language tweet by five times. The same is true for Portuguese and the morpheme "bieber". The morpheme "q8"  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Language identification performance (F1 Scores) and relative frequency in the corpus for 4-gram (4-gr) and u-morph (u-m) representations and the combination system (Comb).</p><note type="other">Language Freq 4-gr u-m Comb English 43.</note><p>increases the odds of an Arabic language tweet by thirteen times due to its phonetic similarity to the name of the Arabic speaking country Kuwait.</p><p>Other features may simply reflect cultural norms. For example, having an underscore in the user- name makes it five percent less likely to observe an English tweet. These highly discriminative mor- phemes are both long and short. It is hard for the fixed-length n-grams to capture this information as well as the morphemes do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>Of the many studies on automatic classification of online user demographics, few have leveraged names or usernames at all, and the few that do mainly explore their use in combination with other features. The work presented here differs in its use of usernames alone, but more importantly in the introduction of morphological analysis to handle a large number of usernames. Two studies on gender recognition are particu- larly relevant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burger et al. (2011)</ref> use the Twitter username (or screen name) in combination with other profile and text features to predict gender, but they also look at the use of username features alone. The results are not directly comparable to ours, because of differences in the data set used (150k Twitter users) and the classifier framework (Winnow), but the character n-gram performance is similar to ours (21-22% different from the ma- jority baseline). The study uses over 400k char- acter n-grams (n=1-5) for screen names alone; our study indicatess that the u-morphs can reduce this number by a factor of 10. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burger et al. (2011)</ref> used the same strategy with the self-identified full name of the user as entered into their profile, obtaining 89% gender recognition (vs. 77% for screen names). Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Liu and Ruths (2013)</ref> use the full first name from a user's profile for gender detection, finding that for the names that are highly predictive of gender, performance improves by re- lying on this feature alone. However, more than half of the users have a name that has an unknown gender association. Manual inspection of these cases indicated that the majority includes strings formed like usernames, nicknames or other types of word concatenations. These examples are pre- cisely what the u-morph approach tries to address.</p><p>Language identification is an active area of re- search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bergsma et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Zubiaga et al., 2014</ref>), but the username has not been used as a feature. Again, results are difficult to compare due to the lack of a common test set, but it is no- table that the average F1 score for the combination model approaches the scores obtained on a similar Twitter language identification task where the al- gorithm has access to the full text of the tweet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lui and Baldwin, 2014</ref>): 73% vs. 77% .</p><p>A study that is potentially relevant to our work is automatic classification of ethnicity of Twit- ter users, specifically whether a user is African- American ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011</ref>). Again, a variety of content, profile and behav- ioral features are used. Orthographic features of the username are used (e.g. length, number of nu- meric/alpha characters), and names of users that a person retweets or replies to. The profile name features do not appear to be useful, but examples of related usernames point to the utility of our ap- proach for analysis of names in other fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In summary, this paper has introduced the use of unsupervised morphological analysis of user- names to extract features (u-morphs) for identi- fying user demographics, particularly gender and language. The experimental results demonstrate that usernames contain useful personal informa- tion, and that the u-morphs provide a more effi- cient and complementary representation than char- acter n-grams. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The result for language identifi- cation is particularly remarkable because it comes close to matching the performance achieved by us-ing the full text of a tweet. The work is com- plementary to other demographic studies in that the username prediction can be used together with other features, both for the user and members of his/her social network.</p><p>The methods proposed here could be extended in different directions. The unsupervised morphol- ogy learning algorithm could incorporate priors related to capitalization and non-alphabetic char- acters to better model these phenomena than our simple text normalization approach. More so- phisticated classifiers could also be used, such as variable-length n-grams or neural-network-based n-gram language models, as opposed to the uni- gram model used here. Of course the sophistica- tion of the classifier will be limited by the amount of training data available.</p><p>A large amount of data is not necessary to build a high precision username classifier. For example, less than 7,000 training examples were available for Turkish in the language identification exper- iment and the classifier had a precision of 76%. Since little data is required, there may be many more applications of this type of model. Prior work on unsupervised morphological in- duction focused on applying the algorithm to natu- ral language input. By using those techniques with a new type of input, this paper shows that there are other applications of morphology learning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2" validated="false"><head>Table 2 : Gender Classification Results</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table></table></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Note that the unigram model used here, which considers only the observed u-morphs or n-grams, is not the same as using a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier based on a vector of u-morph counts. In the former, unobserved u-morphs do not impact the class-dependent probability, whereas the zero counts do impact the probability for the NB classifier. Since the vast majority of possible u-morphs are unobserved in a username, it is better to base the decision only on the observed u-morphs. The n-gram model is actually a unigram with an n-gram &quot;vocabulary&quot; rather than an n-gram language model.</note>
