			<abstract>
				<p>Distant supervision has become the leading method for training large-scale relation extractors, with nearly universal adoption in recent TAC knowledge-base population competitions. However, there are still many questions about the best way to learn such extractors. In this paper we investigate four orthogonal improvements: integrating named entity linking (NEL) and coreference resolution into argument identification for training and extraction, enforcing type constraints of linked arguments , and partitioning the model by relation type signature. We evaluate sentential extraction performance on two datasets: the popular set of NY Times articles partially annotated by Hoffmann et al. (2011) and a new dataset, called GORECO, that is comprehensively annotated for 48 common relations. We find that using NEL for argument identification boosts performance over the traditional approach (named entity recognition with string match), and there is further improvement from using argument types. Our best system boosts precision by 44% and recall by 70%.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Relation extractors are commonly trained by dis- tant supervision (also known as knowledge-based weak supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al., 2011)</ref>), an au- tonomous technique that creates a labeled train- ing set by heuristically matching the contents of a knowledge base (KB) to mentions (substrings) in a textual corpus. For example, if a KB contained the ground tuple BornIn(Albert Einstein, Ulm) then a distant supervision system might label the sen- tence "While <ref type="bibr">[Einstein]</ref> 1 was born in <ref type="bibr">[Ulm]</ref> 2 , he moved to Munich at an early age." as a positive training instance of the BornIn relation. Although distant supervision is a simple idea and often cre- ates data with false positives, it has become ubiq- uitous; for example, all top-performing systems in recent TAC-KBP slot filling competitions used the method.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, many aspects of distant supervision are poorly studied. In response we perform an extensive search of ways to improve distant supervision and the extraction process, in- cluding using named entity linking (NEL) and coreference to identify arguments for distant su- pervision and extraction, as well as using type con- straints and partitioning the trained model by rela- tion type signatures.</p><p>The first step in the distant supervision process is argument identification <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) -finding textual mentions referring to entities that might be in some relation. Next comes matching, where KB facts, e.g. tuples such as R(e 1 , e 2 ), are associated with sentences mentioning entities e 1 and e 2 in the assumption that many of these sentences de- scribe the relation R. Most previous systems per- form these steps by first using named entity recog- nition (NER) to identify possible arguments and then using a simple string match, but this crude approach misses many possible instances. Since the separately-studied task of named entity linking (NEL) is precisely what is needed to perform dis- tant supervision, it is interesting to see if today's optimized linkers lead to improved performance when used to train extractors.</p><p>Coreference, the task of clustering mentions that describe the same entity, may also be use- ful for increasing the number of candidate argu- ments. Consider the following variant of our pre- vious example: "While [he] 1 was born in <ref type="bibr">[Ulm]</ref> 2 , <ref type="bibr">[Einstein]</ref> 3 moved to Munich at an early age." Since mentions 1 and 3 corefer, one could con- sider using either the pair 1, 2 or 3, 2 (or both) for training. Intuitively, it seems that 1, 2 is more representative of BornIn and might generalize bet- ter, so we consider the use of coreference at both training and extraction time.</p><p>Semantic relations often have selectional prefer- ences (also known as type signatures); for exam- ple, BornIn holds between people and locations. Therefore, it seems promising to include entity types, whether coarse or fine grained in the dis- tantly supervised relation extraction process. We consider two ways of adding this information. By using NEL to get linked entities, we can impose type constraints on the relation extraction system to only allow relations over appropriately typed mentions. We also investigate using coarse types from NER to learn separate models for different relation type signatures in order to make the mod- els more effective.</p><p>In summary, this paper represents the following contributions:</p><p>• We explore several dimensions for improv- ing distantly supervised relation extraction, including better argument identification dur- ing training and extraction using both NEL and coreference, partitioning the model by relation type signatures, and enforcing type constraints of linked arguments as a post- processing step. While some of these ideas may seem straightforward, to our knowledge they have not been systematically studied. And, as we show, they lead to dramatic im- provements.</p><p>• Since previous datasets are incapable of mea- suring an extractor's true recall, we intro- duce GORECO, a new exhaustively-labeled dataset with gold annotations for sentential instances of 48 relations across 128 newswire documents from the ACE 2004 corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Doddington et al., 2004</ref>).</p><p>• We demonstrate that NEL argument identifi- cation boosts both precision and recall, and using type constraints with linked arguments further boosts precision, yielding a 43% in- crease in precision and 27% boost to re- call. Using coreference during training ar- gument identification gives an additional 7% improvement to precision and further boosts recall by 9%. Partitioning the model by rela- tion type signature offers further benefits, so our best system yields a total boost of 44% to precision and 70% to recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Distantly Supervised Extraction</head><p>At a sentence-level, the goal for relation extrac- tion is to determine for each sentence, what facts are expressed. We describe these as relation an- notations of the form s→R(m 1 , m 2 ), where s is a sentence, R ∈ R is a relation name, R is our finite set of target relations, and m 1 and m 2 are grounded entity mentions of the form (s, t 1 , t 2 , e), where t 1 and t 2 delimit a text span in the sentence, and e is a grounded entity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Training</head><p>During training, the contents of the KB are heuris- tically matched to the training corpus according to the distant supervision hypothesis: if a relation holds between two entities, any sentence contain- ing those two entities is likely to express that rela- tion. The training KB ∆ contains fact tuples of form R(e 1 , e 2 ), where R ∈ R is a relation name, R is our finite set of target relations, and e 1 and e 2 are ground entities. The training text corpus Σ con- tains documents, which contain sentences. Argu- ment identification is performed over the text cor- pus to get grounded mentions m. Then during sen- tential instance generation, sentential instances of the form (s, m 1 , m 2 ) are generated representing a sentence with two grounded mentions. At this point, these sentential instances can be matched to the seed KB, yielding candidate relation anno- tations of the form s→R(m 1 , m 2 ) by finding all relations that hold over the entities in a sentential instance. These candidate relation annotations are all positive instances to use for training. Negative instance generation is also performed, generating negative examples of the form s→NA(m 1 , m 2 ) in- dicating that no relation holds between m 1 and m 2 . There are several heuristics for generating negative instances, and the number of negative ex- amples and how they are treated can greatly affect performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Min et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>Because the distant supervision hypothesis of- ten does not hold, this training data is noisy. That a fact is in the KB does not imply that the sen- tence in question is expressing the relation. There has been much work in combating noise in dis- tant supervision training data, but one of the most successful ideas is to train a multi-instance classi- fier which assumes at-least-one relation holds for positive bags. We use Hoffmann et al. (2011)'s MULTIR system, which uses a probabilistic graph- ical model to jointly reason at the corpus-level and sentence-level, handles overlapping relations in the KB so that multiple relations can hold over an entity pair, and scales to large datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Extraction</head><p>The trained relation extractor can assign a most likely relation and a confidence score to a senten- tial instance (s, m 1 , m 2 ). To get these sentential instances, argument identification and sentential instance generation are applied to new documents. Then the relation extractor potentially yields a re- lation annotation of the form s→R(m 1 , m 2 ), or potentially no relation. At extraction time a men- tion m might have a NIL link if a correspond- ing ground entity was not found during argument identification (meaning the entity is not in the KB). The relation annotations have associated confi- dence scores, so a threshold can be chosen to only use high-confidence relation annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Argument Identification</head><p>An important piece of relation extraction is deter- mining what can be an argument, and how to form a semantic representation of it. We define an argu- ment identification function ArgIdent ∆ (D), which takes a document D, finds potential arguments, and links them to entities in ∆ if possible, yield- ing m, a set of grounded mentions in D. Pre- vious relation extraction systems have based this on NER. We evaluate NER-based argument iden- tification against argument identification based on NEL, as well as NEL with coreference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Named Entity Recognition</head><p>Named entity recognition (NER) tags spans of to- kens with basic types such as PERSON, ORGANI- ZATION, LOCATION, and MISC. This is a high accuracy tagging task often performed using a sequence classifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>). Rela- tion extraction systems can base their argument identification on NER, by using NER to identify text spans indicating entities and then find corre- sponding entities in the KB through exact string match ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Riedel et al., 2010)</ref>. Some downsides of using NER with exact string match for relation ex- traction is that it does not allow for overlapping mentions, it can only capture arguments with full names, and it can only capture arguments with types of the NER system, e.g., "politician" might not be captured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Named Entity Linking</head><p>Named entity linking (NEL) is the task of ground- ing textual mentions to entities in a KB, such as Wikipedia. Thus "named entity" here, has a some- what broader definition than in NER -these are any entities in the KB, not just those expressed with proper names. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hachey et al. (2013)</ref> define three stages that NEL systems take to perform this task: extraction (mention detection), search (generating candidate KB entities for a mention), and disambiguation (selecting the best entity for a mention). There has been much work on the task of NEL in recent years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Milne and Witten, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kulkarni et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ratinov et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cheng and Roth, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Our definition of a function ArgIdent(D) is completely served by an NEL system. It can find any entity in the KB, and those entities are grounded. Additionally, NEL can have overlap- ping mentions as well as support for abbreviated mentions like "Obama", or acronyms like "US". NEL does not seek to capture anaphoric mentions, however.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Coreference Resolution</head><p>Coreference resolution is the task of clustering mentions of entities together, typically within a single document. Using coreference, we can find even more mentions than NEL, since it can find pronouns and anaphoric mentions. We seek to use coreference to add additional arguments to those found by NEL, and we refer to this combined ar- gument identification method as NEL+Coref. Tak-ing in arguments from NEL argument identifica- tion and coreference clusters, we ground the clus- ters by picking the most common grounded entity from NEL mentions that occur in a coreference cluster. A difficulty is that mentions from NEL and coreference can have small differences in text spans, such as whether determiners are included. We try to assign each NEL argument to a corefer- ence cluster, first looking for an exact span match, then by looking for the shortest coreference men- tion that contains it. If the coreference cluster al- ready has matched an NEL argument through ex- act span match that is different from the one found by looking for the shortest containing coreference mention, the new NEL argument is not added. This gives for each coreference cluster a possible grounding to an entity in the KB. What is provided as final arguments for NEL+Coref argument iden- tification are, in order, grounded NEL arguments, grounded coreference arguments that do not over- lap with previous arguments, NIL arguments from NEL that do not overlap with previous arguments, and NIL arguments from coreference that do not overlap with previous arguments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Type-Awareness</head><p>Relations have expected types for each argument. Entity types, whether coarse-grained, such as from NER, or fine-grained, such as from Freebase enti- ties, are an important source of information that can be useful for making decisions in relation ex- traction. We bring type-awareness into the system through partitioning the model, as well as by en- forcing type constraints on output relation annota- tions.</p><p>Model Partitioning Instead of building a single relation extractor that can generate sentential in- stances and then relation annotations with argu- ments of any type, we can instead build separate relation extractors for each possible coarse type signature, e.g., (PERSON, PERSON), (PERSON, LO- CATION), etc., and combine the extractions from the extractor for each type signature. This modi- fication allows each trained model to only handle instances of specific types, and thus relations of that type signature, allowing each to do a better job of choosing relations within the type signature.</p><p>Type Constraints We can additionally reject re- lation annotations where the types of the argu- ments do not agree with the expected types of the relation. That is, we only accept a relation annota- tion s→R(m 1 , m 2 ) when EntityTypes(e 1 ) ∩ τ 1 = ∅ and EntityTypes(e 2 )∩τ 2 = ∅, where m 1 is linked to e 1 , m 2 is linked to e 2 , EntityTypes provides the set of valid types for an entity, τ 1 is the set of al- lowed types for the first argument of target relation r, and τ 2 for the second argument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation Setups</head><p>Relation extraction is often evaluated from a macro-reading perspective ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mitchell et al., 2009)</ref>, in which the extracted facts, R(e 1 , e 2 ), are judged true or false independent of any supporting sen- tence. For these experiments, however, we take a micro-reading approach in order to strictly eval- uate whether a relation extractor is able to extract every fact expressed by a sentence s→R(m 1 , m 2 ). Micro-reading is more difficult, but it provides fully semantic information at the sentence and document level allowing detailed justifications, and, for our purposes, allows us to better under- stand the effects of our modifications. In order to fairly evaluate different systems, even those us- ing different methods of argument identification, we want to use gold evaluation data allowing for varying mention types. We additionally use Hoff- mann et al. (2011)'s sentential evaluation as-is in order to better compare with prior work. For our training corpus, we use the TAC-KBP 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McNamee and Dang, 2009</ref>) English newswire corpus containing one million documents with 27 million sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Hoffmann et al. Sentential Evaluation</head><p>Hoffmann et al. (2011) generated their gold data by taking the union of sentential instances where some system being evaluated extracted a relation as well as the sentential instances matching ar- guments in the KB. They took a random sample of these sentential instances and manually labeled them with either a single relation or NA. Although this process provides good coverage, since is is sampled from extractions over a large corpus, it does not allow one to measure true recall. Indeed, Hoffmann's method significantly overestimates re- call, since the random sample is only over senten- tial instances where a program detected an extrac- tion or a KB match was found. Furthermore, this test set only contains sentential instances in which arguments are marked using NER, which makes it impossible to determine if the use of NEL or coreference confers any benefit.</p><p>Finally, it does not allow for the possibility that there may be multiple relations that should be ex- tracted for a pair of arguments. For example, a CeoOf relation, and an EmployedBy relation might both be present for <ref type="bibr">(Larry Page, Google)</ref></p><note type="other">. To ad- dress these issues, we manually annotate a full set of documents with relation annotations. Because we are evaluating changing various aspects of the distant supervision process, we cannot use Riedel et al. (2010)'s distant supervision data as-is as oth- ers did on the Hoffmann et al. (2011) sentential evaluation. Instead, we use the TAC-KBP data de- scribed above.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">GoReCo Evaluation</head><p>In order to allow for variations on mentions (NER, NEL, and coreference each has its own definition of what a mention boundary should be), we want gold relation annotations over coreference clus- ters broadly defined to allow mentions obtained from NER and NEL, as well as gold coreference mentions. So as long as a relation extraction sys- tem extracts a relation annotation s→R(m 1 , m 2 ) where m 1 and m 2 are allowed options (based on text spans), it will get credit for extracting the relation annotation. We introduce the GORECO (gold relations and coreference) evaluation to sat- isfy these constraints.</p><p>We start with an existing gold coreference dataset, ACE 2004 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Doddington et al., 2004</ref>) newswire, consisting of 128 documents. To get relation annotations over coreference clusters, we define two human annotation tasks and use the BRAT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Stenetorp et al., 2012</ref>) tool for visualization and relation and coreference annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation Annotation</head><p>The annotator is pre- sented with a document with gold mentions indi- cated and asked to determine for each sentence, what facts involving target relations are expressed by the sentence. They draw an arrow for each fact and label it with the relation. They also have the ability to add mentions not present (ReAnn men- tions).</p><p>Supplemental Coreference Mentions from NER and NEL are displayed along with ACE and ReAnn mentions from the previous task. The annotator draws coreference links from NER or NEL mentions to an ACE or ReAnn mention if they are coreferent.</p><p>We randomly shuffle the 128 ACE 2004 newswire documents and use 64 as a development set and 64 as a test set. To complete annotations of these documents, we only used one original hu- man annotator (hired using the oDesk crowdsourc- ing platform) and found mistakes by having others check the work, as well as checking false positives of relation extractors on the development set to find patterns of annotation mistakes. On average, there are 7 relation annotations per document.</p><p>For the GORECO evaluation, we define our train/test split (with the separate TAC-KBP corpus used for training) such that each has a different set of documents and entities, in order to evaluate how well the system performs on unseen entities. To do this, we remove entities found in the gold evalua- tion set from the training KB. (We do not remove entities for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al. (2011)</ref> evaluation, since they do not.) We choose the threshold con- fidence score for each system using the develop- ment set to optimize for F1 and report results on the test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Target Relations</head><p>Since we use a different evaluation, we also seek to choose a more comprehensive and interesting set of relations than prior work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Riedel et al. (2010)</ref>, whose train and test data is also used by Hoff- mann et al. (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Surdeanu et al. (2012)</ref>, use Freebase properties under domains /people, /busi- ness, and /location. Since /location relations such as /location/location/contains dominate the results (and are relatively uninteresting in that they rarely change), we do not use any /location relations, and instead use the domains /people, /business, and /organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Google, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Since many Freebase properties are between an entity and a table instead of another entity, we also use joined relations, such as /people/person/employment_history /busi- ness/employment_tenure/company , in this case representing employment. We bring in an addi- tional 20 relations of this form, also under /person, /business, and /organization. Additionally we use NELL ( <ref type="bibr">Carlson et al., 2010a</ref>) relations mapped to Freebase by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhang et al. (2012)</ref>.</p><p>We only include a relation in our set of target relations if both of its entity arguments are con- tained in the set of entities found via NER with exact string match or NEL over the training cor- pus. We also remove inverse relations, since they represent needless duplication. This gives us a set R of 105 target relations based on joins and unions of Freebase properties. Of the 105 target relations, 48 were used at least once in the GORECO data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments and Results</head><p>We conduct experiments to determine how chang- ing distantly supervised relation extraction along various dimensions affects performance. We ex- amine the choice of argument identification dur- ing training and extraction, as well as the effects of model type partitioning, and type constraints. We consider the space of all combinations of these dimensions, but focus on specific combinations where we find improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Relation Extraction Setup</head><p>We use and modify <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al. (2011)</ref>'s sys- tem MULTIR to control our experiments and as a baseline. For NER argument identification as well as for the use of NER in the features, we use use Stanford NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>). For NEL argument identification we use Wikipedia Miner with the default threshold 0.5, and allowing re- peated mentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Milne and Witten, 2008)</ref>. Since Wikipedia Miner does not support NIL links, we use non-overlapping NER mentions as NIL links. For coreference, we use Stanford's sieve-based de- terministic coreference system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al., 2013</ref>). For sentential instance generation, we take all pairs of non-overlapping arguments in a sentence (in either order). If the arguments have KB links, we do not allow sentential instances where both arguments represent the same entity. We use the same lexical and syntactic features as MULTIR, based on the features of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mintz et al. (2009)</ref>. As required for features, we use Stanford CoreNLP's tokenizer, part of speech tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Toutanova et al., 2003)</ref>, and dependency parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">de Marneffe and Manning, 2008)</ref>, and use the Charniak Johnson constiuent parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Charniak and Johnson, 2005</ref>). For negative training generation, we take a simi- lar approach to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Riedel et al. (2010)</ref> and define a percentage parameter n of the number of nega- tive instances divided by the number of total in- stances. Experimenting with n ∈ {0, 20%, 80%}, we find that n = 20% works best for our evalua- tions, optimizing for F1, although using 80% neg- ative training gives high precision at lower recall. We use frequency-based feature selection to elimi- nate features that appear less than 10 times, which is helpful both for reducing overfitting as well as constraining memory usage. Since the perceptron learning of MULTIR is sensitive to instance order- ing, we perform 10 random shuffles and average the models. For model type partitioning, when training with NER, we ensure that the NER types match the coarse relation type signatures. For NEL, we at- tempt to use NER for coarse types of arguments, but if an NER type is not present, we map the Free- base type to its FIGER type ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ling and Weld, 2012)</ref> to its coarse type. For type constraints, we use Freebase's expected input and output types for re- lations. For NIL links, we use the NER type of PERSON, ORGANIZATION, or LOCATION, if avail- able, mapping it to appropriate Freebase types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">NER Baseline</head><p>As a result of a larger training set, as well as model averaging, our baseline, which is otherwise equiv- alent to the methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al. (2011)</ref> and uses their MULTIR system, has slightly higher precision as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, curve NER. It is also higher than that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xu et al. (2013)</ref>, who achieved higher performance than <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al. (2011)</ref>; our baseline gets 89.9% precision and 59.6% relative recall, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xu et al. (2013)</ref>'s sys- tem gets 84.6% precision and 56.1% relative re- call. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for results on GORECO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">NEL and Type Constraints</head><p>On GORECO, using NEL argument identification increases recall and gives higher precision over the entire curve. We further find that filtering results using type constraints gives a large boost in pre-cision at a small cost to recall. Note the increase in performance from NER to NEL to NEL+TC in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>, as well as in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Using NEL gives more recall, since it is able to capture arguments that NER cannot, such as professions like "pa- leontologist". The decrease in recall from type constraints comes from false positives in the type constraints process including from non-ideal links, e.g., "paleontologist" might get linked to the entity Paleontology, so will not have the type required for the Profession relation.</p><p>On the Hoffmann et al. (2011) sentential evalu- ation, we were not able to use NEL argument iden- tification at extraction time, because the instances in the test set are from NER argument identifica- tion. We tried using NEL only at training time and found that it got similar performance to using NER <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>, curve NER+LT). Doing the same on GORECO yielded slightly lower recall, because of the mismatch of features learned from NEL ar- guments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3b</ref>, curve NER+LT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">NEL+Coref Argument Identification</head><p>Using NEL+Coref for both training and extrac- tion (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) introduces noise from arguments not encountered during training time, but using NEL+Coref just for training results in a decrease in recall but similar precision <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 2 and 3b)</ref>.</p><p>We found using NEL+Coref at test time unhelp- ful for this dataset, because there were no exam- ples we could find where coreference could re- cover arguments that NEL could not. There were three true positives from NEL+Coref involving pronouns in the GORECO development set, but there were also proper name versions of the ar- guments nearby in the same sentences, making coreference unnecessary. Additionally, corefer- ence brings in many mentions such as times like "Friday" or "1954" that do not have corresponding KB matches during training time. These sentential instances have similar features to others involv- ing coreference mentions, and there are not neg- ative instances to weigh against these, since these types do not appear in the training data. Better fea- tures more suited to coreference mentions could be helpful here.</p><p>At both training and extraction time, corefer- ence can cluster together mentions that can be con- sidered to be separate, such as in "Brian Kain, a 33-year-old accountant", "Brian Kain" and "ac- countant" are coreferent in the gold ACE 2004 dataset. This means that type constraints will disregard a Profession annotation between these when it should not, because "Brian Kain" (which would have been a NIL link) gets the link of "ac- countant". This effect contributes to the decrease in recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Model Type Partitioning</head><p>Using type partitioning helps both NER and NEL based models as shown with the +TP curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Partitioning by type signature results in each model being able to better choose relations for sentential instances of that type signature. In the Partitioned columns of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, removing type partitioning from the best system (NEL <ref type="table">training Single   Partitioned   R  P  F1  R  P  F1</ref> NER training NER extraction 7.9 21.8 11.6 11.3 21.0 14.7 NEL extraction 8.5 21.4 12.2 9.8 19.7 13.1 NEL training NER extraction 9.6 21.1 13.2 8.9 25.1 13.2 NEL extraction 10.0 30.5 15.1 15.3 16.7 16.0 NEL w/TC extraction 11.7 31.1 17.0 13.4 31.3 18.8 NEL+Coref training NER extraction 9.4 19.2 12.6 6.8 28.3 11.0 NEL extraction 12.1 27.5 16.8 11.1 21.6 14.6 NEL w/TC extraction 12.8 33.3 18.5 12.1 34.1 17.9 NEL+Coref extraction 10.6 20.4 14.0 10.0 12.9 11.3 NEL+Coref w/TC extraction 9.4 22.7 13.3 7.9 19.1 11.1 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Evaluation of different versions of the relation extraction system on the GORECO test set. For nearly all systems, partitioning the model by argument types boosts F1, as does using NEL at either training or extraction time, and using coreference at training time with type constraints (w/TC) raises F1 except with coreference at extraction time and when combined with type partitioning. and extraction, with type constraints, Partitioned) results in a decrease in F1 from 18.8% to 17.0%. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> shows by-relation performance results for the best system (curve NEL+TC+TP in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Other Dimensions Explored</head><p>We also experimented with adding generalized features that replaced lexemes with WordNet classes <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>, which had uneven re- sults. We observed a small but consistent improve- ment on the NER baseline (11.6% F1 to 12.7% F1 on GORECO), but after introducing NEL argu- ment identification and partitioning, we no longer observed the improvement. For some relations, there was a small gain in recall that was offset by a loss in precision, but for others, the gain in recall outweighed the loss of precision.</p><p>We experimented with a negative instance feed- back loop that ran a trained extractor over the training corpus and tested whether each extrac- tion made was in fact a negative example. Even though the training corpus contains one million documents, this method only yielded a few thou- sand new negative instances due to the difficulty of being certain an extraction should be negative. A naïve approach would simply ensure that both entities participate in a relation in the KB; this is troublesome, because of KB incompleteness and because of type errors. For example Freebase con- tains BornIn(Barack Obama, Honolulu), but our ex- tractor extracted BornIn(Barack Obama, Hawaii). To avoid labeling this true extraction as a nega- tive instance we have to be robust about location semantics. We selected new negative instances NA(e 1 , e 2 ) from our initial extractor that had e 1 in the knowledge base, with e 1 participating as the first argument in the extracted relation but with- out e 2 as the second argument. The results were promising for some relations but overall inconclu- sive as identifying true negatives is quite difficult.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>There has been much recent work on distantly su- pervised relation extraction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mintz et al.

(2012)</ref> take a similar approach and use soft constraints and lo- gistic regression.  integrate open information extraction with schema-based, proposing a universal schema approach, including using features based on latent types. There has also been recent work on reducing noise in dis- tantly supervised relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Takamatsu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ritter et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xu et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Min et al. (2013)</ref> improve the quality of distant su- pervision training data by reducing false negative examples. Distant supervision is related to semi- supervised bootstrap learning work such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carlson et al. (2010b)</ref> and many others. Note that distant supervision can be viewed as a subroutine of bootstrap learning; bootstrap learning can continue the process of distant supervision by taking the new tuples found and then training on those again, and repeating the process.</p><p>There has also been work on performing NEL and coreference jointly <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cucerzan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hajishirzi et al., 2013)</ref>, however these systems do not perform relation extraction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Singh et al. (2013)</ref> performs joint relation extraction, NER, and coref- erence in a fully-supervised manner. They get slight improvement by adding coreference, but do not use NEL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ling and Weld (2013)</ref> extend MUL- TIR to find meronym relations in a biology text- book. They get slight improvement over NER by using coreference to pick the best mention of an entity in the sentence for the meronym relation at training and extraction time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Given the growing importance of distant supervi- sion, a comprehensive understanding of its vari- ants is crucial. While some of the optimizations we propose may seem intuitive, they have not pre- viously been systematically explored. Our experi- ments show that NEL, type constraints, and type partitioning are extremely important in order to best take advantage of the seed KB during training as well as known information at extraction time. Our best system results in a 44% increase in pre- cision, and a 70% increase in recall over our NER baseline using GORECO. While we were not able to evaluate all our methods on <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al. (2011)</ref>'s sentential evaluation, our baseline per- forms significantly better than previous methods, especially in precision, and training-only modifi- cations perform similarly in both evaluations.</p><p>Future work will explore the use of NEL in dis- tantly supervised relation extraction further, tun- ing a confidence parameter for the NEL system, and determining whether different confidence pa- rameters should be used for training and extrac- tion. Another possible direction is interleaving NEL with relation extraction by using newly ex- tracted facts to try to improve NEL performance.</p><p>We freely distribute GORECO a new gold stan- dard evaluation for relation extraction consisting of exhaustive annotations of the 128 documents from ACE 2004 newswire for 48 relations. The source code of our system, its output, as well as our gold data are available at http://cs.uw.edu/homes/mkoch/re.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Distantly supervised extraction pipeline.</figDesc></figure>
