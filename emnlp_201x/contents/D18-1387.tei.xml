				<p>Website privacy policies represent the single most important source of information for users to gauge how their personal data are collected, used and shared by companies. However, privacy policies are often vague and people struggle to understand the content. Their opaque-ness poses a significant challenge to both users and policy regulators. In this paper, we seek to identify vague content in privacy policies. We construct the first corpus of human-annotated vague words and sentences and present empirical studies on automatic vagueness detection. In particular, we investigate context-aware and context-agnostic models for predicting vague words, and explore auxiliary-classifier gener-ative adversarial networks for characterizing sentence vagueness. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches. Finally, we provide suggestions for resolving vagueness and improving the usabil-ity of privacy policies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Website privacy policies are difficult to read and people struggle to understand the content. Recent studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sadeh et al., 2013</ref>) have raised concerns over their opaqueness, which poses a considerable challenge to both Internet users and policy reg- ulators. Nowadays, consumers supply their per- sonal information to online websites in exchange for personalized services; they are surrounded by smart gadgets such as voice assistants and surveil- lance cameras, which constantly monitor their ac- tivities in the home and work environments. With- out clearly specifying how users' information will be collected, used and shared, there is a substantial risk of information misuse, including undesired advertisements and privacy breaches. Especially with recent high-profile cases involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the public is becoming  more aware and concerned with how their infor- mation is handled. Privacy policies are binding agreements be- tween companies and users that stipulate how companies collect, use, and share users' personal information. They are lengthy and difficult to read. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bhatia et al. (2016)</ref> suggested two possible causes for this. First, privacy policies must be compre- hensive in order to cover a variety of uses (e.g., in- store and online purchases). Second, the policies have to be accurate to all data practices and sys- tems. Clearly, it would be difficult for a company's legal counsel to anticipate all future needs. They need to resort to vague language to describe the content, causing it to be difficult to read and com- promising the effectiveness of privacy policies.</p><p>In this paper, we present the first study on au- tomatic detection of vague content in website pri- vacy policies. We construct a sizable corpus con- taining word-and sentence-level human annota- tions of vagueness for privacy policy documents. The corpus contains a total of 133K words and 4.5K sentences. Our methods for automatically detecting vague words and sentences are based on deep neural networks, which have demonstrated impressive recent success. Specifically, we inves- tigate context-aware and context-agnostic models for predicting word vagueness, where feature rep- resentations of words are built with and without considering their surrounding words. By this, we seek to verify the hypothesis that vagueness is an intrinsic property of words and has little to do with context. To understand sentence vagueness, we explore auxiliary-classifier generative adver- sarial networks (AC-GAN, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Odena et al., 2018)</ref>. The model has performed strongly on vision tasks (e.g., image synthesis), however, whether it can be adapted to handle text data has not been thor- oughly investigated. We train the AC-GAN model to discriminate between real/fake privacy policy sentences while simultaneously classifying sen- tences exhibiting different levels of vagueness, in- cluding "clear," "somewhat clear," "vague," and "extremely vague," thus improving the model's generalization capabilities. The detected vague words and sentences can assist users in browsing privacy policy documents, and privacy regulators in assessing the clarity of privacy policy practices. Our research contributions include the following:</p><p>• we present the first study on automatic detection of vague content in privacy policies. Vague con- tent compromises the usability of privacy poli- cies and there is an urgent need to identify and resolve vagueness; • we construct a sizable text corpus including hu- man annotations for 133K words and 4.5K sen- tences of privacy policy texts. The data 1 is avail- able publicly to advance research on language vagueness; and • we investigate both context-aware and context- agnostic methods for predicting vague words. We also explore the auxiliary-classifier genera- tive adversarial networks for characterizing sen- tence vagueness. This is the first study lever- aging deep neural networks for detecting vague content in privacy policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Privacy policies are often verbose, difficult to read, and perceived as ineffective <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(McDonald and Cranor, 2008</ref>). In particular, vague language in these documents hurts understanding. "A term is re- garded as vague if it admits borderline cases, where speakers are reluctant to say either the term definitely applies or definitely does not ap- ply," a definition of vagueness quoted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(van Deemter, 2010)</ref>. Legal scholars and language philosophers strive to understand vagueness from a theoretical perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Keefe, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shapiro, 2006</ref>). The "sorites paradox" describes the phe- nomenon of vagueness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Keefe, 2000)</ref>. It states that small changes in the object do not affect the appli- cability of a vague term. For example, a room can remain "bright" even if the light is dimmed little by little until it is entirely extinguished, thus cre- ating a paradox. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyde (2014)</ref> further suggests that vagueness is a feature pertaining to multiple syn- tactic categories. Nouns, adjectives and adverbs (e.g., "child", "tall", "many") are all susceptible to reasoning. These studies often focus on linguis- tic case studies but not on developing resources for automatic detection of vagueness.</p><p>Recent years have seen a growing interest in using natural language processing techniques to improve the effectiveness of website privacy poli- cies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sadeh et al. (2013)</ref> describe a Usable Pri- vacy Policy Project that seeks to semi-automate the extraction of salient details from privacy poli- cies. Other studies include crowdsourcing privacy policy annotations and categorizing data prac- tices ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Massey et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2016b,a)</ref>, grouping text segments re- lated to certain policy issues ( , summarizing terms of ser- vices ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Braun et al., 2017)</ref>, identifying user opt- out choices ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sathyendra et al., 2017)</ref>, and many others. These studies emphasize the "too long to read" issue of privacy policies but leave behind the "difficult to understand" aspect, such as identify- ing and eliminating vague content.</p><p>The work of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu et al., 2016</ref>) is close to ours. The authors attempt to learn vector representations of words in privacy policies using deep neural net- works, where the vectors encode not only seman- tic/syntactic aspects but also vagueness of words. The model is later fed to an interactive visualiza- tion tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Strobelt et al., 2016</ref>) to test its ability to discover related vague terms. While promising, their approach is not fully automatic, and the fea- sibility of detecting vague words and sentences in an automatic manner is still left untested.</p><p>In this work we conduct the first study to auto-matically detect vague content from privacy poli- cies. We ask human annotators to label vague words and sentences and train supervised classi- fiers to do the same. Classifying vague words is a challenging task, because vagueness is an understudied property and it spans multiple syn- tactic categories (e.g., "usually," "personal data," "necessary"). Neural network classifiers such as CNN and LSTM have demonstrated prior success on text classification tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Wallace, 2015)</ref>, but whether they can be utilized to identify vague terms is not well understood.</p><p>For sentence classification, we investigate aux- iliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GAN, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Odena et al., 2018)</ref>. GANs have seen growing popularity in recent years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mirza and Osindero, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cai and Wang, 2018)</ref>. AC-GAN is a variant of GAN that generates word sequences using class-conditional probabilities. E.g., it gen- erates "fake" privacy policy sentences exhibit- ing different degrees of vagueness (e.g., "clear," "vague," "extremely vague"). AC-GAN nicely combines real (human-annotated) and fake (syn- thetic) privacy policy sentences in a discrimina- tive framework to improve the model's generaliza- tion capabilities. This can be equated to a semi- supervised learning paradigm through augmenta- tion of the dataset with generated sentences. Data augmentation is particularly valuable for vague- ness detection, which generally has small expen- sive datasets. We perform a full analysis on AC- GAN and compare it to state-of-the-art systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Corpus</head><p>Annotating vague words and sentences is a non- trivial task. We describe our effort to select pri- vacy policy sentences for annotation, recruit qual- ified workers, and design annotation guidelines.</p><p>We select 100 website privacy policies from the collection gathered by . The doc- uments are quite lengthy, containing on average 2.3K words. More importantly, most content is not vague. To obtain a more balanced corpus, a filter- ing step is used to select only sentences that have a moderate-to-high chance of containing vague con- tent. Fortunately, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bhatia et al. (2016)</ref> provide a list of 40 cue words for vagueness, manually compiled by policy experts. We therefore retain only sen- tences containing one of the cue words for further annotation. A brief examination shows that most  man annotators and their frequencies in our corpus. "pers.," "iden." and "info." are shorthand for "personally," "identifi- able" and "information."</p><p>of the sentences removed from the corpus are in- deed clear. Even with this bias, the resulting cor- pus still contains a small portion of clear sentences (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). The reason is that a cue word can be used in a way that is not vague. For example, in the sentence "Users may post to our website," the word may indicates permission but not possibility, and therefore the sentence is not vague. <ref type="bibr">Reidenberg et al. (2015)</ref> discuss attempts to use crowdsourced workers as a cost-effective alterna- tive to policy experts for annotating privacy poli- cies. In this study, we hire crowd workers from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. To recruit quality workers, we require them to reside in the U.S. and be proficient in English; they are skilled workers maintaining a task success rate of 90% or above. We provide example labelled vague terms obtained from the case studies described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bhatia et al. (2016)</ref> to reduce discrepancies among work- ers. The annotators are then asked to use their best judgment to perform the task.</p><p>Given a privacy policy sentence, the annotators are instructed to identify all vague terms 2 and as- sign a score of vagueness to the sentence. A vague term is limited to be 5 words or less (e.g., "includ- ing but not limited to"). We use this rule to prevent annotators from tagging an entire sentence/clause as vague. A slider is provided in the interface to al- low annotators to select a vagueness score for the sentence: 1 is extremely clear and 5 is extremely vague. We design a human intelligence task (HIT) to include 5 privacy policy sentences and a worker is rewarded $0.05 for completing the task. Five human workers are recruited to perform each task.</p><p>We obtain annotations for 133K words and 4.5K sentences. The average sentence vagueness score is 2.4±0.9. As of inter-annotator agreement <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , we find that 47.2% of the sentences have their vague- ness scores agreed by 3 or more annotators; 12.5% of the sentence vagueness scores are agreed by 4 or more annotators. Furthermore, the annotators are not required to select vague words if they be- lieve the sentences are clear. We remove vague words selected by a single annotator. Among the rest, 46.1% of the words are selected by 3 or more annotators; 18.5% of the words are selected by 4 or more annotators. These results suggest that, al- though annotating vague terms and sentences is considered challenging, our annotators can reach a reasonable degree of agreement. We present ex- ample vague terms in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. Note that we obtain a total of 1,124 unique vague terms, which go well beyond the 40 cue words used for sentence pres- election. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows more statistics on sen- tence vagueness, including (i) the percentages of sentences containing different numbers of vague words, and (ii) the percentages of sentences whose vagueness scores fall in different ranges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Word Vagueness</head><p>We seek to test an important hypothesis related to word vagueness. We conjecture that vagueness is an intrinsic property of words; whether a word is vague or not has little to do with its context words. To verify this hypothesis, we build context-aware and context-agnostic models to classify each word <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We choose not to calculate a kappa statistic, as labelling vague words/sentences is not a clear-cut classification task. Sent: This includes your credit card number , income level , or any other information that would normally be considered confidential .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Annotator 1: any, other, normally Annotator 2: any other information Annotator 3: normally, confidential, any other</head><p>Ground Truth Labels: <ref type="bibr">[This]</ref> human-annotated vague terms; "any," "other," "normally" are labelled 1 because they are selected by 2 or more annotators.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0 [includes]0 [your]0 [credit]0 [card]0 [number]0 , [income]0 [level]0 , [or]0 [any]1 [other]1 [information]0 [that]0 [would]0 [normally]1 [be]0 [considered]0 [confidential]0 .</formula><p>in a privacy policy sentence as either vague or non- vague. The ground-truth labels are obtained by consolidating human annotations (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> for an example). A word is labelled 1 if it is selected by two or more annotators, otherwise 0. We de- scribe details of the two classifiers below.</p><p>Context-aware classifier. It builds feature rep- resentations of words based on the surrounding context words. Given its strong performance, we construct a bidirectional LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>) for this purpose. A word is replaced by its word2vec embedding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) before it is fed to the model. For each time step, we concatenate the hidden states obtained from the forward and backward passes and use it as input to a feedforward layer with sig- moid activation to predict if a word is vague or non-vague. Because single words consist of the majority of the human-annotated vague terms, we choose to use binary word labels instead of a BIO scheme (Chiu and Nichols, 2016) for sequence tagging. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the architecture.</p><p>Context-agnostic classifier. It uses intrinsic fea- ture representations of words without considering the context. Specifically, we represent a word us- ing its word2vec embedding, then feed it to a feed- forward layer with sigmoid activation to obtain the prediction <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2)</ref>. We train the classifier us- ing a list of unique words obtained from the train- ing data; a word is considered positive if it has a ground truth label of 1 in any sentence, otherwise negative. Note that the ratio of positive/negative unique words in our corpus is 1068/3176=0.34. At test time, we apply the binary classifier to each word of the test set. A word is assigned the same label regardless of which sentence it appears in. We adopt this setting to ensure the context-aware and context-agnostic results are comparable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Sentence Vagueness</head><p>We next investigate how vagueness is manifested in privacy policy sentences. Our goal is to assign a  <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>, respec- tively corresponding to "clear," "somewhat clear," "vague," and "extremely vague" categories. The sentences in the four buckets respectively consist of 26.9%, 50.8%, 20.5%, and 1.8% of the total an- notated sentences. We choose to predict discrete labels instead of continuous scores because labels are more informative to human readers. E.g., a la- bel of "extremely vague" is more likely to trigger user alerts than a score of 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Auxiliary-Classifer GAN</head><p>Predicting vague sentences is a nontrivial task due to the complexity and richness of natural lan- guage. We propose to tackle this problem by ex- ploring the auxiliary classifier generative adversar- ial networks (AC-GAN, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Odena et al., 2018</ref>). We choose GAN because of its ability to combine text generation and classification in a unified frame- work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gu et al., 2018)</ref>. Privacy policy sentences are particularly suited for text generation because the policy lan- guage is restricted and a text generator can effec- tively learn the patterns. AC-GAN has a great po- tential to make use of both human-annotated data and "fake" augmented data for classification. The system architecture is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. The generator learns to generate "fake" privacy pol- icy sentences and sentences exhibiting different levels of vagueness using class conditional proba- bilities (hence the name auxiliary-classifer GAN). The discriminator learns to discriminate among real/fake sentences as well as sentences of differ- ent levels of vagueness. They are jointly trained using a heuristic, non-saturating game loss. In the following we present the model details.  A vocab- ulary distribution is produced for each step. Gumbel-softmax is applied to the distributions to calculate weighted embed- dings to be used by the Discriminator (arrows pointing up). Argmax is applied to the distributions to retrieve embeddings to be passed to the next step (arrows pointing down).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Sentence Generator</head><p>The generator focuses on generating "fake" sam- ples that resemble privacy policy sentences of a given vagueness category. This is denoted by P (X|C), where X = {x t } T t=1 is a sequence of words and C ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} is a vagueness cat- egory. A vagueness category is randomly sam- pled in the generation process, and the generator attempts to generate a sentence of that vagueness level. A typical RNN text generator unrolls the sequence X one word at a time until an end-of- sentence symbol (EOS) is reached. At time step t, it samples a word x t from a vocabulary-sized vector of probability estimates P (x t ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x t ∼ P (x t ) = softmax(a t ),<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">a t = Wh t + b,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">h t = f RN N (h t−1 , x t−1 ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where a t is a vector of activation values and h t is the t-th RNN hidden state. We train a neural text generator, implemented as Long Short-Term Memory networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>), on a large collection of privacy policy sen- tences using cross-entropy loss. While generating natural language sentences is successfully tackled by recurrent neural networks, the generated sen- tences are not necessarily vague. Training the gen- erator only on vague sentences is impractical be- cause there is a limited number of annotated sen- tences. In this paper we introduce a new way of defining class conditional probabilities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x t ∼ P (x t |C) = softmax(a t + λ C v),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where v is a vocabulary-sized, trainable vector in- dicating how likely a vocabulary word is vague. λ C is a coefficient for vagueness category C. The underlying assumption is that a "clear" sentence is less likely to contain vague words (λ C is negative), whereas an "extremely vague" sentence tends to contain many vague words (λ C is positive). Finally, the generated "fake" sentences, to- gether with "real" sentences labelled by human an- notators, are fed to the discriminator for training a classifier discriminating between real/fake sen- tences and sentences of different vagueness lev- els. Nevertheless, there remains a critical issue with the current system: we cannot backpropagate through discrete samples X. As a result, the gen- erator parameters cannot be properly updated us- ing backpropagation. To circumvent this issue, we attempt the reparameterization trick with Gumbel- Softmax relaxation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gu et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax. Two com- peting issues exist in the RNN generator. First, the discriminator requires a continuous form for each generated word to keep the entire model differen- tiable. Second, the generator requires a discrete choice for each word to generate a sentence, rather than propagating "partial words" through the se- quence. To solve this problem, the softmax dis- tribution over vocabulary words is sent to the dis- criminator, while the argmax over the distribution is sent to the next step of the generator. This sys- tem is referred to as Straight-Through Gumbel.</p><p>We explain the process of calculating the soft- max distribution to send to the discriminator. To simulate the random-sampling process, the ap- proach applies reparameterization to shift random- ness from sampling a discrete variable x t (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(4)</ref>) to sampling a continuous noise vector z t follow- ing the Gumbel distribution (Eq. <ref type="formula">(5)</ref>). The noise vector is added to the activation a t + λ C v to com- pute the argmax (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref>). To simulate the argmax operation, a temperature parameter τ is applied to softmax (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>), where small values of τ greatly skew the distribution, causing it to peak at the largest value, while still remaining differentiable. Similar reparameterization is also used for varia- tional auto-encoders ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kingma and Welling, 2014)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">z t ∼ Gumbel(z) (5) x t = argmax(a t + z t + λ C v)<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">P (x t |C) = softmax( a t + z t + λ C v τ )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The generator requires a discrete word to prop- agate to the next time step of the RNN. The word with the maximum activation value is chosen as shown in (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref>). An illustration of ST Gumbel is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Sentence Discriminator</head><p>A sentence discriminator learns to perform two tasks simultaneously. Given a privacy policy sentence X, it predicts a probability distribution over its sources, denoted by P (S|X), where S = {real, fake}; and a probability distribution over its level of vagueness, denoted by P (C|X), C = {clear, somewhat clear, vague, extremely vague}. The learning objective for the discriminator is to maximize the log-likelihood of making correct predictions on both tasks, denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L C + L S ,</formula><p>where L C and L S are defined in Eq. <ref type="formula">(8)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(9)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L C = E [log P (C = c|X real+f ake )] (8) L S = E [log P (S = real|X real )] + E [log P (S = f ake|X f ake )]<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The ground truth vagueness labels C for real sentences are annotated by human annotators. For fake sentences the labels are randomly sampled in the generation process; and conditioned on the sampled vagueness labels, fake sentences are gen- erated using P (x t |C) (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L C = E [log P (C = c|X f ake )] (10) L S = E [log P (S = real|X f ake )]<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The generator is trained to maximize L C + L S as illustrated in Eq. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(10-11)</ref>. Intuitively, the gen- erator is rewarded (or punished) only based on the "fake" samples it produces. It is rewarded by generating sentences correctly exhibiting different levels of vagueness, denoted by (L C ). It is also rewarded by generating sentences that look "real" and cannot be easily distinguished by the discrim- inator (L S ). Eq. (11) corresponds to a heuristic, non-saturating game loss that mitigates gradient saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Goodfellow, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We experiment with two variants of the discrim- inator, implemented respectively using the convo- lutional neural networks (CNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Zhang and Wallace, 2015</ref>) and LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmid-  huber, 1997). In both cases, the discriminator as- signs a source and a vagueness label to each sen- tence. The CNN discriminator scans through each sentence using using a sliding window and apply a number of filters to each window. A max pool- ing over the sequence is performed to create a fea- ture map for the sentence. This feature map is treated as the sentence representation. It is fed to two separate dense layers with softmax activation to predict P (C|X) and P (S|X) respectively. In contrast, the LSTM discriminator runs a forward pass through the sentence and uses the last hidden state as the sentence representation. Similarly, this representation is fed to two dense layers used to predict P (C|X) and P (S|X). Both methods pro- duce probability estimations using a shared sen- tence representation. Given the scarcity of labelled sentences, this multitask setting is expected to im- prove the model's generalization capabilities.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Word-Level System P (%) R (%) F (%) Context-</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>We conduct experiments on the annotated corpus using a 5-fold cross validation; 10% of the train- ing data in each fold are reserved for validation.</p><p>In the following sections we present details of ex- perimental settings and report results on detecting vague words and sentences in privacy policy texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Parameter Settings</head><p>The Xavier scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Glorot and Bengio, 2010</ref>) is used for parameter initialization. For the context- aware word classifier, the bidirectional LSTM has 512 hidden units. For AC-GAN, the CNN discrim- inator uses convolutional filters of size {3, 4, 5} and 128 filters for each size. The LSTM gener- ator and discriminator both have 512 hidden units. The generator is further pretrained on 82K privacy policy sentences using a 10K vocabulary. The co- efficient λ C is set to {−1, 0, 1, 2} respectively for 'clear,' 'somewhat clear,' 'vague,' and 'extremely vague' categories. v is initialized as a binary vec- tor, where an entry is set to 1 if it is one of the 40 cue words for vagueness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bhatia et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Predicting Vague Words</head><p>We compare context-aware with context-agnostic classifiers on detecting vague words in privacy policy text. The goal is to test an important hy- pothesis: that vagueness is an intrinsic property of words, thus a word being vague has little to do with its context. Results are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. Interestingly, context-agnostic classifier yields a high recall score (78.15%) despite it ignoring context. This result indicates word vagueness can be encoded in distributed word embeddings. However, the low precision (11.30%) suggests that context is important for fine-grained analysis. While it is possible for experts to create a com- prehensive list of vague terms for assessing pri- vacy policies, extra effort is required to verify the tagged vague terms. Using a context-aware clas- sifier produces more balanced results, improving the F-score from 19.71% to 60.08%. Our findings suggest that the context information is necessary for detecting vague words.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, we present examples of detected vague words. The nouns have caught our atten- tion. The classifier misses several of these, in- cluding "efforts," "information," "services," per-</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Sentence-Level System P (%) R (%) F (%)</formula><p>Baseline <ref type="formula">(</ref>  haps because there is no clear definition for these terminologies. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>, we found nouns consist of 47.64% of all the miss-detected vague words, while adjectives consist of 37.19% of the false alarms. There is also an interesting phenomenon. In S3, "Information" and "those services" are con- sidered more vague by humans than "often de- pends." However, if those terms are removed from the sentence, yielding "The [..] we obtain from [..] often depends on your settings or their privacy policies." In this case, the vagueness of "often de- pends" become more prominent and is captured by our system. It suggests that the degree of vague- ness may be relative, depending on if other terms in the sentence are more vague.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Predicting Vague Sentences</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 7</ref> we present results on classifying pri- vacy policy sentences into four categories: clear, somewhat clear, vague, and extremely vague. We compare AC-GAN with three baselines: CNN and LSTM trained on human-annotated sentences, and a majority baseline that assigns the most frequent label to all test sentences. We observe that the AC- GAN models (using CNN discriminator) perform strongly, surpassing all baseline approaches. CNN shows strong performance, yielding an F-score of 50.92%. A similar effect has been demonstrated on other sentence classification tasks, where CNN outperforms LSTM and logistic regression classi- fiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Wallace, 2015)</ref>. We report results of AC-GAN using the CNN discrim- inator. Comparing "Full Model" with "Vagueness Only," we found that allowing the AC-GAN to only discriminate sentences of different levels of vagueness, but not real/fake sentences, yields bet- ter results. We conjecture this is because training GAN models, especially with a multitask learn- ing objective, can be unstable and more effort is required to balance the two objectives (L S and L C ). Example sentences generated by AC-GAN are presented in    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> shows the ROC curves of the four vagueness classes. Because the dataset is im- balanced, the ROC curves are more informative than F-scores. The "clear" and "somewhat clear" classes yield promising AUC scores of 0.71 and 0.78 respectively. The "vague" and "extremely vague" classes are more challenging. They are also the minority classes, consisting of 20.5% and 1.8% of the annotated data. Confusion matrix in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref> reveals that the majority of the sen- tences are tagged as "somewhat clear," while 7.0% of the vague sentences are tagged as vague. It suggests more annotated data may be helpful to enable the classifier to distinguish "vague" and "extremely vague" sentences. Interestingly, we found there is little correlation between the sen- tence vagueness score and sentence length (Pear- son correlation r=0.18, p &lt;0.001) while there is a relatively strong correlation (r=0.57, p &lt;0.001) between sentence vagueness and the number of vague words in it. This finding verifies our hy- pothesis that vague words seem to increase the perceived sentence vagueness.</p><p>Lessons learned.

Example con- cepts include personally identifiable informa- tion, personal (non-personal) information, third parties, service providers, subsidiaries, etc.</p><p>• suppress the use of vague words. There are on average 2.5 vague words per sentence in our corpus. The more vague words, the more likely the sentence is perceived as vague (r = 0.57); • use sentences with simple syntactic structure to ease understanding. A sophisticated sentence with vague terms in it, e.g., "You may request deletion of your personal data by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or oth- erwise) to keep this information and not delete it..." appears especially confusing to readers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we present the first empirical study on automatic detection of vague content in pri- vacy policies. We create a sizable text corpus in- cluding human annotations of vague words and sentences. We further investigate the feasibility of predicting vague words and sentences using deep neural networks. Specifically we investigate context-agnostic and context-aware models for de- tecting vague words, and AC-GAN for detecting vague sentences. Our results suggest that a super- vised paradigm for vagueness detection provides a promising avenue for identifying vague content and improving the usability of privacy policies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>S1 We may use the information automatically collected from your computer or other devices for the following uses...
