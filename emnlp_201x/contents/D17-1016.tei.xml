			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a method for embedding two-dimensional locations in a continuous vector space using a neural network-based model incorporating mixtures of Gaussian distributions, presenting two model variants for text-based geolocation and lexical dialectology. Evaluated over Twitter data, the proposed model outperforms conventional regression-based geolocation and provides a better estimate of uncertainty. We also show the effectiveness of the representation for predicting words from location in lexical dialectology, and evaluate it using the DARE dataset.</p>

Although Twitter provides users with the means to geotag their messages, less than 1% of users opt to turn on geotagging, so third- party service providers tend to use profile data, text content and network information to infer the lo- cation of users. Text content is the most widely used source of geolocation information, due to its prevalence across social media services.</p><p>Text-based geolocation systems use the geo- graphical bias of language to infer the location of a user or message using models trained on geotagged posts. The models often use a representation of text (e.g. based on a bag-of-words, convolutional or recurrent model) to predict the location either in real-valued latitude/longitude coordinate space or in discretised region-based space, using regression or classification, respectively. Regression models, as a consequence of minimising squared loss for a unimodal distribution, predict inputs with multiple targets to lie between the targets (e.g. a user who mentions content in both NYC and LA is predicted to be in the centre of the U.S.). Classification mod- els, while eliminating this problem by predicting a more granular target, don't provide fine-grained predictions (e.g. specific locations in NYC), and also require heuristic discretisation of locations into regions (e.g. using clustering).</p><p>Mixture Density Networks ("MDNs": <ref type="bibr">Bishop (1994)</ref>) alleviate these problems by representing location as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Given a text input, an MDN can generate a mixture model in the form of a probability distribution over all location points. In the example of a user who talks about both NYC and LA, e.g., the model will predict a strong Gaussian component in NYC and another one in LA, and also provide an estimate of uncertainty over all the coordinate space.</p><p>Although MDNs are not new, they have not found widespread use in inverse regression prob- lems where for a single input, multiple correct outputs are possible. Given the integration of NLP technologies into devices (e.g. phones or robots with natural language interfaces) is growing quickly, there is a potential need for interfacing lan- guage with continuous variables as input or target. MDNs can also be used in general text regression problems such as risk assessment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang and Hua, 2014</ref>), sentiment analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Joshi et al., 2010)</ref> and loan rate prediction <ref type="bibr">(Bitvai and Cohn, 2015)</ref>, not only to improve prediction but also to use the mix- ture model as a representation for the continuous variables. We apply MDNs to geotagged Twit- ter data in two different settings: (a) predicting location given text; and (b) predicting text given location.</p><p>Geotagged text content is not only useful in ge- olocation, but can also be used in lexical dialectol- ogy. Lexical dialectology is (in part) the converse of text-based geolocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Eisenstein, 2015)</ref>: in- stead of predicting location from language, lan- guage (e.g. dialect terms) are predicted from a given location. This is a much more challenging task as the lexical items are not known beforehand, and there is no notion of dialect regions in the con- tinuous space of latitude/longitude coordinates. A lexical dialectology model should not only be able to predict dialect terms but also be able to automat- ically learn dialect regions.</p><p>In this work, we use bivariate Gaussian mix- tures over geotagged Twitter data in two different settings, and demonstrate their use for geoloca- tion and lexical dialectology. Our contributions are as follows: <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> we propose a continuous rep- resentation of location using bivariate Gaussian mixtures; (2) we show that our geolocation model outperforms regression-based models and achieves comparable results with classification models, but with added uncertainty over the continuous output space; (3) we show that our lexical dialectology model is able to predict geographical dialect terms from latitude/longitude input with state-of-the-art accuracy; and (4) we show that the automatically learned Gaussian regions match expert-generated dialect regions of the U.S. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Text-based Geolocation</head><p>Text-based geolocation models are defined as ei- ther a regression or a classification problem. In regression geolocation, the model learns to predict a real-valued latitude/longitude from a text input. This is a very challenging task for data types such as Twitter, as they are often heavily biased toward population centres and urban areas, and far from uniform. As an example, Norwalk is the name of a few cities in the U.S among which Norwalk, California (West Coast) and Norwalk, Connecti- cut (East Coast) are the two most populous cities. Assuming that occurrences of the city's name are almost equal in both city regions within the training set, a trained regression-based geolocation model given Norwalk as input, would geolocate it to a point in the middle of the U.S. instead of choosing one of the cities. In the machine learning literature, regression problems where there are multiple real- valued outputs for a given input are called inverse problems <ref type="bibr">(Bishop, 1994)</ref>. Here, standard regres- sion models predict an average point in the middle of all training target points to minimise squared error loss. <ref type="bibr">Bishop (1994)</ref> proposes density mixture networks to model such inverse problems, as we discuss in detail in Section 3.</p><p>In addition, non-Bayesian interpretations of re- gression models, which are often used in practice, don't produce any prediction of uncertainty, so other than the predicted point, we have little idea where else the term could have high or low prob- ability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Priedhorsky et al. (2014)</ref> propose a Gaus- sian Mixture Model (GMM) approach instead of squared loss regression, whereby they learn a mix- ture of bivariate Gaussian distributions for each individual n-gram in the training set. During pre- diction, they add the Gaussian mixture of each n- gram in the input text, resulting in a new Gaussian mixture which can be used to predict a coordinate with associated uncertainty. To add the mixture components they use a weighted sum, where the weight of each n-gram is assigned by several heuris- tic features. Learning a GMM for each n-gram is resource-intensive if the size of the training set - and thus the number of n-grams -is large.</p><p>Assuming sufficient training samples containing the term Norwalk in the two main, a trained clas- sification model would, given this term as input, predict a probability distribution over all regions, and assign higher probabilities to the regions con- taining the two major cities. The challenge, though, is that the coordinates in the training data must first be partitioned into regions using administra- tive regions <ref type="bibr">(Cheng et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hecht et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kinsella et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Han et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Han et al., , 2014</ref>), a uni- form grid ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Serdyukov et al., 2009)</ref>, or a clustering method such as a k-d tree (Wing and Baldridge, 2011) or K-means (Rahimi et al., to appear). The cluster/region labels can then be used as targets. Once we have a prediction about where a user is more likely to be from, there is no more infor- mation about the coordinates inside the predicted region. If a region that contains Wyoming is pre- dicted as the home location of a user, we have no idea which city or county within Wyoming the user might be from, unless we retrain the model using a more fine-grained discretisation or a hierarchical discretisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wing and Baldridge, 2014)</ref>, which is both time-consuming and challenging due to data sparseness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Lexical Dialectology</head><p>The traditional linguistic approach to lexical di- alectology is to find the geographical distributions of known contrast sets such as {you, yall, yinz}: ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Labov et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nerbonne et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gonçalves and Sánchez, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Doyle, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Huang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nguyen and Eisenstein, to appear)</ref>. This usually involves surveying a large geographically-uniform sample of people from dif- ferent locations and analysing where each known alternative is used more frequently. Then, the co- ordinates are clustered heuristically into dialect re- gions, based on the lexical choices of users in each region relative to the contrast set. This processing is very costly and time-consuming, and relies crit- ically on knowing the lexical alternatives a priori. For example, it would require a priori knowledge of the fact that people in different regions of the US use pop and soda to refer to the same type of drink, and a posteriori analysis of the empirical geograph- ical distribution of the different terms. Language, particularly in social media and among younger speakers, is evolving so quickly, in ways that can be measured over large-scale data samples such as Twitter, that we ideally want to be able to infer such contrast sets dynamically. The first step in automatically collecting dialect words is to find terms that are disproportionately distributed in dif- ferent locations. The two predominant approaches to this problem are model-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eisenstein et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmed et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Eisenstein, 2015)</ref> and through the use of statistical metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Monroe et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cook et al., 2014)</ref>. Model-based approaches use a topic model, e.g., to extract region-specific topics, and from this, predict the probability of see- ing a word given a geographical region ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eisenstein et al., 2010)</ref>. However, there are scalability issues, limiting the utility of such models.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a neural network archi- tecture that learns a mixture of Gaussian distribu- tions as its activation function, and predicts both locations from word-based inputs (geolocation), and words from location-based inputs (lexical di- alectology).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Mixture Density Network (MDN)</head><p>A mixture density network ("MDN": <ref type="bibr">Bishop (1994)</ref>) is a latent variable model where the condi- tional probability of p(y|x) is modelled as a mix- ture of K Gaussians where the mixing coefficients π and the parameters of Gaussian distributions µ and Σ are computed as a function of input using a neural network:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P(y|x) = K k=1 π k (x)N y|µ k (x), Σ k (x)</formula><p>In the bivariate case of latitude/longitude, the number of parameters of each Gaussian is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">6 (π k (x), µ 1k (x), µ 2k (x), ρ k (x), σ 1k (x), σ 2k (x)),</formula><p>which are learnt in the output layer of a regular neural network as a function of input x. The out- put size of the network for K components would be 6 × K. The output of an MDN for N sam- ples (e.g. where N is the mini-batch size) is an N × 6K matrix which is then sliced and reshaped</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">into (N × 2 × K), (N × 2 × K), (N × 1 × K)</formula><p>and (N × 1 × K) matrices, providing the model parameters µ, σ, ρ and π. Each parameter type has its own constraints: σ (the standard deviation) should be positive, ρ (the correlation) should be in the interval [−1, 1] and π should be positive and sum to one, as a probability distribution. To force these constraints, the following transformations are often applied to each parameter set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ ∼ SoftPlus(σ) = log(exp(σ) + 1) ∈ (0, +∞) π ∼ SoftMax(π) ρ ∼ SoftSign(ρ) = ρ 1 + |ρ| ∈ [−1, 1]</formula><p>As an alternative, it's possible to use transforma- tions like exp for σ and tanh for ρ. After applying the transformations to enforce the range constraints, the negative log likelihood loss of each sample x given a 2d coordinate label y is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L(y|x) = − log K k=1 π k (x)N y|µ k (x), Σ k (x)</formula><p>To predict a location, given an unseen input, the output of the network is reshaped into a mixture of Gaussians and µ k , one of the K components' µ is chosen as the prediction. The selection criteria is either based on the strongest component with highest π, or the component that maximises the overall mixture probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max µ i ∈{µ 1 ...µ K } K k=1 π k N (µ i |µ k , Σ k )</formula><p>For further details on selection criteria, see <ref type="bibr">Bishop (1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Mixture Density Network with Shared Parameters (MDN-SHARED)</head><p>In the original MDN model proposed by <ref type="bibr">Bishop (1994)</ref>, the parameters of the mixture model are separate functions of input, which is appropriate when the inputs and outputs directly relate to each other, but in the case of geolocation or lexical di- alectology, the relationship between inputs and out- puts is not so obvious. As a result, it might be a difficult task for the model to learn all the param- eters of each sample correctly. Instead of using the output to predict all the parameters, we share µ and Σ among all samples as parameters of the output layer, and only use the input to predict π, the mixture probabilities, using a SoftMax layer. We initialise µ by applying K-means clustering to the training coordinates and setting each value of µ to the centroids of the K clusters; we initialise Σ ran- domly between 0 and 10. We use the original cost function to update the weight matrices, biases and the global shared parameters of the mixture model through backpropagation. Prediction is performed in the same way as for MDN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Continuous Representation of Location</head><p>Gaussian mixtures are usually used as the output layer in neural networks (as in MDN) for inverse regression problems. We extend their application by using them as an input representation when the input is a multidimensional continuous vari- able. In problems such as lexical dialectology, the input is real-valued 2d coordinates, and the goal is to predict dialect words from a given location. Small differences in latitude/longitude may result in big shifts in language use (e.g. in regions such as <ref type="bibr">Switzerland or Gibraltar)</ref>. One way to model this is to discretise the input space (similar to the discretisation of the output space in classification), with the significant downside that the model is not able to learn/fine-tune regions in a data-driven way.</p><p>A better solution is to use a K component Gaussian mixture representation of location, where µ and Σ are shared among all samples, and the output of the layer is the probability of input in each of the mix- ture components. Note that in this representation, there is no need for π parameters as we just need to represent the association of an input location to K regions, which will then be used as input to the next layer of a neural network and used to predict the targets. We use this continuous representation of location to predict dialect words from location input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We apply the two described MDN models on two widely-used geotagged Twitter datasets for geolo- cation, and compare the results with state-of-the-art classification and regression baselines. Also, we use the mixture of Gaussian representation of loca- tion to predict dialect terms from coordinates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data</head><p>In our experiments, we use two existing Twitter user geolocation datasets: <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>   opment and test partitions, and a user is represented by the concatenation of their tweets, and labelled with the latitude/longitude of the first collected geo- tagged tweet. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US cover the continental US with 9k, 449k users, respec- tively. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> DARE is a dialect-term dataset derived from the Dictionary of American Regional English <ref type="bibr">(Cassidy, 1985)</ref> by <ref type="bibr">Rahimi et al. (to appear)</ref>. DARE consists of dialect regions, terms and the meaning of each term. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> It represents the aggregation of a number of dialectal surveys over different regions of the U.S., to identify shared dialect regions. Because the dialect regions in DARE maps are not machine readable, populous cities within each dialect region are manually extracted and associated with their dialect region terms. The dataset is made up of around 4.3k dialect terms across 99 U.S. dialect regions. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> This geolocation representation is naive, but was made by the creators of the original datasets and has been used by others. It has been preserved in this work for comparability with the results of others, despite misgivings about whether this is a faithful representation of the location for a given user. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The datasets can be obtained from https://github. com/utcompling/textgrounder. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> http://www.daredictionary.com/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Geolocation</head><p>We use a 3-layer neural network as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1a</ref> where the input is the l 2 normalised bag-of- words model of a given user with stop words, @- mentions and words with document frequency less than 10 removed. The input is fed to a hidden layer with tanh nonlinearity that produces the output of the network (with no nonlinearity applied). The output is the collection of Gaussian mixture param- eters (µ, Σ, π) from MDN. For prediction, the µ k of the mixture component which has the highest prob- ability within the mixture component is selected.</p><p>In the case of MDN-SHARED, the output is only π, a vector with size K, but the output layer con- tains extra global parameters µ and Σ (σ lat , σ lon , ρ) which are shared between all the samples. The negative log likelihood objective is optimised using Adam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) and early stopping is used to prevent overfitting. The hidden layer is sub- ject to drop-out and elastic net regularisation (with equal l 1 and l 2 shares). As our baseline, we used a multilayer perceptron regressor with the same input and hidden architecture but with a 2d out- put with linear activation that predicts the location from text input. The regularisation and drop-out rate, hidden layer size and the number of Gaussian components K (for MDN and MDN-SHARED) are tuned over the development set of each dataset, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate the predictions of the geolocation models based on three measures (following <ref type="bibr">Cheng et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eisenstein et al. (2010)</ref>):</p><p>1. the classification accuracy within a 161km (= 100 mile) radius of the actual location ("Acc@161"); i.e., if the predicted location is within 161km of the actual location, it is considered to be correct 2. the mean error ("Mean") between the pre- dicted location and the actual location of the user, in kilometres 3. the median error ("Median") between the pre- dicted location and the actual location of the user, in kilometres</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Lexical Dialectology</head><p>To predict dialect words from location, we use a 4-layer neural network as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref>. The input is a latitude/longitude coordinate, the first hidden layer is a Gaussian mixture with K com- ponents which has µ and Σ as its parameters and produces a probability for each component as an activation function, the second hidden layer with tanh nonlinearity captures the association between different Gaussians, and the output is a SoftMax layer which results in a probability distribution over the vocabulary. For a user label, we use an l 1 nor- malised bag-of-words representation of its text con- tent and use binary tf and idf for term-weighting. The model should learn to predict the probability distribution over the vocabulary and so be capable of predicting dialect words with a higher probabil- ity. It also learns regions (parameters of K Gaus- sians) that represent dialect regions. We evaluate the lexical dialectology model (MDN-layer) using perplexity of the predicted unigram distribution, and compare it with a base- line where the Gaussian mixture layer is replaced with a tanh hidden layer (tanh-layer). Also we retrieve words given points within a region from the DAREDS dataset, and measure recall with respect to relevant dialect terms from DAREDS. To do that, we randomly sample P = 10000 lat- itude/longitude points from the training set and predict the corresponding word distribution. To come up with a ranking over words given region r as query, we use the following measure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">score(w i |r) = 1 N p j ∈r log(P (w i |p j )) − 1 P P j=1 log(P (w i |p j ))</formula><p>where N equals the number of points (out of 10000) inside the query dialect region r and P equals the total number of points (here 10000). For exam- ple, if we are querying dialect terms from dialect region South (r), N is the number of randomly se- lected points that fall within the constituent states of South. score(w i |r) measures the (log) probabil- ity ratio of a word w i inside region r compared to its global score: if a word is local to region r, the ratio will be higher. We use this measure to create a ranking over the vocabulary from which we mea- sure precision and recall at k given gold-standard dialect terms in DAREDS.</p></div>

Because the DARE dialect terms are not used frequently in Twitter, many of the words are not covered in our dataset, despite its size. However, our model is able to retrieve dialect terms that are distinctly associated with regions. The top dialect words for regions New York, Louisiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, and include named entities, dialect words and local hashtags. We also visualised the learned Gaussians of the dialectology model in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which as expected show several smaller regions (Gaussians with higher σ) and larger regions in lower populated areas. It is interesting to see that the shape of the learned Gaussians matches natural borders such as coastal regions.</p><p>We also visualised the log probability of dialect terms hella (an intensifier mainly used in North- ern California) and yall (means "you all", used in Southern U.S.) resulting from the Gaussian rep- resentation model. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, the heatmap matches the expected regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a continuous representation of loca- tion using mixture of Gaussians and applied it to geotagged Twitter data in two different settings: (1) geolocation of social media users, and (2) lexical dialectology. <ref type="bibr">We used MDN (Bishop, 1994)</ref> in a multilayer neural network as a geolocation model    <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Learned Gaussian representation of input locations over TWITTER-US in the lexical dialectology model.

There is also very recent work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Iso et al., 2017</ref>) in tweet-level geolocation that shows the effectiveness of MDN.</p><p>We modified MDN by sharing the parameters of the Gaussian mixtures in MDN-SHARED and im- proved upon MDN, achieving competetive results with state-of-the-art classification models.
