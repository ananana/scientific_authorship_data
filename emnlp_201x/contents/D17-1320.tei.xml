				<p>Concept maps can be used to concisely represent important information and bring structure into large document collections. Therefore, we study a variant of multi-document summarization that produces summaries in the form of concept maps. However, suitable evaluation datasets for this task are currently missing. To close this gap, we present a newly created corpus of concept maps that summarize heterogeneous collections of web documents on educational topics. It was created using a novel crowdsourcing approach that allows us to efficiently determine important elements in large document collections. We release the corpus along with a baseline system and proposed evaluation protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Multi-document summarization (MDS), the trans- formation of a set of documents into a short text containing their most important aspects, is a long- studied problem in NLP. Generated summaries have been shown to support humans dealing with large document collections in information seek- ing tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McKeown et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Maña-López et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Roussinov and Chen, 2001</ref>). How- ever, when exploring a set of documents manually, humans rarely write a fully-formulated summary for themselves. Instead, user studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kang et al., 2011)</ref> show that they note down important keywords and phrases, try to identify re- lationships between them and organize them ac- cordingly. Therefore, we believe that the study of summarization with similarly structured outputs is an important extension of the traditional task. A representation that is more in line with ob- served user behavior is a concept map <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Novak and Gowin, 1984)</ref>, a labeled graph showing con- cepts as nodes and relationships between them as edges ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Introduced in 1972 as a teach- ing tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Novak and Cañas, 2007)</ref>, concept maps have found many applications in education <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Edwards and Fraser, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Roy, 2008)</ref>, for writing assistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Villalon, 2012</ref>) or to structure infor- mation repositories ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Briggs et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Richardson and Fox, 2005</ref>). For summarization, concept maps make it possible to represent a summary con- cisely and clearly reveal relationships. Moreover, we see a second interesting use case that goes be- yond the capabilities of textual summaries: When concepts and relations are linked to correspond- ing locations in the documents they have been ex- tracted from, the graph can be used to navigate in a document collection, similar to a table of contents. An implementation of this idea has been recently described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Falke and Gurevych (2017)</ref>.</p><p>The corresponding task that we propose is concept-map-based MDS, the summarization of a document cluster in the form of a concept map. In order to develop and evaluate methods for the task, gold-standard corpora are necessary, but no suitable corpus is available. The manual creation of such a dataset is very time-consuming, as the annotation includes many subtasks. In particular, an annotator would need to manually identify all concepts in the documents, while only a few of them will eventually end up in the summary.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Excerpt from a summary concept map on the topic "students loans without credit history".</p><p>To overcome these issues, we present a corpus creation method that effectively combines auto- matic preprocessing, scalable crowdsourcing and high-quality expert annotations. Using it, we can avoid the high effort for single annotators, allow- ing us to scale to document clusters that are 15 times larger than in traditional summarization cor- pora. We created a new corpus of 30 topics, each with around 40 source documents on educational topics and a summarizing concept map that is the consensus of many crowdworkers (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>.</p><p>As a crucial step of the corpus creation, we de- veloped a new crowdsourcing scheme called low- context importance annotation. In contrast to tra- ditional approaches, it allows us to determine im- portant elements in a document cluster without re- quiring annotators to read all documents, making it feasible to crowdsource the task and overcome quality issues observed in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lloret et al., 2013</ref>). We show that the approach creates reliable data for our focused summarization sce- nario and, when tested on traditional summariza- tion corpora, creates annotations that are similar to those obtained by earlier efforts.</p><p>To summarize, we make the following contribu- tions: (1) We propose a novel task, concept-map- based MDS ( §2), (2) present a new crowdsourc- ing scheme to create reference summaries ( §4), (3) publish a new dataset for the proposed task ( §5) and (4) provide an evaluation protocol and baseline ( §7). We make these resources publicly available under a permissive license.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task</head><p>Concept-map-based MDS is defined as follows: Given a set of related documents, create a concept map that represents its most important content, satisfies a specified size limit and is connected.</p><p>We define a concept map as a labeled graph showing concepts as nodes and relationships be- tween them as edges. Labels are arbitrary se- quences of tokens taken from the documents, mak- ing the summarization task extractive. A concept can be an entity, abstract idea, event or activity, designated by its unique label. Good maps should be propositionally coherent, meaning that every relation together with the two connected concepts form a meaningful proposition.</p><p>The task is complex, consisting of several inter- dependent subtasks. One has to extract appropri- ate labels for concepts and relations and recognize different expressions that refer to the same concept across multiple documents. Further, one has to se- lect the most important concepts and relations for the summary and finally organize them in a graph satisfying the connectedness and size constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Some attempts have been made to automatically construct concept maps from text, working with either single documents ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zubrinic et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Villalon, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Valerio and Leake, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kowata et al., 2010</ref>) or document clusters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Qasim et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zouaq and Nkambou, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rajaraman and Tan, 2002</ref>). These approaches extract concept and relation labels from syntactic structures and con- nect them to build a concept map. However, com- mon task definitions and comparable evaluations are missing. In addition, only a few of them, namely Villalon (2012) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Valerio and Leake (2006)</ref>, define summarization as their goal and try to compress the input to a substantially smaller size. Our newly proposed task and the created large-cluster dataset fill these gaps as they empha- size the summarization aspect of the task.</p><p>For the subtask of selecting summary-worthy concepts and relations, techniques developed for traditional summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nenkova and McKeown, 2011</ref>) and keyphrase extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hasan and Ng, 2014</ref>) are related and applicable. Approaches Imagine you want to learn something about students loans without credit history. How useful would the following statements be for you?</p><p>(P1) students with bad credit history -apply for -federal loans with the FAFSA 2 Extremely Important 2 Very Important 2 Moderately Important 2 Slightly Important 2 Not at all Important (P2) students -encounter -unforeseen financial emergencies 2 Extremely Important 2 Very Important 2 Moderately Important 2 Slightly Important 2 Not at all Important <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Likert-scale crowdsourcing task with topic description and two example propositions.</p><p>that build graphs of propositions to create a sum- mary <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li, 2015</ref>) seem to be particularly related, however, there is one important difference: While they use graphs as an intermediate representation from which a textual summary is then generated, the goal of the proposed task is to create a graph that is directly interpretable and useful for a user. In contrast, these intermediate graphs, e.g. AMR, are hardly useful for a typical, non-linguist user.</p><p>For traditional summarization, the most well- known datasets emerged out of the DUC and TAC competitions. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> They provide clusters of news articles with gold-standard summaries. Extend- ing these efforts, several more specialized corpora have been created: With regard to size, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nakano et al. (2010)</ref> present a corpus of summaries for large-scale collections of web pages. Recently, corpora with more heterogeneous documents have been suggested, e.g. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zopf et al., 2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benikova et al., 2016</ref>). The corpus we present combines these aspects, as it has large clusters of heterogeneous documents, and provides a neces- sary benchmark to evaluate the proposed task.</p><p>For concept map generation, one corpus with human-created summary concept maps for student essays has been created ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Villalon et al., 2010)</ref>. In contrast to our corpus, it only deals with single documents, requires a two orders of magnitude smaller amount of compression of the input and is not publicly available .</p><p>Other types of information representation that also model concepts and their relationships are knowledge bases, such as Freebase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollacker et al., 2009)</ref>, and ontologies. However, they both differ in important aspects: Whereas concept maps follow an open label paradigm and are meant to be interpretable by humans, knowledge bases and on- tologies are usually more strictly typed and made to be machine-readable. Moreover, approaches to automatically construct them from text typically 4 Low-Context Importance Annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lloret et al. (2013)</ref> describe several experiments to crowdsource reference summaries. Workers are asked to read 10 documents and then select 10 summary sentences from them for a reward of $0.05. They discovered several challenges, includ- ing poor work quality and the subjectiveness of the annotation task, indicating that crowdsourcing is not useful for this purpose.</p><p>To overcome these issues, we introduce a new task design, low-context importance annotation, to determine summary-worthy parts of documents. Compared to Lloret et al.'s approach, it is more in line with crowdsourcing best practices, as the tasks are simple, intuitive and small ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sabou et al., 2014</ref>) and workers receive reasonable payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fort et al., 2011</ref>). Most importantly, it is also much more efficient and scalable, as it does not require workers to read all documents in a cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Task Design</head><p>We break down the task of importance annota- tion to the level of single propositions. The goal of our crowdsourcing scheme is to obtain a score for each proposition indicating its importance in a document cluster, such that a ranking according to the score would reveal what is most important and should be included in a summary. In contrast to other work, we do not show the documents to the workers at all, but provide only a description of the document cluster's topic along with the propo- sitions. This ensures that tasks are small, simple and can be done quickly (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>In preliminary tests, we found that this design, despite the minimal context, works reasonably on our focused clusters on common educational top- ics. For instance, consider <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: One can eas- ily say that P1 is more important than P2 without reading the documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>We distinguish two task variants:</head><p>Likert-scale Tasks Instead of enforcing binary importance decisions, we use a 5-point Likert- scale to allow more fine-grained annotations. The obtained labels are translated into scores (5..1) and the average of all scores for a proposition is used as an estimate for its importance. This follows the idea that while single workers might find the task subjective, the consensus of multiple workers, rep- resented in the average score, tends to be less sub- jective due to the "wisdom of the crowd". We ran- domly group five propositions into a task.</p><p>Comparison Tasks As an alternative, we use a second task design based on pairwise compar- isons. Comparisons are known to be easier to make and more consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Belz and Kow, 2010)</ref>, but also more expensive, as the number of pairs grows quadratically with the number of objects. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> To reduce the cost, we group five propositions into a task and ask workers to order them by impor- tance per drag-and-drop. From the results, we de- rive pairwise comparisons and use TrueSkill <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Herbrich et al., 2007</ref>), a powerful Bayesian rank in- duction model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang et al., 2016)</ref>, to obtain im- portance estimates for each proposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Pilot Study</head><p>To verify the proposed approach, we conducted a pilot study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using data from TAC2008 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dang and Owczarzak, 2008)</ref>. We collected importance estimates for 474 propo- sitions extracted from the first three clusters 4 using both task designs. Each Likert-scale task was as- signed to 5 different workers and awarded $0.06. For comparison tasks, we also collected 5 labels each, paid $0.05 and sampled around 7% of all possible pairs. We submitted them in batches of 100 pairs and selected pairs for subsequent batches based on the confidence of the TrueSkill model. Quality Control Following the observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lloret et al. (2013)</ref>, we established several mea- sures for quality control. First, we restricted our tasks to workers from the US with an approval rate of at least 95%. Second, we identified low quality workers by measuring the correlation of each worker's Likert-scores with the average of <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Even with intelligent sampling strategies, such as the ac- tive learning in CrowdBT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2013)</ref>, the number of pairs is only reduced by a constant factor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang et al., 2016</ref> the other four scores. The worst workers (at most 5% of all labels) were removed. In addition, we included trap sentences, similar as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lloret et al., 2013)</ref>, in around 80 of the tasks. In contrast to Lloret et al.'s findings, both an obvi- ous trap sentence (This sentence is not important) and a less obvious but unimportant one (Barack Obama graduated from Harvard Law) were con- sistently labeled as unimportant (1.08 and 1.14), indicating that the workers did the task properly.</p><p>Agreement and Reliability For Likert-scale tasks, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Snow et al. (2008)</ref> and calcu- late agreement as the average Pearson correlation of a worker's Likert-score with the average score of the remaining workers. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> This measure is less strict than exact label agreement and can account for close labels and high-or low-scoring workers. We observe a correlation of 0.81, indicating sub- stantial agreement. For comparisons, the majority agreement is 0.73. To further examine the reliabil- ity of the collected data, we followed the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kiritchenko and Mohammed (2016)</ref> and simply repeated the crowdsourcing for one of the three topics. Between the importance estimates calcu- lated from the first and second run, we found a Pearson correlation of 0.82 (Spearman 0.78) for Likert-scale tasks and 0.69 (Spearman 0.66) for comparison tasks. This shows that the approach, despite the subjectiveness of the task, allows us to collect reliable annotations.</p><p>Peer Evaluation In addition to the reliability studies, we extrinsically evaluated the annotations in the task of summary evaluation. For each of the 58 peer summaries in TAC2008, we calcu- lated a score as the sum of the importance es- timates of the propositions it contains. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows how these peer scores, averaged over the three topics, correlate with the manual responsive- ness scores assigned during TAC in comparison  Figure 4: Steps of the corpus creation (with references to the corresponding sections).</p><p>to ROUGE-2 and Pyramid scores. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The results demonstrate that with both task designs, we obtain importance annotations that are similarly useful for summary evaluation as pyramid annotations or gold-standard summaries (used for ROUGE).</p><p>Conclusion Based on the pilot study, we con- clude that the proposed crowdsourcing scheme al- lows us to obtain proper importance annotations for propositions. As workers are not required to read all documents, the annotation is much more efficient and scalable as with traditional methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Corpus Creation</head><p>This section presents the corpus construction pro- cess, as outlined in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, combining automatic preprocessing, scalable crowdsourcing and high- quality expert annotations to be able to scale to the size of our document clusters. For every topic, we spent about $150 on crowdsourcing and 1.5h of expert annotations, while just a single annotator would already need over 8 hours (at 200 words per minute) to read all documents of a topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Source Data</head><p>As a starting point, we used the DIP corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Habernal et al., 2016)</ref>, a collection of 49 clusters of 100 web pages on educational topics (e.g. bul- lying, homeschooling, drugs) with a short descrip- tion of each topic. It was created from a large web crawl using state-of-the-art information retrieval. We selected 30 of the topics for which we created the necessary concept map annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Proposition Extraction</head><p>As concept maps consist of propositions express- ing the relation between concepts (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>, we need to impose such a structure upon the plain text in the document clusters. This could be done by manually annotating spans representing con- cepts and relations, however, the size of our clus- ters makes this a huge effort: 2288 sentences per topic (69k in total) need to be processed. There- fore, we resort to an automatic approach. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Correlations for ROUGE and Pyramid are lower than re- ported in TAC since we only use 3 topics instead of all 48.</p><p>The Open Information Extraction paradigm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banko et al., 2007</ref>) offers a representation very similar to the desired one. For instance, from</p><p>Students with bad credit history should not lose hope and apply for federal loans with the FAFSA.</p><p>Open IE systems extract tuples of two arguments and a relation phrase representing propositions:</p><p>(s. with bad credit history, should not lose, hope) (s. with bad credit history, apply for, federal loans with the FAFSA)</p><p>While the relation phrase is similar to a relation in a concept map, many arguments in these tuples represent useful concepts. We used Open IE 4 7 , a state-of-the-art system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Stanovsky and Dagan, 2016)</ref> to process all sentences. After removing du- plicates, we obtained 4137 tuples per topic.</p><p>Since we want to create a gold-standard corpus, we have to ensure that we produce high-quality data. We therefore made use of the confidence assigned to every extracted tuple to filter out low quality ones. To ensure that we do not filter too aggressively (and miss important aspects in the fi- nal summary), we manually annotated 500 tuples sampled from all topics for correctness. On the first 250 of them, we tuned the filter threshold to 0.5, which keeps 98.7% of the correct extractions in the unseen second half. After filtering, a topic had on average 2850 propositions (85k in total).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Proposition Filtering</head><p>Despite the similarity of the Open IE paradigm, not every extracted tuple is a suitable proposition for a concept map. To reduce the effort in the sub- sequent steps, we therefore want to filter out un- suitable ones. A tuple is suitable if it (1) is a cor- rect extraction, (2) is meaningful without any con- text and (3) has arguments that represent proper concepts. We created a guideline explaining when to label a tuple as suitable for a concept map and performed a small annotation study. Three anno- tators independently labeled 500 randomly sam-pled tuples. The agreement was 82% (κ = 0.60). We found tuples to be unsuitable mostly because they had unresolvable pronouns, conflicting with (2), or arguments that were full clauses or propo- sitions, conflicting with (3), while (1) was mostly taken care of by the confidence filtering in §5.2.</p><p>Due to the high number of tuples we decided to automate the filtering step. We trained a linear SVM on the majority voted annotations. As fea- tures, we used the extraction confidence, length of arguments and relations as well as part-of-speech tags, among others. To ensure that the automatic classification does not remove suitable proposi- tions, we tuned the classifier to avoid false neg- atives. In particular, we introduced class weights, improving precision on the negative class at the cost of a higher fraction of positive classifications. Additionally, we manually verified a certain num- ber of the most uncertain negative classifications to further improve performance. When 20% of the classifications are manually verified and cor- rected, we found that our model trained on 350 labeled instances achieves 93% precision on neg- ative classifications on the unseen 150 instances. We found this to be a reasonable trade-off of au- tomation and data quality and applied the model to the full dataset.</p><p>The classifier filtered out 43% of the proposi- tions, leaving 1622 per topic. We manually ex- amined the 17k least confident negative classifi- cations and corrected 955 of them. We also cor- rected positive classifications for certain types of tuples for which we knew the classifier to be im- precise. Finally, each topic was left with an aver- age of 1554 propositions (47k in total).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Importance Annotation</head><p>Given the propositions identified in the previous step, we now applied our crowdsourcing scheme as described in §4 to determine their importance. To cope with the large number of propositions, we combine the two task designs: First, we col- lect Likert-scores from 5 workers for each propo- sition, clean the data and calculate average scores. Then, using only the top 100 propositions 8 accord- ing to these scores, we crowdsource 10% of all possible pairwise comparisons among them. Us- ing TrueSkill, we obtain a fine-grained ranking of the 100 most important propositions. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We also add all propositions with the same score as the 100th, yielding 112 propositions on average.</p><p>For Likert-scores, the average agreement over all topics is 0.80, while the majority agreement for comparisons is 0.78. We repeated the data collec- tion for three randomly selected topics and found the Pearson correlation between both runs to be 0.73 (Spearman 0.73) for Likert-scores and 0.72 (Spearman 0.71) for comparisons. These figures show that the crowdsourcing approach works on this dataset as reliably as on the TAC documents.</p><p>In total, we uploaded 53k scoring and 12k comparison tasks to Mechanical Turk, spending $4425.45 including fees. From the fine-grained ranking of the 100 most important propositions, we select the top 50 per topic to construct a sum- mary concept map in the subsequent steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Proposition Revision</head><p>Having a manageable number of propositions, an annotator then applied a few straightforward trans- formations that correct common errors of the Open IE system. First, we break down propositions with conjunctions in either of the arguments into sep- arate propositions per conjunct, which the Open IE system sometimes fails to do. And second, we correct span errors that might occur in the ar- gument or relation phrases, especially when sen- tences were not properly segmented. As a result, we have a set of high quality propositions for our concept map, consisting of, due to the first trans- formation, 56.1 propositions per topic on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Concept Map Construction</head><p>In this final step, we connect the set of important propositions to form a graph. For instance, given the following two propositions (student, may borrow, Stafford Loan) (the student, does not have, a credit history) one can easily see, although the first arguments differ slightly, that both labels describe the con- cept student, allowing us to build a concept map with the concepts student, Stafford Loan and credit history. The annotation task thus involves decid- ing which of the available propositions to include in the map, which of their concepts to merge and, when merging, which of the available labels to use. As these decisions highly depend upon each other and require context, we decided to use expert annotators rather than crowdsource the subtasks.</p><p>Annotators were given the topic description and the most important, ranked propositions.

They were instructed to reach a size of 25 concepts, the recommended maximum size for a concept map <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Novak and Cañas, 2007)</ref>. Fur- ther, they should prefer more important proposi- tions and ensure connectedness. When connect- ing two propositions, they were asked to keep the concept label that was appropriate for both propo- sitions. To support the annotators, the tool used ADW ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pilehvar et al., 2013</ref>), a state-of-the-art ap- proach for semantic similarity, to suggest possible connections. The annotation was carried out by graduate students with a background in NLP after receiving an introduction into the guidelines and tool and annotating a first example. If an annotator was not able to connect 25 con- cepts, she was allowed to create up to three syn- thetic relations with freely defined labels, mak- ing the maps slightly abstractive. On average, the constructed maps have 0.77 synthetic relations, mostly connecting concepts whose relation is too obvious to be explicitly stated in text (e.g. between Montessori teacher and Montessori education).</p><p>To assess the reliability of this annotation step, we had the first three maps created by two annota- tors. We casted the task of selecting propositions to be included in the map as a binary decision task and observed an agreement of 84% (κ = 0.66). Second, we modeled the decision which concepts to join as a binary decision on all pairs of com- mon concepts, observing an agreement of 95% (κ = 0.70). And finally, we compared which concept labels the annotators decided to include in the final map, observing 85% (κ = 0.69) agree- ment. Hence, the annotation shows substantial agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Landis and Koch, 1977)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Corpus Analysis</head><p>In this section, we describe our newly created cor- pus, which, in addition to having summaries in the form of concept maps, differs from traditional summarization corpora in several aspects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Document Clusters</head><p>Size The corpus consists of document clusters for 30 different topics. Each of them contains around 40 documents with on average 2413 to- kens, which leads to an average cluster size of 97,880 token. With these characteristics, the docu- ment clusters are 15 times larger than typical DUC clusters of ten documents and five times larger than the 25-document-clusters <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. In addi- tion, the documents are also more variable in terms of length, as the (length-adjusted) standard devia- tion is twice as high as in the other corpora. With these properties, the corpus represents an interest- ing challenge towards real-world application sce- narios, in which users typically have to deal with much more than ten documents.</p><p>Genres Because we used a large web crawl as the source for our corpus, it contains docu- ments from a variety of genres. To further an- alyze this property, we categorized a sample of 50 documents from the corpus. Among them, we found professionally written articles and blog posts (28%), educational material for parents and kids (26%), personal blog posts (16%), forum dis- cussions and comments (12%), commented link collections (12%) and scientific articles (6%).</p><p>Textual Heterogeneity In addition to the vari- ety of genres, the documents also differ in terms of language use. To capture this property, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zopf et al. (2016)</ref> and compute, for every topic, the average Jensen-Shannon divergence be- tween the word distribution of one document and the word distribution in the remaining documents. The higher this value is, the more the language dif- fers between documents. We found the average di- vergence over all topics to be 0.3490, whereas it is 0.3019 in DUC 2004 and 0.3188 in TAC 2008A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Concept Maps</head><p>As <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows, each of the 30 reference con- cept maps has exactly 25 concepts and between 24 and 28 relations. Labels for both concepts and per Map</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Token</head><p>Character Concepts 25.0 ± 0.0 3.2 ± 0.5 22.0 ± 4.1 Relations 25.2 ± 1.3 3.2 ± 0.5 17.1 ± 2.6 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Size of concept maps (mean with std).</p><p>relations consist on average of 3.2 tokens, whereas the latter are a bit shorter in characters.</p><p>To obtain a better picture of what kind of text spans have been used as labels, we automatically tagged them with their part-of-speech and deter- mined their head with a dependency parser. Con- cept labels tend to be headed by nouns (82%) or verbs (15%), while they also contain adjectives, prepositions and determiners. Relation labels, on the other hand, are almost always headed by a verb (94%) and contain prepositions, nouns and parti- cles in addition. These distributions are very sim- ilar to those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Villalon et al. (2010)</ref> for their (single-document) concept map corpus.</p><p>Analyzing the graph structure of the maps, we found that all of them are connected. They have on average 7.2 central concepts with more than one relation, while the remaining ones occur in only one proposition. We found that achieving a higher number of connections would mean com- promising importance, i.e. including less impor- tant propositions, and decided against it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Baseline Experiments</head><p>In this section, we briefly describe a baseline and evaluation scripts that we release, with a detailed documentation, along with the corpus.</p><p>Baseline Method We implemented a simple ap- proach inspired by previous work on concept map generation and keyphrase extraction. For a docu- ment cluster, it performs the following steps:</p><p>1. Extract all NPs as potential concepts.</p><p>2. Merge potential concepts whose labels match after stemming into a single concept.</p><p>3. For each pair of concepts co-occurring in a sentence, select the tokens in between as a potential relation if they contain a verb.</p><p>4. If a pair of concepts has more than one rela- tion, select the one with the shortest label.</p><p>5. Assign an importance score to every concept and rank them accordingly.  For <ref type="formula">(5)</ref>, we trained a binary classifier to iden- tify the important concepts in the set of all poten- tial concepts. We used common features for key- phrase extraction, including position, frequency and length, and Weka's Random Forest ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hall et al., 2009</ref>) implementation as the model. At inference time, we use the classifiers confidence for a posi- tive classification as the score. In step (6), we start with the full graph of all extracted concepts and relations and use a heuris- tic to find a subgraph that is connected, satisfies the size limit of 25 concepts and has many high- scoring concepts: We iteratively remove the weak- est concept until only one connected component of 25 concepts or less remains, which is used the summary concept map. This approach guarantees that the concept map is connected, but might not find the subset of concepts that has the highest to- tal importance score.</p><p>Evaluation Metrics In order to automatically compare generated concept maps with reference maps, we propose three metrics. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> As a concept map is fully defined by the set of its propositions, we can compute precision, recall and F1-scores between the two proposition set of generated and reference map. A proposition is represented as the concatenation of concept and relation labels. Strict Match compares them after stemming and only counts exact and complete matches. <ref type="bibr">Using METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014</ref>), we offer a second metric that takes synonyms and paraphrases into account and also scores partial matches. And finally, we compute ROUGE-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lin, 2004</ref>) between the concatenation of all proposi- tions from the maps. These automatic measures might be complemented with a human evaluation.</p><p>Results <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the performance of the baseline. An analysis of the single pipeline steps revealed major bottlenecks of the method and challenges of the task. First, we observed that around 76% of gold concepts are covered by the extraction (step 1+2), while the top 25 concepts (step 5) only contain 17% of the gold concepts. Hence, content selection is a major challenge, stemming from the large cluster sizes in the cor- pus. Second, while also 17% of gold concepts are contained in the final maps (step 6), scores for strict proposition matching are low, indicat- ing a poor performance of the relation extraction (step 3). The propagation of these errors along the pipeline contributes to overall low scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we presented low-context impor- tance annotation, a novel crowdsourcing scheme that we used to create a new benchmark corpus for concept-map-based MDS. The corpus has large- scale document clusters of heterogeneous web documents, posing a challenging summarization task. Together with the corpus, we provide im- plementations of a baseline method and evaluation scripts and hope that our efforts facilitate future re- search on this variant of summarization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Elements of a concept map.</figDesc></figure>
