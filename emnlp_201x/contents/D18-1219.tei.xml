				<p>Previous work on bridging anaphora resolution (Poesio et al., 2004; Hou et al., 2013b) use syntactic preposition patterns to calculate word relatedness. However, such patterns only consider NPs&apos; head nouns and hence do not fully capture the semantics of NPs. Recently, Hou (2018) created word embeddings (em-beddings PP) to capture associative similarity (i.e., relatedness) between nouns by exploring the syntactic structure of noun phrases. But embeddings PP only contains word representations for nouns. In this paper, we create new word vectors by combining embeddings PP with GloVe. This new word embeddings (em-beddings bridging) are a more general lexical knowledge resource for bridging and allow us to represent the meaning of an NP beyond its head easily. We therefore develop a deter-ministic approach for bridging anaphora resolution , which represents the semantics of an NP based on its head noun and modifications. We show that this simple approach achieves the competitive results compared to the best system in Hou et al. (2013b) which explores Markov Logic Networks to model the problem. Additionally, we further improve the results for bridging anaphora resolution reported in Hou (2018) by combining our simple de-terministic approach with Hou et al. (2013b)&apos;s best system MLN II.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Anaphora plays a major role in discourse com- prehension and accounts for the coherence of a text. In contrast to identity anaphora which in- dicates that a noun phrase refers back to the same entity introduced by previous descriptions in the discourse, bridging anaphora or associa- tive anaphora links anaphors and antecedents via lexico-semantic, frame or encyclopedic relations. Bridging resolution is the task to recognize bridg- ing anaphors (e.g., distribution arrangements in Example 1 1 ) and find links to their antecedents (e.g., dialysis products in Example 1).</p><p>(1) While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued, Delmed will continue to supply dialysis prod- ucts through National Medical after their exclu- sive agreement ends in March 1990, Delmed said. In addition, Delmed is exploring distribution ar- rangements with Fresenius USA, Delmed said.</p><p>Most previous empirical research on bridging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Poesio and Vieira, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Poesio et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Markert et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lassalle and Denis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al., 2013b</ref>) focus on bridging anaphora resolution, a subtask of bridging resolution that aims to choose the antecedents for bridging anaphors. For this substask, most previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Poesio et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lassalle and Denis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al., 2013b</ref>) calculate semantic relatedness between an anaphor and its antecedent based on word co-occurrence counts using certain syntac- tic patterns. However, such patterns only consider head noun knowledge and hence are not sufficient for bridging relations which require the semantics of modification. In Example 1, in order to find the antecedent (dialysis products) for the bridging anaphor "distribution arrangements", we have to understand the semantics of the modification "distribution".</p><p>Over the past few years, word embeddings gained a lot popularity in the NLP community. State-of-the-art word vectors such as word2vec skip-gram ( ) and GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) have been shown to perform well across a variety of NLP tasks, including tex- tual entailment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rocktäschel et al., 2016)</ref>, reading comprehension ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen et al., 2016)</ref> and corefer- ence resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hou (2018)</ref> found that these vanilla word embeddings capture both "genuine" similar- ity and relatedness, and hence they are not suit- able for bridging anaphora resolution which re- quires lexical association knowledge instead of se- mantic similarity information between synonyms or hypernyms. Hou (2018) created word embed- dings for bridging (embeddings PP) by exploring the syntactic structure of noun phrases (NPs) to derive contexts for nouns in the GloVe model. However, embeddings PP only contains the word representations for nouns. In this paper, we improve embeddings PP by combining it with GloVe. The resulting word embeddings (embed- dings bridging) are a more general lexical knowl- edge resource for bridging anaphora resolution. Compared to embeddings PP, the coverage of lex- icon in embeddings bridging is much larger. Also the word representations for nouns without the suffix " PP" are more accurate because they are trained on many more instances in the vanilla GloVe. Based on this general vector space, we develop a deterministic algorithm to select an- tecedents for bridging anaphors. Our approach combines the semantics of an NP's head with the semantics of its modifications by vector av- erage using embeddings bridging. We show that this simple, efficient method achieves the com- petitive results on ISNotes for the task of bridg- ing anaphora resolution compared to the best sys- tem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref> which explores Markov Logic Networks to model the problem.</p><p>The main contributions of our work are: (1) a general word representation resource 2 for bridg- ing; and (2) a simple yet competitive deterministic approach for bridging anaphora resolution which models the meaning of an NP based on its head noun and modifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Lexical/world knowledge for bridging: Hou et al. (2013a) explored various lexico-semantic features for bridging anaphora recognition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hou (2016)</ref> proposed an attention-based LSTM model with pre-trained word embeddings for information status classification and reported moderate results for bridging recognition. Previous work on bridg-ing anaphora resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Poesio et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lassalle and Denis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al., 2013b</ref>) explored word co-occurrence counts in certain syntactic preposition patterns to calculate word relatedness. For instance, the big hit counts of the query "the door of the house" in large corpora could indi- cate that door and house stand in a part-of rela- tion. These patterns encode associative relations between nouns which cover a variety of bridging relations. Unlike previous work which only con- sider a small number of prepositions per anaphor, the PP context model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hou, 2018</ref>) uses all prepo- sitions for all nouns in big corpora. It also includes the possessive structure of NPs. In this paper, we further improve Hou (2018)'s embeddings PP by combining it with the vanilla GloVe. The re- sulting word embeddings (embeddings bridging) are a more general lexical knowledge resource for bridging resolution. In addition, it enables ef- ficient computation of word association strength through low-dimensional matrix operations.</p><p>Bridging anaphora resolution: regarding the methods to select antecedents for bridging anaphors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Poesio et al. (2004)</ref> applied a pair- wise model combining lexical semantic features as well as salience features to perform mereo- logical bridging resolution in the GNOME cor- pus <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . To address the data sparseness problem (e.g., some part-of relations are not covered by Word- Net), they used the Web to estimate the part-of relations expressed by certain syntactic construc- tions. Based on the method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Poesio et al. (2004)</ref>, Lassalle and Denis (2011) devel- oped a system that resolves mereological bridging anaphors in French. The system was enriched with meronymic information extracted from raw texts. Such information was extracted in a bootstrapping fashion by iteratively collecting meronymic pairs and the corresponding syntactic patterns. Lassalle and Denis (2011) evaluated their system on mere- ological bridging anaphors annotated in the DEDE corpus and reported an accuracy of 23%. proposed a joint inference framework for bridg- ing anaphora resolution using Markov logic net- works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Domingos and Lowd, 2009</ref>).

First, bridging anaphors are not limited to defi- nite NPs as in previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Poesio et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Poesio et al., , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lassalle and Denis, 2011</ref>). Also in IS- Notes, the semantic relations between anaphor and antecedent are not restricted to meronymic rela- tions. We therefore choose ISNotes to evalu- ate our algorithm for bridging anaphora resolu- tion. Our approach is deterministic and simple, but achieves the competitive results compared to the advanced machine learning-based approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al., 2013b</ref>). We also improve the result reported in Hou (2018) on the same corpus by combining our deterministic approach with the best system from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref>.</p><p>Just recently, two new corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rösiger, 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Poesio et al., 2018</ref>) with bridging annotations have become available and we notice that the defini- tions of bridging in these corpora are different from the bridging definition in ISNotes. We ap- ply our algorithm with small adaptations to select antecedents for bridging anaphors on these cor- pora. The moderate results demonstrate that em- beddings bridging is a general word representa- tion resource for bridging. anaphors and their antecedents. For instance, the prepositional structure in "the door of the house" indicates the part-of relation between "door" and "house". More specifically, for NPs containing the prepositional structure (e.g., X preposition Y) or the possessive structure (e.g., Y 's X), the au- thor extracts the noun pair "X PP-Y". Note that the head of the NP is always on the left and the noun modifier is always on the right. In addition, the suffix " PP" is added for the nouns on the left. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows a few examples of noun phrases to- gether with the extracted noun pairs. Hou <ref type="bibr">(2018)</ref> showed that the suffix " PP" plays an important role for the model to learn the asym- metric relations between the head nouns and their noun modifiers from the extracted noun pairs. For instance, among the top five nearest neighbors in embeddings PP, "president PP" is mostly related to countries or organizations (e.g., "federation", "republic", or "USA"), while "president" is mostly related to words which have the same semantic type as "president" (e.g., "minister", "mayor", or "governor").   both in GloVe and in embeddings PP, its vector in embeddings bridging is the concatenation of v1 w and v2 w . For the word w 1 which only ap- pears in GloVe, its vector in embeddings bridging is the concatenation of v1 w 1 and v f iller . Finally, for the word w 2 which only appears in embed- dings PP (all the words with the suffix " PP"), we construct its vector by concatenating v f iller and v2 w 2 . The resulting 200 dimension word em- beddings (embeddings bridging) is a general lex- ical resource for bridging. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> compares the main features between embeddings bridging and embeddings PP. In the next section, we will com- pare embeddings bridging with embeddings PP and the original GloVe on a few typical bridging relations in the task of measuring relational simi- larity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jurgens et al., 2012</ref>). Moreover, in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4, we show that using embed- dings bridging yields better results than using em- beddings PP for bridging anaphora resolution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Measuring Relational Similarity on Typical Bridging Relations</head><p>We evaluate our embeddings bridging quantita- tively using a few typical bridging relations from SemEval-2012 Task 2 (Jurgens et al., 2012). The shared task aims to rank word pairs by the degree to which they are prototypical members of a given relation class. For instance, given the prototyp- ical word pairs {wedding-bride, rodeo-cowboy, banquet-food} for the relation Event:Feature, we would like to know among the input word pairs {school-students, circus-clown, meal-food, lion- zoo}, which one represents the relation best.</p><p>SemEval-2012 Task 2 contains 79 relation classes chosen from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bejar et al. (1991)</ref>. These relations fall into ten main categories, including SIMILAR, PART-WHOLE, CONTRAST and more. Each relation class is paired with a few prototyp- ical word pairs and a list of around 40 word pairs which are ranked by humans according to their degree of similarity to the corresponding relation. We choose all typical bridging relations under the PART-WHOLE category and evaluate our embed- dings bridging in terms of ranking the list of word pairs for each relation. Spearman's rank correla- tion coefficient ρ is used to evaluate a system by comparing the system's ranking of the word pairs against the gold standard ranking.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zhila et al. (2013)</ref>, we calculate the relational similarity between word pairs using co- sine similarity. Let (w 1 , w 2 ) and (w 3 , w 4 ) be the two word pairs, v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 be the correspond- ing vectors for these words. We first normalize all word vectors to unit vectors, then the relational similarity between (w 1 , w 2 ) and (w 3 , w 4 ) is calcu- lated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(v1 − v2) · (v3 − v4) v1 − v2 v3 − v4<label>(1)</label></formula><p>For each chosen relation class, we rank the list of word pairs according to their mean relational similarity to the given prototypical word pairs. Ta- ble 3 shows the results of Spearman's rank correla- tion coefficient ρ for each typical bridging relation using embeddings bridging, embeddings PP, and GloVe, respectively. Note that when using embed- dings bridging and embeddings PP, we add the suffix " PP" to the potential bridging anaphor for <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: The cosine similarities between the bridging anaphor distribution arrangements and its antecedent can- didates for Example 1. dist h indicates the cosine similarity between {arrangements PP} and the candidate head, dist hm the cosine similarity between {distribution PP, arrangements PP} and Head+Modifiers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">A Deterministic Algorithm for Bridging Anaphora Resolution</head><p>In this section, we describe our deterministic al- gorithm based on embeddings bridging for bridg- ing anaphora resolution. For each anaphor a, we construct the list of antecedent candidates E a us- ing NPs preceding a from the same sentence as well as from the previous two sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref> found that globally salient entities are likely to be the antecedents of all anaphors in a text. We approximate this by adding NPs from the first sentence of the text to E a . This is motivated by the fact that ISNotes is a newswire corpus and globally salient entities are often introduced in the beginning of an article. We exclude an NP from E a if it is a bridging anaphor because a bridging anaphor is rarely to be an antecedent for another bridging anaphor. We also exclude NPs whose se- mantic types are "time" from E a if a is not a time expression. This is because time expressions are related to a lot of words in the corpus in which we learned embeddings bridging from. Therefore we only keep them as the antecedent candidates for bridging anaphors whose semantic types are "time" (see Example 2). Given an anaphor a and its antecedent candidate list E a , we predict the most semantically related NP among all NPs in E a as the antecedent for a. In case of a tie, the closest one is chosen to be the predicted antecedent.</p><p>The relatedness is measured via cosine sim- ilarity between the vector representation of the anaphor and the vector representation of the candi- date. More specifically, given a noun phrase np 1 , we first construct a list N which consists of the head and all common nouns (e.g., earthquake vic- tims), adjectives (e.g., economical sanctions), and ed/ing participles (e.g., the collapsed roadway and the landing site) appearing before the head. If np 1 contains a post-modifier NP np 2 via the preposi- tion "of", we also add the above premodifiers and the head of np 2 to the list N (e.g., the policies of racial segregation). Finally, the noun phrase np 1 is represented as a vector v using the following formula, where the suffix " PP" is added to each n if np 1 is a bridging anaphor and its semantic type is not time:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v = n∈N embeddings bridging n |N |<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The underlying intuition of adding NP modifi- cations to the list N is that the above mentioned modifiers also represent core semantics of an NP, therefore we should consider them when select- ing antecedents for bridging anaphors. For in- stance, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, for Example 1, the co- sine similarity between {arrangements PP} and {products} is 0.06, while the cosine similarity be- tween {distribution PP, arrangements PP} and {dialysis, products} is 0.17.</p><p>If none of the words in N is present in embed- dings bridging, we simply neglect the noun phrase np1. Note that we do not add the suffix " PP" to a bridging anaphor representing time information, because such an anaphor is likely to have the same semantic type antecedent (see Example 2). There- fore we use semantic similarity instead of related- ness to find its antecedent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Dataset</head><p>For the task of bridging anaphora resolution, we use the dataset ISNotes 5 released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Markert et al. (2012)</ref>. This dataset contains around 11,000 NPs annotated for information status including 663 bridging NPs and their antecedents in 50 texts taken from the WSJ portion of the OntoNotes cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Weischedel et al., 2011</ref>). As stated in Sec- tion 2, bridging anaphors in ISNotes are not lim- ited to definite NPs as in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Poesio et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Poesio et al., , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lassalle and Denis, 2011)</ref>. The semantic relations between anaphor and an- tecedent in the corpus are quite diverse: only 14% of anaphors have a part-of/attribute-of rela- tion with the antecedent and only 7% of anaphors stand in a set relationship to the antecedent. 79% of anaphors have "other" relation with their an- tecedents. This includes encyclopedic or frame relations such as restaurant -the waiter as well as context-specific relations such as palms -the thieves. In Example 1, "dialysis products" is the "theme" of the distribution arrangements. More specifically, "dialysis products" belongs to the frame element "Individuals" in the "Dispersal" frame that is triggered by "distribution arrange- ments".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experimental Setup</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref>'s experimental setup, we resolve bridging anaphors to entity an- tecedents. Entity information is based on the OntoNotes coreference annotation. We also use the OntoNotes named entity annotation to assign NPs the semantic type "time" if their entity types are "date" or "time".</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref>, features are extracted by using entity information. For instance, the raw hit counts of the preposition pattern query (e.g., arrangements of products) for a bridging anaphor a and its antecedent candidate e is the maximum count among all instantiations of e. In our experiments, we simply extend the list of an- tecedent candidates E a (described in Section 4) to include all instantiations of the original enti- ties in E a . Note that our simple antecedent can- didate selection strategy (described in Section 4) allows us to include 76% of NP antecedents com- pared to 77% in pairwise model III from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref> where they add top 10% salient en- tities as additional antecedent candidates. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref>, salient entities on each text are mea- sured through the lengths of the coreference chains based on the gold coreference annotation.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al.

We calculate how many bridging anaphors are correctly resolved among all bridging anaphors.</p></div>

The relat- edness is measured via cosine similarity between the head of the anaphor (plus the postfix " PP" if the anaphor is not a time expression) and the head of the candidate. We run experiments on the following four word embeddings: the original GloVe vectors trained on Gigaword and Wikipedia 2014 dump (GloVe GigaWiki14), GloVe vectors that we trained on Gigaword only (GloVe Giga), word vectors from Hou (2018) (embeddings PP), and our word representation resource described in Section 3.2 (embeddings bridging). Note that for the first two word vectors, we do not add the suffix " PP" to the anaphor's head since such words do not exist in GloVe GigaWiki14 and GloVe Giga. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> lists the results for bridging anaphora resolution based on different word representa- tion resources <ref type="bibr">7</ref> .

This suggests that in the future we should include more context for bridging anaphors that hold the set-of relation to their antecedents, because the head nouns of such anaphors often do not bear any specific meanings (e.g., Another).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Analysis of Modifiers</head><p>To better understand the role of NP modifiers in our method, we carried out experiments on em- beddings bridging using different set of modifiers (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 7</ref>). It seems that among all three types of modifiers, compared to using NP head alone, adding noun modifiers has the positive im- pact (36.65% on NP head + noun modifiers vs. 34.84% on NP head). Although adding only ad-  jective modifiers does not have influence on re- sults, combining them with noun modifiers yields some improvement over adding only noun modi- fiers (38.31% on NP head + noun&amp;adjective mod- ifiers vs. 36.65% on NP head + noun modifiers). On the other hand, ed/ing participle modifiers only have a small positive impact over NP head + noun modifiers when combining with noun modifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Combining NP Head + Modifiers with MLN II</head><p>For bridging anaphora resolution, Hou (2018) in- tegrates a much simpler deterministic approach by combining an NP head with its noun modi- fiers (appearing before the head) based on em- beddings PP into the MLN II system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al., 2013b</ref>). Similarly, we add a constraint on top of MLN II using our deterministic approach (NP head + modifiers) based on embeddings bridging. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 8</ref> lists the results of different systems 8 for bridging anaphora resolution in ISNotes. It shows that combining our deterministic approach (NP Head + modifiers) with MLN II slightly improves the result compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hou (2018)</ref>. Although combining NP Head + modifiers with MLN II achieves significant improvement over NP Head + modifiers, we think the latter has its own value. Our deterministic algorithm is simpler and more efficient compared to MLN model II + em- 8 We also reimplement the algorithms from Schulte im <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Walde (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Poesio et al.

Moreover, our algorithm is "unsupervised" and requires no training when applied to other English bridging corpora.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Resolving Bridging Anaphors in Other Corpora</head><p>Recently, two new corpora containing bridging an- notation have become available. The BASHI cor- pus (Rösiger, 2018a) contains 459 bridging NPs and their antecedents in 50 World Street Jour- nal articles. Similar to ISNotes, BASHI includes both definite and indefinite referential bridging anaphors. In addition, comparative anaphora is also considered as bridging anaphora in BASHI.</p><p>Another new corpus for bridging is the sec- ond release of the ARRAU corpus, which con- tains 5,512 bridging pairs in three different do- mains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Poesio et al., 2018)</ref>. However, most bridg- ing links in ARRAU are purely lexical bridging pairs, and only a small subset of the annotated pairs contains truly anaphoric bridging anaphors <ref type="bibr">(Rösiger et al., 2018)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr">Rösiger et al. (2018)</ref>, we focus on resolving bridging anaphors in the news text domain (RST).</p><p>Based on embeddings bridging, we apply our deterministic algorithm with small adaptations to resolve bridging anaphors to entity antecedents on the BASHI and ARRAU (RST) corpora. Specifi- cally, for the BASHI corpus, we do not add NPs from the first sentence to the list of antecedent candidates E a . This is because the phenomenon of globally salient antecedents being linked to all anaphors in a text is less obvious in BASHI. In ad- dition, comparative anaphors often have the same semantic class as their antecedents, therefore we do not add the suffix " PP" to a bridging anaphor if it is a comparative anaphor.</p><p>For the ARRAU corpus, we construct the list of antecedent candidates E a using NPs preceding a from the same sentence as well as from the pre- vious ten sentences. Since most bridging pairs in ARRAU are lexical bridging (e.g., Tokyo -Japan, other nations -Britain) and anaphors often have the same semantic type as their antecedents, we do not add the suffix " PP" to bridging anaphors. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 9</ref> lists the results of bridging anaphora resolution in the BASHI and ARRAU corpora, respectively. On the test set of the ARRAU (RST) corpus, Rösiger (2018b) proposed a modi-</p></div>

Overall, the reasonable per- formance on these two corpora demonstrates that embeddings bridging is a general word represen- tation resource for bridging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We improve the word representation resource em- beddings PP (Hou, 2018) by combining it with GloVe. The resulting word embeddings (embed- dings bridging) are a more general word repre- sentation resource for bridging. Based on em- beddings bridging, we propose a deterministic approach for choosing antecedents for bridging anaphors. We show that this simple and effi- cient method achieves the competitive result on bridging anaphora resolution compared to the ad- vanced machine learning-based approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref> which is heavily dependent on a lot of carefully designed complex features. We also demonstrate that using embeddings bridging yields better results than using embeddings PP for bridging anaphora resolution. For the task of bridging anaphora resolution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hou et al. (2013b)</ref> pointed out that considering only head noun knowledge is not enough and fu- ture work needs to explore wider context to re- solve context-specific bridging relations. In this work we explore the context within NPs-that is, we combine the semantics of certain modifica- tions and the head by vector average using em- beddings bridging. But in some cases, knowledge about NPs themselves is not enough for resolv- ing bridging. For instance, in Example 3, know- ing that any loosening has the ability to "rekindle inflation" from the context of the second sentence can help us to find its antecedent "the high rates" (which is used to against inflation).</p><p>(3) Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation, which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987. Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle in- flation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies.</p><p>In the future, we will study how to integrate context outside of NPs for the task of choosing an- tencedents for bridging anaphors. Also we hope that our word representation resource will facil- itate other related research problems such as se- mantic role labeling.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Markert et al.
