				<p>Languages that have no explicit word de-limiters often have to be segmented for statistical machine translation (SMT). This is commonly performed by automated seg-menters trained on manually annotated corpora. However, the word segmentation (WS) schemes of these annotated corpora are handcrafted for general usage, and may not be suitable for SMT. An analysis was performed to test this hypothesis using a manually annotated word alignment (WA) corpus for Chinese-English SMT. An analysis revealed that 74.60% of the sentences in the WA corpus if segmented using an automated segmenter trained on the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) will contain conflicts with the gold WA annotations. We formulated an approach based on word splitting with reference to the annotated WA to alleviate these conflicts. Experimental results show that the refined WS reduced word alignment error rate by 6.82% and achieved the highest BLEU improvement (0.63 on average) on the Chinese-English open machine translation (OpenMT) corpora compared to related work.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Word segmentation is a prerequisite for many natural language processing (NLP) applications on those languages that have no explicit space between words, such as Arabic, Chinese and Japanese. As the first processing step, WS affects all successive steps, thus it has a large potential impact on the final performance. For SMT, the unsupervised WA, building translation models and reordering models, and decoding are all based on segmented words. Automated word segmenters built through supervised-learning methods, after decades of in- tensive research, have emerged as effective so- lutions to WS tasks and become widely used in many NLP applications. For example, the Stan- ford word segmenter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xue et al., 2002</ref>) 1 which is based on conditional random field (CRF) is em- ployed to prepare the official corpus for NTCIR- 9 Chinese-English patent translation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Goto et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>However, one problem with applying these supervised-learning word segmenters to SMT is that the WS scheme of annotating the training cor- pus may not be optimal for SMT. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chang et al., 2008)</ref> noticed that the words in CTB are often too long for SMT. For example, a full Chinese per- sonal name which consists of a family name and a given name is always taken as a single word, but its counterpart in English is usually two words.</p><p>Manually WA corpora are precious resources for SMT research, but they used to be only avail- able in small volumes due to the production cost. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Och and Ney, 2000</ref>) initially an- notated 447 English-French sentence pairs, which later became the test data set in ACL 2003 shared task on word alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003)</ref>, and was used frequently thereafter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Liang et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">DeNero and Klein, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Haghighi et al., 2009)</ref> For Chinese and English, the shortage of man- ually WA corpora has recently been relieved by the linguistic data consortium (LDC) 2 GALE Chinese-English word alignment and tag- ging training corpus (the GALE WA corpus) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The corpus is considerably large, containing 4,735 documents, 18,507 sentence pairs, 620,189 Chi- nese tokens, 518,137 English words, and 421,763 alignment annotations. The corpus carries no Chi- nese WS annotation, and the WA annotation was performed between Chinese characters and En- glish words. The alignment identifies minimum translation units and relations <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , referred as atomic blocks and atomic edges, respectively, in this pa- per. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an example that contains six atomic edges.</p><p>Visual inspection of the segmentation of an au- tomatic segmenter with reference to a WA cor- pus revealed a number of inconsistencies. For ex- ample, consider the word "bao fa" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Empirically we observed that this word is seg- mented as a single token by an automatic seg- menter trained on the CTB, however, this segmen- tation differs with the alignment in the WA cor- pus, since its two components are aligned to two different English words. Our hypothesis was that the removal of these inconsistencies would benefit machine translation performance (this is explained further in Section 2.3), and we explored this idea in this work.</p><p>This paper focuses on optimizing Chinese WS for Chinese-English SMT, but both the research method and the proposed solution are language- independent. They can be applied to other lan- guage pairs.</p><p>The major contributions of this paper include,</p><p>• analyze the CTB WS scheme for Chinese- English SMT;</p><p>• propose a lexical word splitter to refine the WS;</p><p>• achieve a BLEU improvement over a baseline Stanford word segmenter, and a state-of-the- art extension, on Chinese-English OpenMT corpora.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: first, Section 2 analyzes WS using a WA corpus; next, Section 3 proposes a lexical word splitter to refine WS; then, Section 4 evaluates the pro- posed method on end-to-end SMT as well as word segmentation and alignment; after that, Section 5 compares this work to related work; finally, Sec- tion 6 concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Analysis of a General-purpose Automatic Word Segmenter</head><p>This section first briefly describes the GALE WA corpus, then presents an analysis of the WS arising from a CTB-standard word segmenter with refer- ence to the segmentation of the atomic blocks in the GALE WA corpus, finally the impact of the findings on SMT is discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">GALE WA corpus</head><p>The GALE WA corpus was developed by the LDC, and was used as training data in the DARPA GALE global autonomous language exploitation program <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . The corpus incorporates linguistic knowledge into word aligned text to help improve automatic WA and translation quality. It em- ploys two annotation schemes: alignment and tag- ging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al., 2010)</ref>. Alignment identifies min- imum translation units and translation relations; tagging adds contextual, syntactic and language- specific features to the alignment annotation. For example, the sample shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> carries tags on both alignment edges and tokens. The GALE WA corpus contains 18,057 man- ually word aligned Chinese and English parallel sentences which are extracted from newswire and web blogs. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the statistics on the corpus. One third of the sentences are approxi- mately newswire text, and the remainder consists of web blogs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Analysis of WS</head><p>In order to produce a Chinese word segmenta- tion consistent with the CTB standard we used the Stanford Chinese word segmenter with a model trained on the CTB corpus. We will refer to this as the 'CTB segmenter' in the rest of this paper.</p><p>The Chinese sentences in the GALE WA cor- pus were first segmented by the CTB segmenter, and the predicted words were compared against the atomic blocks with respect to the granularity of segmentation. The analysis falls into the following three categories, two of which may be potentially harmful to SMT:</p><p>• Fully consistent: the word locates within the block of one atomic alignment edge. For ex- ample, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(a), the Chinese text has  four atomic blocks; the CTB segmenter pro- duces five words which all locate within the blocks, so they are all small enough.</p><p>• Alignment inconsistent: the word aligns to more than one atomic block, but the target expression is contiguous, allowing for cor- rect phrase pair extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zens et al., 2002</ref>). For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(b), the characters in the word "shuang fang", which is produced by the CTB segmenter, contains two atomic blocks, but the span of the target "to both side" is continuous, therefore the phrase pair "shuang fang ||| to both sides" can be ex- tracted.</p><p>• Alignment inconsistent and extraction hin- dered: the word aligned to more than one atomic block, and the target expression is not contiguous, which hinders correct phrase pair extractions. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(c), the word "zeng chan" has to be split in order to match the target language. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the statistics of the three cat- egories of CTB WS on the GALE WA corpus. 90.74% of the words are fully consistent, while the remaining 9.26% of the words have inconsistent alignments. 74.60% of the sentences contain this problem. The category with inconsistent align- ment and extraction hindered only accounts for 0.46% of the words, affecting 9.06% of the sen- tences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Impact of WS on SMT</head><p>The word alignment has a direct impact on the na- ture of both the translation model, and lexical re- ordering model in a phrase-base SMT system. The words in last two categories are all longer than an atomic block, which might lead to problems in the word alignment in two ways:</p><p>• First, longer words tend to be more sparse in the training corpus, thus the estimated distri- bution of their target phrases are less accu- rate.</p><p>• Second, the alignment from them to target sides are one-to-many, which is much more complicated and requires fertilized alignment models such as IBM model 4 -6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Och and Ney, 2000</ref>).</p><p>The words in the category of "fully consistent" can be aligned using simple models, because the alignment from them to the target side are one-to- one or many-to-one, and simple alignment models such as IBM model 1, IBM model 2 and HMM model are sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Och and Ney, 2000</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Refining the Word Segmentation</head><p>In the last subsection, it was shown that 74.60% of parallel sentences were affected by issues related to under-segmentation of the corpus. Our hypoth- esis is that if these words are split into pieces that match English words, the accuracy of the unsuper- vised WA as well as the translation quality will be improved. To achieve this, we adopt a splitting Arrows represent the alignment of atomic blocks. Note that "shuang fang" and "zeng chan" are words produced by the CTB segmenter, but consist of two atomic blocks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Word splitting task</head><p>The word splitting task is formalized as a sequence labeling task as follows: each word (represented by a sequence of characters x = x 1 . . . x T where T is the length of sample) produced by the CTB segmenter is a sample, and a corresponding se- quence of binary boundary labels y = y 1 . . . y T is the learning target,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y t =    1</formula><p>if there is a split point between c t and c t−1 ; 0 otherwise.</p><p>(1)</p><p>The sequence of boundary labels is derived from the gold WA annotation as follows: for a sequence of two atomic blocks, where the first character of the second block is x t , then the la- Each word sample may have no split point, one split point or multiple split points, depending on the gold WA annotation. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the statis- tics of the word splitting data set which is built from the GALE manual WA corpus and the CTB segmenter's output, where 2000 randomly sam- pled sentences are taken as a held-out test set. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">points per sample  Train.  16,057  348,086  32,337  0.0929  Test  2,000  43,910</ref> 3,929 0.0895 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Data set for learning the word splitting</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">CRF approach</head><p>This paper employs a condition random field (CRF) to solve this sequence labeling task <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Lafferty et al., 2001)</ref>. A linear-chain CRF defines the conditional probability of y given x as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P Λ (y|x) = 1 Z x ( T t=1 k λ k f k (y t−1 , y t , x, t)),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Λ = {λ 1 , . . .} are parameters, Z x is a per- input normalization that makes the probability of all state sequences sum to one; f k (y t−1 , y t , x, t) is a feature function which is often a binary-valued sparse feature. The training of CRF model is to maximize the likelihood of training data together with a regularization penalty to avoid over-fitting as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Peng et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peng and McCallum, 2006</ref>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Λ * = argmax Λ ( i logP Λ (y i |x i ) − k λ 2 k 2δ 2 k ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where (x,y) are training samples; the hyperparam- eter δ k can be understood as the variance of the prior distribution of λ k . When predicting the la- bels of test samples, the CRF decoder searches for the optimal label sequence y * that maximizes the conditional probability,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y * = argmax y P Λ (y|x).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In (Chang et al., 2008) a method is proposed to select an appropriate level of segmentation gran- ularity (in practical terms, to encourage smaller segments). We call their method "length tuner". The following artificial feature is introduced into the learned CRF model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f 0 (x, y t−1 , y t , 1) = 1 if y t = +1 0 otherwise<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The weight λ 0 of this feature is set by hand to bias the output of CRF model. By way of expla- nation, a very large positive λ 0 will cause every character to be segmented, or conversely a very large negative λ 0 will inhibit the output of segmen- tation boundaries. In their experiments, λ 0 = 2 was used to force a CRF segmenter to adopt an in- termediate granularity between character and the CTB WS scheme. Compared to the length tuner, our proposed method exploits lexical knowledge about word splitting, and we will therefore refer to it as the "lexical word splitter" or "lexical splitter" for short.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Feature Set</head><p>The features f k (y t−1 , y t , x, t) we used include the WS features from the Chinese Stanford word seg- menter and a set of extended features described below. The WS features are included because the target split points may share some common char- acteristics with the boundaries in the CTB WS scheme.</p><p>The extended features consists of four types - named entities, word frequency, word length and character-level unsupervised WA. For each type of the feature, the value and value concatenated with previous or current character are taken as sparse features (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> for details). The real val- ues of word frequency, word length and character- level unsupervised WA are converted into sparse features due to the routine of CRF model. The character-level unsupervised alignment feature is inspired by the related works of unsu- pervised bilingual WS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chung and Gildea, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nguyen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Michael et al., 2011</ref>). The idea is that the character-level WA can approximately capture the counterpart English ex- pression of each Chinese token, and source tokens aligned to different target expressions should be split into different words (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> for an illus- tration).</p><p>The values of the character-level alignment fea- tures are obtained through building a dictionary. First, unsupervised WA is performed on the SMT training corpus where the Chinese sentences are treated as sequences of characters; then, the Chi- nese sentences are segmented by CTB segmenter and a dictionary of segmented words are built; fi- nally, for each word in the dictionary, the relative frequency of being split at a certain position is cal-</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In the last section we found that 9.26% of words produced by the CTB segmenter have the poten- tial to cause problems for SMT, and propose a lexical word splitter to address this issue through segmentation refinement. This section contains experiments designed to empirically evaluate the proposed lexical word splitter in three aspects: first, whether the WS accuracy is improved; sec- ond, whether the accuracy of the unsupervised WA during training SMT systems is improved; third, whether the end-to-end translation quality is im- proved. This section first describes the experimental methodology, then presents the experimental re- sults, and finally illustrates the operation of our proposed method using a real example.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Experimental Corpora</head><p>The GALE manual WA corpus and the Chinese to English corpus from the shared task of the NIST open machine translation (OpenMT) 2006 evalua- tion 6 were employed as the experimental corpus ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5)</ref>.</p><p>The experimental corpus for WS was con- structed by first segmenting 2000 held out sen- tences from the GALE manual WA corpus with the Stanford segmenter, and then refining the seg- mentation with the gold alignment annotation. For example, the gold segmentation for the examples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Note that this test corpus is intended to represent an oracle segmentation for our proposed method, and serves primarily to gauge the improvement of our method over the baseline Stanford segmenter, relative to an upper bound.  The experimental corpus for unsupervised WA was the union set of the NIST OpenMT training set and the 2000 test sentence pairs from GALE WA corpus. We removed the United Nations cor- pus from the NIST OpenMT constraint training re- sources because it is out of domain.</p><p>The main result of this paper is the evaluation of the end-to-end performance of an SMT sys- tem. The experimental corpus for this task was the NIST OpenMT corpus. The data set of the NIST evaluation 2002 was used as a development set for MERT tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Och, 2003)</ref>, and the remain- ing data sets of the NIST evaluation from 2003 to 2006 were used as test sets. The English sentences were tokenized by Stanford toolkit 7 and converted to lowercase.</p></div>

Each experiment was performed three times, and the average BLEU and standard derivation were calculated, because there is randomness in the results from MERT. The proposed lexical splitter outperformed the two baselines on all the test sets, and achieves an average improvement of 0.63 BLEU percentage points, indicating that the proposed method can effectively improve the translation quality. The length tuner also outperforms the CTB segmenter, but the average improvement is 0.15 BLEU per- centage points, much less than the proposed meth- ods. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> presents an example from the test cor- pus, which demonstrates how the proposed lexical splitter splits words more accurately than the base- line length tuner method. Two words in the seg- mentation result of the CTB segmenter are wor- thy of attention. The first one is "yang nian"(the year of goat), the lexical splitter split this word and got the right translation, while the length tuner did not split it. The second is "rong jing"(booming or prosperity), the length tuner split this word, which resulted in wrong translations, while the lexical splitter avoided this mistake.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Comparison to Related Work</head><p>The most similar work in the literature to the pro- posed method is the the length tuner method pro- posed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chang et al., 2008)</ref>. This method also encourages the generation of more words during segmentation by using a single parameter that can be use to control segment length. Our method dif- fers from theirs in that it is able to acquire vocabu- lary knowledge from word alignments that can be used to more accurately split words into segments suitable for machine translation.</p><p>There is large volume of research using bilin- gual unsupervised and semi-supervised WS to ad- dress the problem of optimizing WS for SMT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chung and Gildea, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nguyen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Michael et al., 2011</ref>). The main differ- ence with our approach is that they use automatic WA results, most often obtained using the same tools as are used in training SMT systems. One of the main problems of using unsupervised WA is that it is noisy, and therefore, employing iterative optimization methods to refine the results of unsu- pervised WA is a key issue in their research, for example boosting <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ma and Way, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Michael et al., 2011</ref>), expectation maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chung and Gildea, 2009</ref>), Bayesian sampling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nguyen et al., 2010)</ref>, or heuristic search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zhao et al., 2013)</ref>. Nevertheless, noisy WA makes both analyzing WS and improving SMT quality quite hard. In contrast, by using manual WA, we can clearly analyze the segmentation problems (Sec- tion 2), and train supervised models to solve the problem (Section 3).</p><p>As far as we are aware, among related work on WS, our method achieves the highest BLEU improvement relative to the start-of-the-art WS - the Stanford Chinese word segmenter -on the Chinese-English OpenMT corpora. The meth- ods proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ma and Way, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chung and Gildea, 2009</ref>) fail to outperform the Stan- ford Chinese word segmenter on Chinese-English OpenMT corpora. The length tuner method pro- posed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chang et al., 2008</ref>) is less effective to ours according to the experimental results in this paper.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>This paper is concerned with the role of word segmentation in Chinese-to-English SMT. We ex- plored the use of a manually annotated word align- ment corpus to refine word segmentation for ma- chine translation. Based on an initial finding that 74.60% of running sentences in the WA corpus have segmentation inconsistent with a gold WA annotation, we proposed a supervised lexical re- segmentation model to modify the WS in order to relieve these issues.</p><p>Our main experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of improving both alignment quality and end-to-end translation qual- ity. The proposed method achieved the highest BLEU score relative to a number of respectable baseline systems that included the Stanford word segmenter, and an improved Stanford word seg- menter that could be tuned for segment length. No language-specific techniques other than a manu- ally aligned corpus were employed in this paper, thus the approach can applied to other SMT lan- guage pairs that require WS.</p><p>In the future, we plan to explore combining multiple source words which are aligned to the same target words. This is the symmetric topic of the post word splitting which is studied in this paper. The effect of this word combination oper-ation on SMT is non-trivial. On one hand, it can reduce the ambiguity in the source side. On the other hand, it may cause sparseness problems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example from the GALE WA corpus.
