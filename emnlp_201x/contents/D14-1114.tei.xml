				<p>Knowledge graphs are recently used for enriching query representations in an entity-aware way for the rich facts organized around entities in it. However , few of the methods pay attention to nonentity words and clicked websites in queries, which also help conveying user intent. In this paper, we tackle the problem of intent understanding with innovatively representing entity words, refiners and clicked urls as intent topics in a unified knowledge graph based framework, in a way to exploit and expand knowledge graph which we call &apos;tailor&apos;. We collaboratively exploit global knowledge in knowledge graphs and local contexts in query log to initialize intent representation , then propagate the enriched features in a graph consisting of intent topics using an unsupervised algorithm. The experiments prove intent topics with knowledge graph enriched features significantly enhance intent understanding.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Query understanding is the process of generating a representation which characterizes a user's search intent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Croft et al., 2010)</ref>, which is of vital im- portance for information retrieval. However, users are remarkably laconic in describing their infor- mation needs due to anomalous state of knowledge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Belkin et al., 1982)</ref>, resulting in vague and under- specified queries, which makes it especially dif- ficult to understand and locate what they intended for in mountains of web data. The problem is often significantly compounded that people convey their intent rather in a series of behaviors called a search session than a single query, leaving a wealth of clues including query reformulations, page visits, dwell times, etc. What's more, as entities are tak- ing center stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yin and Shah, 2010</ref>), string-level or phrase-level modeling of intent soon hits the bottleneck, calling for an entity-aware perspective.</p><p>Knowledge repositories, better known as knowledge graphs, such as Wikipedia, DBpedia and Freebase, have been recently utilized for en- hancing query understanding for the large amounts of world knowledge they've harvested about en- tities and facts. A widely accepted way to use knowledge graph is tying queries with it by anno- tating entities in them, also known as entity link- ing.</p><p>However, information need is conveyed through more than entities. Quite a few non-entity words, aka refiners or modifiers, as well as many urls are barely included in knowledge graph, while they play an irreplaceable role in intent understand- ing. For example, a user may query toyota, volvo or just enter car soup, cars for sale and click www.carsoup.com, which should be encoded in a form that we could perceive their closeness in intent. That's why at-a-glance info cards about merely recognized entity in the query are far from enough and previous methods disregarding refin- ers and urls are too limited to cover queries in ma- jority.</p><p>We move one step further to tailor knowledge graph for representing more than entity words. We collect refiners and clicked urls along with en- tity words and model intents they represent us- ing knowledge graph based features. We use Freebase <ref type="bibr">1</ref> , one of the largest available knowledge graph, in our work and our method can be easily generalized to other knowledge repositories.</p><p>We put up an idea of intent topic which can be query words or urls, whether mean an entity or not, representing an atomic information need. We identify them with intent features by exploit- ing global knowledge in Freebase and local con-texts in query sessions. Notice the new concept here is distinguished from query intent or query facet in previous literature for it is in a holistic view, not specifically meaning subtopics around a certain query.</p><p>Our intuitive observations as follows inspire us to represent intent features with topics and do- mains in knowledge graph and propagate the en- riched features in the intent topic graph. 1) Query words and urls within the same session tend to indicate the same query intent. 2) Intent topics sharing similar query intent often relate to similar topics in knowledge graph. 3) Knowledge graph domains sketch the query in- tent briefly. Observation 1 indicates domain coherency within sessions is a good starting point to gener- ate intent features, along with Observation 2 and 3 lay the basis of proximity that the propagation rely on.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, we're the first to represent intent behind entity words, refiners and urls in a unified knowledge graph based frame- work, in a way to exploit and expand knowledge graph which we call 'tailor'.</p><p>Our contributions include:</p><p>• An innovative and unified framework to rep- resent intent topics, whether they can directly link to an entity in knowledge graph or not.</p><p>• A novel algorithm to generate a specified in- tent topic graph, which enables learning in- tent features in an unsupervised propagation method.</p><p>• With intent topic graph we can better under- stand user intent conducting session-based contextualization and potentially find highly- related intent topic. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec- tion 2 tells our methods to map queries to Freebase and initialize intent features. Section 3 is about how we model intent topics in a unified graph and the propagation framework to learn intent features.</p><p>We provide experiments and analysis in Section 4. Related work and conclusions are presented at the end of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Labeling intent topic nodes with</head><p>Freebase-enriched features</p><p>In Freebase, facts around a certain topic and multi- faceted intents they reflect is more like a global domain distribution, what facet do users exactly intend for is difficult to locate until in a specified context, namely a query session. We take a line in query log as a query, exhibit- ing an interaction with the search engine, includ- ing query words and page clicks. And a sequence of queries with a certain time interval constitute a session, completely conveying an information need.</p><p>In existing knowledge graph, only a small part of urls are contained in views of web pages be- yond number online. Even for query words, we can merely get access to some of them, which we call entity words and the rest refiners. To avoid misunderstanding, the url intent topics in the fol- lowing will specially refer to the clicks without di- rectly matched concepts in knowledge graph, oth- erwise they'll be taken as entity intent topic.</p><p>In this section, we propose a framework of knowledge graph enriched representation of in- tent topics, the following propagation in Section3 bases on it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Freebase as a knowledge graph</head><p>Freebase has over 39 million concepts, aka top- ics, about real-world entities like people, places and things stored as nodes in a graph. They're linked to each other with annotated egdes named as property. These edges actually represent facts. There are over a billion such facts or relations that make up the graph and they're all available for free. Properties are grouped into types, types are grouped into domains, which gives a broad view of knowledge in addtion to specific topics.</p><p>We can tap into Freebase through dump data or API 2 . In our work, we retrieve related Freebase topics with relevance scores for entity words via Freebase search API, which is based on combina- tion of topic's inbound and outbound link counts in Freebase and Wikipedia as well as a popularity score computed by Google, and all the facts about a given topic through Freebase topic API. We use</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T = {t 1 , t 2 , ...t n }, D = {d 1 , d 2 , ...d n } to denote</formula><p>all Freebase topics and domains used in our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Enriching entities and queries with Freebase</head><p>We represent a query's candidate intent topics by three sets, E q , R q , C q , where E q includes entity words and clicks which have equivalents in Free- base, R q the refiner words and C q the rest clicks.</p><p>Global knowledge in Freebase can directly enrich each e in E q with Freebase topics represented in vector t e , for each candidate topic there's a Free- base domain distribution vector d t . As for the rest in R q and C q , they can learn features in later prop- agation process. For any topic t i in t e , the relevance of entity words e and knowledge graph topic t i is estimated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t e i = RelevanceScore(e, t i ) max t j ∈T RelevanceScore(e, t j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>And the domain vector d t i for t i is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d t i j = pr(d j |t i ) d k ∈D pr(d k |t i ) (2) pr(d j |t i ) = # of links of t i in domain d j # of all links in domain d j (3)</formula><p>Then we'll get a knowledge graph enriched in- tent description of the query by combining that of e, r, c.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t q i = e∈Eq t e i w q (e) + r∈Rq t r i w q (r) + c∈Cq t c i w q (c) (4) w q (e) = N Count q (e)ϕ(e)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Here t e t r t c correspond to the topic vector of each entity, refiner and click respectively. The weight indicates how dominant it is in conveying intent in the query. It is in proportion to the normalized count as well as each occurrence's quality denoted by ϕ(e). Such as for entity words in Equation (5), the quality ϕ(e) can be estimated with the help of entity linking methods, which describes the proba- bility of e as a candidate reference. That for clicks and refiners will be explained later. The query's domain feature can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d q i = t j ∈T d t j i t q j d k ∈D t j ∈T d t j k t q j (6)</formula><p>It describes the probability of query q in domain d i , in which t q j can be calculated by Equation (4) and d t j i via facts around topic t j by Equation (2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Contextualized intent depiction of sessions</head><p>The aforesaid enriched features we get about queries rely heavily on global knowledge in Free- base, reflecting prior distribution in the feature space. In this part, we derive a contextualized de- scription of session intent in a local view by aggre- gating all the global knowledge we get about the session's queries. The ambiguity of a single query can be alleviated by looking at the dominant do- main within the session. The intent features t s and d s of session s can be represented by computations on its query set Q s = {q 1 , q 2 , ...q n } with time-order decay.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">t s i = q∈Qs t q i α rank(q) t j ∈T q∈Qs t q j α rank(q)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where we put an exponential decay controlled by decay factor α. We get domain feature the same way as Equation <ref type="formula">(6)</ref>. We'll put up an unsupervised method of learn- ing knowledge graph based intent representation of refiners and clicks in the following part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Propagating intent features in the intent topic graph</head><p>In this section, our idea is to characterize entities, refiners and urls uniformly as intent topics, tailor- ing knowledge graph to intent topic graph so as to enrich representations by propagation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Modeling intent topic graph</head><p>As in last section, with d s featuring the context, candidate intent topics in sessions can make intent topic nodes now. We use the concept intent topic to stress words with local contexts tell a specified information need, thus making a node. Taking en- tity word fl as an example, it can be recognized as the topic Florida in Freebase, while the intent behind it can hardly be mapped to a single intent topic, such as travel domain in hollywood fl, ed- ucation domain in community college in florida, and florida department of health actually convey intent in government domain. So each intent topic node is identified with its name string and Freebase-enriched intent features t and d. They're directly linked by co-occurring in the same line in the query log and implicitly related via intent features similarities, so that con- stitute a large graph G =&lt; V, E, W &gt;, where ∀w ∈ W denotes an explicit edge weight and ∀v ∈ V an intent topic. With intent topics and their relations modeled in a graph, we can better understand the query space so as to find the in- tended query faster. We realize it by aggregating massive sessions.</p><p>The implicit intent similarity ISim of any node pair n and v can be encoded as follows.</p><p>ISim n,v = βSSim n,v + γDSim n,v + ηT Sim n,v (8) where SSim denotes the names' string similar- ity, DSim the similarity of their domain feature and T Sim the topic vector similarity, with β, γ and η controlling the weight. The parameters may vary due to different scenarios. We just provide a framework of modeling nodes' intent features, which actually mirror their proximity in query in- tent.</p><p>To put it in more details, we use jaccard sim- ilarity for name shinglings and cosine similarity for domain and topic vector. As query log in- duced intent topic graph is of considerable large size, the pair-wise similarity is computationally prohibitive, hence we use Local Sensitive Hash <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Indyk and Motwani, 1998</ref>) for each similarity metric so as to compute ISim just in candidate set. We use random hyperplane based hash fam- ily proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Charikar, 2002</ref>) and set the hash code dimension and hash table numbers empiri- cally to ensure the number of nodes falling into each bucket is relatively stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Merging nodes</head><p>Although our idea of specifying intent topics by context better models the multi-facets of queries, it obviously also brings a sparse issue. For exam- ple, in one session user query beep lyrics and click www.lyricsandsongs.com, lyrics is tagged with the song beep and the musician Pussycat Dolls, in an- other scenario lyrics occurs with the song what you know and url www.dapslyrics.com, intents be- hind these two nodes are so similar that they should come into one, otherwise connections be- tween the two intent-coherent urls may be lost.</p><p>To avoid that, we conduct a merge process to integrate nodes with exactly the same names and contexts into one, combing linked nodes and intent features together.</p><p>For a set of nearly duplicate nodes ω the cal- culation of new node's features can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ˆ t = u∈ω t u |ω|<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">ˆ d = u∈ω d u |ω|<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In other words, we gather candidate nodes re- trieved by LSH and then calculate ISim for them with η setting to 0. Only node pairs with ISim higher than a merge threshold θ can be seen as duplicates. The merge process is summarized in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1: Merging similar nodes</head><p>Input:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">G =&lt; V, E, W &gt;, β, γ, η, θ Output: ˆ G =&lt;ˆV=&lt;ˆ =&lt;ˆV , ˆ E, ˆ W &gt; begin Initialize Ω ← ∅ for v ∈ V do Find dupset ω v with ISim β,γ,η if ∃u ∈ V, ω u ∈ Ω and ω v ∩ ω u = ∅ then ω v ← ω v ∪ ω u Remove ω u from Ω Add ω v to Ω for ω ∈ Ω do</formula><p>Merge nodes in ω into new nodê v Update G with replacing nodes in ω withˆvwithˆ withˆv</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Label propagation</head><p>We utilize knowledge graph induced intent fea- tures instead of manually labels as constraints to conduct label propagation( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002</ref>). The idea is that node labels are propa- gated to nearby nodes via weighted edges until convergence, as highly weighted edges indicate high probability of sharing labels.</p><p>Nodes in our work have soft labels, where each dimension of intent features denotes a label, such as a topic or domain of knowledge graph. As de- scribed in aforesaid observations, it is intuitively reasonable to propagate on the basis of explicit edges and implicit intent similarities. We illustrate the propagation with topic feature, that of domain feature is similar.</p><p>We use matrix Y t ∈ R |V | * |T| to denote the in- tent topic graph's initial topic feature labels, with element Y t ik indicating node v i 's relevance to t k , wherer t k ∈ T. Y t is initialized based on the results of the feature enriching step in Section 2, with no manually-labelled instances needed in our model. As only part of nodes can directly map to Freebase topics, those are initialized as labelled nodes, then propagate t to their linked neighbors. The number of unlabelled data is written as u, while that of labelled data l and the total number of nodes N .</p><p>The transition matrix T indicates the impact of nodes on each other. Note that here the w ij can be replaced by other similarity measures such as ISim in Section 3.2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T ij = w ij N k=1 w kj<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Let D denote an N ×N diagonal matrix with d ii = j T ij . Then we can get a normalized version of transition matrix P = D −1 T .</p><p>The normalized transition matrix can be split into 4 sub-matrices.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P = P ll P lu P ul P uu<label>(12)</label></formula><p>At each step, we propagate and clamp the labelled data and repeat until Y converges, the propagation step can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ˆ Y u = P uu Y u + P ul Y l<label>(13)</label></formula><p>As is shown in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zhu et al., 2003</ref>) the solution to the propagation con- verges to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ˆ Y u = (I − P uu ) −1 P ul Y l<label>(14)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">The propagation framework for intent features</head><p>We carry the propagation in an iterative process illustrated in Algorithm 2.</p><p>Algorithm 2: Intent feature propagation</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Input: G, Y t l ,Y d l Output: ˆ G, ˆ Y t u , ˆ Y d u Initialize Y t l Y d</formula><note type="other">with results of Section2 repeat Merge similar nodes according to Algorithm 1 Compute matrix P repeatˆY repeatˆ repeatˆY</note><formula xml:id="formula_14">t u = P uu Y t u + P ul Y t l until Convergence; Recomputê P withˆYwithˆ withˆY t repeatˆY repeatˆ repeatˆY d u = ˆ P uu Y d u + ˆ P ul Y d l until Convergence; until no dups;</formula><p>Since intent features include both domain vec- tor and topic vector, we propagate them in an alter- nating way. At first we label nodes as described in Section 2, though missing refiners' and some urls' intent features, they are just used for initialization. Then we propagate Freebase topic features based on explicit edge weights, so that more nodes in intent topic graph have topic features now. Then fetching the learned topic features, we reinput it into domain feature propagation, which means we recalculate the transition matrix combining the im- plicit learned T Sim into edge weight, then prop- agate domain vector of labelled nodes through the graph. At each iteration, we first update Y t , then input it to update Y d , therefore merge near dupli- cate intent topics to update the whole graph.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Search logs</head><p>We use AOL search log data for experiments. It includes 20 million web queries collected covering 500K users over three months in 2006. We preprocess the query log by keeping urls oc- curring more than 3 times and queries with 2 to 40 characters, then extract sessions considering 25 minutes duration. While user session segmenta- tion can be improved with more sophisticated al- gorithms, this simple low-cost heuristic performs adequately for our purposes. We then move on to map queries to Freebase and empirically filter ses- sions that are less entity-centric. We use an anno- tation tool especially for short text (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2012) called Tagme <ref type="bibr">3</ref> to recognize entities and observe only 16% of all the queries are ex- actly an entity itself, which means most of queries do have refiner words to convey information need. To ensure the precision of recognized entities, we set a significant threshold and bottom line thresh- old , queries should have at least one recognized entity with a likelihood above significant level, and those below bottom line are ignored. They are 0.19 and 0.05 in our work, which may vary with entity recognition method. The normalized  likelihood is used as w q (e). Then we drop ses- sions where tagged entity words weight less than refiners as well as the ones with too many entity words spotted indicating disperse intents. For each recognized entity, only Freebase topics with rele- vance over 0.3 are kept. The query set we finally get is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Freebase</head><p>To enrich query representations, we collect a sub- set of Freebase including more than 7 millions facts and 4 millions topics in total which also contain 150 thousand topical equivalent websites, though less than 3% urls in query set are covered.</p><p>The facts and entities in Freebase is rather un- balanced across domains especially against that of recoginized entities in query set as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref>. Thus the original global knowledge we use about domain distribution may cause bias, which makes tailoring necessary for intent understand- ing.</p><p>For both generality and precision, we keep most of Freebase domains except several extreme in- complete ones, instead of retaining a small number of representative domains like many researchers do ( ). But generality comes at a price that some domains are confusing and mixed used which we then choose to merge, like celebrities and people, periodicals and books, tv and broadcast, etc. We finally keep 50 of all 76 domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Intent topic graph</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Building the graph</head><p>We leverage both Freebase and search sessions to enrich intent topics. We set α to 0.9 in calcula- tion of session's intent features. After labeling the session log, we roughly make a graph with 335206 intent topic nodes, 119364 of them have been labelled with Freebase topic feature, others only have domain feature. Then we conduct a merge process with β set to 0.7, γ to 0.3 and θ to 0.75 in order to merge nodes with duplicate names and similar contexts. We find 46659 duplicate sets covering 140768 nodes. Then we ignore nodes with few links and rare names to reduce sparsity. Finally we've got a graph of 209351 intent topics to initialize the propagation, including 78932 la- belled nodes. The merge and propagation progress get converged in less than 4 rounds.</p><p>We'll further evaluate the graph with case study and a session intent understanding task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Case Study</head><p>We demonstrate intent features are good interpre- tations for query intent, whether they're labelled in Section 2 or learned by propagation in Section 3.</p><p>We can see in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> that as nodes' original <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Examples of unlabelled intent topic nodes with learned feature</p><p>Intent topic node intent features Annotation Similarity nodes www.bnm.com (The Hertz Corporation, 0.25), (South- west Florida International Airport, 0.17), (Punta Gorda Airport, 0.13), (Supercar, 0.09), (Sports car, 0.08)... (aviation, 0.23), (business, 0.21), (lo- cation, 0.14), (automotive, 0.11)... types in Freebase are not proper for describing in- tent, the intent features they get after propagation tend to be more explainable, such as the travel site often co-occurs with city names, tourist attrac- tions, hotels and so on, thus indicating its intent in travel and location domain. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows examples which have no equiv- alents in Freebase. Although some of them may be accessible in other ontologies, we only take them as examples to show our propagation method makes it possible to depict intents behind urls and words in a knowledge graph based way while be- yond the capacity of knowledge graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Session intent understanding task</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Experiment Setup</head><p>The evaluation of query understanding has long been a challenging task. To judge whether the con- cepts in query are successfully recognized seems too straightforward, and it can hardly be consid- ered understanding the intent until the big idea about what kind of topics users emphasis is cap- tured, which can be briefly sketched by distribu- tion across Freebase domains. Also it is difficult to translate results of previous log analysis methods into knowledge graph domain information, thus hardly fit into our evaluation schema. We take popularity-based method as baseline.</p><p>We have few choices but to tag ground truth our- selves for intent understanding evaluation.</p><p>We randomly select 150 sessions as test set, the domain distribution of which agrees with the whole query set as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. As mas- tering meanings of all Freebase domains is too challenging, we ask 5 accessors to describe each session's intent broadly with a few natural lan- guage terms, then an expert familiar with Freebase schema translates the words into matched Free- base domains. Each test session is tagged by 2 accessors and 1 expert, we choose to use the tags of the cases in which the accessors reached agree- ment as the gold stantard. For example, if acces- sors tag session intent as pictures, then experts can translate it into Freebase visual art domain. Each session has 1∼4 tags and 1.6 tags in average. The tags cover 30 domains.</p><p>For each session, we derive the local intent do- main vector d s following the method in Section 2. Here we simply set quality function ϕ(r) to a con- stant λ r for all refiners and ϕ(c) to λ c for all clicks, we'll dive into more specialized weighting method in future work. λ r and λ c are parameters to control impact of different kinds of intent topics. Based on whether to exploit global intent features of non- entity words, we compare four variations against one baseline.</p><p>• Popularity-based (GP). We use domains' fre- quency in the query set as a baseline.</p><p>• Entity-based (E). We only use entity nodes' original intent features without propagation.</p><p>• Entity+Clicks (EC). Both intent features of entity words and clicks are used, controlled with λ c .</p><p>• Entity+Refiners (ER). Intent features of en- tity words and refiner words are used, refin- ers' impact is controlled by λ r .</p><p>• Entity+Clicks+Refiners (ECR). All intent topics are combined, controlled by λ c , λ r . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Evaluation metrics</head><p>We use each approach to rank domains accord- ing to its derived weight, then compare it with golden standard set. It can be evaluated using Mean Average Precision (MAP), Geometric MAP and Precision@K. We use GMAP because it is more robust to outliers than the arithmetic mean. For test set of size N , the MAP and GMAP can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">M AP @k = 1 N N i=1 AP i @k (15) GM AP @k = N N i=1 AP i @k (16)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Results and analysis</head><p>We first study impact of parameters λ r and λ c , which is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. It roughly demonstrates different combinations of parameters' impact on ECR methods, perfor- mance is evaluated in four metrics, with deeper color indicating better result.</p><p>Best results comes with a λ c larger than λ r in all four subfigures. This trend seems more obvi- ous in (d) where right part with larger λ c get better results. Also, deeper colors around diagonal line in (a) (c) indicate a more balanced combination of refiners and urls are more likely to enhance in- tent understanding. Thus we conclude clicks has a weak advantage over refiners in improving the re- sult, while combining both with proper parameters can get the best result.</p><p>When comparing between MAP and GMAP, we can see while GMAP stays a high value when am- plifying the impact of clicks, MAP changes with the variation of λ r for better or worse. As GMAP is a more robust metric, we can then infer that in- creasing weight of refiners could bring more out- liers, implying refiners' intent features are more susceptible to noise.</p><p>Then we use ER with λ r = 0.5 as ER opt , EC with λ c = 0.5 as EC opt and ECR with λ r = 0.2, λ c = 0.5 as ECR opt . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> clearly shows the superior performance of our model, especially at top positions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows the detailed comparisons between different methods. We can see our knowledge graph based intent representations perform well in session in- tent understanding. And refiners' and clicks' in- tent features which we learn by propagation con-  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Query intent understanding</head><p>Query intent or search intent has been studied in- tensively from various views. A popular paradigm is to label several intents for each query, also called facets subgoals and subtopics in the literature, manully or by min- ing methods and then do classification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Li et al., 2008</ref>) based on that. Manually in- tent schemas range from 3 top level <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Broder, 2002)</ref> to fine-grained subcatogories ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rose and Levinson, 2004</ref>) and taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yin and Shah, 2010)</ref>. Intent tasks in NTCIR-10 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sakai et al., 2013</ref>) also pro- vide subtopic pools made by accessors.</p><p>Another view of intent is more generic, min- ing or learning search intents without any kind of pre-defined intent category and clustering method is often used. Methods including ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sadikov et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yamamoto et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheung and Li, 2012</ref>) cast intent as represented by a pattern or template consisting of a sequence of semantic con- cepts or lexical items. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tan et al., 2012</ref>) encode intent in language models, aware of long-lasting interests. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ren et al., 2014</ref>) uses an unsupervised heterogeneous clustering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yin and Shah, 2010)</ref> capture generic intents around a certain named en- tities and model their relationships in a tree tax- onomy and ( ) mine broad latent modifiers of intent aspect , which are similar to our motivation, while we model more than intent phrases, but intent topics. We do not split queries into clusters or subtopics relevant to the original query to indicate a intent, but link them in an graph with intent feature similarity, weakly or strongly, in a holistical view.</p><p>On the other hand, previous research can be categorized by what kind of resources they rely on. Quite an amount of work leverage query logs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jiang et al., 2013)</ref>, including query reformula- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Radlinski et al., 2010)</ref>, click-through data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Li et al., 2008)</ref>. There are also works using spon- sered data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yamamoto et al., 2012</ref>) and interactive data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ruotsalo et al., 2013</ref>). The new trend of in- tegrating knowledge graph will be discussed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Knowledge graph on intent understanding</head><p>Instead of summarizing queries into concepts by clustering, recently there appears a tendency to use concpets from knowledge graph resources. Some researchers manage to build entity graph from queries (Bordino et al., 2013a) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordino et al., 2013b;</ref>), some in a structure view, interpret quries into knowledge base fit template ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pound et al., 2012;</ref>. ( ) models latent intent to mine entity type dis- tributions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ren et al., 2014</ref>) utilizes knowledge graph resources in a hetrogeneous view. ( ) also pays attention to refiners, but re- stricted to limited domains, while our method is more general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we tailor knowledge graph to rep- resent query intent behind entity words, refiners and clicked urls in a unified framework, taking them as intent topic nodes connected in a large graph. We manage to get a contextualized intent depiction exploiting global knowledge in Free- base, then propagate the feature to cover more in- tent topics. We show in experiments the knowl- edge graph enriched representation is reasonable and explainable, and the intents feature of refiners and clicks can better enhance intent understanding than methods simply relying on entities.</p><p>There are several directions for future work, in- cluding using both types and domains in Free- base schema, diving into refiners and looking for a proper weighting method, developing a query rec- ommendation framework based on the intent topic graph and user interest modeling.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Unbalanced domain distributions in Freebase comparing against query set.
