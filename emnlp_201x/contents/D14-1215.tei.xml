				<p>Comparisons are common linguistic devices used to indicate the likeness of two things. Often, this likeness is not meant in the literal sense-for example, &quot;I slept like a log&quot; does not imply that logs actually sleep. In this paper we propose a computational study of figurative comparisons , or similes. Our starting point is a new large dataset of comparisons extracted from product reviews and annotated for figurativeness. We use this dataset to characterize figurative language in naturally occurring comparisons and reveal linguistic patterns indicative of this phenomenon. We operationalize these insights and apply them to a new task with high relevance to text understanding: distinguishing between figurative and literal comparisons. Finally, we apply this framework to explore the social context in which figurative language is produced, showing that similes are more likely to accompany opinions showing extreme sentiment, and that they are uncommon in reviews deemed helpful.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In argument similes are like songs in love; they describe much, but prove nothing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Franz Kafka</head><p>Comparisons are fundamental linguistic devices that express the likeness of two things-be it en- tities, concepts or ideas. Given that their work- ing principle is to emphasize the relation between the shared properties of two arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bredin, 1998)</ref>, comparisons can synthesize important se- mantic knowledge.</p><p>Often, comparisons are not meant to be under- stood literally. Figurative comparisons are an im- portant figure of speech called simile. Consider the following two examples paraphrased from Ama- zon product reviews:</p><p>(1) Sterling is much cheaper than gold. (2) Her voice makes this song shine brighter than gold.</p><p>In (1) the comparison draws on the relation be- tween the price property shared by the two metals, sterling and gold. While (2) also draws on a com- mon property (brightness), the polysemantic use (vocal timbre vs. light reflection) makes the com- parison figurative.</p><p>Importantly, there is no general rule separating literal from figurative comparisons. More gen- erally, the distinction between figurative and lit- eral language is blurred and subjective <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hanks, 2006</ref>). Multiple criteria for delimiting the two have been proposed in the linguistic and philo- sophical literature-for a comprehensive review, see Shutova (2010)-but they are not without ex- ceptions, and are often hard to operationalize in a computational framework. When considering the specific case of comparisons, such criteria cannot be directly applied.</p><p>Recently, the simile has received increasing at- tention from linguists and lexicographers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Moon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moon, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hanks, 2013)</ref> as it became clearer that similes need to be treated separately from metaphors since they operate on funda- mentally different principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bethlehem, 1996)</ref>. Metaphors are linguistically simple structures hid- ing a complex mapping between two domains, through which many properties are transferred. For example the conceptual metaphor of life as a journey can be instantiated in many particular ways: being at a fork in the road, reaching the end of the line <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lakoff and Johnson, 1980)</ref>. In contrast, the semantic context of similes tends to be very shallow, transferring a single property <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hanks, 2013)</ref>. Their more explicit syntactic structure al- lows, in exchange, for more lexical creativity. As Hanks (2013) puts it, similes "tend to license all sorts of logical mayhem." Moreover, the over- lap between the expressive range of similes and metaphors is now known to be only partial: there are similes that cannot be rephrased as metaphors, and the other way around ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Israel et al., 2004</ref>). This suggests that figurativeness in similes should be modeled differently than in metaphors. To further underline the necessity of a computational model for similes, we give the first estimate of their fre- quency in the wild: over 30% of comparisons are figurative. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We also confirm that a state of the art metaphor detection system performs poorly when applied directly to the task of detecting similes.</p><p>In this work we propose a computational study of figurative language in comparisons. To this end, we build the first large collection of naturally oc- curring comparisons with figurativeness annota- tion, which we make publicly available. Using this resource we explore the linguistic patterns that characterize similes, and group them in two con- ceptually distinctive classes. The first class con- tains cues that are agnostic of the context in which the comparison appears (domain-agnostic cues). For example, we find that the higher the seman- tic similarity between the two arguments, the less likely it is for the comparison to be figurative-in the examples above, sterling is semantically very similar to gold, both being metals, but song and gold are semantically dissimilar. The second type of cues are domain-specific, drawing on the in- tuition that the domain in which a comparison is used is a factor in determining its figurativeness. We find, for instance, that the less specific a com- parison is to the domain in which it appears, the more likely it is to be used in a figurative sense (e.g., in example (2), gold is very unexpected in the musical domain).</p><p>We successfully exploit these insights in a new prediction task relevant to text understanding: dis- criminating figurative comparisons from literal ones. Encouraged by the high accuracy of our system-which is within 10% of that obtained by human annotators-we automatically extend the figurativeness labels to 80,000 comparisons occur- ring in product reviews. This enables us to conduct a fine-grained analysis of how comparison usage interacts with their social context, opening up a research direction with applications in sentiment analysis and opinion mining. In particular we find that figurative comparisons are more likely to ac- company reviews showing extreme sentiment, and that they are uncommon in opinions deemed as be- ing helpful. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time figurative language is tied to the so- cial context in which it appears.</p><p>To summarize, the main contributions of this work are as follows:</p><p>• it introduces the first large dataset of compar- isons with figurativeness annotations (Sec- tion 3);</p><p>• it unveils new linguistic patterns characteriz- ing figurative comparisons (Section 4);</p><p>• it introduces the task of distinguishing figura- tive from literal comparisons (Section 5);</p><p>• it establishes the relation between figurative language and the social context in which it appears (Section 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Further Related Work</head><p>Corpus studies on figurative language in compar- isons are scarce, and none directly address the distinction between figurative and literal compar- isons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roncero et al. (2006)</ref> observed, by search- ing the web for several stereotypical comparisons (e.g., education is like a stairway), that similes are more likely to be accompanied by explana- tions than equivalent metaphors (e.g., education is a stairway). Related to figurativeness is irony, which Veale (2012a) finds to often be lexically marked. By using a similar insight to filter out ironic comparisons, and by assuming that the rest are literal, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Veale and Hao (2008)</ref> learn stereotyp- ical knowledge about the world from frequently compared terms. A similar process has been ap- plied to both English and Chinese by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al. (2012)</ref>, thereby encouraging the idea that the trope behaves similarly in different languages. A related system is the Jigsaw Bard (Veale and Hao, 2011), a thesaurus driven by figurative conventional sim- iles extracted from the Google N-grams. This sys- tem aims to build and generate canned expressions by using items frequently associated with the sim- ile pattern above. An extension of the principles of the Jigsaw Bard is found in Thesaurus Rex (Veale and Li, 2013), a data-driven partition of words into ad-hoc categories. Thesaurus Rex is constructed using simple comparison and hypernym patterns and is able to provide weighted lists of categories for given words. In text understanding systems, literal compar- isons are used to detect analogies between related geographical places ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lofi et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Tandon et al. (2014)</ref> use relative comparative patterns (e.g., X is heavier than Y) to enrich a common-sense knowledge base. Jindal and Liu (2006) extract graded comparisons from various sources, with the objective of mining consumer opinion about products. They note that identifying objective vs. subjective comparisons-related to literality-is an important future direction. Given that many comparisons are figurative, a system that discrim- inates literal from figurative comparisons is essen- tial for such text understanding and information retrieval systems.</p><p>The vast majority of previous work on figu- rative language focused on metaphor detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tsvetkov et al. (2014a)</ref> propose a cross-lingual system based on word-level conceptual features and they evaluate it on Subject-Verb-Object triples and Adjective-Noun pairs. Their features include and extend the idea of abstractness used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turney et al. (2011)</ref> for Adjective-Noun metaphors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hovy et al. (2013)</ref> contribute an unrestricted metaphor corpus and propose a method based on tree ker- nels. Bridging the gap between metaphor identifi- cation and interpretation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shutova and Sun (2013)</ref> proposed an unsupervised system to learn source- target domain mappings. The system fits concep- tual metaphor theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lakoff and Johnson, 1980)</ref> well, at the cost of not being able to tackle figu- rative language in general, and similes in particu- lar, as similes do not map entire domains to one another. Since similes operate on fundamentally different principles than metaphors, our work pro- poses a computational approach tailored specifi- cally for comparisons.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Structure of a comparison</head><p>Unlike metaphors, which are generally unre- stricted, comparisons are more structured but also more lexically and semantically varied. This en- ables a more structured computational representa- tion of which we take advantage. The constituents of a comparison according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hanks (2012)</ref> are:</p><p>• the TOPIC, sometimes called tenor: it is usu- ally a noun phrase and acts as logical subject;</p><p>• the VEHICLE: it is the object of the compari- son and is also usually a noun phrase;</p><p>• the shared PROPERTY or ground: it expresses what the two entities have in common-it can be explicit but is often implicit, left for the reader to infer;</p><p>• the EVENT (eventuality or state): usually a verb, it sets the frame for the observation of the common property;</p><p>• the COMPARATOR: commonly a preposition (like) or part of an adjectival phrase (better than), it is the trigger word or phrase that marks the presence of a comparison.</p><p>The literal example (1) would be segmented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[Sterling /TOPIC] [is /EVENT] much [cheaper /PROPERTY] [than /COMPARATOR] [gold /VE- HICLE]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Annotation</head><p>People resort to comparisons often when mak- ing descriptions, as they are a powerful way of expressing properties by example. For this rea- son we collect a dataset of user-generated compar- isons in Amazon product reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(McAuley and Leskovec, 2013)</ref>, where users have to be descrip- tive and precise, but also to express personal opin- ion. We supplement the data with a smaller set of comparisons from WaCky and WaCkypedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni et al., 2009</ref>) to cover more genres. In pre- liminary work, we experimented with dependency parse tree patterns for extracting comparisons and labeling their parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Niculae, 2013)</ref>. We use the same approach, but with an improved set of pat- terns, to extract comparisons with the COMPARA- TORS like, as and than. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We keep only the matches where the TOPIC and the VEHICLE are nouns, and the PROPERTY, if present, is an adjective, which is the typical case. Also, the head words of the constituents are constrained to occur in the distri- butional resources used ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baroni and Lenci, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Faruqui and Dyer, 2014</ref>). 3</p><p>We proceed to validate and annotate for figu- rativeness a random sample of the comparisons extracted using the automated process described above. The annotation is performed using crowd- sourcing on the Amazon Mechanical Turk plat- form, in two steps. First, the annotators are asked to determine whether a displayed sentence is in- deed a comparison between the highlighted words (TOPIC and VEHICLE). Sentences qualified by two out of three annotators as comparisons are used in the second round, where the task is to rate how metaphorical a comparison is. We use a scale of 1 to 4 following <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turney et al. (2011)</ref>, and then binarize to consider scores of 1-2 as lit- eral and 3-4 as figurative. Finally, in this work we only consider comparisons where all three annota- tors agree on this binary notion of figurativeness. For both tasks, we provide guidelines mostly in the form of examples and intuition, motivated on one hand by the annotators not having specialized knowledge, and on the other hand by the observa- tion that the literal-figurative distinction is subjec- tive. All annotators have the master worker qual- ification, reside in the U.S. and completed a lin- guistic background questionnaire that verifies their experience with English. In both tasks, control sentences with confidently known labels are used to filter low quality answers; in addition, we test annotators with a simple paraphrasing task shown to be effective for eliciting and verifying linguis- tic attention ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Munro et al., 2010)</ref>. Both tasks seem relatively difficult for humans, with inter- annotator agreement given by Fleiss' k of 0.48 for the comparison identification task and of 0.54 for the figurativeness annotation after binarization. This is comparable to 0.57 reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hovy et al. (2013)</ref> for general metaphor labeling. We show some statistics about the collected data in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Overall, this is a costly process: out of 2400 auto- matically extracted comparison candidates, about 60% were deemed by the annotators to be actual comparisons and only 12% end up being selected confidently enough as figurative comparisons.</p><p>Our dataset of human-filtered comparisons, with the scores given by the three annotators, is made publicly available to encourage further work. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> This also includes about 400 comparisons where the annotators do not agree perfectly on bi- nary figurativeness. Such cases can be interest- ing to other analyses, even if we don't consider <ref type="bibr">4</ref> http://vene.ro/figurative-comparisons/ Domain <ref type="figure">fig. lit</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Linguistic Insights</head><p>We now proceed to exploring the linguistic pat- terns that discriminate figurative from literal com- parisons. We consider two broad classes of cues, which we discuss next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Domain-specific cues</head><p>Figurative language is often used for striking ef- fects, and comparisons are used to describe new things in terms of something given <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hanks, 2013)</ref>. Since the norms that define what is surprising and what is well-known vary across domains, we ex- pect that such contextual information should play an important role in figurative language detection. This is a previously unexplored dimension of figu- rative language, and Amazon product reviews of- fer a convenient testbed for this intuition since cat- egory information is provided.</p><p>Specificity To estimate whether a compari- son can be considered striking in a particular domain-whether it references images or ideas that are unexpected in its context-we employ a simple measure of word specificity with respect to a domain: the ratio of the word frequency within the domain and the word frequency in all domains being considered. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> It should be noted that speci- ficity is not purely a function of the word, but figurative literal  Indeed, the word melody has a specificity of 96% in the music domain and only of 3% in the books domain. An analysis on the labeled data confirms that literal comparisons do indeed tend to have more domain-specific VEHICLES (Mann-Whitney U test, p &lt; 0.01) than figurative ones. Further- more, the distribution of specificity across both types of comparisons, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1a</ref> Domain label An analysis of the annotation re- sults reveals that the percentage of comparisons that are figurative differs widely across domains, as indicated in the last column in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. This suggests that simply knowing the domain of a text can serve to adjust some prior expectation about figurative language presence and therefore improve detection. We test this hypothesis using <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The mass around 0.25 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1a</ref> is largely explained by generic words such as thing, others, nothing, average and barely specific words like veil, reputation, dream, garbage. a Z-test comparing all Amazon categories. With the exception of books and music reviews, that have similar ratios, all other pairs of categories show significantly different proportions of figura- tive comparisons (p &lt; 0.01).</p><note type="other">0.4 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Domain-agnostic cues</head><p>Linguistic studies of figurative language suggest that there is a fundamental generic notion of fig- urativeness. We attempt to capture this notion in the context of comparisons using syntactic and se- mantic information.</p><p>Topic-Vehicle similarity The default role of lit- eral comparisons is to assert similarity of things. Therefore, we expect that a high semantic simi- larity between the TOPIC and the VEHICLE of a comparison is a sign of literal usage, as we pre- viously hypothesized in preliminary work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Niculae, 2013</ref>). To test this hypothesis, we compute TOPIC-VEHICLE similarity using Distributional Memory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baroni and Lenci, 2010</ref>), a freely avail- able distributional semantics resource that cap- tures word relationships through grammatical role co-occurrence.</p><p>By applying this measure to our data, we find that there is indeed an important difference be- tween the distributions of TOPIC-VEHICLE simi- larity in figurative and literal comparisons (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1b)</ref>; the means of the two distribu- tions are significantly different (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Metaphor-inspired features We also seek to understand to what extent insights provided by computational work on metaphor detection can be more concrete less concrete more imageable cinnamon, kiss devil, happiness less imageable casque, pugilist aspect, however Abstractness and imageability features are de- rived from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Coltheart, 1981)</ref>, a dictionary based on manually annotated datasets of psycholinguistic norms. Im- ageability is the property of a word to arouse a mental image, be it in the form of a mental pic- ture, sound or any other sense. Concreteness is defined as "any word that refers to objects, materi- als or persons," while abstractness, at the other end of the spectrum, is represented by words that can- not be usually experienced by the senses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Paivio et al., 1968)</ref>. are more imageable (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.01), as illustrated by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1c</ref>. This is in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hanks (2005)</ref>, who observed that similes are char- acterized by their appeal to sensory imagination.</p><p>Definiteness We introduce another simple but effective syntactic cue that relates to concreteness: the presence of a definite article versus an indefi- nite one (or none at all). We search for the indefi- nite articles a and an and the definite article the in each component of a comparison.</p><p>We find that similes tend to have indefinite arti- cles in the VEHICLE more often and definite arti- cles less often (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.01). In par- ticular, 59% of comparisons where the VEHICLE has a indefinite article are figurative, as opposed to 13% of the comparisons where VEHICLE has a definite article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Prediction Task</head><p>We now turn to the task of predicting whether a comparison is figurative or literal. Not only does this task allow us to assess and compare the effi- ciency of the linguistic cues we discussed, but it is also highly relevant in the context of natural lan- guage understanding systems.</p><p>We conduct a logistic regression analysis, and compare the efficiency of the features derived from our analysis to a bag of words baseline. In addition to the features inspired by the pre- viously described linguistic insights, we also try to computationally capture the lexical usage pat- terns of comparisons using a version of bag of words adapted to the comparison structure. In this slotted bag of words system, features correspond to occurrence of words within constituents (e.g., bright ∈ PROPERTY).</p><p>We perform a stratified split of our compari- son dataset into equal train and test sets (each set containing 408 comparisons, out of which 134 are figurative), <ref type="bibr">9</ref> and use a 5-fold stratified cross vali- dation over the training set to choose the optimal value for the logistic regression regularization pa- rameter and the type of regularization (ℓ 1 or ℓ 2 ) for each feature set. 10 <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The entire analysis described in Section 4 is only con- ducted on the training set. Also, in order to ensure that we are assessing the performance of the classifier on unseen com- parisons, we discard from our dataset all those with the same TOPIC and VEHICLE pair. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We use the logistic regression implementation of liblinear <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fan et al., 2008)</ref> wrapped by the scikit-learn library <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Classification performance on the test set for the different sets of features we considered; human performance is shown for reference.</p><p>Classifier performance The performance on the classification task is summarized in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We note that the bag of words baseline is remark- ably strong, because of common idiomatic simi- les that can be captured through keywords. Our full system (which relies on our linguistically in- spired cues discussed in Section 4 in addition to slotted bag of words) significantly outperforms the bag of words baseline and the slotted bag of words system in terms of accuracy, F 1 score and AUC (p &lt; 0.05), 11 suggesting that linguistic insights complement idiomatic simile matching. Impor- tantly, a system using only our linguistic insight cues also significantly improves over the baseline in terms of accuracy and AUC and it is not signif- icantly different from the full system in terms of performance, in spite of having about an order of magnitude fewer features. It is also worth noting that the domain-specific cues play an important role in bringing the performance to this level by capturing a different aspect of what it means for a comparison to be figurative. The features used by the state of the art metaphor detection system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tsvetkov et al. (2014a)</ref>, adapted to the comparison structure, per- form poorly by themselves and do not improve significantly over the baseline. This is consis- tent with the theoretical motivation that figura- tiveness in comparisons requires special compu- tational treatment, as discussed in Section 1. Fur- thermore, the linguistic insight features not only significantly outperform the metaphor inspired features (p &lt; 0.05), but are also better at exploit- ing larger amounts of data, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> All statistical significance results in this paragraph are obtained from 5000 bootstrap samples. Comparison to human performance To gauge how well humans would perform at the classifica- tion task on the actual test data, we perform an- other Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation on 140 examples from the test set. For the evaluation, we use majority voting between the three anno- tators, <ref type="bibr">12</ref> and compare to the agreed labels in the dataset. Estimated human accuracy is 96%, plac- ing our full system within 10% of human accuracy.</p><p>Feature analysis The predictive analysis we perform allows us to investigate to what extent the features inspired by our linguistic insights have discriminative power, and whether they actually cover different aspects of figurativeness.</p><p>TOPIC-VEHICLE similarity −11.3 the older man was wiser and stronger than the boy VEHICLE specificity −5.8 the cord is more durable than the adapter <ref type="bibr">[Electronics]</ref> VEHICLE imageability 4.9 the explanations are as clear as mud VEHICLE communication supersense −4.6 the book reads like six short articles VEHICLE indefiniteness 4.0 his fame drew foreigners to him like a magnet life ∈ VEHICLE 7.1 the hero is truly larger than life: godlike, yet flawed picture ∈ VEHICLE −6.0 the necklace looks just like the picture other ∈ VEHICLE −5.9 this one is just as nice as the other others ∈ VEHICLE −5.5 some songs are more memorable than others crap ∈ VEHICLE 4.7 the headphones sounded like crap  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the best linguistic insight and slotted bag of words features selected by the full model. The strongest feature by far is the seman- tic similarity between the TOPIC and the VEHI- CLE. By itself, this feature gets 70% accuracy and 61% F 1 score.</p><p>The rest of the top features involve mostly the VEHICLE. This suggests that the VEHICLE is the most informative element of a comparison when it comes to figurativeness. Features involving other constituents also get selected, but with slightly lower weights, not making it to the top.</p><p>VEHICLE specificity is one of the strongest fea- tures, with positive values indicating literal com- parisons. This confirms our intuition that domain information is important to discriminate figurative from literal language.</p><p>Of the adapted metaphor features, the noun communication supersense and the imageability of the VEHICLE make it to the top. Nouns with low communication rating occurring in the train- ing set include puddles, arrangements, carbohy- drates while nouns with high communication rat- ing include languages and subjects.</p><p>Presence of an indefinite article in the VEHICLE is a strong indicator of figurativeness. By them- selves, the definiteness and indefiniteness features perform quite well, attaining 78% accuracy and 67% F 1 score.</p><p>The salient bag of words features correspond to specific types of comparisons. The words other and others in the VEHICLE indicate comparisons between the same kind of arguments, for exam- ple some songs are more memorable than others, and these are likely to be literal. The word pic- ture is specific to the review setting, as products are accompanied by photos, and for certain kinds of products, the resemblance of the product with the image is an important factor for potential buy- ers. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The bag of words systems are furthermore able to learn idiomatic comparisons by identify- ing common figurative VEHICLES such as life and crap, corresponding to fixed expressions such as larger than life.</p><p>Error analysis Many of the errors made by our full system involve indirect semantic mechanisms such as metonymy. For example, the false pos- itive the typeface was larger than most books really means larger than the typefaces found in most books, but without the implicit expansion the meaning can appear figurative. A similar kind of ellipsis makes the example a lot [of songs] are even better than sugar be wrongly classified as literal. Another source of error is polysemy. Ex- amples like the rejuvelac formula is about 10 times better than yogurt are misclassified because of the multiple meanings of the word formula, one being closely related to yogurt and food, but the more common ones being general and abstract, suggest- ing figurativeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Social Correlates</head><p>The advantage of studying comparisons situated in a social context is that we can understand how their usage interacts with internal and external hu- man factors. An internal factor is the sentiment of  To gain insight about fine grained interactions with human factors at larger scale, we use our clas- sifier to find over 80,000 figurative and literal com- parisons from the same four categories. The trends we reveal also hold significantly on the manually annotated data.</p><p>Sentiment While it was previously noted that similes often transmit strong affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hanks, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Veale, 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Veale, 2012b)</ref>, the connection be- tween figurativeness and sentiment was never em- pirically validated. The setting of product reviews is convenient for investigating this issue, since the star ratings associated with the reviews can be used as sentiment labels. We find that com- parisons are indeed significantly more likely to be figurative when the users express strong opin- ions, i.e., in one-star or five-star reviews (Mann- Whitney p &lt; 0.02 on the manually annotated data). Helpfulness It is also interesting to understand to what extent figurative language relates to the external perception of the content in which it ap- pears. We find that comparisons in helpful re- views 14 are less likely to be figurative. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3b</ref> shows a near-constant high ratio of figurative com- parisons among unhelpful and average reviews; as helpfulness increases, figurative comparisons be- come less frequent. We further validate that this effect is not a confound of the distribution of help- fulness ratings across reviews of different polarity by controlling for the star rating: given a fixed star rating, the proportion of figurative comparisons is still lower in helpful (helpfulness over 50%) than in unhelpful (helpfulness under 50%) reviews; this difference is significant (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.01) for all classes of ratings except one-star. The size of the manually annotated data does not al- low for star rating stratification, but the overall dif- ference is statistically significant (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.01). This result encourages further exper- imentation to determine whether there is a causal link between the use of figurative language in user generated content and its external perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This work proposes a computational study of fig- urative language in comparisons. Starting from a new dataset of naturally occurring comparisons with figurativeness annotation (which we make publicly available) we explore linguistic patterns that are indicative of similes. We show that these insights can be successfully operationalized in a new prediction task: distinguishing literal from figurative comparisons. Our system reaches ac- curacy that is within 10% of human performance, and is outperforming a state of the art metaphor detection system, thus confirming the need for a computational approach tailored specifically to comparisons. While we take a data-driven ap- proach, our annotated dataset can be useful for more theoretical studies of the kinds of compar- isons and similes people use.</p><p>We discover that domain knowledge is an im- portant factor in identifying similes. This suggests that future work on automatic detection of figura- tive language should consider contextual parame- ters such as the topic and community where the content appears.</p><p>Furthermore, we are the first to tie figurative language to the social context in which it is pro- duced and show its relation to internal and exter- nal human factors such as opinion sentiment and helpfulness. Future investigation into the causal effects of these interactions could lead to a better understanding of the role of figurative language in persuasion and rhetorics.</p><p>In our work, we consider common noun TOP- ICS and VEHICLES and adjectival PROPERTIES. This is the most typical case, but supporting other parts of speech-such as proper nouns, pronouns, and adverbs-can make a difference in many ap- plications. Capturing compositional interaction between the parts of the comparison could lead to more flexible models that give less weight to the VEHICLE.</p><p>This study is also the first to estimate how prevalent similes are in the wild, and reports that about one third of the comparisons we consider are figurative. This is suggestive of the need to build systems that can properly process figurative com- parisons in order to correctly harness the semantic information encapsulated in comparisons.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>figurative</figDesc></figure>

the existing corpora annotated for metaphor can-
not be directly used to study comparisons. For ex-
ample, in TroFi (Birke and Sarkar, 2006), a cor-
pus of 6436 sentences annotated for figurative-
ness, we only find 42 noun-noun comparisons with 
sentence-level (thus noisy) figurativeness labels.

Supersenses are a very coarse form of meaning representation. Tsvetkov et al. (2014a) used WordNet (Miller, 1995) semantic classes for nouns and verbs, for example noun.body, noun.animal, verb.consumption, or verb.motion. For adjectives, Tsvetkov et al. (2014b) developed and made available a novel classification in the same spirit. 7 We compute abstractness, image- ability and supersenses for the TOPIC, VEHICLE, EVENT, and PROPERTY. 8 We concatenate these features with the raw vector representations of the constituents, following Tsvetkov et al. (2014a). We find that such features relate to figurative comparisons in a meaningful way. For example, out of all comparisons with explicit properties, fig- urative comparisons tend to have properties that 7 Following Tsvetkov et al. (2014a) we train a classifier to predict these features from a vector space representation of a word. We use the same cross-lingually optimized represen- tation from Faruqui and Dyer (2014) and a simpler classifier, a logistic regression, which we find to perform as well as the random forests used in Tsvetkov et al. (2014a). We treat su- persense prediction as a multi-label problem and apply a one- versus-all transformation, effectively learning a linear classi- fier for each supersense. 8 If the PROPERTY is implicit, all corresponding features are set to zero. An extra binary feature indicates whether the PROPERTY is explicit or implicit.</figDesc><table></table></figure>

We also filtered proper nouns using a capitalization heuristic.</note>
