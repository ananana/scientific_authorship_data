				<p>Exponential growth in the number of scientific publications yields the need for effective automatic analysis of rhetorical aspects of scientific writing. Acknowledging the argumentative nature of scientific text, in this work we investigate the link between the argumentative structure of scientific publications and rhetorical aspects such as discourse categories or citation contexts. To this end, we (1) augment a corpus of scientific publications annotated with four layers of rhetoric annotations with argumentation annotations and (2) investigate neural multi-task learning architectures combining argument extraction with a set of rhetorical classification tasks. By coupling rhetorical classifiers with the extraction of argumentative components in a joint multi-task learning setting , we obtain significant performance gains for different rhetorical analysis tasks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Scientific publications, as "tools of persuasion" in research <ref type="bibr">(Gilbert, 1977)</ref>, are carefully composed documents written to convince the reader of the validity and merit of the researchers' work. As such, they are inherently argumentative and often adhere to well-trodden rhetorical patterns and ar- gumentation schemes of the respective research field. The accelerated growth of scientific liter- ature ( <ref type="bibr">Bornmann and Mutz, 2015</ref>) makes explo- ration and analysis of relevant publications increas- ingly difficult. This yields the need for automatic analyses of these documents, including their argu- mentative and rhetorical structure.</p><p>Accordingly, computational models already sup- port publication analysis tasks, e.g., classification of citation purpose and polarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jha et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lauscher et al., 2017b</ref>, inter alia) and classification of (sentential) discourse roles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Teufel et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liakata et al., 2010, inter alia)</ref>. Further, rhetorical predictions at the (sub-)sentence level obtained us- ing these models have been shown useful in higher- level downstream tasks such as publication classifi- cation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Teufel et al., 1999</ref>), (extractive) publication summarization ( <ref type="bibr">Cohan and Goharian, 2015)</ref>, and research trend prediction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McKeown et al., 2016</ref>).</p><p>To allow for the holistic analysis of scientific publications with respect to the interactions be- tween different rhetorical aspects of scientific text <ref type="bibr">Fisas et al. (2016)</ref> created a corpus of scientific publications with manual annotations of several high-level rhetorical aspects of scientific writing (e.g., sentence-level discourse roles), but without annotations of the argumentative structure of publi- cations. Despite (1) scientific texts being inher- ently argumentative <ref type="bibr">(Gilbert, 1976)</ref>, (2) the ex- istence of theoretical argumentative frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Toulmin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kirschner et al., 2015)</ref>, and (3) a wide range of argument extraction models in other domains (e.g., debates or essays, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Palau and Moens (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Habernal and Gurevych (2017)</ref>, inter alia), there is still very little work on auto- matic argumentation mining from scientific litera- ture. Consequently, there has been no work analyz- ing associations between argumentation and other rhetorical constructs in scientific writing, although such dependencies exist. Consider the following example:</p><p>"In general, our OMR preserves the high frequency content of the motion quite well <ref type="bibr">[claim]</ref>, since ::::::</p><p>inverse :::: rate ::::::: control :: is ::::::: directed ::</p><p>by ::::::::: Jacobian :::::: values <ref type="bibr">[data]</ref>."</p><p>Here, the authors make a claim (underlined text) about their approach and support it with a techni- cal fact (data) about the method (wave-underlined text). At the same time, regarding other rhetorical constructs, this sentence is stating the subjective aspect of advantage (of the proposed method), be- longs to the discourse category of outcome (of the authors' work), and may be considered relevant for the (extractive) summary of the publication. We argue that these rhetorical dimensions are in- terconnected and that fine-grained argumentation underpins other rhetorical layers in scientific text. For example, sentences stating an advantage of a method are likely to be argumentative and may con- tain claims that should be included in the summary. Assuming that argumentation guides rhetorics in scientific text, we investigate neural multi-task learning (MTL) models which couple argument ex- traction with several other rhetorical analysis tasks. To this end, we augment the existing corpus of sci- entific publications ( <ref type="bibr">Fisas et al., 2016)</ref>, containing several layers of rhetorical annotations, with an additional layer of argumentative components and relations. We then explore two neural MTL archi- tectures based on shared recurrent encoders, intra- sentence attention, and private task-specific classi- fiers and couple the neural architectures with a joint MTL objective with uncertainty-based weighting of task-specific losses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kendall et al., 2018)</ref>. We validate our approach by testing that it outperforms traditional machine learning models in single-task settings. We finally show that coupling rhetorical analysis tasks with argument extraction using MTL models significantly improves the results for the rhetorical analysis tasks.</p><p>Contributions. We create the first corpus of sci- entific publications in English annotated with fine- grained argumentative structures and carry out the first study on dependencies between different rhetorical dimensions in scientific writing. Using MTL models, we show that argumentation informs other rhetorical analysis tasks. Finally, in the con- text of MTL research, our results indicate that the dynamic uncertainty-based loss weighting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kendall et al., 2018</ref>) is beneficial for high-level natural lan- guage processing tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>We provide an overview of (1) studies analyzing rhetorical aspects in scientific publications and (2) a large body of work on argumentation mining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Rhetorical Analysis of Scientific Texts</head><p>Previous work has analyzed a number of rhetori- cal aspects of scientific publications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Teufel et al. (1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Teufel et al. ( , 2009</ref> analyzed the discourse structure of sci- entific publications. They annotated sentences with discourse categories named argumentative zones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liakata et al. (2010)</ref> proposed a more general dis- course scheme dubbed core scientific concepts and in subsequent work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liakata et al., 2012</ref>) trained a conditional random fields (CRF) model to as- sign discourse labels to text spans. Several authors focused on tasks relating to citations: extraction of citation context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abu-Jbara et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jha et al., 2017)</ref>, classification of citation polarity (e.g., Athar, 2011) and purpose (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Teufel et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jochim and Schütze, 2012)</ref>, and the auto- matic detection of referenced parts of the cited pub- lication ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jaidka et al., 2017)</ref>. Both discourse and citation information have been exploited for sum- marizing scientific publications <ref type="bibr">(Cohan and Goharian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Teufel and Moens, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen and Zhuge, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lauscher et al., 2017a)</ref>. Intuitively, citation contexts may contain information relevant to the summary. Simi- larly, summaries commonly contain sentences with diversified discourse properties. <ref type="bibr">Fisas et al. (2016)</ref> provided different layers of rhetorical annotations on the same corpus of sci- entific text.Their Dr. Inventor Corpus is annotated with a combination of existing discourse annotation schemes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Teufel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liakata et al., 2010)</ref> and citation-based annotations. Despite the argu- mentative nature of scientific texts, the Dr. Inventor Corpus contains no annotations of argumentative components such as claims. Several computational studies followed, addressing the rhetorical tasks corresponding to the layers of the Dr. Inventor Corpus ( <ref type="bibr">Saggion, 2015, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Accuosto et al., 2017)</ref>, but none of them investigated dependencies between different tasks. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kirschner et al. (2015)</ref> is the closest to ours, since they also annotated scientific publi- cations with fine-grained argumentation. However, their corpus is in German and contains no anno- tations of other rhetorical dimensions. Moreover, their corpus is significantly smaller than the Dr. In- ventor Corpus ( <ref type="bibr">Fisas et al., 2016)</ref>. In contrast, we augment the Dr. Inventor Corpus with an argumen- tation layer, effectively allowing for combinations of argumentation extraction and other rhetorical analysis tasks in MTL settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Argumentation Mining</head><p>Argumentation mining (AM) refers to extracting (and ideally understanding) arguments from natu- ral language text ( <ref type="bibr">Torroni, 2015, 2016)</ref> and includes tasks like argument detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Palau and Moens, 2009)</ref>, argument component identifica- tion <ref type="bibr">(Daxenberger et al., 2017)</ref>, and argument rela- tion classification <ref type="bibr">(Boltuži´Boltuži´c andŠnajderandˇandŠnajder, 2014</ref>). In their pioneering work on automatic AM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Palau and Moens (2009)</ref> discriminated argumentative from non-argumentative sentences and proposed a rule- based approach for extracting argumentative struc- tures in documents. <ref type="bibr">Gurevych (2016, 2017)</ref> extracted argumentative components from online discussions. They framed the argumentative component extraction as a sequence labeling task and applied structured SVMs as a learning model. Recent work started exploiting dependencies be- tween AM tasks using global optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Peldszus and Stede, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Persing and Ng, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Stab et al., 2014</ref>) and MTL models <ref type="bibr">(Eger et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Niculae et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Peldszus and Stede (2015)</ref> used decoding based on minimum spanning trees to jointly predict argumentative segments and their types as well as argumentative relations, to gener- ate an argumentation graph from text. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Persing and Ng (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stab and Gurevych (2017)</ref> similarly produced argumentative structures by globally op- timizing local predictions of argumentative compo- nents and relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Potash et al. (2017)</ref> proposed a neural architecture based on a pointer network for jointly predicting types of argumentative compo- nents and identifying argumentative relations. In a similar effort, <ref type="bibr">Eger et al. (2017)</ref> combined the AM tasks using the MTL framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Søgaard and Goldberg (2016)</ref>. Remedying for data sparsity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schulz et al. (2018)</ref> treated different argumentation formalisms as different tasks and combined respec- tive extraction tasks and datasets in a MTL setting. In contrast to these efforts that combine several AM subtasks or formalisms with joint optimization and MTL models, in this work we examine the dependencies between argumentative components and other rhetorical aspects of scientific writing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Annotation</head><p>We first briefly describe the Dr. Inventor Cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr">Fisas et al., 2016)</ref>, which we augment with ar- gumentative annotations. We then explain in more detail our argumentation annotation scheme and the annotation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dr. Inventor Corpus</head><p>We chose the Dr. Inventor Corpus ( <ref type="bibr">Fisas et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Fisas et al., , 2016</ref> 10, 789 sentences, it is one of the largest corpora of scientific text manually labeled with rhetorical information. Secondly, it contains four different layers of rhetorical annotations: (1) a discourse layer, specifying discourse roles of sentences, (2) a citation context layer, specifying the textual con- text of citations, (3) a layer with subjective aspect categories assigned to sentences, and (4) a summa- rization relevance layer, indicating how relevant sentences are for the summary. The overview of labels for all annotation layers with the distribution of instances across labels is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For more details on the original Dr. Inventor Corpus we refer the reader to ( <ref type="bibr">Fisas et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">Fisas et al., , 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Argumentation Annotation Scheme</head><p>We considered several existing argumentation frameworks (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Walton et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dung, 1995</ref>, inter alia) and selected the Toulmin's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Toulmin, 2003)</ref> as a starting point for our study. We chose the Toul- min's model because: (1) it is a well-established in philosophy as well as in computer science (e.g, <ref type="bibr">Freeman, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bench-Capon, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Verheij, 2009</ref>, inter alia) and (2) it contains different types of argu- mentative components and relations between them into account, which is useful for fine-grained argu-mentative analyses.</p><p>To test the applicability of the framework for our purposes,we first carried out a small preliminary annotation round with two expert annotators and adjusted the annotation scheme according to their observations.</p><p>Argumentative components. We devised an adapted version of the Toulmin model, 1 containing the following argumentative components:</p><p>• Background claim: An argumentative statement related to the work of other authors, state-of-the- art methods, or common practices;</p><p>"The range of breathtaking realistic 3D models is only limited by the creativity of artists and resolution of devices."</p><p>• Own claim: An argumentative statement about own work, covered by the publication itself;</p><p>"Using our method, character authors may use any tool they like to author characters."</p><p>• Data: A fact that the authors state as evidence that either supports or contradicts a claim.</p><p>"SSD is widely adopted in games, virtual reality, and other realtime applications due to :: its ::::: ease Argumentative components are annotated as arbi- trary spans of text (in terms of length, annotated components ranged from a single token to multiple sentences). Annotators were instructed to annotate the shortest possible span of text that completely captures the argumentative component. Thus, we do not bind arguments to sentences, i.e., we allow for fine-grained argumentative components.</p><p>Argumentative relations. Authors connect ar- gumentative components in order to form convinc- ing reasoning chains. To allow for the detection of long argumentation chains, we also annotated relations between argumentative components. Fol- lowing proposals from previous work <ref type="bibr">(Dung, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bench-Capon, 1998</ref>), we distinguish between three relation types:</p><p>• Supports: indicates that a claim component is supported by a data component or another claim. The (assumed) validity of the supporting compo- nent (data or claim) contributes to the validity of the supported claim.</p><p>• Same claim: connects different mentions of what is essentially the same claim. It is common to re- peat important claims (e.g., the central claim) of the work several times in the publication (claim coreference).</p><p>Further details about the annotation scheme can be found in the annotation guidelines we provided to our annotators. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Annotation Procedure and Results</head><p>Annotation process. We hired four annotators for the task, one of whom we considered to be an expert annotator 3 and executed the process in two phases. In the first phase, we calibrated the annotators for the task in five iterations, on five pub- lications from the Dr. Inventor Corpus. After all annotators labeled one of the five documents, we met with them, discussed the disagreements, iden- tified erroneous annotations, and, when required, revised the annotation guidelines. At the end of the calibration phase, the annotators re-annotated the five calibration publications and resolved the remaining disagreements by consensus. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> we show the IAA for both compo- nent identification and relation classification, in terms of averaged pairwise F 1 score, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> after each of the five calibration iterations. It can be seen that the discussions in the calibration phase helped to get a common understanding of the task among the annotators. However, we note that when con- sidering argumentative relations in addition to the components only, the agreement decreases. Apart from the increased complexity compared to the component identification only this is due to the high ambiguity of argumentative structures, which is one of the main challenges in argument mining, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: IAA evolution over calibration phases (blue for argumentative components; green for re- lations). We report both strict (annotated compo- nents match in span and type; relations match in type and components at both ends match strictly) and relaxed agreement scores (components match in type and overlap in span; relations match in type and their components at both ends match according to the relaxed criterion).</p><p>as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Stab et al. (2014)</ref>. Moreover, dis- agreements in the argumentative component iden- tification are propagated and cause disagreements in relation annotations, since relation annotations match only when the agreement criterion for the components at both ends is met. Interestingly, the average agreement of our expert annotator with non-expert annotators was similar to the average agreement between non-expert annotators. This is encouraging, because it suggests that annotating argumentative structures in scientific text does not require expert knowledge of the domain. In the second phase, we evenly split the remaining 35 documents of the Dr. Inventor Corpus among the four annotators, without any overlaps.</p><p>The augmented corpus. We make the Dr. Inven- tor Corpus augmented with argumentation anno- tations (together with the annotation guidelines) publicly available. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The final corpus contains 12, 289 annotations of argumentative components and 6, 530 relation annotations. We show the dis- tributions of labels in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The number of own claims doubles the num- ber of background claims. This is not surprising considering that the Dr. Inventor Corpus contains only original research articles (i.e., no survey nor <ref type="bibr">5</ref>    <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Normalized mutual information between the label sets of the annotation layers indicating argument components (AC), discourse roles (DR), subjective aspects (SA), and citation contexts (CC) in the extended Dr. Inventor Corpus.</p><p>position articles), in which authors primarily em- phasize the contributions of their own work. There are two main reasons for having a smaller num- ber of data components compared to claims. On one hand, there are longer argumentative chains in which claims are supported by other claims (i.e., only the first claim is supported by the data com- ponent). On the other hand, there is also a non- negligible amount of standalone (i.e., unsupported and unchallenged) claims, implied also by having less annotated relations than claims.</p><p>To obtain an initial insight on the interrelations between the different rhetorical aspects in scientific writing, we conduct an information-theoretic anal- ysis and assess the amount of information shared among the annotation layers by computing the nor- malized mutual information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Strehl and Ghosh, 2003)</ref>. Normalized mutual information is a vari- ant of mutual information, which has been shown to correlate with the gains that can be obtained in multi-task learning settings <ref type="bibr">(Bjerva, 2017)</ref>. The results can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The strongest link is observed between argument components and dis- course roles, followed by argument components and citation contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Multi-task Learning for Rhetorical Analysis of Scientific Writing</head><p>We next exploit the augmented corpus to exploit the dependencies between argumentation and other rhetorical dimensions. To this end, we adopt neural MTL as a methodological framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Tasks</head><p>The following are the rhetorical analysis and argu- ment extraction tasks we investigate.</p><p>Argumentative Component Identification (ACI). The task is to extract and classify argumentative components. We frame ACI as a token-level sequence labeling task: given a sequence of tokens x = (x 1 , .., x n ) of length n, the task is to assign a sequence of tags y aci = (y 1 , .., y n ), y i ∈ Y aci . The tagset Y aci contains seven token-level tags, obtained by combining the standard B-I-O annotation scheme with three types of argumentative components: Own claim, Background claim, and Data.</p><p>Discourse Role Classification (DRC). The multi-class classification task in which each sen- tence needs to be assigned one out of the set of discourse roles Y drc = {Background, Unspecified, Challenge, FutureWork, Approach, Outcome}.</p><p>Citation Context Identification (CCI). The task is to identify the span of the publication text that introduces or explains a reference. It is also a token-level sequence-labeling task -a sequence of tags y cci = (y 1 , .., y n ) with y i ∈ Y cci = {B CC , I CC , O} is assigned to a sequence of to- kens x = (x 1 , .., x n ).</p><p>Subjective Aspect Classification (SAC). An- other sentence-level classification task in which each sentence is assigned one of the subjective aspect labels, Y sac = {None, Limitation, Advantage, Disadvantage-Advantage, Disadvantage, Common Practice, Novelty, Advantage-Disadvantage}.</p><p>Summary Relevance Classification (SRC).</p><p>The task is to predict the relevance of a sentence for the (extractive) summary of the publication. Each sentence needs to be assigned one of the labels Y src = {Very relevant, Relevant, May appear, Should not appear, Totally irrelevant}.</p><p>ACI and CCI are token-level sequence labeling tasks. The remaining three tasks can be cast as either (1) plain sentence classification tasks or (2) sentence-level sequence labeling tasks (assuming that there are regularities in sequences of sentence- level labels that can be captured). We propose one MTL architecture for each of the two possibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Multi-Task Learning Models</head><p>We propose two different MTL architectures for the rhetorical and argumentative analysis of scientific publications. The Simple model treats sentence- level tasks (DRC, SAC, and SRC) as plain classifi- cation tasks (i.e., the prediction for each sentence ignores the content and labels of other, neighbor- ing sentences). The Hierarchical model addresses sentence-level tasks as sequence labeling tasks. This model can be seen as a hierarchical sequence labeling model, in which the sentence-level recur- rent network is stacked on top of the token-level sequence labeling network. Both architectures are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Token-level Predictions. Given a sentence s i = (x i1 , .., x in ) out of a sequence of sentences d = (s 1 , .., s m ) we first retrieve the pre-trained embed- ding vector for each token x ij .We then obtain context-aware token representations h ij by apply- ing a bidirectional recurrent network with long short-term memory cells (Hochreiter and Schmid- huber, 1997) on the sequence of pre-trained word embeddings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">hij = [ − −−− → LSTM (xi1, . . . , xij); ← −−− − LSTM (xin, . . . , xij)] . (1)</formula><p>This token-level Bi-LSTM encoder is shared be- tween the tasks combined by the MTL models. Next, we define a separate classifier for each of the token-level (TL) tasks (i.e., ACI and CCI) and feed the contextualized token representations h ij to these classifiers.

We learn to aggre- gate a sentence representation s i from contextu- alized vectors of its tokens, h ij (produced by the  token-level Bi-LSTM), using the intra-sentence at- tention mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>:</p></div>

All of the tasks we consider are framed as multi-class clas- sification tasks. Thus, we simply specify all task- specific losses to be L2-regularized cross-entropy errors. Let y to be the one-hot ground truth label vector for the prediction instance o 6 of the task t, and let y to be the predicted probability distribution over the task labels for the same instance. With Y t as the set of labels for task t, the task-specific loss L t is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Lt = λΩt2 − o |Y t | k=1 y (k) to · ln y (k) to ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where Ω t is the set of model's parameters relevant for the task t 7 and λ is the regularization factor. We train the MTL model jointly on different tasks by defining and minimizing the joint loss function L that combines task-specific losses L t . Instead of us- ing constant weights, we opt for dynamic weighting of task-specific losses during the training process, based on the homoscedastic uncertainty of tasks, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kendall et al. (2018)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L = t 1 2σ 2 t Lt + ln σ 2 t , (9)</formula><p>where σ t is the variance of the task-specific loss over training instances, used to quantify the uncer- tainty of task t. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kendall et al. (2018)</ref> show that better MTL results can be obtained by dynamically assigning less weight to the more uncertain tasks, as opposed to constant task weights throughout the whole training process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>We run two sets of experiments. First, we evaluate the performance of the Simple and the Hierarchical neural models on individual tasks (i.e., in single- task learning (STL) scenarios). We then evaluate the impact of the argumentative signal on other dimensions of rhetorical analysis by combining them in joint MTL settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setup.</head><p>We randomly split the corpus on the document- level into train (roughly 70%, 28 documents con- taining 6,697 sentences) and test portions (roughly 30%; 12 documents with 2,874 sentences). We used roughly 20% of the train portion as the valida- tion set for model selection.</p><p>Model configuration and training. We ran an initial grid search on the validation set with pos- sible values for the hyperparameters learning rate ν ∈ {10 −4 , 10 −5 }, L2 regularization factor λ ∈ {0.001, 0, 0001}, and LSTM states K ∈ {64, 128, 256} and found the hyperparameter con- figuration ν = 10 −4 , λ = 0.001, and K = 128 to be optimal for the vast majority of the STL and MTL models. In all experiments, we represent tokens with pre-trained 300-dimensional GloVe embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) 8 and opti- mize the model parameters using the Adam algo- rithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kingma and Ba, 2015)</ref>. We initialize all model parameters using Xavier initialization <ref type="bibr">(Glorot and Bengio, 2010)</ref>, train the models in batches of N = 16 sentences and apply early stopping based on the validation set performance.</p><p>Baselines. As a type of "sanity check", we first compare the performance of the two neural ar- chitectures against traditional supervised machine learning algorithms on each of the tasks separately.    <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> SVM with RBF kernel and embedding features. In the latter case we obtain a sentence representation by averaging the pre-trained embeddings of sentence words. We tune the hyperparameter values of the SVM by conducting a grid search with possible pe- nality parameter values c ∈ {0.1, 1.0, 10.0} (linear SVM and SVM with RBF kernel) and the parame- ter of the radial basis function γ ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 1.0} (SVM with RBF kernel). The possible hyperparam- eter values for the L1 regularization coefficient c1 and for L2 regularization coefficient c2 of the CRF are c1, c2 ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.001, 0.0001}.</p><p>In MTL experiments, we consider the respective task performances from single-task experiments and MTL with a joint loss function with equal weighting of the task losses as baselines.</p><p>Single-Task Experiments. We first report the model performances for individual tasks in STL settings. Results for token-level tasks are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>, whereas <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> displays results for sentence-level tasks. The scores (precision, recall, and F 1 score) are reported as macro-averages over all task labels. Expectedly, our neural architec- tures substantially outperform the traditional ma- chine learning baselines on all tasks. For the three sentence-level tasks, the Hierarchical architecture outperforms the Simple model only when classify- ing sentences by summary relevance (SRC). This result seems intuitive -a Very relevant sentence is likely to be surrounded with Relevant and May  appear sentences (and an Irrelevant sentence with other Irrelevant and Should not appear sentences). The fact that we observe no gains from the ad- ditional sentence-level Bi-LSTM encoder for the DRC and SAC tasks suggests that the content of the sentence informs its discourse role and subjec- tive aspect much more strongly than neighboring sentences. In other words, the DRC and SAC seem to be more localized classification tasks than SRC.</p><p>Multi-Task Learning Results. Our core re- search question relates to the effect that recogniz- ing fine-grained argumentative components has on other rhetorical analysis tasks. This is why, in our central set of experiments, we evaluate MTL models with homoscedastic uncertainty weighting which combine the ACI (as an auxiliary task) with each of the four other tasks. In each multi-task learning model, the token-level Bi-LSTM encoder is shared between the two tasks. For sentence- level tasks (DRC, SAC, SRC), we evaluate both the Simple and Hierarchical architecture. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table  6</ref> we show the performance of the MTL models on rhetorical analysis tasks (these can be compared to the respective single-task model performances from <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 4 and 5</ref>. When coupled in MTL settings with argumenta- tion component identification (ACI) using the joint loss formulation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kendall et al. (2018)</ref>, the results significantly <ref type="bibr">10</ref> improve for all rhetorical analysis tasks and models (except for SAC with the Hierar- chical model), in comparison with the respective single-task models. However, the performance for the argumentation component identification does not improve in MTL. In other words, the extraction of fine-grained argumentative components seems to inform higher-level rhetorical analysis tasks, but not vice-versa. This indeed supports the hypothe- sis that argumentation guides scientific writing and influences rhetorical structure of publications. Fur- thermore, our results support the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schulz et al. (2018)</ref> who show that, opposed to initial re- sults of <ref type="bibr">Alonso and Plank (2017)</ref>, MTL can yield performance gains for higher-level semantic tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>Acknowledging the argumentative nature of scien- tific text, we investigated the role of argumentation in the rhetorical analysis of scientific publications. We first extended an existing corpus annotated with four different layers of rhetorical information with annotations of argumentative components and re- lations, creating the largest argumentation-labeled corpus of scientific text in English. We explored in- tuitive neural architectures with recurrent encoders for argument extraction and rhetorical analysis tasks and showed significant improvements over traditional machine learning models. We then cou- pled argument extraction with different rhetorical analysis tasks in MTL models with dynamic loss weighting and demonstrated that the argumentative signal has a positive impact on high-level rhetorical analysis tasks.</p><p>Admittedly, the corpus we used in this work is limited to the domain of computer graphics. Nonetheless, we believe that our findings relating to the argumentative nature of scientific text and links between argumentation and other rhetorical aspects generalize to other domains too. This is also supported by the comparable agreement ob- served between expert and non-expert annotators.</p><p>In the future work, we would like to extend the collection of scientific text to other fields. Next, we intend to explore a wider range of MTL mod- els, especially those involving more than two tasks. Having annotated argumentative relations, we will work on models for their automated identification in scientific publications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>:: of :::::::::::::: implementation and ::: low :::: cost ::: of :::::::::: computing."</figDesc></figure>
