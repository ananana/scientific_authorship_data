				<p>Identifying optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints and users from Twitter is useful for providing better social support to those who need such support, and for minimizing the negative influence among users and maximizing the spread of positive attitudes and ideas. In this paper, we explore a range of deep learning models to predict optimism and pessimism in Twitter at both tweet and user level and show that these models substantially outperform traditional machine learning classifiers used in prior work. In addition, we show evidence that a sentiment classifier would not be sufficient for accurately predicting optimism and pessimism in Twitter. Last, we study the verb tense usage as well as the presence of polarity words in optimistic and pessimistic tweets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>"You know, ever since we were little, I would get this feeling like... Like I'm floating outside of my body, looking down at myself... And I hate what I see... How I'm acting, the way I sound. And I don't know how to change it. And I'm so scared... That the feeling is never gonna go away."</p><p>The Edge of Seventeen 1</p><p>Much has been written about optimism and pessimism in psychological studies for decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Scheier and Carver, 1992)</ref>. These feelings are af- fected by one's personality from an early age (as pinpointed above) and can strongly impact one's psychological and physical health. For exam- ple, pessimism and negative attitudes impact neg- atively one's mental health, can induce suicidal thoughts, and affect negatively not only the per- son in question, but also their family and friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Peterson and Bossio, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Achat et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Scheier et al., 2001</ref>). On the other hand, optimism reduces stress and promotes better physical health and overall well-being <ref type="bibr">(Carver et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Despite that optimism and pessimism are un- der the scrutiny of many researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Rasmussen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kumar et al., 2017</ref>), large scale anal- yses that explore optimism and pessimism in so- cial media have just started to emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ruan et al., 2016</ref>). However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruan et al. (2016)</ref> focused on identifying optimism and pessimism in Twitter us- ing a simple "bag of words" representation with no emphasis on incorporating semantic information hidden in text. Often, a deeper understanding of the text that accounts for textual semantic similar- ities and the writer's intention are required in order to correctly detect the characteristics of optimistic and pessimistic feelings in tweets. Towards this end, our contributions in this paper are as follows. First, we focus on the question: "Would a deep learning approach help to discover these charac- teristics better than traditional machine learning classifiers used in prior work?" To our knowl- edge, we take the first step towards exploring the performance of deep learning models for opti- mism/pessimism prediction in Twitter and iden- tify the most promising deep learning models for this task. Identifying optimism and pessimism in Twitter has many applications including identify- ing suicidal/depressive people and providing bet- ter social support (e.g., emotional/empathetic sup- port) that can improve people's moods and atti- tudes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yan and Tan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Biyani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Khanpour et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Khanpour et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Second, since it may seem intuitive that a pos- itive sentiment is associated with optimism and a negative sentiment with pessimism, we address the question: "Would a sentiment classifier be suffi- cient to correctly identify optimism and pessimism in social media?" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows evidence that a sentiment tool would not suffice on accurately predicting tweets with pessimistic and optimistic connotations (left and right side of the figure, re- spectively). We answer the above question by in- vestigating a spectrum of sentiment analysis tools and datasets for optimism/pessimism prediction.</p><p>Third, we perform a linguistic analysis, first of its kind, and study the usage of verb tenses (past, present, future) in optimistic and pessimistic tweets, as well as the presence of polarity words associated with both types of tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Datasets</head><p>In this section, we first describe the optimism/ pessimism Twitter dataset and then present two datasets used for sentiment analysis.</p><p>The Optimism/Pessimism Twitter dataset (OPT) was made available to us by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruan et al. (2016)</ref>. The total number of tweets in the dataset is 7,475. These tweets were sampled from data corresponding to 500 optimist and 500 pessimist users, and were manually annotated using Ama- zon Mechanical Turk. Precisely, each tweet was manually annotated by five independent annota- tors using a score between −3 (very pessimistic) and 3 (very optimistic). For our evaluation, we consider two different thresholds (0 and 1/-1) on the above score and create two settings as follows. In the first evaluation setting, a tweet is labeled as pessimistic if its score is smaller than or equal to 0, and optimistic, otherwise. In the second evaluation setting, a tweet is labeled as pessimistic if its score is smaller than or equal to −1, and optimistic if its score is greater than or equal to 1. A summary of this dataset is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.  The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Socher et al., 2013</ref>) is a corpus for sentiment analysis that capture complex linguistic patterns. This dataset 2 is based on a dataset originally in- troduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Pang and Lee (2005)</ref> and consists of 10,662 sentences from movie reviews downloaded from rottentomatoes.com. From these sentences, 215,154 phrases were extracted using the Stanford Parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Klein and Manning, 2003)</ref> and labeled using Amazon Mechanical Turk such that each phrase was annotated by 3 human judges.</p><p>The Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA) dataset, 3 available online for download, contains 1,578,627 tweets that are classified as 1 for positive senti- ment and 0 for negative sentiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments and Results</head><p>In experiments, we explore several deep learning models for optimism/pessimism prediction. The general training strategy is as follows: sentence embeddings are fed into a sentence encoder to obtain the sentence representation. The classi- fier consists of three fully connected layers topped by a softmax layer. Dropout was applied to the first layer only. We used several encoders as fol- lows, based on: (1) Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory networks (BiLSTMs), which are a spe- cial type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997); (2) Convo- lutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which consist of convolution and max pooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Kim, 2014)</ref>; and (3) Stacked Gated RNNs ( <ref type="bibr">Chung et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>We used SGD optimizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Goodfellow et al., 2016</ref>) with a learning rate of 0.1 and no weight de- cay. At every tenth epoch we decreased the learn-  For sentence embedding, after a cleanup pro- cess, sentences were transformed into a list of words, then words were replaced with word em- beddings (GloVe) and padding was used to align batch sentences to the same size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Optimism/Pessimism Prediction</head><p>In our first experiment, we explore the above deep learning models on the OPT dataset and com- pare their performance with that of two traditional machine learning classifiers, Na¨ıveNa¨ıve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which were used in the previous work for this task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruan et al. (2016)</ref>. In this experiment, the OPT dataset is split in train-dev-test as 80-10-10(%), respec- tively. We repeated each experiment 5 times and averaged the results. Our deep learning implemen- tation is built on top of TensorFlow ( <ref type="bibr">Abadi et al., 2015)</ref>. For NB and SVM, we used their implemen- tation available in scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the accuracy of all these models at tweet and user level for the two thresh- olds 0 and 1/-1 (as discussed in Section 2).</p><p>We can see that overall, the deep learning mod- els achieve a much higher performance compared with the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruan et al. (2016)</ref>, i.e., the NB and SVM classifiers on "bag of words," for both tweet and user level with both thresholds, yield- ing an improvement in performance between 5%- 10%. For example, at tweet level and 1/-1 thresh- old, CNN yields an accuracy of 90.32% as com- pared with NB, which achieves an accuracy of 84.10%. At user level and 1/-1 threshold, GRUS- tack yields an accuracy of 92.24%, as compared with 81.80% achieved by SVM. Not surprising, for both tweet and user level, when we use a threshold of 0, the performance of all models is smaller compared with that of models obtained when we use a 1/-1 threshold. Intuitively, this is true since most of the tweets with a human- annotated score between -1 and 1 are in the "gray" area that is harder to classify. Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruan et al. (2016)</ref> considered the tweets with a score between -1 and 1 as being neutral.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sentiment vs. Optimism/Pessimism</head><p>In our second experiment, we investigate the cor- relation between sentiment and optimism / pes- simism, and argue that sentiment analyzers, that are trained to predict sentiment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Liu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Pang and Lee, 2008)</ref>, fail to detect optimism and pes- simism. Specifically, we train several sentiment classifiers on the large SST and TSA sentiment datasets (described in Section 2) and evaluate the performance of these classifiers on the opti- mism/pessimism categories from the OPT dataset.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows the performance of several deep learning models trained on either SST or TSA datasets and evaluated on the OPT dataset. Note that the Dev set was used for model selection. As can be seen from the table, the models trained on the sentiment datasets perform poorly on the op- timism/pessimism dataset. For example, there is a drop in performance from 80.19% to 67.60% when training on TSA (with an even larger de- crease when we train on SST).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>The SST/TSA sentiment classifiers are trained to predict the sentiment as negative, neutral, or positive. To calculate the accuracy in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>, an optimistic tweet predicted as positive by the sentiment classifier counts as a correct predic- tion, whereas an optimistic tweet predicted as ei- ther neutral or negative by the sentiment classi- fier counts as an incorrect prediction (similarly for pessimistic tweets). This analysis is done at tweet level for the threshold of 0.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the normalized number of ex- amples from optimism and pessimism categories classified as positive, negative and neutral, using the CNN model trained on TSA. Precisely, we show how many tweets from the set of optimistic (or pessimistic) tweets in the OPT dataset are pre- dicted as negative, neutral or positive by the TSA sentiment classifier. The numbers on each row sum up to 1. As we can see from the figure, al- though pessimism is more correlated with a nega- tive sentiment, 13% of the pessimistic tweets are classified as positive (with similar results on the optimism category).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Linguistic Analysis</head><p>In this section, we perform a linguistic analysis and study the usage of verb tenses in optimistic and pessimistic tweets, as well as the presence of polarity words associated with both types of tweets. This analysis is done at tweet level with 1/- 1 threshold. The reason for using the 1/-1 thresh- old is that we wanted to study the usage of verb tenses and polarity words in tweets that are clear optimistic or clear pessimistic (far from the deci- sion boundary).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Verb Tenses in Optimism/Pessimism</head><p>For this analysis, we used the part of speech tagger spaCy <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and assigned the verbs to their correspond- ing tenses according to the Penn Treebank Project; that is, the tags VBD and VBN correspond to past tense, VBG, VBZ , VBP correspond to present tense, whereas an MD tag followed by VB (pos- sibly with a negation between them) corresponds to the future tense.</p><p>As mentioned, a tweet was considered optimist if its manually annotated score was above 1 and pessimist if the score was below −1. The num- bers of tweets with past, present, and future tenses in the optimistic category are: 1,474, 7,444, and 561, respectively, whereas these numbers in the pessimistic category are: 1,276, 5,311, and 325, respectively.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the normalized verb occurrences at past, present and future tenses in optimistic and pessimistic tweets. As can be seen from the fig- ure, the present tense is the most prevalent for both categories, although there are more present tense verbs in the optimistic category compared with the pessimistic one. We can also observe that more past tense verbs occur in the pessimistic category and less future tense verbs in the pessimistic one.</p><p>While there are some common verbs such as "be," "have," and "do," that appear most fre- quently in both optimistic and pessimistic cate- gories at all three tenses, there are some verbs that are more specific to one category than the other. Examples of such verbs and their frequencies from both categories at the present tense are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. As we can see, optimism is characterized more by verbs with a positive connotation.</p><p>[optimism]</p><p>[pessimism] ('be', 1662)  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Polarity Words in Optimism/Pessimism</head><p>Next, we analyze the association of polarity words from the positive and negative lexicons con- structed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hu and Liu (2004)</ref>, in both tweet cat- egories: optimism and pessimism. Instead of us- ing the presence or absence of the words from the two lexicons in tweets, we calculated the cosine similarity between the word embeddings of the words in the two lexicons with the words in the tweets. If the similarity is above 0.8, then we con- sider the word from the corresponding lexicon to be present in the tweet (or synonym with a word in tweet). Using the cosine similarity between the word embeddings of words in lexicons with words in tweets captures not only the exact match be- tween the words (a cosine similarity of 1 for exact match), but also incorporates the semantic infor- mation that exists in the text. Although this word similarity computation re- laxes the exact match/presence of a word in a tweet and aims at incorporating semantic similarity, a high similarity between antonyms may occur since word embeddings are known to not differentiate well between synonyms and antonyms, which tend to appear in similar contexts.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the number of polarity words in optimistic and pessimistic tweets. As shown in the figure, more positive words appear in optimistic tweets compared with negative words (1,242 vs. 71), while there is not a substantial difference be- tween the numbers of positive and negative words in pessimistic tweets <ref type="bibr">(118 vs. 210)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the top most frequent polarity words associated with optimism and pessimism. As we can see, words with a negative polarity (e.g., bad) although not very frequent, still appear in optimistic tweets. This supports our intuition that a sentiment model is not enough to accurately predict pessimism and optimism in Twitter. <ref type="bibr">Optimism [positive]</ref> [negative] ('great', 289) ('bad', 13) <ref type="bibr">('loved', 279)</ref> ('worried', 11) ('wonderful', 155) ('lost', 6) ('glad', 76)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">('scared', 5) ('kind', 45) ('terrible', 4) ('thrilled', 29) ('disappointed', 3) Pessimism [positive]</formula><p>[negative] <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">('great', 29)</ref> ('bad', 36) <ref type="bibr">('kind', 27)</ref> ('lost', 18) ('loved', 13)</p><p>('scared', 16) ('wonderful', 9) ('alone', 13) <ref type="bibr">('surprised', 8)</ref> ('terrible', 12) ('glad', 6) ('terrified', 12) <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Top frequent polarity words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Concluding Remarks</head><p>In this paper, we explored deep learning models for optimism and pessimism prediction in Twitter and showed that these models substantially out- perform traditional classifiers such as Na¨ıveNa¨ıve Bayes and Support Vector Machines. To our knowledge, this work is the first computational study that ex- plores optimism and pessimism using deep learn- ing. We also showed that a sentiment classifier would not be sufficient for accurately predicting optimism and pessimism. This topic is less ex- plored despite its importance in many applications such as identifying suicidal/depressive people. Interesting future directions are: understanding how one's age is correlated with optimism / pes- simism; if one user is characterized by a mixture of topics, is that user optimist (pessimist) across all these topics? Thus, decomposing a user's tex- tual data into topic and correlating this with op- timism and pessimism may be interesting to ex- plore; last, studying how optimism and pessimism are affected by sarcasm.</p><p>As we started our study with a pessimistic quote from the movie "The Edge of Seventeen," we end our study with a quote from the same movie, with a positive sentiment and full of optimism: "Life's about taking risks. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there."</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Sentiment prediction on tweets with pessimist (left) and optimist (right) connotations.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,75.87,66.60,219.51,127.58" type="bitmap" /></figure>
