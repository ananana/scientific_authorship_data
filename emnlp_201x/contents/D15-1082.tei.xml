				<p>Representation learning of knowledge bases aims to embed both entities and relations into a low-dimensional space. Most existing methods only consider direct relations in representation learning. We argue that multiple-step relation paths also contain rich inference patterns between entities, and propose a path-based representation learning model. This model considers relation paths as translations between entities for representation learning , and addresses two key challenges: (1) Since not all relation paths are reliable, we design a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure the reliability of relation paths. (2) We represent relation paths via semantic composition of relation embeddings. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, as compared with baselines, our model achieves significant and consistent improvements on knowledge base completion and relation extraction from text.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>People have recently built many large-scale knowledge bases (KBs) such as Freebase, DBpe- dia and YAGO. These KBs consist of facts about the real world, mostly in the form of triples, e.g., (Steve Jobs, FounderOf, Apple Inc.). KBs are important resources for many applications such as question answering and Web search. Although typical KBs are large in size, usually containing thousands of relation types, millions of entities and billions of facts (triples), they are far from * Corresponding author: Z. <ref type="bibr">Liu (liuzy@tsinghua.edu.cn)</ref> complete. Hence, many efforts have been invested in relation extraction to enrich KBs.</p><p>Recent studies reveal that, neural-based repre- sentation learning methods are scalable and ef- fective to encode relational knowledge with low- dimensional representations of both entities and relations, which can be further used to extract unknown relational facts. <ref type="bibr">TransE (Bordes et al., 2013</ref>) is a typical method in the neural-based ap- proach, which learns vectors (i.e., embeddings) for both entities and relations. The basic idea behind TransE is that, the relationship between two enti- ties corresponds to a translation between the em- beddings of the entities, that is, h + r ≈ t when the triple (h, r, t) holds. Since TransE has issues when modeling 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N rela- tions, various methods such as TransH ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wang et al., 2014</ref>) and TransR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lin et al., 2015)</ref> are pro- posed to assign an entity with different represen- tations when involved in various relations.</p><p>Despite their success in modeling relational facts, TransE and its extensions only take di- rect relations between entities into considera- tion. It is known that there are also substan- tial multiple-step relation paths between entities indicating their semantic relationships. The re- lation paths reflect complicated inference pat- terns among relations in KBs. For example, the relation path h Nationality between h and t, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(h, Nationality, t)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we aim at extending TransE to model relation paths for representation learning of KBs, and propose path-based TransE (PTransE). In PTransE, in addition to direct connected rela- tional facts, we also build triples from KBs us- ing entity pairs connected with relation paths. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, TransE only considers direct relations between entities, e.g., h r − → t, builds a triple (h, r, t), and optimizes the objec-tive h + r = t. PTransE generalizes TransE by regarding multiple-step relation paths as con- nections between entities. Take the 2-step path h r 1 − → e 1 r 2 − → t for example as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. Besides building triples (h, r 1 , e 1 ) and (e 1 , r 2 , t) for learning as in TransE, PTransE also builds a triple (h, r 1 • r 2 , t), and optimizes the objective h + (r 1 • r 2 ) = t, where • is an operation to join the relations r 1 and r 2 together into a unified rela- tion path representation. As compared with TransE, PTransE takes rich relation paths in KBs for learning. There are two critical challenges that make PTransE nontrivial to learn from relation paths:</p><p>Relation Path Reliability. Not all relation paths are meaningful and reliable for learning. For example, there is often a relation path h Hence, it is inappropriate to consider all relation paths in our model. In experiments, we find that those re- lation paths that lead to lots of possible tail enti- ties are mostly unreliable for the entity pair. In this paper, we propose a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure the reliability of relation paths. Afterwards, we select the reliable relation paths for representation learning.</p><p>Relation Path Representation. In order to take relation paths into consideration, relation paths should also be represented in a low-dimensional space. It is straightforward that the semantic meaning of a relation path depends on all relations in this path. Given a relation path p = (r 1 , . . . , r l ) , we will define and learn a binary operation func- tion (•) to obtain the path embedding p by re- cursively composing multiple relations, i.e., p = r 1 • . . . • r l .</p><p>With relation path selection and representation, PTransE learns entity and relation embeddings by regarding relation paths as translations between the corresponding entities. In experiments, we select a typical KB, Freebase, to build datasets and carry out evaluation on three tasks, including entity prediction, relation prediction and relation extraction from text. Experimental results show that, PTransE significantly outperforms TransE and other baseline methods on all three tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our Model</head><p>In this section, we introduce path-based TransE (PTransE) that learns representations of entities and relations considering relation paths. In TransE and PTransE, we have entity set E and relation set R, and learn to encode both entities and re- lations in R k . Given a KB represented by a set of triples S = {(h, r, t)} with each triple composed of two entities h, t ∈ E and their relation r ∈ R. Our model is expected to return a low energy score when the relation holds, and a high one otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">TransE and PTransE</head><p>For each triple (h, r, t), TransE regards the relation as a translation vector r between two entity vectors h and t. The energy function is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E(h, r, t) = ||h + r − t||,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>which is expected to get a low score when (h, r, t) holds, and high otherwise. TransE only learns from direct relations be- tween entities but ignores multiple-step relation paths, which also contain rich inference patterns between entities. PTransE take relation paths into consideration for representation learning.</p><p>Suppose there are multiple relation paths P (h, t) = {p 1 , . . . , p N } connecting two entities h and t, where relation path p = (r 1 , . . . , r l ) indi- cates h</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r 1 − → . . . r l − → t.</formula><p>For each triple (h, r, t), the energy function is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G(h, r, t) = E(h, r, t) + E(h, P, t),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where E(h, r, t) models correlations between rela- tions and entities with direct relation triples, as de- fined in Equation (1). E(h, P, t) models the infer- ence correlations between relations with multiple- step relation path triples, which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E(h, P, t) = 1 Z p∈P (h,t) R(p|h, t)E(h, p, t),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where R(p|h, t) indicates the reliability of the re- lation path p given the entity pair (h, t), Z = p∈P (h,t) R(p|h, t) is a normalization factor, and E(h, p, t) is the energy function of the triple (h, p, t).</p><p>For the energy of each triple (h, p, t), the com- ponent R(p|h, t) concerns about relation path reli- ability, and E(h, p, t) concerns about relation path representation. We introduce the two components in detail as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Relation Path Reliability</head><p>We propose a path-constraint resource allocation (PCRA) algorithm to measure the reliability of a relation path. Resource allocation over networks was originally proposed for personalized recom- mendation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhou et al., 2007)</ref>, and has been suc- cessfully used in information retrieval for measur- ing relatedness between two objects (Lü and Zhou, 2011). Here we extend it to PCRA to measure the reliability of relation paths. The basic idea is, we assume that a certain amount of resource is associ- ated with the head entity h, and will flow following the given path p. We use the resource amount that eventually flows to the tail entity t to measure the reliability of the path p as a meaningful connection between h and t.</p><p>Formally, for a path triple (h, p, t), we compute the resource amount flowing from h to t given the path p = (r 1 , . . . , r l ) as follows. Starting from h and following the relation path p, we can write the flowing path as S 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r 1 − → S 1 r 2 − → . . . r l − → S l , where S 0 = h and t ∈ S l .</formula><p>For any entity m ∈ S i , we denote its direct pre- decessors along relation r i in S i−1 as S i−1 (·, m). The resource flowing to m is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R p (m) = n∈S i−1 (·,m) 1 |S i (n, ·)| R p (n), (4)</formula><p>where S i (n, ·) is the direct successors of n ∈ S i−1 following the relation r i , and R p (n) is the resource obtained from the entity n.</p><p>For each relation path p, we set the initial re- source in h as R p (h) = 1. By performing re- source allocation recursively from h through the path p, the tail entity t eventually obtains the re- source R p (t) which indicates how much informa- tion of the head entity h can be well translated. We use R p (t) to measure the reliability of the path p given (h, t), i.e., R(p|h, t) = R p (t).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Relation Path Representation</head><p>Besides relation path reliability, we also need to define energy function E(h, p, t) for the path triple (h, p, t) in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2)</ref>. Similar with the en- ergy function of TransE in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, we will also represent the relation path p in the embedding space. The semantic meaning of a relation path con- siderably relies on its involved relations. It is thus reasonable for us to build path embeddings via se- mantic composition of relation embeddings. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>, the path embedding p is composed by the embeddings of BorninCity, CityInState and StateInCountry.</p><p>Formally, for a path p = (r 1 , . . . , r l ), we define a composition operation • and obtain path embed- ding as p = r 1 • . . . • r l . In this paper, we consider three types of composition operation:</p><p>Addition (ADD). The addition operation ob- tains the vector of a path by summing up the vec- tors of all relations, which is formalized as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p = r 1 + . . . + r l .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Multiplication (MUL). The multiplication op- eration obtains the vector of a path as the cumula- tive product of the vectors of all relations, which is formalized as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p = r 1 · . . . · r l .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Both addition and multiplication operations are simple and have been extensively investigated in semantic composition of phrases and sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mitchell and Lapata, 2008)</ref>. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNN is a recent neural-based model for semantic composi- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mikolov et al., 2010</ref>). The composition op- eration is realized using a matrix W:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">c i = f (W [c i−1 ; r i ]),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where f is a non-linearity or identical function, and <ref type="bibr">[a; b]</ref> represents the concatenation of two vec-tors. By setting c 1 = r 1 and recursively perform- ing RNN following the relation path, we will fi- nally obtain p = c n . RNN has also been used for representation learning of relation paths in KBs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Neelakantan et al., 2015)</ref>. For a multiple-step relation path triple (h, p, t), we could have followed TransE and define the energy function as E(h, p, t) = ||h + p − t||. However, since we have minimized ||h + r − t|| with the direct relation triple (h, r, t) to make sure r ≈ t−h, we may directly define the energy func- tion of (h, p, t) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E(h, p, t) = ||p − (t − h)|| = ||p − r|| = E(p, r),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>which is expected to be a low score when the multiple-relation path p is consistent with the di- rect relation r, and high otherwise, without using entity embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Objective Formalization</head><p>We formalize the optimization objective of PTransE as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L(S) = (h,r,t)∈S L(h, r, t)+ 1 Z p∈P (h,t) R(p|h, t)L(p, r) .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Following TransE, L(h, r, t) and L(p, r) are margin-based loss functions with respect to the triple (h, r, t) and the pair (p, r):</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L(h, r, t) = (h ,r ,t )∈S − [γ + E(h, r, t) − E(h , r , t )]+,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L(p, r) = (h,r ,t)∈S − [γ + E(p, r) − E(p, r )]+,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where [x] + = max(0, x) returns the maximum be- tween 0 and x, γ is the margin, S is the set of valid triples existing in a KB and S − is the set of invalid triples. The objective will favor lower scores for valid triples as compared with invalid triples. The invalid triple set with respect to (h, r, t) is defined as S − = {(h , r, t)}∪{(h, r , t)}∪{(h, r, t )}. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> That is, the set of invalid triples is composed of the original valid triple (h, r, t) with one of three components replaced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Optimization and Implementation Details</head><p>For optimization, we employ stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the loss function. We randomly select a valid triple from the training set iteratively for learning. In the implementation, we also enforce constraints on the norms of the em- beddings h, r, t. That is, we set h 2 ≤ 1, r 2 ≤ 1, t 2 ≤ 1. ∀h, r, t.</p><p>(13) There are also some implementation details that will significantly influence the performance of representation learning, which are introduced as follows.</p><p>Reverse Relation Addition. In some cases, we are interested in the reverse version of a relation, which may not be presented in KBs. Path Selection Limitation. There are usually large amount of relations and facts about each en- tity pair. It will be impractical to enumerate all possible relation paths between head and tail en- tities. For example, if each entity refers to more than 100 relations on average, which is common in Freebase, there will be billions of 4-step paths. Even for 2-step or 3-step paths, it will be time- consuming to consider all of them without limita- tion. For computational efficiency, in this paper we restrict the length of paths to at most 3-steps and consider those relation paths with the reliabil- ity score larger than 0.01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Complexity Analysis</head><p>We denote N e as the number of entities, N r as the number of relations and K as the vector di- mension. The model parameter size of PTransE is (N e K + N r K), which is the same as TransE. PTransE follows the optimization procedure in- troduced by ) to solve Equa- tion (9). We denote S as the number of triples for learning, P as the expected number of relation paths between two entities, and L as the expected length of relation paths. For each iteration in opti- mization, the complexity of TransE is O(SK) and the complexity of PTransE is O(SKP L) for ADD and MUL, and O(SK 2 P L) for RNN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments and Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Sets and Experimental Setting</head><p>We evaluate our method on a typical large-scale KB Freebase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bollacker et al., 2008)</ref>. In this pa- per, we adopt two datasets extracted from Free- base, i.e., FB15K and FB40K. The statistics of the datasets are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We evaluate the performance of PTransE and other baselines by predicting whether testing triples hold. We consider two scenarios: (1) Knowledge base completion, aiming to predict the missing entities or relations in given triples only based on existing KBs. (2) Relation extraction from texts, aiming to extract relations between en- tities based on information from both plain texts and KBs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Knowledge Base Completion</head><p>The task of knowledge base completion is to com- plete the triple (h, r, t) when one of h, t, r is miss- ing. The task has been used for evaluation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bordes et al., 2011;</ref>. We conduct the evaluation on FB15K, which has 483, 142 relational triples and 1, 345 re- lation types, among which there are rich inference and reasoning patterns.</p><p>In the testing phase, for each testing triple (h, r, t), we define the following score function for prediction</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">S(h, r, t) = G(h, r, t) + G(t, r −1 , h),<label>(14)</label></formula><p>and the score function G(h, r, t) is further defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">G(h, r, t) =||h + r − t||+ 1 Z p∈P (h,t)</formula><p>Pr(r|p)R(p|h, t)||p − r||.</p><p>The score function is similar to the energy func- tion defined in Section 2.1. The difference is that, here we consider the reliability of a path p is also related to the inference strength given r, which is quantified as Pr(r|p) = Pr(r, p)/ Pr(p) obtained from the training data. We divide the stage into two sub-tasks, i.e., en- tity prediction and relation prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Entity Prediction</head><p>In the sub-task of entity prediction, we follow the setting in ( ). For each test- ing triple with missing head or tail entity, vari- ous methods are asked to compute the scores of G(h, r, t) for all candidate entities and rank them in descending order.</p><p>We use two measures as our evaluation metrics: the mean of correct entity ranks and the proportion of valid entities ranked in top-10 (Hits@10). As mentioned in ( ), the measures are desirable but flawed when an invalid triple ends up being valid in KBs. For example, when the testing triple is (Obama, PresidentOf, USA) with the head entity Obama is missing, the head entity Lincoln may be regarded invalid for prediction, but in fact it is valid in KBs. The eval- uation metrics will under-estimate those methods that rank these triples high. Hence, we can filter out all these valid triples in KBs before ranking. The first evaluation setting was named as "Raw" and the second one as "Filter".</p><p>For comparison, we select all methods in (Bor- des et al., 2013; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wang et al., 2014</ref>) as our base- lines and use their reported results directly since the evaluation dataset is identical.</p><p>Ideally, PTransE has to find all possible relation paths between the given entity and each candidate entity. However, it is time consuming and imprac- tical, because we need to iterate all candidate en- tities in |E| for each testing triple. Here we adopt a re-ranking method: we first rank all candidate entities according to the scores from TransE, and then re-rank top-500 candidates according to the scores from PTransE.</p><p>For PTransE, we find the best hyperparameters according to the mean rank in validation set. The optimal configurations of PTransE we used are λ = 0.001, γ = 1, k = 100 and taking L 1 as dissimilarity. For training, we limit the number of epochs over all the training triples to 500.</p><p>Evaluation results of entity prediction are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wang et al., 2014</ref>), and TransR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lin et al., 2015)</ref>. For PTransE, we consider three composition op- erations for relation path representation: addition (ADD), multiplication (MUL) and recurrent neu- ral networks (RNN). We also consider relation paths with at most 2-steps and 3-steps. With the same configurations of PTransE, our TransE im- plementation achieves much better performance than that reported in ( .</p><p>From <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> we observe that: (1) PTransE significantly and consistently outperforms other baselines including TransE. It indicates that rela- tion paths provide a good supplement for repre- sentation learning of KBs, which have been suc- cessfully encoded by PTransE. For example, since both George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln were presidents of the United States, they exhibit simi- lar embeddings in TransE. This may lead to con- fusion for TransE to predict the spouse of Laura Bush. In contrast, since PTransE models rela- tion paths, it can take advantage of the relation paths between George W. Bush and Laura Bush, and leads to more accurate prediction. (2) For PTransE, the addition operation outperforms other composition operations in both Mean Rank and Hits@10. The reason is that, the addition opera- tion is compatible with the learning objectives of both TransE and PTransE. Take h r 1 − → e 1 r 2 − → t for example. The optimization objectives of two di- rect relations h + r 1 = e 1 and e 1 + r 2 = t can easily derive the path objective h + r 1 + r 2 = t. (3) PTransE of considering relation paths with at most 2-step and 3-step achieve comparable results.

Here we demonstrate the performance of PTransE and some baselines with respect to different types of relations in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Relation Prediction</head><p>Relation prediction aims to predict relations given two entities. We also use FB15K for evaluation. In this sub-task, we can use the score function of PTransE to rank candidate relations instead of re- ranking like in entity prediction.</p><p>Since our implementation of TransE has achieved the best performance among all base- lines for entity prediction, here we only com- pare PTransE with TransE due to limited space. Evaluation results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, where we report Hits@1 instead of Hits@10 for com- parison, because Hits@10 for both TransE and PTransE exceeds 95%. In this table, we report the performance of TransE without reverse rela- tions (TransE), with reverse relations (+Rev) and considering relation paths for testing like that in PTransE (+Rev+Path). We report the performance of PTransE with only considering relation paths (- TransE), only considering the part in Equation (1) (-Path) and considering both (PTransE).</p><p>The optimal configurations of PTransE for re- lation prediction are identical to those for entity prediction: λ = 0.001, γ = 1, k = 100 and taking L 1 as dissimilarity.</p><p>From <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> we observe that: (1) PTransE out- performs TransE+Rev+Path significantly for rela- tion prediction by reducing 41.8% prediction er- rors.

It indicates that encoding relation paths will benefit for predict- ing relations. (3) PTransE with only considering relation paths (PTransE-TransE) gets surprisingly high mean rank. The reason is that, not all entity pairs in testing triples have relation paths, which will lead to random guess and the expectation of rank of these entity pairs is |R|/2.

We combine the ranking scores from the text-based model with those from KB rep- resentations to rank testing triples, and gener- ate precision-recall curves for both TransE and PTransE. For learning of TransE and PTransE, we set the dimensions of entities/relations embed- dings k = 50, the learning rate λ = 0.001, the margin γ = 1.0 and dissimilarity metric as L1. We also compare with MIMLRE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Surdeanu et al., 2012)</ref> which is the state-of-art method using dis- tant supervision. The evaluation curves are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref> we can observe that, by combin- ing with the text-based model Sm2r, the precision of PTransE significantly outperforms TransE espe- cially for the top-ranked triples. This indicates that encoding relation paths is also useful for relation extraction from text.</p><p>Note that TransE used here does not consider reverse relations and relation paths because the performance does not change much. We analyze the reason as follows. In the task of knowledge base completion, each testing triple has at least one valid relation. In contrast, many testing triples in this task correspond to non-relation (NA), and there are usually several relation paths between two entities in these non-relation triples. TransE does not encode relation paths during the training phase like PTransE, which results in worse perfor- mance for predicting non-relation when consider- ing relation paths in the testing phase, and com- pensates the improvement on those triples that do have relations. This indicates it is non-trivial to encode relation paths, and also confirms the effec- tiveness of PTransE.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>Recent years have witnessed great advances of modeling multi-relational data such as social net- works and KBs. Many works cope with rela- tional learning as a multi-relational representation learning problem, encoding both entities and re- lations in a low-dimensional latent space, based on Bayesian clustering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kemp et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Miller et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sutskever et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhu, 2012)</ref>, energy-based models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bordes et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bordes et al., 2014</ref>), matrix factorization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Singh and Gordon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nickel et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nickel et al., 2012</ref>) . Among existing representation mod- els, <ref type="bibr">TransE (Bordes et al., 2013</ref>) regards a relation as translation between head and tail entities for optimization, which achieves a good trade-off be- tween prediction accuracy and computational effi- ciency. All existing representation learning meth- ods of knowledge bases only use direct relations between entities, ignoring rich information in re- lation paths. Relation paths have already been widely con- sidered in social networks and recommender sys- tems. Most of these works regard each relation and path as discrete symbols, and deal with them us- ing graph-based algorithms, such as random walks with restart ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tong et al., 2006</ref>). Relation paths have also been used for inference on large-scale KBs, such as Path Ranking algorithm (PRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lao and Cohen, 2010)</ref>, which has been adopted for ex- pert finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lao and Cohen, 2010</ref>) and informa- tion retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lao et al., 2012)</ref>. PRA has also been used for relation extraction based on KB structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lao et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gardner et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Neelakantan et al., 2015)</ref> further learns a recurrent neural network (RNN) to represent unseen rela- tion paths according to involved relations. We note that, these methods focus on modeling rela- tion paths for relation extraction without consid- ering any information of entities. In contrast, by successfully integrating the merits of modeling en- tities and relation paths, PTransE can learn supe- rior representations of both entities and relations for knowledge graph completion and relation ex- traction as shown in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>This paper presents PTransE, a novel representa- tion learning method for KBs, which encodes re- lation paths to embed both entities and relations in a low-dimensional space. To take advantages of relation paths, we propose path-constraint re- source allocation to measure relation path reliabil- ity, and employ semantic composition of relations to represent paths for optimization. We evaluate PTransE on knowledge base completion and re- lation extraction from text. Experimental results show that PTransE achieves consistent and signif- icant improvements as compared with TransE and other baselines.</p><p>In future, we will explore the following research directions: (1) This paper only considers the infer- ence patterns between direct relations and relation paths between two entities for learning. There are much complicated patterns among relations. For example, the inference form Queen(e) Inference = ==== ⇒ Female(e) cannot be handled by PTransE. We may take advantages of first-order logic to encode these inference patterns for representation learn- ing. (2) There are some extensions for TransE, e.g., TransH and TransR. It is non-trivial for them to adopt the idea of PTransE, and we will explore to extend PTransE to these models to better deal with complicated scenarios of KBs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: TransE and PTransE.</figDesc></figure>

3.3 Relation Extraction from Text 

Relation extraction from text aims to extract re-
lational facts from plain text to enrich existing 
KBs. Many works regard large-scale KBs as dis-
tant supervision to annotate sentences as training 
instances and build relation classifiers according to 
features extracted from the sentences (Mintz et al., 
2009; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; 
Surdeanu et al., 2012). All these methods reason 
new facts only based on plain text. TransE was 
used to enrich a text-based model and achieved a 
significant improvement (Weston et al., 2013), and 
so do TransH (Wang et al., 2014) and TransR (Lin
