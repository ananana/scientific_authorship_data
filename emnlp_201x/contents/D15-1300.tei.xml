			<abstract>
				<p>For fine-grained sentiment analysis, we need to go beyond zero-one polarity and find a way to compare adjectives that share a common semantic property. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised approach to assign intensity levels to adjectives , viz. high, medium and low, where adjectives are compared when they belong to the same semantic category. For example , in the semantic category of EXPERTISE , expert, experienced and familiar are respectively of level high, medium and low. We obtain an overall accuracy of 77% for intensity assignment. We show the significance of considering intensity information of adjectives in predicting star-rating of reviews. Our intensity based prediction system results in an accuracy of 59% for a 5-star rated movie review corpus.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sentence intensity becomes crucial when we need to compare sentences having the same polarity ori- entation. In such scenarios, we can use inten- sity of words to judge the intensity of a sentence. Words that bear the same semantic property can be used interchangeably to upgrade or downgrade the intensity of the expression. For example, good and outstanding both are positive words from the QUALITY category, but the latter can be used to intensify positive expression in a sentence.</p><p>There are several manually or automatically created lexical resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Liu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wilson et al., 2005b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wilson et al., 2005a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Taboada and Grieve, 2004</ref>) that assign a fixed positive (+1) or nega- tive (−1) polarity to words, making no distinction among them in terms of their intensity. This pa- per presents a semi-supervised approach to assign intensity levels to adjectives, viz. high, medium and low, which share the same semantic property. We have used the semantic frames of FrameNet- 1. <ref type="bibr">5 (Baker et al., 1998</ref>) to obtain these semantic categories. Our approach is based on the idea that the most intense word has higher contextual simi- larity with high intensity words than with medium or low intensity words. We use the intensity an- notated movie review corpus to obtain the most intense word for a semantic category. Then, co- sine similarity between word vectors of the most intense word and other words of the category is used to assign intensity levels to those words. Our approach with the used resources is shown in fig- ure 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Intensity Analysis System</head><p>Our Contribution: Corpus based approaches suf- fer from the data sparsity problem. Our approach tackles this problem by using word vectors for in- tensity assignment (Section 2.3). It also provides a better overall accuracy (77%) than current state of the art when compared with gold-standard in- tensity levels <ref type="bibr">(Section 6.2)</ref>. In addition to this, we show that accuracy of the star rating prediction task improves when we incorporate our intensity levels as features in addition to standard features such as unigrams (Section 6.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Idea Used for Deriving Adjectival Scale</head><p>In this paper, we dealt with 52 semantic (polar) categories of the FrameNet data and derived the polarity-intensity ordering among adjectives for each category. Examples of these semantic cate- gories with a few words that belong to the category are as follows.</p><p>• INTELLIGENCE: Brainy, brainless, intelli- gent, smart, dim etc.</p><p>• CANDIDNESS: Honest, dishonest, trust- worthy, reliable, gullible etc.</p><p>• EMOTION: Sad, upset, appalled, tormented, gleeful, happy, pleased etc.</p><p>Our algorithm to assign intensity levels to adjec- tives is based on the following ideas:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">What Does Intensity Annotated Corpus</head><p>Tell About The Intensity of Words? <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rill et al. (2012)</ref> showed that an intensity anno- tated polar corpus can be used to derive the in- tensity of the adjectives. A high intensity word will occur more frequently in high intensity re- views. For example, the word excellent is found 118 times, while average is found only 16 times in 5-star rated movie reviews (Section 3). Based on this distribution, we use a weighted mean formula to find intensity of the words from the corpus. We call it Weighted Normalized Polarity Intensity (WNPI) formula. For a 5-star intensity rating cor- pus, the W N P I formula is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W N P I(word) = 5 i=1 i * C i 5 * 5 i=1 C i (1)</formula><p>where C i is the count of the word in i-star reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Need Significant Occurrence of A Word</head><p>The W N P I formula gives a corpus based result, hence can give biased scores for words which oc- cur less frequently in the corpus. For example, in our movie review data-set, the word substan- dard occurs only 3 times in the corpus, and these occurrences happen to be in 1-star and 2-star re- views only. Hence, the W N P I formula assigns a higher score to substandard. To avoid such a bias, we integrate W N P I formula with Chi-Square test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sharma and Bhattacharyya (2013)</ref> used Chi- Square test to find significant polar words in a do- main. We use the same categorical Chi-Square test in our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">How to Get Intensity Clue for All Words?</head><p>A combination of W N P I formula and Chi- Square test cannot assign intensity scores to ad- jectives, which are not present in the corpus. To overcome this data sparsity problem, we restrict the use of W N P I formula to identify the most intense word in each category. We explore pre- computed context vectors of words, presented by Mikolov et al. (2011) (Section 3), to assign in- tensity levels to remaining words of the semantic category:</p><p>Case-1 Words which have less number of senses: These words will have a limited set of con- text words. Hence, their context vectors will also be based on these limited words. Example: excel- lent, extraordinary, amazing, superb, great etc.</p><p>Case-2 Words which have many senses: These words will have a large set of context words. Hence their context vectors will be based on a set of large number of words. Example: good, fair, fine, average etc. Inferences:</p><p>1. Two words expressing similar meaning, and satisfying case-1 will have similar context. Hence, their word vectors will exhibit high cosine similar- ity. Whereas a word satisfying case-2 will be less similar to a word satisfying case-1.</p><p>2. The classical semantic bleaching theory 1 states that a word which has less number of senses (possibly one) tends to have higher intensity in comparison to a word having more senses. Con- sidering semantic bleaching phenomenon as a base, we deduce that words which satisfy case-1 tend to be high intensity words while words satis- fying case-2 are low intensity words.</p><p>Hence, we conclude that high intensity words (case-1) have higher cosine similarity with each other than with low or medium intensity words (case-2). Therefore, cosine similarity with a high intensity word can be used to obtain intensity or- dering for remaining words of the category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data and Resources</head><p>This section gives an overview of the corpus and lexical resources used in our approach.</p><p>Semantic Categories: We worked with frames of FrameNet-1.5 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker et al., 1998</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee, 2005</ref>) of 5006 files. Each review is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 indicates an unbearable movie and 4 represents a must see film. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> describes the meanings of the rating scores with the count of re- views in each rating. We can infer that increase in rating corresponds to increase in positive intensity and decrease in negative intensity.</p><p>Sentiment Lexicon: To identify the polarity orientation of words, we use a list of positive (2006) and negative (4783) words 3 (Liu, 2010). We manually assign polarities to universally po- lar words like enduring, creditable and nonsensi- cal, which are missing in this lexicon, using other standard lexicons. We found a total of 218 such missing words.</p><p>Context Vectors: We use the precomputed context vectors of words generated using Recur- rent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>). The RNN is trained with 320M words from the broadcast news data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Gold Standard Data Preparation</head><p>We asked five annotators to assign words to differ- ent intensity levels: high, medium, and low. An- notators were given positive and negative words of each category separately. The level chosen by a majority of annotators is selected as the gold standard intensity level for the word. To compute agreement among five annotators, we used fleiss' kappa, and obtained a score of 0.61. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Identification of Intensity of Adjectives</head><p>In this section, we give a step-by-step description of our approach.</p><p>Step 1: Find Intensity of Words We calculate polarity-intensity of each word of a semantic category using W N P I formula (eq. 1). Based on the polarity orientation of a word, the W N P I formula uses intensity interpretation of star-rating as shown in table 2. The variable i of the W N P I formula refers to these star ratings (in- tensity levels). The polarity orientation of an ob- served word is obtained using Bing Liu's lexicon.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Interpretation of star rating as intensity scores of reviews for positive and negative words.</p><p>Step 2: Find Pivot Using Chi-Square Test The word which gives the highest Chi-Square score with the highest intensity score as per W N P I is set as pivot (Pos-pivot and Neg-pivot). The Chi-Square test helps us to exclude the biased words, which are getting high intensity scores by the W N P I formula, just by chance (Section 2.2).</p><p>Step 3: Obtain Similarity Scores with Pivot Further, we compute the cosine similarity between the context vectors of the pivot and the other words of the category. We use Pos-pivot, if the observed word is positive and Neg-pivot, if the observed word is negative.</p><p>Step 4: Assign Intensity Level to Words Finally, we arrange similarity scores obtained above in decreasing order, and place 2 break points in the sequence where consecutive similar- ity scores differ the most. We set these break- points as the thresholds for intensity levels. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows the intensity scale obtained by our approach for the QUALITY category, where extraordinary was found as Pos-pivot and awful as Neg-pivot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments And Results</head><p>To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three measures: accuracy with the gold- standard data, comparison with state of the art and accuracy for the star rating prediction task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Evaluation Using Gold Standard Data</head><p>We compute accuracy as the fraction of adjectives for which the predicted intensity level is the same as the gold standard level. We obtained an overall accuracy of 77% across 52 polar categories, con- taining a total of 697 adjectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Comparison with State of The Art</head><p>Ruppenhofer et al. <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref> showed that a cor- pus based method called MeanStar approach per- forms the best for intensity ordering task among existing approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(De Melo and Bansal, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kim and de Marneffe, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fahrni and Klenner, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dragut et al., 2010</ref>) for polar seman- tic categories. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the comparison be- tween MeanStar and our approach for four seman- tic categories <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . For first three categories, our ap- proach performs better than MeanStar and for EX- PERTISE we obtain the same level of accuracy. MeanStar approach gives an overall accuracy of 73% across 52 polar categories, which is signifi- cantly lesser than the accuracy obtained with our approach. MeanStar approach does not assign in- tensity score to words missing from the corpus. While, 88 out of 122 missing words are assigned correct intensity levels by our approach. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Evaluation Using Star Rating Prediction</head><p>There have been several successful attempts at sentiment polarity detection in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Turney, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pang et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pang and Lee, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mohammad et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Svetlana Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2014</ref>). However, prediction of star ratings still considered as a challenging task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Qu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gupta et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boteanu and Chernova, 2013</ref>). We implemented three systems to evaluate the significance of intensity annotated ad- jectives in star rating prediction task.</p><p>System 1: A rule based system based on the concept that negatively high intense words will oc- cur more frequently in the low star reviews and positively high intense words will occur more fre- quently in the high star reviews. This system uses the following function I to assign intensity score to a review r:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I(r) = 3 i=1 i * C P i − 3 i=1 i * C N i 3 * ( 3 i=1 C P i + 3 i=1 C N i ) (2)</formula><p>where C P i and C N i respectively represent sum of the term-frequencies of positive and negative ad- jectives with intensity i.</p><p>Eq. 2 gives us an intensity score between −1 and +1 for each review. We need four breakpoints on these intensity scores to map intensity scores into 5-star ratings. We learn these breakpoints by maximizing accuracy for the training data 5 over all possible breakpoints.</p><p>System 2: In this system, we consider intensity of each adjective as +1 or −1 as per its polarity, and then uses eq. 2 to find review intensity.</p><p>System 3: This is an SVM based system which uses four different types of features: (a) unigrams, (b) unigrams with the modification that if adjec- tive belongs to our intensity annotated adjective list, then feature value is intensity of the adjective, (c) and (d) use the scores coming from eq. 2 as an additional feature over those in (a) and <ref type="formula">(b)</ref>    <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows the results obtained with the above systems. System 3(d) achieves the maxi- mum accuracy depicting that inclusion of intensity information with the standard features improves the star rating prediction significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Sentiment analysis on adjectives has been exten- sively explored in NLP literature. However, most of the works addressed the problem of finding po- larity orientation of adjectives ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wiebe, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fahrni and Klenner, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dragut et al., 2010)</ref>. The first work in the direction of adjectival scale was done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993)</ref>. They ex- ploited linguistic knowledge available in the cor- pora to compute similarity between adjectives. However, their approach did not consider polarity orientation of adjectives, they provided ordering among non-polar adjectives like, cold, lukewarm, warm, hot.</p><p>The task of ordering adjectives according to their polarity-intensity has recently received much attention due to the vital role of intensity analy- sis in several real world tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kim et al. (2013)</ref> interpreted the continuous space word representa- tion by demonstrating that vector off-set can be used to derive scalar relationship amongst adjec- tives. Their approach provided relationship among all the adjectives independent of their semantic property. De Melo and Bansal (2013) used a pat- tern based approach to identify intensity relation among adjectives, but their approach had a severe coverage problem. They also did not consider the semantic property of adjectives, assuming one sin- gle intensity-scale for all adjectives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ruppenhofer et al. (2014)</ref> provided ordering among polar adjectives that bear the same seman- tic property. Their approach was completely cor- pus dependent, it was not able to derive intensity of those adjectives which were not found in the corpus. We have used the same star-rated movie review corpus in our work as used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ruppenhofer et al. (2014)</ref> and found 122 polar adjectives which are absent from the corpus. Our system is able to identify intensity levels for these missing adjec- tives. Moreover, we obtained an improvement of 4% in overall accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed an approach that assigns intensity levels to domain independent ad- jectives, viz. high, medium and low. The impor- tant feature of our approach is that it is not fully corpus dependent, hence is able to assign inten- sity to adjectives that are absent in the corpus. We have reported that the overall results are better than the recently reported corpus based approach and fairly close to human agreement on this challeng- ing task.</p><p>The use of adjectives with their intensity infor- mation can enrich existing sentiment analysis sys- tems. We have shown the significance of consider- ing intensity information of adjectives in predict- ing the intensity of movie reviews.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Intensity scale for QUALITY category, where extraordinary was found as Pos-pivot and awful as Neg-pivot.</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="3,307.28,116.00,226.77,240.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>
