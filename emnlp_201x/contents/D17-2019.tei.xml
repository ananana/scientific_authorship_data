				<p>We present a novel interactive summa-rization system that is based on abstrac-tive summarization, derived from a recent consolidated knowledge representation for multiple texts. We incorporate a couple of interaction mechanisms, providing a bullet-style summary while allowing to attain the most important information first and interactively drill down to more specific details. A usability study of our implementation , for event news tweets, suggests the utility of our approach for text exploration.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Multi-document summarization (MDS) tech- niques aim to assist readers in obtaining the most important information when reading multiple texts on a topic. The dominant MDS approach focuses on constructing a short summary of some targeted length, capturing the most important information, mimicking a manually-crafted "static" summary. As an alternative, few papers considered interactive summarization, where the presented information can be interactively explored by the user according to needs and interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Christensen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leuski et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yan et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we propose further contribution to this approach, focusing on interactive abstrac- tive summarization. We suggest that an abstrac- tive summarization approach, based on extracted "atomic" facts, is particularly suitable in the inter- active setting as it allows more flexible informa- tion presentation. Intuitively, it makes more sense for a user to explore information at the level of in- dividual facts, rather than the coarser level of full original sentences, as in prior work on interactive extractive summarization (see Section 6).</p><p>We build on the abstractive approach in sup- porting two useful modes of interaction. First, we present information in a bullet-style summary, where the most important information is initially displayed in bullet sentences, while further de- tails may be obtained by unfolding additional bul- lets. Specifically, we implemented this approach for summarizing news tweets on a certain event along a time line (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Our second mode of interaction is concept expansion, which allows viewing complementary information about a con- cept via its alternative term mentions, while track- ing the concept occurrences throughout the sum- mary (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). This information is hidden in static summaries that use original sentences (ex- tractive) or a single term per concept (abstractive).</p><p>To facilitate the modular construction of inter- active summaries, we utilize as input a consol- idated representation of texts, in particular the recent Open Knowledge Representation (OKR) of <ref type="bibr">Wities et al. (2017)</ref>. Briefly, this representation captures the propositions of the texts, where co- refferring concepts or propositions are collapsed together while keeping links to the original men- tions (see Section 2). We leverage OKR structures to extract information at the level of atomic facts, to expand information from collapsed mentions and to retrieve the sources from which summary sentences were derived.</p><p>The novelties of our interactive scheme call for verifying its effectiveness and usefulness for users. For that, we have implemented our ap- proach in a prototype system (Sections 3-4). This system automatically produces an interactive sum- mary from input OKR data, which we assume to be parsed from original texts by an external black- box tool. We have examined our system through a set of standard usability tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brooke, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lund, 2001</ref>) on gold standard OKR datasets that enabled us to study its contribution in isolation (Section 5). Our results show that the proposed system is highly valuable for readers, providing an appealing alternative to standard static summa- rization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preliminaries</head><p>As mentioned above, our interactive summariza- tion system is based on a consolidated representa- tion for the information in multiple texts. We next review some background on such representations and then describe the particular Open Knowledge Representation that we use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Consolidated Representation</head><p>Motivated by summarization and text exploration, recent work considered the consolidation of tex- tual information in various structures. As promi- nent examples, the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Liu et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Li et al. (2016)</ref> construct graph-based rep- resentations whose nodes are predicates or argu- ments thereof, extracted from the original text, and the predicate-argument relations are captured by edges. Identical or coreferring concepts are col- lapsed in a single node. <ref type="bibr">Rospocher et al. (2016)</ref> present a more super- vised approach where concepts in the graph are linked to DBPedia 1 entries. This along with other metadata is used to detect coreferences and disam- biguate concepts.</p><p>None of these works considers interactive sum- maries, and in particular none incorporates suffi- cient data for our modes of user interaction. We next briefly review the Open Knowledge Rep- resentation recently introduced by <ref type="bibr">Wities et al. (2017)</ref>, which is used by our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Open Knowledge Representation</head><p>We illustrate the components of the OKR for- malism that are central to our summarization method via the example OKR structure in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (see <ref type="bibr">Wities et al. (2017)</ref> for full details). On the top, there are four original tweets. On the bottom, there are two consolidated propositions (marked P1 and P2) and four entities (marked E1-E4) de- rived from these tweets. The figure depicts three types of links captured in OKR, as follows.</p><p>Mention links connect each proposition or en- tity with its set of mention terms, namely, ev- 1 http://wiki.dbpedia.org/ ery form of reference to the entity/proposition throughout the texts. E.g., E1 from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is mentioned in the tweets as "man", "shooter" or "Radcliffe Haughton". Mentions of propositions are stored as templates with argument placehold- ers, e.g., "[a2] dead in [a3]". Through their men- tions, entities and propositions are further linked with their occurrences in the original texts (omit- ted from the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>.</p><p>Argument links connect propositions with their arguments, which may be entities or (nested) propositions. Since a proposition may have sev- eral templates with different arguments, argument IDs (marked a1-a3 in P1) are used to capture co- referring arguments within the same proposition. For example, a2 and a3 appear as arguments in the two templates of P1, and refer to entity E2 and proposition P2 respectively. Entailment links, marked by directed edges in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, track semantic entailment (in context) between different types of OKR components. For example, in E1, "Radcliffe Haughton" entails "man" or "shooter", namely, the former is more specific/informative in the given context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Comprehensive Summary Information</head><p>The architecture of our system consists of two main steps: (1) a preprocessing step in which we generate comprehensive summary information and (2) interactive display of selected information. In this section we describe the first step, which is based on an input OKR structure. Our UI for ex- ploring the summary information interactively is described in the following section.</p><p>The general scheme for generating summary in- formation in our system is as follows.</p><p>1. Partition the OKR propositions into groups.</p><p>2. Generate representative summary sentences for each group of propositions. These yield the bullet-style summary sentences.</p><p>3. Generate metadata for each representative sentence: a knowledge score, concept expan- sions and timestamp. For the current system, we implemented a baseline method for each of these steps, which nonetheless achieved high satisfaction scores in the usability study (see Section 5).</p><p>We partition propositions, as captured in the OKR structure, into distinct groups such that the propositions of each group are (transitively) con- nected by argument links (ignoring link direction). E.g., in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, P2 is nested in P1 and thus the two are grouped together.</p><p>Next, for the "root" (i.e., not nested) proposi- tion in a group, we generate alternative candidate sentences. This is done by filling, in its templates, all the possible combinations of relevant argument mentions, and recursively so for nested proposi- tions. For example, for P1 we would generate "[3 people] dead in [shooting in <ref type="bibr">[Wisconsin]</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">]", "[3 people] dead in [[spa] shooting]", "[Three] dead in [[spa] shooting]"</formula><p>, and so on (22 candidate sentences in total).</p><p>From each set of candidates we choose one rep- resentative sentence. Importantly, this means that unlike bounded-length summary paragraphs our comprehensive summary information effectively covers all the propositions in the original texts. In- stead of filtering upfront less salient information, it is only hidden initially in the UI and can be un- folded by the user (see Section 4). For a represen- tative sentence, we choose a candidate with high language model score, 2 high knowledge score (de- fined below) and small length. This is done by op- timizing a weighted sum of these factors.</p><p>The knowledge score of each sentence intu- itively reflects how common its mentions are in the original texts as well as how informative (spe- cific) they are, based on the OKR entailment links. Reconsidering <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for example, in the tweet "Three dead in spa shooting", the concepts "three", "dead" and "spa shooting" should be rewarded for appearing each in two tweets, but "three" should be rewarded less than "3 people", which is more informative.</p><p>We use the following heuristically formulated equation to calculate the score of each generated sentence s:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">score(s) = m∈mentions(s) α + β · depth(m)</formula><p>where mentions(s) are the mentions of predicates and entities in the sentence. depth(m) assigns a given mention m its depth in the relevant lexical entailment graph within the OKR. We have empir- ically set α = 1, β = 0.1.</p><p>Each concept (entity or proposition) in the sum- mary sentences is linked to its mentions and orig- inal texts using the OKR. The set of mentions is cleaned from duplicates (strings with small edit distance), yielding the concept expansion for sets with &gt; 1 different mentions. This gives extra information about concepts that otherwise might have been missed. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, for example, the "suspected gunman" is also identified as "Ja- maican". For the tweet summarization scenario, we also compute the timestamp of each represen- tative sentence as the time of the first tweet men- tioning its root proposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Interactive User Interface</head><p>We now describe the web application 3 we imple- mented, designed for the interactive exploration of multiple tweets on a specific event. Our backend is implemented in Python 2.7 and runs on a CentOS server. The frontend is implemented with the An- gularJS library. JSON is used for data interchange. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the initial screen summarizing a set of 109 tweets about the shooting in a Wis- consin spa from our running example. Bullet-style sentences (generated as explained in Section 3) are  displayed along the event timeline, in descend- ing order of their timestamps. As an indication of salience, to the right of each sentence, a pie chart shows the "percentage" of knowledge it cov- ers according to its normalized knowledge score. The pie chart on the top shows the total knowledge "covered" by the currently visible sentences.</p><p>Initially, only sentences exceeding a certain in- formation score threshold are displayed, as a con- cise bullet-style summary of the event. Other sen- tences are folded (e.g., between timestamps 01:07 and 22:55 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2)</ref>. The user can then decide whether and which sentences to unfold, according to (a) time intervals of interest on the timeline; (b) the number of folded sentences, as indicated in the middle of the line; and (c) the amount of additional knowledge to be unfolded, which is highlighted on the top pie chart when hovering over folded sentences. By repeatedly unfolding sentences, the user can gradually discover the full timeline of the event with all consolidated data from the tweets.</p><p>Another mode of discovering information is via concept expansion: hovering over a highlighted concept (e.g., "suspected gunman") opens a pop- up with different mentions of the same concept in the summary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref>; clicking it further high- lights all of its coreferences in the summary. Fi- nally, the user can also click the Twitter icon to inspect the source tweets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">System Usability Tests</head><p>To assess and improve the value of our system, we have conducted two usability studies employ- ing standard usability tests. The tests were per- formed on a dataset of human annotated OKR structures (of the form of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) released by <ref type="bibr">Wities et al. (2017)</ref>. We took their 6 largest clus- ters of event tweets, of about 100 tweets each. This gold-standard dataset enabled us to study in iso- lation the merits of our novel system. Given the positive results that we report below, we plan, in future work, to integrate and study our system in a fully automated pipeline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Preliminary Usability Study</head><p>A first usability study was conducted with two goals: to examine the usefulness of our ideas and to understand user needs.</p><p>Methodology. The evaluation phase of a proto- type requires only a few evaluators, according to the "discount" usability testing principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Nielsen, 1993)</ref>. Thus, six students not familiar with our project were recruited as evaluators. We asked them to perform a series of predefined tasks on one of the six selected events. During the system us- age we observed the users' activity and employed a "think aloud" technique to obtain user remarks. Each on-screen activity was captured using "De- but Video Capturing Software" 4 . After perform- ing all tasks, users were asked to fill the SU Scale (SUS) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brooke, 1996)</ref> for subjective usability evaluation.</p><p>Results. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the average scores ob- tained for each of the ten SUS questions, on a scale of 1 to 5. Overall, users found the prototype easy to use and showed willingness to use it frequently.</p><p>The SUS questionnaire yields an important sin- gle number in <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref> representing a composite measure of the overall usability of the system. This number is calculated based on the ten ques- tion scores. As seen in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, except for one dissatisfied user 5 , the system received high scores ranging from 70 to 95. The observation and ver- bal reports during the test yielded a list of require- ments that helped improve our prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUS Question</head><p>Avg. Score I think that I would like to use this system frequently.</p><p>3.83 I found the system unnecessarily complex. 2.33 I thought the system was easy to use.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Comparative Usability Test</head><p>After updating our system to incorporate improve- ments obtained from the preliminary study, we conducted another comparative study to examine the relative effectiveness of our system.</p><p>Methology. We have compared our system, here denoted by IAS (for Interactive Abstractive Sum- mary), with two baseline approaches:</p><p>• Tweet: a list of all the original tweets in the event dataset.</p><p>• Static: the full ordered list of sentences gen- erated by our system (Section 3), with no in- teractive features nor metadata (such as con- cept expansion, knowledge scores, etc.). As mentioned earlier, we have used the gold- standard OKR structures for 6 of the events re- leased by <ref type="bibr">Wities et al. (2017)</ref>. Six users were each presented with two events in each interface <ref type="bibr">(IAS, Tweet, Static)</ref>, where the assignment of event to interface and order of interfaces were different for each user. The users explored the information that describes each event in the assigned interface, and at the end were asked to complete the USE Ques- tionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lund, 2001</ref>).  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: USE questionnaire dimensions score comparison of the three system interfaces on a scale of 1 to 3.</p><p>This questionnaire required users to rank each of the three interfaces on a scale from 1 to 3 ac- cording to 33 statements. The original 30 USE statements represent four dimensions: Usefulness, Satisfaction, Ease of Use, and Ease of Learning. We added three statements to rank user's experi- ence of knowledge exploration. 6</p><p>Results. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the average rank of each interface in each of the examined dimensions. While our system was naturally somewhat more complex to use than the baselines, which only re- quire reading, it consistently received the highest ranks in the dimensions of Usefulness, Satisfac- tion and Knowledge Exploration. This indicates that interactivity indeed provides substantial value to the user, regardless of the summary sentences (as evident by the comparison to baseline Static).</p><p>The ranked USE statements also serve as an indication for the quality of our summary when compared to the other baselines. Standard summa- rization metrics are designed for static summaries <ref type="bibr">7</ref> and are thus not expressly adequate for our inter- active system due to its content being dynamic and user-manipulated. Having demonstrated here that interactive summaries are useful, designing and conducting dedicated quality tests for interactive summaries is a priority in our future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>A vast body of work has been dedicated to the problem of multi-text summarization. We focus here on the rather few studies that enhance sum- marization with user interaction.</p><p>The iNeATS system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leuski et al., 2003</ref>) was an early attempt for interactive summarization, al- lowing explicit control over parameters such as length, participating elements, etc. <ref type="bibr">Yan et al. (2011)</ref> have studied a more implicit approach, at- tempting to discover user preferences such as top- ics and contexts via user clicks. Both approaches involve repeatedly updating a summary paragraph based on user feedback.</p><p>The more recent SUMMA system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Christensen et al., 2014</ref>) resembles ours in supporting hierar- chical summarization. Salient summary sentences are high in the hierarchy and further details can be discovered by drilling down into lower levels.</p><p>All of the aforementioned methods compute ex- tractive summaries, which are composed of sen- tences from the original texts. In comparison, our abstractive approach has a few appealing advan- tages. Most importantly, this approach facilitates the construction of flexible bullet-style summaries since we are not confined to existing sentences, which may combine several atomic facts of vary- ing saliency or require textual context. This, in turn, allows users to browse data at the level of atomic facts and avoids the need to regenerate the summary in order to incorporate user feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we presented a novel system for the interactive exploration of abstractive summary in- formation. Our system builds on the Open Knowl- edge Representation (Wities et al., 2017) for con- solidating the information of multiple texts, and produces a summary that fully captures this infor- mation. The interactive UI allows focusing on the most salient facts as well as gradually obtaining further details via different interaction modes. Our usability studies provide supportive evidence for the usefulness of our approach.</p><p>Our results shed light on a few important di- rections for future research. In general, our in- teractive abstractive method should be ported to other domains and types of corpora. E.g., while in the case of news tweets, sentence ordering was done along a timeline, the ordering of consolidated summary sentences may in general be a nontrivial task. Further, our approach for summary sentence generation can be enhanced, e.g., by using ma- chine learning techniques to select the best repre- sentative sentences. For evaluation, we will design tests adequate for assessing the quality of an inter- active summary, and use them in a more extensive user study that will incorporate a fully automated pipeline (i.e., an OKR parser).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Four tweets on an event and their OKR structure.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,307.28,62.81,218.27,114.78" type="bitmap" /></figure>
