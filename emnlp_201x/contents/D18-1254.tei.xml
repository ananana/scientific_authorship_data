				<p>Modern automated dialog systems require complex dialog managers able to deal with user intent triggered by high-level semantic questions. In this paper, we propose a model for automatically clustering questions into user intents to help the design tasks. Since questions are short texts, uncovering their semantics to group them together can be very challenging. We approach the problem by using powerful semantic classifiers from question duplicate/matching research along with a novel idea of supervised clustering methods based on structured output. We test our approach on two intent clustering corpora, showing an impressive improvement over previous methods for two languages/domains.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The recent years have seen a resurgent interest for dialog systems, ranging from help desks and more complex task-based dialog to general pur- pose conversational agents, e.g., Alexa, Cortana or Siri. All these different application scenarios show that users expect to formulate complex informa- tion needs in natural language, with no limitation to their expressiveness. In other words, standard shallow semantic parsing based on concept seg- mentation and labeling is no longer sufficient for dialog modeling in today's applications. In partic- ular, when designing dialog managers, we need to consider user intents expressed by articulated nat- ural language text.</p><p>Current solutions to the intent detection prob- lem consist in manually analyzing user questions and creating a taxonomy of intents to be attached to the appropriate actions. For example, if sev- eral semantically similar/identical questions re- gard BookFlight, the designer will build a cat- * The first two authors contributed equally to this manuscript.</p><p>egory. This is a rather costly, difficult and time consuming task, which can often prevent the fast prototyping of dialog systems even for small do- mains. Moreover, the effort is extremely task-and system-specific, with very limited possibilities of porting the intent model, at least partially, across platforms, domains and languages. For example, in the recent 2016/2017 Natural Language Under- standing Benchmarks ( <ref type="bibr">Coucke et al., 2017)</ref>, the or- ganizers have evaluated built-in intents generated by the major dialog managers (Apple's SiriKit, Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Luis, Google's Di- alogflow, and Snips.ai) against a rather small set of relatively generic intents (e.g., GetWeather). This involved a considerable effort on aligning dif- ferent system outputs.</p><p>To our knowledge, no previous work has been dedicated to automatizing this task, mainly be- cause the underlying problem, semantic ques- tion paraphrasing, is very challenging. How- ever, recent initiatives for automatic question du- plicate detection 1 , question relatedness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nakov et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nakov et al., , 2017</ref> and semantic textual similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agirre et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cer et al., 2017</ref>) have shown that current technology achieves good accuracy in matching short text expressing similar semantics.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a model for automat- ically clustering questions into user intent cate- gories, which can help the design of dialog sys- tems. Our approach aims at overcoming the dif- ficulty of providing a unique definition of intent from either a theoretical or practical perspective. Collaborating with stakeholders, we observe that it is very challenging to capture the intent prop- erty that can optimize dialogue/chatbot engineer- ing work in terms of design and effort. The impor- tant aspect of our approach is that given a notion of intent, explicitly provided by annotated data, our model can create clusterings driven by such intrin- sic definition. This is one of our major contribu- tions: providing an effective supervised clustering approach, which can learn definitions from exam- ples.</p><p>Regarding the technical solution our approach is bridging (i) the state-of-the-art methods for ques- tion similarity/paraphrasing with (ii) powerful su- pervised clustering algorithms. The former are obtained by exploiting previous research, e.g., on Quora, whereas the latter, are obtained by capi- talizing on the structured output machine learn- ing methods used for coreference resolution (CR), e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Yu and Joachims, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fernandes et al., 2014</ref>). The main difference with CR consists in substituting mentions and their vector representa- tion with the one of entire questions. It should be noted that structured output methods require a rep- resentation of edges connecting questions, which we obtain from question similarity research.</p><p>To train our model, we define a clustering cor- pus by automatically deriving question clusters from the Quora data, complementing the avail- able question pair annotation with the transitive closure of the semantic matching property. Ad- ditionally, since Quora data is noisy, we manually annotate a question sample, defining an intent hi- erarchical taxonomy. To test the applicability of our methodology across languages and domains, we run evaluation experiments on another intent- based corpus, a collection of FAQs for an Italian online service.</p><p>We evaluate our approach comparing it to the classical k-means using (i) tf-idf model, (ii) our learned question similarity, and (iii) the similar- ity with spectral clustering. The last two methods can be considered another relatively novel contri- bution. Our results show that our new structured output method for question clustering: (i) highly outperforms all its competitors with respect to the standard clustering accuracy/purity as well as the measures defined in the CR domain, (ii) provides clustering accuracy of 80% with respect to the original Quora annotation and a still valuable ac- curacy of 65% with respect to the intent classes designed by an expert in Dialog modeling. This is a promising result as our designer can only pro- vide one of the many interpretations of the intent taxonomy, which can be effectively applied.</p><p>Finally, a particular strength of our approach lies in identifying new intents (singleton clus- ters). These unseen intents are clearly problem- atic for dialogue management and cannot be cov- ered by traditional approaches (e.g., our unsuper- vised clustering baselines show much lower per- formance on singleton clusters).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Intent is a key concept for building dialog systems and is therefore a central research topic in the area. In particular, recent general-purpose dialog sys- tems have to rely on extensive intent modeling to be able to correctly analyze a wide variety of user queries. This has led to a considerable amount of research on data-driven intent modeling.</p><p>In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xu et al. (2013)</ref> represent query's intent as trees and employ a procedure for map- ping an NL query into a tree-structured intent. The problem of this approach is that a new set of intent trees is required for new domains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kim et al. (2016);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Celikyilmaz et al. (2011)</ref> use semi- supervised approaches with large amounts of un- labeled data to improve the accuracy in map- ping user queries into intents. However, they still require a small amount of labeled data in or- der to learn a given intent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen et al. (2016a)</ref> train a Convolutional Deep Neural Network to jointly learn the representations of human intents and associated utterances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen et al. (2016b)</ref> propose feature-enriched matrix factorization to model open domain intents. This leverages knowl- edge from Wikipedia and Freebase to acquire in- formation from unexplored domains according to new users' requests. Unfortunately, it also requires external knowledge bases to induce concepts ap- pearing within the intents.</p><p>Approaching the same problem from the op- posite direction, several studies investigate algo- rithms for automatic question clustering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wen et al. (2001)</ref> propose to cluster together queries that lead to the same group of web pages that are frequently selected by users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jeon et al. (2005)</ref> use machine translation to estimate word trans- lation probabilities and retrieve similar questions from question archives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li et al. (2008)</ref> try to infer the intent of unlabeled queries according to the proximity with respect to the labeled queries in a click graph. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beitzel et al. (2007)</ref> propose to automatically classify web queries from logs into a set of topics by using a combination of different techniques, either supervised or unsu- pervised. The extracted topics are further used for efficient web search. <ref type="bibr">Deepak (2016)</ref> presents MiXKmeans, a variation of k-means algorithm, suited for clustering threads present on forums and Community Question Answering websites. How- ever, most techniques use unsupervised clustering to group similar questions/queries, without model- ing intents. In contrast, our study relies on super- vised clustering to learn intent-based similarity.</p><p>Finally, our work is related to a large body of research on dialog acts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Stolcke et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kim et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chen et al., 2018)</ref>: our low-level intent labels <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref> can be seen as very fine- grained dialog acts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Core and Allen, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bunt et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Oraby et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>However, our paper's objective is different as our goal is not to rigidly define intents and then ex- ploit them to derive a semantic interpretation. We focus on two contributions: first, we aim at provid- ing a tool to help implementing dialog managers such that the designer can more easily create cate- gories from precomputed clusters. Note that hav- ing in mind hundreds of questions to create intent category from scratch is clearly an exigent task.</p><p>Second, our approach can dynamically cluster questions with the same semantics, without any concept annotation. Indeed, the important con- cepts will be learned from the training data, which constitutes a much simpler annotation task than the creation of ad hoc dialogue acts. In particu- lar, this can help with domain-specific intents: the domain-level semantics will be learned from data with no need for advanced manual engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Question Clustering Algorithms</head><p>In this paper, we explore techniques for clustering questions into user intent. To this end, an input set of questions Q undergoes splitting into subsets (clusters), c i = {q i j } N i j=1 , where q i j is the j-th ques- tion in the cluster i of size N i and i c i = Q. Each c i is assumed to contain questions with the same intent, i.e., to represent a distinct intent. Perform- ing a clustering of a new question set Q in an un- supervised manner may generally be troublesome due to the lack of any information about the struc- ture of Q and the target number of distinct intents in it. To overcome this issue, we learn a clustering function from data annotated with gold question clusters.</p><p>In this work, we pose the task as a supervised clustering problem following the formulation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Finley and Joachims (2005)</ref>. Having the train- ing examples of the form {(x i , y i )} n i=1 , where each input x i is a set of elements of some nature and y i -the corresponding gold standard cluster- ing of such a set, the goal is to learn a predictor h : X → Y , from the space of sets X to the space of clusterings Y . Supervised clustering has been shown particularly effective for the NLP task of coreference resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yu and Joachims, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fernandes et al., 2014</ref>). These models learn to in- fer an optimal clustering y of an input set x in a structured way, i.e., as one output object optimiz- ing a global scoring function f : X × Y → R. This is different from local models, which aggre- gate multiple clustering decisions taken with re- spect to pairs of elements.</p><p>At the test time, the global models draw predic- tions by findingˆy</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">findingˆ findingˆy = argmax y∈Y f (x, y).</formula><p>(1)</p><p>In the following, we give the necessary details of the original approach of Yu and Joachims <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2009)</ref> and its adaptation for clustering questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Structured Output Clustering</head><p>To facilitate the inference of the optimal clustering in Equation 1, Yu and Joachims represent clus- tering variables y using graph structures. For an input x, they construct a fully-connected undi- rected graph G, whose nodes are elements x i of the input x and edges are all the pairwise links between them (x i , x j ). 2 Any spanning forest h on G straightforwardly translates into a clustering y. The nodes, aka elements represented by them, in each connected component (spanning tree) of h are considered to belong to the same cluster. The authors incorporate the spanning forest struc- tures h as latent variables and decompose the fea- ture representation of the input-output pair (x, y), which is extended with h, over the edges of h:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Φ(x, y, h) = (x i ,x j )∈h φ(x i , x j ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>They employ Kruskal's spanning algo- rithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kruskal, 1956</ref>) to infer the optimal h, and, respectively, y. A linear model w is trained using the Latent for- mulation of the Structural SVM learner (LSSVM), to score the output clusterings according to the function f (x, y, h) = w · Φ(x, y, h). In fact, w learns to score the edges since the structural fea- ture vector decomposes over the edges. However, imposing a structure onto the output is supposed to produce a better w, which we test in our exper- iments described in Section 5.</p><p>Alternatively, we employ the same structural model with another learning algorithm -latent structured perceptron (LSP) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sun et al. (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Fernandes et al. (2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Pairwise question similarity classifier</head><p>Our intent clustering algorithm relies on the pair- wise similarity between questions (edge score). To provide an accurate estimation of question- question similarity, we build upon an extensive state-of-the-art research in semantic similarity for short text, more specifically, on our previous work ( <ref type="bibr">Filice et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Filice et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barrón-Cedeño et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Da San Martino et al., 2016</ref>) solu- tions/features shown effective in the shared tasks by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nakov et al.

( , 2013</ref>.</p><p>In such work, the classifier is trained with SVMs, which learn a classification function f : Q × Q → {0, 1} on duplicate vs. non-duplicate pairs of questions belonging to the question set Q. The classifier score is used to decide if two ques- tions in the dataset q i and q j are duplicate or not. We represent question pairs as vectors of similar- ity features derived between two questions.</p><p>Feature Vectors are built for questions pairs, (q i , q j ), using a set of text similarity features that capture the relations between two ques- tions. More specifically, we compute 20 sim- ilarity features sim(q i , q j ) using word n-grams (n = [1, . . . , 4]), after stopword removal, greedy string tiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wise, 1996)</ref>, longest common sub- sequences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allison and Dix, 1986)</ref>, Jaccard coef- ficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jaccard, 1901)</ref>, word containment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lyon et al., 2001</ref>), and cosine similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Building Intent clusters</head><p>In this study, we rely on two datasets, providing some important insights on question semantics. None of them, however, fully annotates intents ex- plicitly. Below we describe our approach for con- verting these resources into intent corpora, relying on an automatic procedure followed by a manual post-annotation step. Our intent corpora as well as the larger raw question clusters collections are available to the research community. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Quora corpus</head><p>The original Quora task requires detecting whether two questions are semantically dupli- cate or not. The associated dataset contains over 404, 348 pairs of questions, posted by users on Quora website, labeled as a duplicate pair or not. For example, How do you start a bakery? and How can one start a bakery business? are dupli- cate, while What are natural numbers? and What is a least natural number? are not. Note that the coders label pairs in isolation, only having access to one pair to be labeled at a time on Quora website (answer base). The pairs to be labeled are not se- lected randomly. To make the task more challeng- ing, as well as more useful for practical applica- tions, the organizers only offer pairs of questions that are somewhat semantically related: In <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>, the lexical material is very similar, yet the questions are rather distinct, as reflected in the Quora annotation. They also express very differ- ent user intents: while q 1 is a generic curiosity question about automobiles, q 2 is a practical re- quest for information on R&amp;D in the automotive industry. Example (4) shows why Quora dupli- cate detection task is very challenging and requires a very good level of NL Understanding: while these three questions are very similar on the sur- face level, they all convey distinct semantics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Question clusters from Quora</head><p>Differently from the original task, in this work, we are interested in automatically acquiring in- tents from large question repositories. Given this, we need a corpus that contains clusters of ques- tions annotated by their underlying intent. As a first step in this direction, we approximate intent clusters with the clusters of similar questions from Quora. These can be obtained by exploiting the pairwise annotation and relying on the transitivity property: for each pair q 1 , q 2 annotated as a du- plicate, we assign q 1 and q 2 to the same cluster; negative pairs (non-duplicate question) do not im- pact the clustering in any way. This procedure has obvious limitations by de- sign: (i) it will not give us any intent labels, only the clusters and (ii) it will not provide any hier- archy of intents, or any general/large intent cate- gories. Still, it provides data for a large number of user-generated intents that fully manual anno- tation initiatives (e.g., Natural Language Under- standing Benchmarks) cannot guarantee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Manually annotating intent clusters</head><p>The use of Quora dataset to derive intent raises several potential issues: (i) no consistency is en- forced across labels, (ii) duplicate or very similar Quora answers potentially pollute the annotation for their corresponding questions, (iii) specific de- cisions may depend on availability and granular- ity of the underlying answers, and (iv) the anno- tation of popular questions might be very spuri- ous since the users have no access to all the other related questions. The first issue has also been noted by the Quora competition 4 participants, who found the same pairs of questions appearing sev- eral times in the training set with different labels. Moreover, we found numerous cases where the an- notation does not respect the transitivity property: Here, the three independent coders have produced inconsistent labeling: although q 2 and q 3 are ex- plicitly labeled as non-duplicate, they are both considered duplicates of q 1 . The second issue arises when the answer base contains (near-)duplicate entries. For example, the following two very similar questions are consid- ered non-duplicates since they lead to two distinct answers:</p><p>(6) q1: Which is better -DC or Marvel? q2: DC VS Marvel: which do you like more? <ref type="bibr">[nonduplicate]</ref> Note that this typically happens for rather popular questions that are therefore important to be ana- lyzed correctly, either manually or automatically. The third issue is extremely important for areas only partially covered by the answer DB. For ex- ample, for the set of questions, Why is Saltwater Taffy candy imported in LOCATION?, most LO- CATIONs are covered by a generic answer, and all the corresponding questions are judged dupli- cates. However, some specific LOCATIONs, e.g., Fiji, have a dedicated answer and thus the corre- sponding questions form singleton clusters.</p><p>Finally, the annotation coherence problem arises for very popular areas covering a lot of closely related questions. Thus, more than 100 questions cover different aspects of Weight Loss. Since the coders do not have any access to all the questions on the same topic, the individual deci- sions are not coordinated, which leads to rather ar- bitrary partitioning of the area into clusters: To overcome these issues, we manually re- annotated a portion of the original Quora dataset with intent-based clusters. Starting from automat- ically induced clusters described above, we first re-assess the partitioning, correcting eventual mis- takes and then assign intent-based labels to our clusters. Our labels are hierarchical, thus allow- ing for a better flexibility when designing dialog managers: the dialog flow/actions can be defined in terms of more generic (e.g., Advice) or more specific (e.g., Advice-WeightLoss-diet) intents, depending on different implementation considerations (query frequency for specific in- tents, overall importance for the application, diffi- culty of processing inter alia). To stay inline with the recent intent-based dialogue research, we also annotate slots, where applicable: entities external to the intent, yet playing an essential role for the correct semantic interpretation of the question. <ref type="table">Ta- ble 1</ref> shows an example of the intent-based cluster annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">FAQ: Hype Intent corpus</head><p>Our second corpus, Hype, allows for a more di- rect evaluation of the intent clustering algorithm. The data come from a set of questions asked by Intent Slots Questions Recommend-TourismCuisine streetfood, Delhi What are the best street food in Delhi ? Recommend-TourismCuisine streetfood, Delhi What is the best street food in Delhi ? Recommend-TourismCuisine streetfood, Delhi What are the best street foods in delhi ? Recommend-TourismRestaurant streetfood, Delhi What are the best street food places of delhi ? <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Manually annotated intent clusters for Quora users to a conversational agent, collected and man- ually processed for constructing a FAQ section for Hype-an online service that offers a credit card, a bank account number and an ibanking app to its customers. Unlike Quora, the questions are explic- itly assigned to clusters by human annotators, and these clusters correspond to intents by construc- tion. However, they do not have any informative labels and there is therefore no associated hierar- chy. While this corpus provides very valuable data for our study, its main disadvantage is a very lim- ited number of questions. Some questions are re- ported below: At the current stage of our research, we use the FAQ/Hype corpus directly, with no automatic or manual adjustments as we did for Quora. We plan to annotate the FAQ categories with explicit intent labels in future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Setup</head><p>We used two different corpora, described in Sec- tion 4:</p><p>The Quora Intent corpus contains 270, 146 and 212 clusters in the training, development and test sets. The clusters contain different numbers of questions, ranging from singletons to groups of 100+ questions. The singletons are the dominant group in the Quora dataset. This is probably due to the inclusion of non-duplicate questions that ap- pear in the original Quora dataset. Overall, there are 1, 334 questions distributed in 628 clusters (an average of 2.12 questions/cluster).</p><p>The FAQ/Hype corpus contains no small-size (&lt; 3) clusters by construction since smaller clus- ters are typically not selected as FAQ entries. The largest groups of clusters are those of size 8 and 9. Overall, the FAQ Intent corpus contains 147 ques- tions spread in 28 intent-based clusters, which cor- respond to an average of 5.25 questions/cluster. Models To perform supervised clustering, we use: (i) the original implementation of the Latent SVM struct 5 -LSSVM, and (ii) our implementation of the LSP algorithm based on the same clustering inference on undirected graphs using Kruskal's spanning algorithm.</p><p>We compare these approaches to two unsuper- vised clustering baselines: (i) spectral cluster- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ng et al., 2001</ref>), for which we employ the implementation from the smile 6 library, and (ii) re- lational k-means <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Szalkai, 2013)</ref>. The former im- plementation takes a matrix of pairwise similari- ties between data points as input, whereas the lat- ter approach is a generalization of k-means to an arbitrary matrix of pairwise distances. Thus, they can be run on the scores relative to the question pairs (q i , q j ).</p><p>We provide two variants of such scores: first, we run both the methods on the scores obtained from a binary pairwise similarity classifier, de- scribed in Section 3.2. Second, we run the cluster- ing baselines on the tf-idf scores computed for the question pairs. Note that our use of the scores from a trained pairwise classifier introduces some su- pervision in standard unsupervised clustering ap- proaches, originating new hybrid methods.</p><p>Parametrization LSSVM and LSP require the tuning of a regularization parameter, C, and of a specific loss parameter, r (penalty for adding an incorrect edge), which we select on the dev. set. We pick up C from {1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0}, and the r values from {0.1, 0.5, 1.0}. K-means and spectral clustering algorithms require the in- dication of the number of clusters k. In all of our  experiments, we use the gold standard k of each example (clustering) as parameter to run the base- line approaches. This corresponds to comparing with an upperbound of the baselines.</p><p>Measures We compare the output clusteringˆy clusteringˆ clusteringˆy = j ˆ c j to the ground truth y * = i c i , where c i , in our case, are either the clusters obtained with transitive closure from Quora annotation or the manually annotated categories (see Section 4.1).</p><p>For evaluation purposes, we assign each clus- terˆcterˆ terˆc j to the most frequent gold class (cluster), i.e., argmax i |c i ∩ ˆ c j |, and compute the average preci- sion over the clustering as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P recision = 1 N ˆ k j=1 max i |c i ∩ ˆ c j |,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where N is the number of questions to be clus- tered, andˆkandˆ andˆk is the number of output clusters. This number is exactly the standard clustering purity by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhao and Karypis (2002)</ref>. Since the purity is known to favor the clustering outputs with the large number of clusters, we interchange the roles of output and gold clusters, which gives us the clustering</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Recall = 1 N k j=1 max i |ˆc|ˆc i ∩ c j |,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where k is the number of gold standard clusters. We then compute F1 from the above measures. The defined majority-class based clustering measure allows assigning more than one cluster to the same gold cluster. The coreference resolution metric CEAF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Luo, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cai and Strube, 2010)</ref> solves this issue by finding one-to-one alignment between the clusters in the output and in the ground truth, based on which the final score is computed. We use CEAF e , the variant with the entity-based similarity, as an alternative evaluation measure. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Note that, although we split the data into samples, all the clustering measures we use, the majority-based, defined by equations 9 and 10, and CEAF, are computed over the whole test sets (not by averaging scores separately for each sam- ple).</p><p>We evaluate the results as well in terms of the classification scores relative to the correctness of the models in detecting the pairs of questions with the same/different intent. This enables the comparison against the pairwise classification ap- proaches and an evaluation of their impact. We compute the Precision, Recall, and Accuracy of question pairs with the same intent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experiments on Quora</head><p>Original question label-based evaluation: first, we test the models on the clustering data from the Quora corpus, derived as described in Section 4.1. We train LSSVM, LSP, and the SVM classifier on the training part. The results of all the models on the test set are depicted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. In terms of clustering accuracy (the left half of the table), the LSSVM approach outperforms all the clustering baselines, improving about 10 points the highest baseline model, i.e., SVM + k-means both in terms of F1 and CEAF. LSP, in this setting, shows a slightly worse F1 than LSSVM, producing a model with high recall.</p><p>To study the impact of the pairwise classifier, we consider all the pairs of questions predicted by the clustering approaches as belonging to the same cluster as positive and the rest -as nega- tive. All the clustering models show high accu- racy, superior to that shown by the SVM classi- fier, but this is mainly due to the fact that there are much more negative question pairs. Interest- ingly, only LSSVM, though, among all the clus-  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Supervised vs. unsupervised clustering models and pairwise classification baselines on the test set, where the gold labels are provided by the intent-based manual annotation on a portion of the test set.</p><p>tering model, approaches the classifier in terms of classification F1. However, the cluster accuracy depends on many factors in addition to the pair- wise classification accuracy.</p><p>Intent-based evaluation In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we present the results obtained on the portion of the test set which we manually annotated with the intent clus- ters. Here, we apply the same LSSVM, LSP, and the SVM classifier models trained in the experi- ments of the previous paragraph. However, we re- compute all the four unsupervised clustering base- lines supplying them with the new k -the number of gold intent-based annotated clusters.</p><p>In spite of being trained on data with differ- ent style of annotation (clusters automatically de- rived form Quora annotation), which is potentially rather noisy, LSSVM is able to recover the new in- tent categories better than the baseline approaches in terms of all the clustering metrics. The differ- ence from the closest unsupervised clustering ap- proach, which is the same as in the previous exper- iment, is now reduced in terms of CEAF. However, the information about the number of clusters in the ground truth critically impacts on the accuracy. The LSP model scored the best with respect to the new annotation. The lower classification accuracy of LSSVM with respect to the pairwise classifier is expected as the cluster number changed notably with the new annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Evaluation on the FAQ dataset</head><p>Due to the limited size of the FAQ HYPE dataset, we split it into two parts, each of which forms one sample. We use the one containing 19 out of 28 clusters for training and the other with the remain- ing 9 clusters -for testing. The training sample comprises 97 questions, while the test sample - 50. The plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref> illustrate the perfor- mance of LSSVM and LSP in terms of the clus- tering F1 in confront to the clustering baselines. We run the k-means and the spectral clustering al- gorithms with k in the range (1, 50), which covers all the possible values for the given test set size. LSSVM is better than the spectral clustering models with any k. k-means curves surpass LSSVM only in a narrow interval, showing high unstability. This suggests that guessing the k value in a realistic scenario in the absence of supervision does not seem an easy task. It should be also taken into consideration that we deal with very scarce training data. This also explains slightly insuffi- cient accuracy of LSP compared to the k-means baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Error Analysis and Discussion</head><p>As seen in tables 2 and 3, the structural output model consistently outperforms approaches based on spectral and k-means clustering on the Quora dataset. The most prominent improvement comes from singleton clusters: questions that are not du- plicate with any other entries. Recall that the orig- inal dataset is constructed in such a way that sin- gleton clusters are somewhat similar or related to existing material, but are still considered distinct by Quora annotators. LSSVM correctly recovers 71% of singleton clusters, whereas other methods perform much worse (5-30%). In the question- answering setting, singleton clusters correspond to novel questions that require setting up of a new entry in the answer base. Accurate recognition of singletons would allow for a timely allocation of resources to keep the answer base up-to-date and in line with incoming user requests.</p><p>Larger clusters are problematic for all the com- pared methods. Still, as evidenced by the CEAF score 8 , the structural clustering is doing a better job at recovering non-singleton clusters. This mir- rors our observations that even human annotators have difficulties correctly and consistently detect- ing duplicates in complex over-populated seman- tic areas (see Example 7) in the absence of the global context (e.g., list of all the related ques- tions).</p><p>Finally, the clusters created by the LSSVM ap- proach are more semantically related. Thus, 97% of all the suggested clusters contain questions with the same intent but, possibly, incorrect slots. For example, in the following question cluster: the user wants advice on losing their weight very fast by a specific deadline. LSSVM groups these questions with some others, more generic queries on fast weight loss (How do I loose weight fast?). This means that LSSVM captures the intent hi- erarchy well, providing meaningful clusters, al- though occasionally missing some important de- tails. Other methods, on the contrary, form more poorly-related clusters (25-42% of clusters sug- gested by unsupervised approaches contain unre- lated intents). Thus, the questions from Example (11) get grouped by other methods with such unre- lated queries as How is it to be in true love? (spec- tral clustering over tf-idf).</p><p>Note that neither LSSVM nor unsupervised ap- proaches have any access to the cluster labels and their hierarchy: in the training data, we only spec- ify the clustering itself. Yet, by taking into account the global cluster structure, the LSSVM method can uncover the underlying hierarchy.</p><p>In the FAQ setting, most clusters are mid-size (5-9 questions). All the methods are doing a mod- erate job at recuperating the intent structure in this experiment. However, LSSVM shows better per- formance (cf. Section 5.3). Moreover, structural output is the only method that perfectly recuper- ates at least some clusters, e.g.:</p><p>(12) q1: Non ricordo piú la password per accedere all'App (I don't remember the password for the App) q2: mi sono dimenticato la password (I forgot the pass- word) q3: reimpostare la password (reset the password) q4: cambio password (change the password)</p><p>Here, LSSVM predicts the correct cluster exactly. K-means based approaches put q 1 − q 4 into the same cluster, however, they also merge them with bloccare gli acquisti online (block the online pur- chases). Finally, spectral clustering does a poor job on this particular example, tearing either q 1 (tf-idf based spectral clustering) or q 2 (SVM pair- wise classifier-based spectral clustering) apart and introducing a lot of spurious material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed structured output methods fed with semantic question paraphrasing models to automatically extract user intents from question repositories. Our approach provides clustering ac- curacy of 80% with respect to the original Quora annotation and still valuable accuracy of 65% with respect one to of the many interpretations of ques- tion intent of our dataset, carried out by our expert in dialog modeling. This line of research looks promising as it can potentially simplify and speed up the work of Dialog Manager engineers. Al- though a deeper study is required to assess the ben- efits of our approach, the feedback of our designer clearly suggests that automatic clusters, even if were not perfect, simplify the annotation work. Several future research directions are enabled by our study, ranging from the use of neural clus- tering models to the application of our models to fast and semi-automatic prototyping of Dialog Systems. For this purpose, we make our data and software available to the research community.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 3 )</head><label>3</label><figDesc>q1: How does an automobile works? q2: How does automobile R&amp;D work?
