				<p>In this paper, we demonstrate how the state-of-the-art machine learning and text mining techniques can be used to build effective social media-based substance use detection systems. Since a substance use ground truth is difficult to obtain on a large scale, to maximize system performance, we explore different unsupervised feature learning methods to take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised social media data. We also demonstrate the benefit of using multi-view unsupervised feature learning to combine heterogeneous user information such as Facebook &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;status updates&quot; to enhance system performance. Based on our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC for predicting tobacco use, 81% for alcohol use and 84% for illicit drug use, all of which significantly outperformed existing methods. Our investigation has also uncovered interesting relations between a user&apos;s social media behavior (e.g., word usage) and substance use.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A substance use disorder (SUD) is defined as a condition in which recurrent use of substances such as alcohol, drugs and tobacco causes clin- ically and functionally significant impairment in an individual's daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(SAMHSA, 2015)</ref>. Ac- cording to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 1 in 10 Americans age 12 and older had a substance use disorder. Substance use also costs Americans more than $700 billion a year in increased health care costs, crimes and lost pro- ductivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(NIDA, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>These days, people also spend a significant amount of time on social media such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to interact with friends and families, exchange ideas and thoughts, pro- vide status updates and organize events and activ- ities. The ubiquity and widespread use of social media underlines the needs to explore its intersec- tion with substance use and its potential as a scal- able and cost-effective solution for screening and preventing substance misuse and abuse.</p><p>In this research, we employ the state-of-the-art machine learning and text mining algorithms to build automated substance use prediction systems, which can be used to identify people who are at risk of SUD. Since SUD data are often expen- sive to obtain at a large scale, to maximize system performance, we focus on methods that employ unsupervised feature learning to take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised social media data. Previous research in Machine Learning, Im- age Processing, Speech and Natural language Pro- cessing has shown that to be able to utilize a large amount of unsupervised data is one of the most re- liable ways to achieve good performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Le et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lee et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Le and Mikolov, 2014)</ref>. Moreover, by analyzing rich human behavior data on social media, we can also gain insight into pat- terns of use and risk factors associated with sub- stance use. The main contributions of this work include:</p><p>1. We have explored a comprehensive set of single-view feature learning methods to take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised social media data. Our results have shown significant improvement over baseline sys- tems that only use supervised training data.</p><p>2. We have explored several multi-view learn- ing algorithms to take advantage of heteroge-neous user data such as Facebook "likes" and "status updates". Our results have demon- strated significant improvement over base- lines that only use a single data type.</p><p>3. We have uncovered new insight into the rela- tionship between a person's social media ac- tivities and substance use such as the relation- ship between word usage and SUD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Substance use disorder (SUD) encompasses a complex pattern of behaviors. Many studies have been conducted to discover factors interacting with SUD. A growing number of studies have confirmed a strong association between personal traits and substance use. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campbell et al., 2014)</ref> found that smokers have signif- icantly higher openness to experience and lower conscientiousness, a personality trait related to a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cook et al., 1998</ref>) examined the links between alcohol consumption and per- sonality and found that alcohol use is correlated positively with sociability and extraversion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Terracciano et al., 2008</ref>) conducted a study involving 1102 participants and found a link between drug use and low conscientiousness. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carroll et al., 2009</ref>) revealed risk factors related to addiction such as age, sex, impulsivity, sweet-liking, nov- elty reactivity, proclivity for exercise, and environ- mental impoverishment. Additionally, addiction is also linked to environmental and social factors such as neighborhood environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Crum et al., 1996)</ref>, family environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cadoret et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brent, 1995)</ref> and social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Botvin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Oetting and Beauvais, 1987)</ref>. Traditionally, in behavior science research, data are collected from surveys or interviews with a limited number of people. The advent of social media makes a large volume of diverse user data available to researchers, which makes it possible to study SUD based on online user behaviors in a natural setting. Typical data from social me- dia include demographics (age, gender etc.), sta- tus updates (text posts etc.), social networks (fol- lower and following graph etc.) and likes (thumb up/down etc.). Recently, social media analytics has increasingly become a powerful tool to help understand the traits and behaviors of millions of social media users such as personal traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Golbeck et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Volkova and Bachrach, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Youyou et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kili√ß and Pan, 2016)</ref>, brand preferences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yang et al., 2015)</ref>, communities and events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sayyadi et al., 2009)</ref>, influenza trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aramaki et al., 2011</ref>) and crime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Li et al., 2012)</ref>. So far, however, there has been limited work that di- rectly applies large scale social media analytics to automatically predict SUD. Among the work known to us, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhou et al., 2016</ref>) identified com- mon drug consumption behaviors with regard to the time of day and week. They also discov- ered common interests shared by drug users such as celebrities (e.g, Chris Tucker) and comedians (e.g., cheechandchong). In addition, ( ) automatically predicted SUD based on social media likes. Since their dataset is very similar to ours, we will use the Kosinski model as one of our baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dataset</head><p>The data for the study was collected from 2007 to 2012 as a part of the myPersonality project ( . myPersonality was a popular Facebook application that offered to its users psy- chometric tests and feedback on their scores. The data were gathered with an explicit opt-in consent for reuse for research purposes. Our study uses three separate datasets from myPersonality: Face- book status updates (a.k.a. posts), Facebook likes and SUD status.</p><p>The status update dataset contains 22 million textual posts authored by 153,000 users. The av- erage posts per user is 143 and the average words per user is 1730. We removed users who only have non-English posts and those who have written less than 500 words. Our final status update dataset includes 106,509 users with 21 million posts. Af- ter filtering out low frequency words (those appear less than 50 times in our corpus), the vocabulary size of the status update dataset is 73,935.</p><p>The likes dataset contains the Facebook likes used to express positive sentiment toward vari- ous targets such as products, movies, books, ex- pressions, websites and people (they are called Like Entities or LEs). Previous studies have demonstrated that social media likes speak vol- umes about who we are. In addition to directly sig- naling interests and preferences, social media likes are indicative of ethnicity, intelligence and per- sonality ( ). The like dataset includes the likes of 11 million Facebook users.</p><p>Overall, there are 9.9 million unique LEs and 1.8 billion user-like pairs in this dataset. The average likes per user is 161 and the average Likes each LE received is 182. We filter out users who have a small number of likes as well as LEs receiving a small number of likes. The filtering threshold for users is 50 and is 800 for LEs. After the filter- ing, our like dataset contains 5,138,857 users and 253,980 unique LEs.</p><p>The SUD dataset contains a total of 13,557 par- ticipants ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stillwell and Tunney, 2012)</ref>. Users were asked to answer questions like "Do you smoke?", with answers "daily or more", "less than daily" or "never". They also completed the Cigarette De- pendence Scale (CDS-5) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Etter et al., 2003)</ref>, Al- cohol Use Questionnaire(AUQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Townshend and Duka, 2005</ref>) and the Assessment of Substance Misuse Questionnaire (ASMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Willner, 2000</ref>). Based on these assessments, the participants were divided into groups for each SUD type. For ex- ample, based on the assessment of tobacco use, a person is categorized as "daily or more" (group 3), "less than daily" (group 2), or "never" (group 1). The validity of the grouping was confirmed by the CDS-5 scores of the groups. Similarly, based on the assessment of alcohol use, participants were categorized as "weekly or more" (group 3), "less than once a week" (group 2) or "never" (group 1). Finally, based on the assessment of drug use, a person is assigned to "weekly or more" (group 3), "less than once a week" (group 2), or "never" (group 1). Among all the SUD participants, 37% of them are males and 63% are females. Their av- erage age is 23 years old.</p><p>Since the like, status update and SUD datasets are only partially overlapping, their intersections are usually much smaller. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarizes the sizes and usage of these datasets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows additional details of the SUD dataset including the distributions of each SUD class.</p><p>In summary, among all the datasets we have, the unsupervised like dataset is the largest (5 million+ people). We also have a significant amount of un- supervised status update data (100k+ users). In contrast, the supervised datasets which have the SUD ground truth are pretty small, ranging from 896 for the intersection of the likes, status updates and SUD (LikeStatusSUD in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) to 3508, which is the intersection of the likes and SUD (LikesSUD in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Thus, the main focuses of this research include (1) employing unsuper- vised feature learning to take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised data (2) employing multi- view learning to combine heterogeneous user data for better prediction.</p></div>

Since we only use Facebook status updates (a.k.a. posts) in this study, we call the process Single-view user Post Embedding (SPE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">SPE Feature Learning Methods</head><p>Since each user is associated with a sequence of textual posts, we have explored the following methods to learn a SPE for the user.</p><p>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a mathematical technique that is frequently used for dimension reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Lathauwer et al., 2000</ref>). Given any m * n matrix A, the algorithm will find matrices U , V and W such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A = U W V T .</formula><p>Here U is an orthonormal m * n matrix, W is a di- agonal n * n metrix and V is an orthonormal n * n matrix. Dimensionality reduction is done by com- puting R = U * W r where W r neglects all but the r largest singular values in the diagonal matrix W . In our study, the m is the number of users, n is the number of unique words in the vocabu- lary. A ij = k where k is how many times word j appears in user i 's posts.</p><p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a genera- tive graphical model that allows sets of documents to be explained by unobserved latent topics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blei et al., 2003</ref>). For each document, LDA outputs a multinomial distribution over a set of latent topics. For each topic, LDA also outputs a multinomial distribution over the vocabulary.</p><p>To learn an SPE for each user based on all his/her posts, we have tried several methods (1) UserLDA: it treats all the posts from each user as one big document and trains an LDA model to drive the topic distribution for this document. The per-document topic distribution is then used as the SPE for this user. (2) PostLDA Doc: it treats each post as a separate document and trains an LDA model to derive a topic distribution for each post. To derive the SPE for each user, we aggregate  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(topic|user) = w‚ààvoc P (topic|w) * p(w|user)</formula><p>where voc represents the vocabulary, p(w|user) is the probability that word w appears in the posts of user and p(topic|w) is the topic distribution of a word w, which is available internally in an LDA model. For the UserLDA model, all the hyper pa- rameters were set to default values. For all the PostLDA models, since Facebook posts are usu- ally short and have a small number of topics in each post, we set the hyper parameter Œ± to 0.3, as suggested in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schwartz et al., 2013</ref>) Document Embedding with Distributed Mem- ory (D-DM) Given a document, D-DM simulta- neously learns a vector representation for each word and a vector for the entire document ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Le and Mikolov, 2014</ref>). During training, the document vector and one or more word vectors are aggre- gated to predict a target word in the context. To learn an SPE for each user, we have explored two methods (1) User-D-DM: it treats all the posts by the same user as one document and trains a docu- ment vector to represent the user. (2) Post-D-DM: it treats each post as a document and train a D-DM to learn a vector for each post. To derive the SPE for a user, we aggregate all the post vectors from the same person using "average".</p><p>Document Embedding with Distributed Bag of </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">SUD Prediction with SPE</head><p>In our experiments, to search for the best model, we systematically varied the output SPE dimen- sion from 50, 100, 300, to 500. We used the Gen- sim implementation of SVD, LDA, D-DM and D- DBOW in our experiments. For D-DM, the con- text window size was set to 5. We compared our models with two baselines that use only supervised learning (1) a unigram model which uses unigrams as the predicting fea- tures. Since we have a large number of uni- grams, we performed supervised feature selection to lower the total number of input features. Fi- nally since all our SUD variables have three val- ues, we employed SVM in 3-way classifications. (2) a LIWC model which uses human engineered LIWC features for SUD prediction. LIWC is a psycholinguistic lexicon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pennebaker et al., 2015</ref> <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> as the training data for SPE learning and the StatusSUD dataset for supervised SUD prediction .</p><note type="other">) that has been frequently used in text-based human behavior prediction. Since the number of LIWC features is relatively small, no feature selection was performed. Here, we only used the Status Up- date dataset in</note><p>We evaluate the performance of our models us- ing 10-fold cross validation. The evaluation re- sults shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> are based on weighted ROC AUC of the best models. Among all the fea- ture learning methods for Facebook status updates, User-D-DBOW performed the best. It signifi- cantly outperformed all the baseline systems that only rely on supervised training (p &lt; 0.01 based on t-tests). It also significantly outperformed all the traditional feature learning methods such as LDA and SVD (p &lt; 0.01 based on t-tests). More- over, in terms of whether to treat all the posts by the same user as one big document or separate documents, LDA prefers one post one document (models with a "post" prefix) while all the doc- ument vector-based methods prefer one user one document (models with a "User" prefix). More- over, to use post-level LDA to derive the SPE of a user, the document-based aggregation method (PostLDA Doc) performed better than the word- based method (PostLDA Word).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Single-View Like Embedding (SLE)</head><p>In addition to textual posts, each user account is also associated with a set of likes. Since the like dataset is very sparse (e.g., among the millions of unique likes on Facebook, each user only has a small number of likes), we conduct experiments to learn a dense vector representation for all the likes by a user. We call this process Single-view user Like Embedding (SLE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">SLE Feature Learning Methods</head><p>The input to SLE is simply a set of LEs liked by a user. Each LE is represented by its id. To map such a representation to a dense user like vector, we have tried multiple methods. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is simi- lar to the one used in SPE except A ij = 1 if user i likes LE j . Otherwise, it is 0. Here A is a m * n matrix where m is the number of users and n is the number of unique LEs in the like dataset.</p><p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). To apply LDA to the like data, each individual LE is treated as a word token and all the LEs liked by the same person form a document. The order of the LEs in the document is random. For each user, LDA outputs a multinomial distribution over a set of la- tent "Like Topics". For example, a "Like Topic" about "hip hop music" may include famous hip hop songs and musicians.</p><p>Autoencoder (AE) is a neural network-based method for self-taught learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006</ref>). It learns an identity func- tion so that the output is as close to the input as possible. Although an identity function seems a trivial function to learn, by placing additional con- straints (e.g,, to make the number of neurons in the hidden layer much smaller than that of the input), we can still force the system to uncover structures in the data. Architecturally, the AE we used has one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. For each user, we construct a training in- stance (X, Y ) where the input vector X and out- put vector Y are the same. The size of X and Y is the total number of unique LEs in our dataset. X i and Y i equal to 1 if the user likes LE i . Otherwise they are 0.</p><p>Document Vector with Distributed Memory (D-DM) We also applied D-DM to the like data. Given all the likes of a user, D-DM learns a vector representation for each LE as well as a document vector for all the LEs from the same user. We use the learned document vector as the output SLE.</p><p>Document Vector with Distributed Bag of Words (D-DBOW) Similarly, we applied D- DBOW to the like dataset. Since D-DBOW does not use a local context window and the words for prediction are randomly sampled from the en- tire document, it is more appropriate for the like dataset than D-DM. where the relative positions of LEs do matter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">SUD Prediction with SLE</head><p>Similarly, we systematically varied the output SLE dimension from 50, 100, 300, to 500 in order to search for the best model. We used the Gen- sim implementation of SVD, LDA, D-DM and D- 0.795 0.791 :2-way classification, 3-way for the others DBOW in our experiments. For D-DM, the con- text window size was set to 20. We used Keras with Theano backend to implement AE.</p><p>We used SVM to perform 3-way classification. We compared our results with a unigram base- line. We also compared our results with that of the Kosinski model reported in ( ). The Kosinski model was trained on the same Facebook like dataset. However, its results were based on two-way classification, a simpler task than 3-way classification. All the results are based on weighted ROC AUC.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> We think this is due to the fact that D-DBOW does not use local context window, thus is not sensitive to the positions of LEs in a document. Since LE positions are randomly decided in our like data, D-DBOW seems to be a better fit for this dataset.</p></div>

Typically, there are three steps to train DCCA: (1) using a denoising autoencoder to pre- train each single view. In our experiments, we pretrain each single view using SPE or SLE.

Here, we choose the outputs from D-DBOW since it consistently outperformed all the other methods in learning SPEs and SLEs. We have run CCA and DCCA in two settings (1) balanced setting in which the SPE and SLE dimensions are always the same (2) imbalanced setting in which the dimension of SPE may be different from that of SLE. Since we var- ied the output dimensions of SPE and SLE from 50, 100, 300, to 500 systematically, the input di- mension to MUE under the balanced setting are 100, 200, 600 and 1000. When running CCA and DCCA under the imbalanced setting, we only chose the best SPE (with 50 dimensions) and the best SLE (with 300 dimensions). We also varied the number of MUE output dimensions systemati- cally from 20,50,100,200,300,400,500 to 1000 (up to the total input MUE dimensions). We used the LikeStatus dataset in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> as the training data for multi-view unsupervised feature learning. For MUE-based supervised SUD predication, we used the LikeStatusSUD data. In our experiments, we use a variant of CCA called wGCCA implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benton et al., 2016</ref>) where we set the weights for both views to be equal 1 .

We also varied the number of hidden lay- ers from 1 to 3 to tune the performance.</p><p>We compared our multi-view learning results with 3 baselines: BestSPE and BestSLE are the best single view models. We also used a 3rd baseline called Unigram combine, which simply concatenates all the post and like unigrams to- gether and then applies supervised feature selec- tion before uses the remaining features in a SVM- based classification. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>, both wGCCA and DCCA significantly outperformed the unigram-based baseline (p &lt; 0.01 based on t- test). The difference between the best multi-view models (wGCCA balanced for Alcohol and drug, wGCCA imbalanced for illicit drugs) and the best single view models are also significant (p &lt; 0.01). wGCCA also performed significantly better than DCCA on our tasks (p &lt; 0.01 based on t-tests).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Social Media and Substance Use</head><p>In addition to building models that predict SUD, we are also interested in understanding the rela- tionship between a person's social media activi- ties and substance use behavior. Since many of the SPEs and SLEs are not easily interpretable, in this section, we focus on the LIWC features from status updates and the LDA topics from both Likes and status updates. Since the SUD ground truth is an ordinal variable and the LIWC/LDA features are numerical, we used Spearman's rank corre- lation analysis to identify features that are most significantly correlated with SUD. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the LIWC features that are significantly correlated with at least one type of SUD (p &lt; 0.05). The color red represents a positive correlation while blue represents a negative correlation. In addi- tion, the saturation of the color indicates the sig- nificance of the correlation. The darker the color is, the more significant the correlation is. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, swear words such as "fuck" and "shit", sexual words such as "horny" and "sex", words related to biological process such as "blood" and "pain" are positively correlated with all three types of SUD. In addition, words re- lated to money such as "cash", words related to body such as "hands" and "legs", words related to ingestion such as "eat" and "drink" are posi- tively correlated with both alcohol and drug use; words related to motion such as "car" and "go" are positively correlated with both alcohol and to- bacco use. In addition, female references such as "girl" and "woman", prepositions, space reference words such as "up" and "down" are positively cor- related with alcohol use, while words related to anger such as "hate" and "kill", words related to health such as "clinic" and "pill" are positively correlated with drug use.</p><p>In terms of LIWC features that are negatively correlated with SUD, words associated with the past such as "did" and "ago" are negatively corre- lated with both tobacco and drug use; assent words such as "ok", "yes" and "agree" are negatively cor- related to both alcohol and tobacco use. In addi- tion, male references such as "boy" and "man", words related to reward such as "prize" and "ben- efit", words related to positive emotions such as "nice" and "sweet", first person pronouns (plu- ral) such as "we" and "our" are negatively corre- lated to drug use. Moreover, impersonal pronouns such as "it", differentiation words such as "but" and "else", and work-related words such as "job" and "work" are negatively correlated with alcohol use. Surprisingly, risk related words such as "dan- ger", words related to sadness, death and negative emotions are also negatively correlated with alco- hol use.</p><p>There are a few surprising correlations in our results. For example, female references such as "girl" and "woman" are positively related to alco- hol use while male references such as "man" and "boy" are negatively related to drug use. To inter- pret this, previous research has shown ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schwartz et al., 2013</ref>) that female references actually are used more often by male authors and vice versa. Thus, our findings suggest that males are more likely to use alcohol while females are less likely to use illicit drugs.</p><p>We have also used Spearman's correlation anal- ysis to identify SUD-related "Like Topics" and "Status update Topics" learned by LDA. Since the number of significant topics is quite large, in Ta- ble 6, we only show a few samples. Based on a user's status updates, "swear topics" (T1, T9) are positively correlated with both tobacco and drug use, which is consistent with our LIWC findings. The "night life topic" (T5) is positively related to alcohol use. In addition, school related top- ics (T2, T6) are negatively correlated with tobacco and alcohol use. Positive family-related activities (T10) are negatively correlated with drug use. In addition, based on the LDA topics learned from "likes", a preference for rock music (T3,T11) is positive correlated with tobacco and drug use. A preference for movies such as "V For Vendetta" and "Boondock Saints" (T7) is positively cor- related with alcohol use, while having a hobby (T12), liking cartoons and shows favored by kids (T8) or liking movies and brands favored by girls (T4) are negatively correlated with drug, alcohol and tobacco use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Discussion and Future Work</head><p>Currently, our multi-view unsupervised features learning methods only learn from the intersection of the like and status update data, which is much smaller than either the like or the status update data. Similarly, MUE-based supervised predic- tion used only the intersection of all three datasets which is very small (only contains 896 users).</p><p>Thus, it would be useful if a future multi-view fea- ture learning algorithm is capable of using all the available data (e.g., the union of all the supervised and unsupervised training data). Moreover, our best SPE model only has 50 dimensions while our best SLE model has 300 dimensions. This might be because the supervised training data used by SPE is almost three times smaller than that used by SLE . But surprisingly, SPE-based models per- formed better than SLE-based models. We expect that with more training data, the performance of SPE-based methods can be further improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>We believe social media is a promising plat- form for both studying SUD-related human be- haviors as well as engaging the public for sub- stance abuse prevention and screening. In this study, we have focused on four main tasks (1) employing unsupervised features learning to take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised so- cial media data (2) employing multi-view feature learning to combine heterogeneous user informa- tion such as "likes" and "status updates" to learn a comprehensive user representation (3) building SUD prediction models based on learned user fea- tures (4) employing correlation analysis to obtain human-interpretable results. Our investigation has not only produced models with the state-of-the-art prediction performance (e.g., for all three types of SUD, our models achieved over 80% prediction accuracy based on AUC), but also demonstrated the benefits of incorporating unsupervised hetero- geneous user data for SUD prediction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, among all the SLE meth- ods, the D-DBOW model performed the best. It significantly outperformed the unigram baseline that does not use any unsupervised data (p &lt; 0.01 based on t-tests). It also significantly outper- formed all the traditional feature learning method such as SVD and LDA (The Kosinski model used SVD for feature learning) (p &lt; 0.01 based on t-tests). Between the two document vector- based methods, D-DBOW outperformed D-DM.</figDesc></figure>

Words (D-DBOW) D-DBOW learns a global doc-
ument vector to predict words randomly sampled 
from the document (Le and Mikolov, 2014). Un-
like D-DM, D-DBOW only learns a vector for the 
entire document. It does not learn vectors for in-
dividual words. Neither does it use a local con-
text window since the words for prediction are ran-
domly sampled from the entire document. Similar 
to D-DM, to derive the SPE for a user, we used 
two methods (1) User-D-DBOW and (2) Post-D-
DBOW.
