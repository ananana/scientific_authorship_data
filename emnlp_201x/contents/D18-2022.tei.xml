				<p>Annotating entity mentions and linking them to a knowledge resource are essential tasks in many domains. It disambiguates mentions, introduces cross-document coreferences, and the resources contribute extra information, e.g. taxonomic relations. Such tasks benefit from text annotation tools that integrate a search which covers the text, the annotations, as well as the knowledge resource. However, to the best of our knowledge, no current tools integrate knowledge-supported search as well as entity linking support. We address this gap by introducing knowledge-supported search func-tionality into the INCEpTION text annotation platform. In our approach, cross-document references are created by linking entity mentions to a knowledge base in the form of a structured hierarchical vocabulary. The resulting annotations are then indexed to enable fast and yet complex queries taking into account the text, the annotations, and the vocabulary structure.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In many domains, annotating documents is a key re- quirement to solve complex problems like identify- ing sentiment targets in customer reviews, or identi- fying disease symptoms in medical texts. Tradition- ally, annotation tasks involved creating dense layers of annotation, e.g. part-of-speech or dependency annotations made on every single word, single or multi-token named entity mentions. Nowadays, the information to be annotated is often sparsely dis- tributed, e.g. the mentions of particular types of entities. Finding spans of text which are candidates for a particular annotation type has thus become an important and challenging aspect of the annotation process. Therefore, it is essential that annotators can search the corpus, making queries over the full text as well as over the annotations. Linking en- tity mentions to a structured knowledge resource (e.g. a taxonomy) allows them to be disambiguated, which facilitates interpreting, processing, and nav- igating the annotated texts by effectively creating cross-document coreferences.</p><p>Consider a wine market specialist analysing a corpus of wine reviews. She wants to annotate men- tions of different types of wines and link them to a knowledge resource, more specifically to a wine taxonomy. However, since annotating the entire corpus would take too much time, she wants to focus on statements made about certain properties of specific wines. Thus, she needs to search for keywords ("price", "quality", etc.), mentions of wines of certain types ("Bordeaux", "Burgundy"), or already annotated statements (e.g. to find com- parative reviews). Thus, the specialist might pose queries such as "sentences containing statements about the price of all kinds of Bordeaux wines" in order to completely perform her corpus analy- sis. Note that the analyst cannot prepare a task- specific corpus in advance, because she only dis- covers which properties of the wines are addressed by the reviews as she goes along with the analysis.</p><p>We are not aware of any web-based text anno- tation tool that supports this kind of explorative annotation tasks requiring full-text search, cross- document entity linking, and annotation search, and, at the same time, takes into account the hi- erarchical relations of a taxonomy in a tightly in- tegrated way. To address this gap, we integrate knowledge-supported search capabilities into the INCEpTION annotation platform ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Klie et al., 2018)</ref> to provide a flexible way of searching the corpus during the annotation process. The corpus and annotations are indexed at token level. Primitive attributes (string, numeric, boolean) and attributes linking annotations to a knowledge base are in- dexed and can be queried. For linked annotations, it also considers the super-type/hypernym relations in the respective knowledge resource. Section 2 highlights use cases in which those functionalities are beneficial. Section 3 briefly introduces the INCEpTION annotation platform. Section 4 describes the knowledge-supported search functionality. Section 5 describes which types of knowledge resources the platform supports. Finally, Section 6 describes the related work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Use cases</head><p>This section examines three exemplary scenarios of increasing complexity that highlight the benefits of knowledge-supported search in an annotation tool. We consider a wine market specialist who is investigating a corpus of wine reviews to identify the qualities most valued by the consumers and for which they may be willing to pay more. Her goal is to gain insights on consumer preferences, and the annotations she performs are a means to achieve this goal. The examples use the wine ontology from the W3C's OWL Web Ontology Language Guide, 1 a popular example of an OWL-based ontology.</p><p>Scenario I: Mention identification. The user wants to annotate mentions of a certain concept, e.g. types of wines. She starts with an initial list of wine types and uses the full text search to locate potential mentions, e.g. <ref type="bibr">Bordeaux.</ref> Since the query is ambiguous (e.g. it could refer to the city or to the region instead of the wine type), she reviews each match and annotates it only when appropriate. If she discovers a wine type during this process that is not yet on her list, she adds it and again uses the full text search to locate and annotate its mentions.</p><p>Scenario II: Concept linking. The user now links the previously identified mentions to a taxon- omy where the types of wines are organized into a tree or directed acyclic graph. For example, the vo- cabulary encodes that Château d'Yquem is a wine belonging to the Sauternes type, which in turn is a subtype of Bordeaux. These links effectively in- troduce cross-document coreferences within the corpus. Using the annotation search capabilities, the user wants to locate mentions of a wine type. This should consider the vocabulary structure, such that a search for a general wine type (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Bordeaux)</ref> also finds mentions of all its subtypes.</p><p>Scenario III: Concepts in context. In addition to the linked concept mentions from the previous scenario, we assume that the corpus also carries other types of annotation, e.g. a custom claim anno- tation which identifies text spans containing state- ments made about properties of the wine. The user 1 https://www. <ref type="bibr">w3</ref>.org/TR/owl-guide/wine.rdf now wants to query the linked concept mentions in conjunction with these claims, e.g. to locate claims about particular types of wines. She may search for "claims about wines either from the Bordeaux or from the Burgundy types, containing words matching the pattern 'expensive.*'" ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>These scenarios underline the benefit of integrat- ing full text and knowledge-supported annotation search into an annotation tool. The next sections shows how INCEpTION addresses these needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The INCEpTION platform</head><p>INCEpTION 2 is a generic multi-user annotation platform aiming to cover three essential aspects of text annotation in a single tool: 1) corpus building, 2) knowledge modelling, and 3) annotation, and to combine them with machine-learning-based as- sistive mechanisms (so-called recommenders) to improve the annotation efficiency and quality.</p><p>INCEpTION is implemented as a Java- based web application using Tomcat, Spring Boot and Wicket. It is partially based on WebAnno (Eckart de <ref type="bibr">Castilho et al., 2016</ref>), which we have modularized step-by-step to accommodate the needs of INCEpTION. This has allowed us to exclude certain WebAnno modules, e.g. the origi- nal automation module, which we replace with our own recommender framework, as well as to add new modules such as the search capabilities and knowledge base integration discussed here. We retain the WebAnno modules for project manage- ment, inter-annotator agreement calculation, adju- dication, etc. as they are compatible with our new modules. The platform is open source software licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This paper focusses on the annotation search ca- pabilities of INCEpTION together with its knowl- edge base support. For the recommender mecha- nism, please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Klie et al. (2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Search</head><p>The search functionality of INCEpTION is acces- sible through a sidebar 1 in the annotation editor <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). It allows searching within the docu- ments of the project the user is currently work- ing on. After executing a query, the correspond- ing results are displayed grouped by document 2 . Clicking on a result causes the annotation area to switch to the corresponding document/text span 3 . Attributes that link an annotation to a knowledge base item are conveniently editable through an auto- complete field 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Choosing a search framework</head><p>The knowledge-supported search functionality called for a search framework that met three re- quirements: 1) supporting text and annotation search; 2) supporting frequent updates, since the index needs to be updated whenever the user cre- ates, changes or deletes an annotation; 3) it can be embedded directly in the annotation tool (i.e. no separate installation required). We considered three frameworks: the IMS Open Corpus Work- bench, Mímir and MTAS.</p><p>The IMS Open Corpus Workbench <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Christ, 1994)</ref> (IMS CWB) is an old but powerful tool to index and search annotated corpora. It introduced the popular Corpus Query Language (CQL).</p><p>Using Mímir (Tablan et al., 2015), queries over the annotated text can be combined with informa- tion from an knowledge base through SPARQL. This permits queries such as find all mentions X of persons that were born in London, where X is annotated as a person in the text, and X was born in London is contained in the knowledge base.</p><p>MTAS <ref type="bibr">(Brouwer et al., 2017</ref>) is a recent frame- work which implements a large part of CQL on top of Apache Lucene. Mímir and IMS CWB both assume that corpora are indexed once and queried often. Indexed docu- ments can neither be updated nor easily be deleted and replaced. MTAS does not support updates to documents, but it allows deleting and then re- indexing individual documents.</p><p>IMS CWB is implemented in C and can be run either as a server or in an interactive mode. It cannot be easily embedded into a Java application such as INCEpTION. Mímir is implemented in Java, but its architectural design assumes that it is being used as a server. MTAS can be run as a server, but it can also be embedded into a Java- based application.</p><p>In conclusion, this made MTAS the best choice to be integrated with INCEpTION.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Integrating the search framework</head><p>To manage the annotations, INCEpTION uses UIMA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ferrucci and Lally, 2004</ref>). For the knowl- edge base (KB), it uses RDF4J 4 . Thus, it was nec- essary to first implement a bridge from the UIMA data model to the MTAS data model while support- ing the customizable layer configuration provided by INCEpTION. The ability to index annotation attributes that link to KB items, i.e. classes and in- stances, was then added as a plugin to this bridge.</p><p>The bridge equally supports the built-in anno- tation layers (e.g. NAMED ENTITY) as well as user-defined layers (e.g. CLAIM). It indexes all the spans associated with all types of annotation layers (spans, relations, and chains). However, queries over relations and chains are limited since MTAS does not offer specific query operators for them. Indexed annotations must start and end at a token boundary. Subtoken annotations are not supported.</p><p>Each layer defines a set of attributes. E.g. the NAMED ENTITY layer defines a string attribute VALUE, which usually takes values such as LOC, PER, ORG and OTH for standard named entity anno- tation tasks. For our examples, we have also added WINE and GRAPE to that list. It also provides the attribute IDENTIFIER which can be used to link an annotation to a KB item (class or instance).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Full-text, annotation and attribute search</head><p>The token layer is built into INCEpTION and can be used to perform full-text queries. E.g., this query locates all occurrences of the token Bordeaux:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">"Bordeaux"</formula><p>Layers are referenced by their name. Attributes can be addressed using the syntax <ref type="bibr">[layer]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">[attribute]</ref>. Assuming that wine mentions are annotated as named entities of type WINE, the following query finds all mentions of wines. This addresses the needs of Scenario I (Section 2).</p><p>&lt;Named entity.value="WINE"/&gt;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Knowledge-supported search</head><p>Consider that the named entity annotation layer car- ries an IDENTIFIER attribute that holds the IRI (In- ternationalized Resource Identifier) of a KB item <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>). These IRIs are included in the index, together with the IRIs of any items located higher in the ontology hierarchy. As IRIs are hard to read, the index also includes the human-readable labels associated with the entries, so that the user can query using these labels instead.</p><p>A KB item can either be a class in the ontology hierarchy (e.g. a wine type or subtype) or an in- stance (e.g. a specific wine). The following types of queries can be performed to search for annota- tions linked to the KB: 1) mentions of a specific KB item; 2) mentions of a KB item, including the mentions of its descendants.</p><p>The syntax for addressing the attributes linked to the knowledge base is the same as for normal attributes. The user can either match against the IRI of the linked KB item or against its label. This will retrieve all mentions of the given item, plus all mentions of its descendants in the ontology. Thus, the query effectively traverses the ontology hierar- chy, starting in the given item and going down its corresponding subtree. This addresses queries like the one highlighted in Scenario II (Section 2).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">&lt;[layer].[attribute]="[label | IRI]" /&gt;</formula><p>The following example matches all mentions of wines under the Bordeaux branch of the ontology:</p><p>&lt;Named entity.identifier="Bordeaux"/&gt; By appending -exact to the attribute name, it is possible to limit the query to mentions of exactly one particular item:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">&lt;[layer].[attribute]-exact="[label | IRI]" /&gt;</formula><p>Note that multiple KB items may in principle carry the same label. To avoid this ambiguity, it may be necessary to query using the IRI.</p><p>Considering again that annotations are linked to the wine ontology, the following query locates all exact mentions of the Clos de Vougeot wine: &lt;Named entity.identifier-exact = "http://www. <ref type="bibr">w3</ref>.org/TR/2003/PR-owl-guide- 20031209/wine#ClosDeVougeotCotesDOr"/&gt;</p><p>The rich query language provided by MTAS allows to combine different query types like the ones previously introduced, using operators such as within or containing. Considering that our exam- ple dataset includes the custom CLAIM annotation type, we can address Scenario III (Section 2) by writing the following query, which retrieves all mentions of wines belonging to the Burgundy or Bordeaux types (and their subtypes), located inside a claim that matches the regular expression pattern expensive.* <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>(&lt;Named entity.identifier="Burgundy"/&gt; | &lt;Named entity.identifier="Bordeaux"/&gt;) within (&lt;Claim/&gt; containing "expensive.*") </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Knowledge-base integration</head><p>The knowledge-oriented search capabilities of INCEpTION are enabled by its KB module. This module allows the user to create a KB from scratch or to import one from an RDF file. Remote KBs can be accessed in a read-only mode via the SPARQL.</p><p>The KB management page <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>) allows editing classes, properties, instances and the cor- responding statements they are defined by. Using the search module, it also displays any annotated mentions 6 of the currently selected KB item.</p><p>As the KB module is RDF-based, every piece of information is stored as a triple &lt;subj, pred, obj&gt;. Since this model is very abstract, there are a number of different schemas defining common identifiers (IRIs) that provide additional semantics, e.g. RDF Schema 5 uses the IRI rdfs:subClassOf to encode a subclass relation between the items identified by the subject and the object of a triple.</p><p>To support a broad range of different knowledge resources, INCEpTION offers a configurable map- ping 7 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>). The user can choose from several predefined mappings (e.g. RDF, OWL, or SKOS) or define a custom mapping. The mapping mechanism relies on a minimal set of IRIs that must be defined for any KB used with the plat- form: the INSTANCE-OF relation is required to be able to identify instances, classes and properties within the ontology (&lt;X, instance-of, Y&gt;). Com- monly rdf:type is used here, but e.g. the RDF ver- sion of Wikidata uses a different IRI. Addition- 5 https://www. <ref type="bibr">w3</ref>.org/TR/rdf-schema/ ally IRIs identifying CLASS and PROPERTY defini- tions are required in order to populate the concept explorer 8 and the property explorer 9 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig- ure 2)</ref> -e.g. &lt;X, instance-of, class&gt;. The class hierarchy is defined via the SUBCLASS-OF IRI. Thus, hierarchies defined e.g. via rdfs:subClassOf or skos:broader are supported, but not hierarchies de- fined via skos:narrower. 6 While INCEpTION tries to detect root classes automatically, the correspond- ing query is resource intensive and may eventually time out on some large knowledge resources. Thus, it is also possible to bypass the automatic detection by manually specifying the IRIs of root classes. Fi- nally, IRIs for LABELs and DESCRIPTIONs can be defined. If present, labels are used instead of the IRI when referring to a class, property or instance. Descriptions are shown as a tooltip <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) when linking an annotation to a KB item.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related work</head><p>Several annotation tools support structured vocab- ularies or KBs and some can be used for cross- document annotation tasks. As INCEpTION is a generic annotation tool, we compare our work to the other generic tools. WebAnno (Eckart de Castilho et al., 2016), while not offering explicit support for structured vocab- ularies, can approximate them by combining two of its features: tagsets and constraints. Constraints allow to show a certain attribute of an annotation only when another attribute has a specific value, e.g. to show a COUNTRY attribute only if the TYPE property of the entity has the value location. Tagsets can then be used to control which values are ac- ceptable for the entity type or country properties. However, WebAnno has no support for search. <ref type="bibr">AlvisAE (Papazian et al., 2012</ref>) supports linguis- tic and semantic annotations and can connect them to a structured vocabulary. However, it does not offer the ability to search over annotations and con- sequently also has no ability to make use of the vocabulary structure in such queries.</p><p>CROMER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Girardi et al., 2014</ref>) is a tool for en- tity and event coreference annotation. It allows to annotate and link entity mentions to entities de- fined in a knowledge base and in this way to create implicit cross-document coreference links. It also offers a simple string-based search to locate poten- tial entity mentions. However, it does not allow to perform further searches involving the created annotations or the structure of the vocabulary.</p><p>NeuroCurator <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(O'Reilly et al., 2017</ref>) is a collabo- rative framework for annotating experiment param- eters in scientific papers using an ontology-driven approach. It is rather an interactive knowledge base population tool than a tool for cross-document coreference. Queries over the texts that make use of the information of the KB are not possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have introduced a knowledge-supported search mechanism into a generic text annotation tool, INCEpTION, to support entity linking and cross- document coreference annotation tasks. The need for such a functionality was motivated using three scenarios, all of which are facilitated using the knowledge-supported search mechanism. In future work, we plan to further extend the search mecha- nism, e.g. allowing to search over annotation sug- gestions provided by the recommender framework of INCEpTION and by further enhancing the abil- ity to match against information contained in the knowledge bases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: 1 Search sidebar with the query "all mentions of wines belonging either to the Bordeaux or to the Burgundy type, located inside a claim which contains the pattern expensive.* "; 2 search results grouped by document; 3 annotation area with a highlighted result; 4 auto-complete field allowing to select an entity from the knowledge base; 5 description of the entity the mouse cursor hovers over.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,74.01,62.81,453.53,214.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
