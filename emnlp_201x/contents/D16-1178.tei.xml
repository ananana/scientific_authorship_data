				<p>We present a probabilistic model of the influence of language on the behavior of the U.S. Supreme Court, specifically influence of amicus briefs on Court decisions and opinions. The approach assumes that amici are rational, utility-maximizing agents who try to win votes or affect the language of court opinions. Our model leads to improved predictions of justices&apos; votes and perplexity of opinion language. It is amenable to inspection, allowing us to explore inferences about the persua-siveness of different amici and influenceability of different justices; these are consistent with earlier findings. &quot;Language is the central tool of our trade.&quot; John G. Roberts, 2007 (Garner, 2010)</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), the highest court in the American judiciary, makes decisions with far-reaching effects. In a typical case, there are four participating parties: petitioners and respondents who file briefs arguing the merits of their sides of a case ("merits briefs"); third-party en- tities with an interest (but not a direct stake) in the case, who file amicus curiae 1 briefs to provide fur- ther arguments and recommendations on either side; and justices who, after oral arguments and discus- 1 Amicus curiae is Latin for "friends of the court." Hereafter, we use amicus in singular and amici in plural to refer to these interested third parties. It is common for several amici to co- author a single brief, which we account for in our model. sions, vote on the case and write "opinions" to ex- plain the Court's decisions. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In recent years, amicus briefs are increasingly be- ing employed as a lobbying tool to influence the Court's decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Franze and Anderson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kearney and Merrill, 2000</ref>). The con- tent of these briefs reveals explicit attempts to per- suade justices and provides a fascinating setting for empirical study of influence through language. As such, we take the perspective of an amicus, propos- ing a probabilistic model of the various parties to a case that accounts for the amicus' goals.</p><p>Our model of SCOTUS is considerably more comprehensive than past work in political science, which has focused primarily on ideal point models that use votes as evidence. Text has been incorpo- rated more recently as a way of making such models more interpretable, but without changing the funda- mental assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lauderdale and Clark, 2014</ref>). Here, we draw on decision theory to posit amici as rational agents. We assume these amici-agents max- imize their expected utility by framing their argu- ments to sway justices towards favorable outcomes.</p><p>We build directly on <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref>, who used utility functions to explicitly model the goals of am- ici in a probabilistic setting. Their approach only considered amici in aggregate, inferring nothing about any specific amicus, such as experience or mo- tivation for filing briefs. Here, we enrich their model to allow such analysis and also introduce Court opin- ions as evidence. By modeling the justices' author-ing process as well, we can capture an important aspect of amici's goals: influencing the text of the opinions.</p><p>In §3, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap- proach on vote prediction and perplexity. Further- more, we present analyses that reveal the persuasive- ness of amici and influenceability of justices that are consistent with past findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Generative Models of SCOTUS</head><p>Our approach builds on a series of probabilistic models only recently considered in NLP research. To keep the discussion self-contained, we begin with classical models of votes alone and build up toward our novel contributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Modeling Votes</head><p>Ideal point (IP) models are a mainstay in quantitative political science, often applied to voting records to place voters (lawmakers, justices, etc.) in a continu- ous space. A justice's "ideal point" is a latent vari- able positioning him in this space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Martin and Quinn (2002)</ref> introduced the unidimensional IP model for judicial votes, which posits an IP ψ j ∈ R for each justice j. Often the ψ j values are interpreted as po- sitions along a liberal-conservative ideological spec- trum. Each case i is represented by popularity (a i ) and polarity (b i ) parameters. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> A probabilistic view of the unidimensional IP model is that justice j votes in favor of case i's petitioner (as opposed to the re- spondent) with probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(v i,j = petitioner | ψ j , a i , b i ) = σ(a i + b i ψ j )</formula><p>where σ(x) = exp(x) 1+exp(x) is the logistic function. When the popularity parameter a i is high enough, every justice is more likely to favor the petitioner. The polarity b i captures the importance of a justice's ideology: polarizing cases (i.e., |b i | 0) push jus- tice j more strongly to the side of the petitioner (if b i has the same sign as ψ j ) or the respondent (other- wise).</p><p>Amici IP models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref> introduced a multidimensional IP model that incorporated text from merits and amicus briefs as evidence. They in- ferred dimensions of IP that are grounded in "top- ical" space, where topics are learned using latent Dirichlet allocation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>. In their pro- posed model, the merits briefs describe the issues and facts of the case, while amicus briefs were hy- pothesized to "frame" the facts and potentially influ- ence the outcome of the case. For case i and justice j, the vote probability is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(v i,j = petitioner | ψ j , θ i , ∆ i , a i , b i , c i ) (1) = σ a i + b i ψ j θ i + 1 |A i | k∈A i c s i,k i ∆ i,k case IP</formula><p>where A i is the set of amicus briefs filed on this case, s i,k denotes the side (∈ {petitioner, respondent}) supported by the kth brief, and c p i , and c r i are the ami- cus polarities for briefs on either side. The case IP is influenced by merits briefs (embedded in θ i ) and by the amicus briefs (embedded in ∆ i,k ), both of which are rescaled independently by the case discrimina- tion parameters to generate the vote probability. The model assumes that briefs on the same side share a single embedding and that individual briefs on one side influence the vote-specific IP equally.</p><p>New IP model: Persuasive amici. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lynch (2004)</ref> and others have argued that some amici are more effective than others, with greater influence on jus- tices. We therefore propose a new model which considers amici as individual actors. Starting from Eq. 1, we consider two additional variables: each amicus e's persuasiveness (π e &gt; 0) and each jus- tice j's influenceability (χ j &gt; 0). 4</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p(v i,j = petitioner | ψ j , χ j , θ i , ∆ i , a i , b i , π) (2) = σ a i + b i ψ j θ i + χ j |A i | k∈A i ¯ π i,k ∆ i,k</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">¯ π i,k = e∈E i,k πe |E i,k |</formula><p>is the average of their π- values, with E i,k denoting the set of entities who co- authored the kth amicus brief for case i.</p><p>Intuitively, a larger value of χ j will shift the case IP more towards the contents of the amicus briefs, thus making the justice seem more "influenced" by amicus. Likewise, briefs co-authored by groups of amici who are more effective (i.e., larger ¯ π i,k ), will "frame" the case towards their biases. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref>, we eschew the amicus polarity parame- ters (c i ) and instead rely on the influenceability and persuasiveness parameters. Furthermore, we note that they performed a post-hoc analysis of amici in- fluence on justices but we do so directly through χ j .</p><p>With appropriate priors on the latent variables, the generative story for votes is:</p><p>1. For each topic t ∈ {1, . . . , T }, draw topic-word distributions φ t ∼ Dirichlet(β). 2. For each justice j ∈ J , draw justice IP ψ j ∼ N (0, σ 2 J I + ρ1) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and influenceability χ j ∼ log N (0, σ 2 I I). 3. For each amicus-entity e ∈ E, draw its persua- siveness π e ∼ log N (0, σ 2 P I).  </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">4. For each case i ∈ C: (a) Draw case parameters a i , b i ∼ N (0, σ 2 C ).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">i,k,n ∼ Categorical(∆ i,k ) and w (a) i,k,n ∼ Categorical(φ z (a) i,k,n ).</formula><p>(e) For each participating justice j ∈ J i , draw vote v i,j according to Eq. 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modeling Opinions</head><p>In most SCOTUS cases, a justice is assigned to au- thor a majority opinion, and justices voting in the majority "join" in the opinion. Justices may author additional opinions concurring or dissenting with the majority, and they may choose to join concurring and dissenting opinions written by others. Here, we extend the IP model of votes to generate the opinions of a case; this marks the second major extension be- yond the IP model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref>. SCOTUS justices often incorporate language from merits <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Feldman, 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Feldman, 2016a</ref>) and amicus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Collins et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ditzler, 2011</ref>) briefs into their opinions. While amicus briefs are not usually used directly in legal analyses, the back- ground and technical information they provide are often quoted in opinions. As such, we model opin- ions as a mixture of its justice-authors' topic pref- erences, topic proportions of the merits briefs (θ), and topic proportions of the amicus briefs (∆). This can also be viewed as an author-topic model <ref type="bibr">(RosenZvi et al., 2004</ref>) where justices, litigants, and groups of amici are all effective authors. To accomplish this, we introduce an explicit switching variable x for each word, which selects between the different sources of topics, to capture the mixture proportions.</p><p>Since any justice can author additional opinions explaining the rationale behind their votes, we con- catenate all opinions supporting the same side of a case into a single document. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> However, we note that concurring opinions often contain perspectives that are different from the majority opinion and by concatenating them, we may lose some infor- mation about individual justices' styles or prefer- ences. Building on the generative model for votes, the generative story for each case i's two opinions- documents is:</p><p>5. For each justice j ∈ J , draw topics Γ j ∼ Dirichlet(α). 6. For each case i ∈ C: (a) For each side s ∈ {petitioner, respondent}, draw "author"-mixing proportions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τ s i ∼ Dirichlet               p(v i,1 = s) . . . p(v i,|J | = s) 1 1               (3)</formula><p>where the last two dimensions are for choos- ing topics from the merits and amicus briefs, re-spectively. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Intuitively, our model assumes that opinions will incorporate more language from justices who agree with it. (b) For each side s ∈ {petitioner, respondent} and each word w</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(o)</formula><p>i,s,n in the opinion for side s,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">i. Draw x i,s,n ∼ Categorical(τ s i ). ii. If x i,s,n ∈ J i , draw z (o) i,s,n ∼ Categorical(Γ x i,s,n ), the justice's topic distribution. iii. If x i,s,n = merits, draw z (o) i,s,n ∼ Categorical(θ i ), the merits topic distribu- tion. iv. If x i,s,n = amici, draw z (o) i,s,n ∼ Categorical(∆ s i ), side s's amicus briefs topic distribution. v. Draw word w (o) i,s,n ∼ Categorical(φ z (o) i,s,n ).</formula><p>Unlike in the Court, where an opinion is mainly authored by a single justice, all the participating jus- tices contribute to an opinion in our generative story, with different proportions. This approach simpli- fies the computational model and reflects the closed- door nature of discussions held by justices prior to writing their opinions. Our model assumes that jus- tices debate together, and that the arguments are re- flected in the final opinions. In future work, we might extend the model to infer an authoring pro- cess that separates an initial author from "joiners."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Amici Utility</head><p>Our approach assumes that amici are rational and purposeful decisionmakers who write briefs to in- fluence the outcome of a case; this assumption leads to the design of the distribution over ∆ (generative model step 4(d)i). When writing a brief ∆, an am- icus seeks to increase the response to her brief (i.e., votes), while keeping her costs low. We encode her objectives as a utility function, which she aims to maximize with respect to the decision variable ∆:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">U (∆) = R(∆) − C(∆)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where R(·) is the extrinsic response (reward) that an amicus gets from filing brief ∆ and C(·) is the "cost" of filing the brief; dependency on other latent <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In cases where there are less than nine justices voting, the size of τ p i and τ r i may be smaller.</p><p>variables is notationally suppressed. When author- ing her brief, we assume that the amicus writer has knowledge of the justices (IP and topic preferences), case parameters, and merits, but not the other amici participating in the case. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Amicus curiae are motivated to position them- selves (through their briefs) in such a way as to im- prove the likelihood that their arguments will per- suade SCOTUS justices. This is reflected in the way a justice votes or through the language of the opin- ions. Hence, we investigate two response functions. First, an amicus supporting side s seeks to win votes for s,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R vote (∆) = 1 |J | j∈J p(v j = s | . . .),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which is the expected number of votes for side s, under the model. This follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref>. An alternative is to maximize the (topical) simi- larity between her brief and the Court's opinion(s) siding with s,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R opinion (∆) = 1 − H 2 (∆, Ω s ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">H 2 (P, Q) = 1 2 √ P − √ Q 2 2</formula><p>is the squared Hellinger (1909) distance between two distributions, and Ω s is the expected topic mixture under the model assumptions in §2.2 (which has a closed form). In short, the amicus gains utility by ac- curately predicting the expected opinion, thereby gaining publicity and demonstrating to members, donors, potential clients, and others that the lan- guage of the highly visible SCOTUS opinion was influenced. Both Eqs. 5 and 6 reward amici when justices "agree" with them, for different definitions of agreement.</p><p>We assume the cost C(∆) = H 2 (∆, θ), the squared Hellinger distance between the mixture pro- portions of the amicus brief and merits briefs. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The cost term defines the "budget" set of the amicus: briefs cannot be arbitrary text, as there is disutility or effort required to carefully frame a case, and mone- tary cost to hiring legal counsel. The key assumption is that framing is costly, while simply matching the merits is cheap (and presumably unnecessary).</p><p>Notationally, we use U vote to refer to models where Eq. 5 is in the utility function (in Eq. 4) and U opinion where it is Eq. 6.</p><p>Random utility models Recall our assumption that amici are purposeful writers whose briefs are optimized for their utility function. In an ideal set- ting, the ∆ which we observe will be utility maxi- mizing. We simplify computation by assuming that these amici agents' preferences also contain an id- iosyncratic random component that is unobserved to us. This is a common assumption in discrete choice models known as a "random utility model" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McFadden, 1974)</ref>. We view the utility function as a prior on ∆,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">p util (∆ | . . .) ∝ exp ηU (∆),</formula><p>where our functional equations for utility imply −1 ≤ U (·) ≤ 1. η is a hyperparameter tuned us- ing cross validation. The behavior which we observe (i.e., the amicus' topic mixture proportions) has a likelihood that is proportional to utility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Parameter Estimation</head><p>The models we described above can be estimated within a Bayesian framework. We decoupled the estimation of the votes model from the opinions model; we first estimate the parameters for the votes model and hold them fixed while we estimate the new latent variables in the opinions model. In our preliminary experiments, we found that estimating parameters for both votes and opinions jointly led to slow mixing and poor predictive performance. Sep- arating the estimation procedure into two stages al- lows the model to find better parameters for the votes model, which are then fed into the opinions model as priors through the vote probabilities. We used Metropolis within Gibbs, a hybrid MCMC algorithm, to sample the latent parameters from their posterior distributions <ref type="bibr">(Tierney, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> For the Metropolis-Hastings proposal distributions, we used a Gaussian for the case parameters a, b, and justice IPs ψ, log-normal distributions for χ and π, <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The details of our sampler and hyperparameter settings can be found in §A and §B of the supplementary materials. and logistic-normal distribution for the variables on the simplex θ, ∆, τ , and Γ. We tuned the hyperpa- rameters of the proposal distributions at each itera- tion to achieve a target acceptance rate of 15-45%. We used T = 128 topics for model and initialized topic proportions (θ, ∆) and topic-word distribu- tions (φ) using online LDA <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Hoffman et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Data. In our experiments, we use SCOTUS cases between 1985-2014; votes and metadata are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Spaeth et al. (2013)</ref> and brief texts come from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref>. We concatenate each of the 2,643 cases' merits briefs from both parties to form a single doc- ument, where the text is used to infer the represen- tation of the case in topical space (θ; i.e., merits briefs are treated as "facts of the case"). Likewise, opinions supporting the same side of the case (i.e., majority and concurring vs. dissents) were concate- nated to form a single document. In our dataset, the opinions are explicitly labeled with the justice who authored them (as well as other justices who decide to "join" it).</p><p>As the amicus briefs in the dataset were not ex- plicitly labeled with the side that they support, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref> built a binary classifier with bag-of- n-gram features that took advantage of cues in the brief content that strongly signal the side that the amici supports (e.g., "in support of petitioner"). We used their classifier to label the amici's support- ing side. Additionally, we created regular expres- sion rules to identify and standardize amicus au- thors from the header of briefs. We filtered am- ici who have participated in fewer than 5 briefs <ref type="bibr">11</ref> and merged regional chapters of amicus organiza- tions together (i.e., "ACLU of Kansas" and "ACLU of Kentucky" are both labeled "ACLU"). On the other hand, we separated labeled amicus briefs by the U.S. Solicitor General according to the presi- dential administration when the brief is filed (i.e., an amicus brief filed during Obama's administration will be labeled "USSG-Obama"). The top three am- ici by number of briefs filed are American Civil Lib- erties Union (463), Utah (376), and National Asso- ciation of Criminal Defense Lawyers (359). We represent a document as a bag of n-grams with part of speech tags that follow the simple but effec- tive pattern (Adjective|Cardinal|Noun)+ Noun <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Justeson and Katz, 1995)</ref>. We filter phrases appearing fewer than 100 times or in more than 8,500 docu- ments, obtaining a final set of 48,589 phrase types. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the details of our corpus.</p><p>Predicting Votes. We quantify the performance of our vote model using 5-fold cross validation and on predicting future votes from past votes. The utility function in the vote model uses the response func- tion in Eq. 5. Due to the specification of IP models, we need the case parameters of new cases to predict the direction of the votes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gerrish and Blei (2011)</ref> accomplished this by using regression on legislative text to predict the case parameters (a, b). Here, we follow a similar approach, fitting ridge regression models on the merits brief topic mixtures θ to pre- dict a and b for each case. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> On the held-out test cases, we sampled the mixture proportions for the merits and amicus briefs directly using latent Dirich- let allocation with parameters learned while fitting our vote model. With the parameters from our fitted vote model and ridge regression, we can predict the votes of every justice for every case.</p><p>We compared the performance of our model with two strong baselines: (i) a random forest trained on case-centric metadata coded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Spaeth et al. (2013)</ref> to make predictions on how justices would vote ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Katz et al., 2014</ref>) and (ii) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref>'s amici IP model, which uses amicus briefs and their version of utility; it is a simpler version of our vote model that does not consider the persuasiveness of differ- ent amici or the influenceability of different justices. For prediction in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref>, we used the same approach described above to estimate the case pa- rameters a, b, and regressing on amicus brief topics (∆) instead for amicus polarities c p and c r . <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> Model 5-fold 2013 2014 Most frequent 0.597 0.694 0.650 Random forest 0.651 0.648 0.633 Vote model without U vote 0.661 0.655 0.660 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref> 0.675 0.658 0.661 Vote model with U vote 0.685 0.664 0.672 shows performance on vote prediction. We evaluated the models using 5-fold cross vali- dation, as well as on forecasting votes in 2013 and 2014 (trained using data from 1985 to the preceding year). Our model outperformed the baseline models. The improvement in accuracy over <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sim et al. (2015)</ref> is small; most likely because both models are very similar, the main difference being the parametriza- tion of amicus briefs. In the 2013 test set, the distri- bution of votes is significantly skewed towards the petitioner (compared to the training data), which re- sulted in the most frequent class classifier perform- ing much better than everything else. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> illus- trates our model's estimated ideal points for selected topics.</p><p>Predicting Opinions. We also estimated the opin- ion model using the utility function with response function in Eq. 6. We use perplexity as a proxy to measure the opinion content predictive ability of our model. Perplexity on a test set is commonly used to quantify the generalization ability of probabilistic models and make comparisons among models over the same observation space. For a case with opinion w supporting side s, the perplexity is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">exp − log p(w | s, . . .) N ,</formula><p>where N is the number of tokens in the opinion and a lower perplexity indicates better generalization per- formance. The likelihood term can be approximated using samples from the inference step. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows the perplexity of our model on opinions in the test set. As described in §2.4, we learn the vote model in the first stage before esti- mating the opinion model. Here, we compare our model against using vote models that do not in- clude U vote to evaluate the sensitivity of our opinion</p><note type="other">4 2 0 2 4 6 Ginsburg Sotomayor Kagan Breyer Kennedy Roberts Alito Scalia Thomas 17: juror, prosecutor, death penalty 4 2 0 2 4 6 32: speech, first amendment, free speech 4 2 0 2 4 6 61: eeoc, title vii, discrimination 4 2 0 2 4 6</note><p>120: marriage, same sex, man <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Justices' ideal points for selected topics.

Additionally, we compared against two baselines trained on just the opinions: one using LDA <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and another using the author-topic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004</ref>). For the author-topic model, we treat each opinion as being "authored" by the participating justices, a pseudo- author representing the litigants which is shared be- tween opinions in a case, and a unique amicus au- thor for each side. Our model with U opinion achieves better generalization performance than the simpler baselines, while we do not see significant differences in whether the first stage vote models use U vote . This is not surprising since the vote model's results are similar with or without U vote and it influences the opinion model indirectly through priors and U opinion .</p><p>In our model, the latent variable Γ j captures the proportion of topics that justice j is likely to con- tribute to an opinion. When j has a high probability of voting for a particular side, our informed prior in- creases the likelihood that j's topics will be selected for words in the opinion. While Γ j serves a similar purpose to ψ j in characterizing j through her ideo- logical positions, ψ j relies on votes and gives us a "direction" of j's ideological standing, whereas Γ j is estimated from text produced by the justices and only gives us the "magnitude" of her tendency to au- thor on a particular issue. In <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, we identify the top topics in Γ j by considering the deviation from the mean of all justice's Γ, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Γ j,k − 1 |J | j Γ j,k .</formula><p>Amici Persuasiveness.  fect on the case IP, which we call "persuasiveness."</p><p>A large π e indicates that across the dataset, e exerts a larger effect on the case IPs, that is, according to our model, she has a larger impact on the Court's decision than other amici. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> is a swarm plot illustrating the distribution of π values for different types of amicus writers. Our model infers that governmental offices tend to have larger π values than private organizations, es- pecially the U.S. Solicitor General. 14 In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lynch (2004)</ref> found through interviews with SCOTUS law clerks that "amicus briefs from the solicitor general are 'head and shoulders' above the rest, and are of- ten considered more carefully than party briefs."</p><p>Another interesting observation from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> is the low π value for ACLU and ABA, despite being pro- lific amicus brief filers. While it is tempting to say that amici with low π values are ineffective, we find that there is almost no correlation between π and the proportion of cases where they were on the winning side. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Note that our model does not assume that a John G.

Instead, an am- icus with large π will impact the case IP most, and thus explain a justice's vote or opinion (even dissent- ing) more than the other components in a case.</p><p>Insofar as π explains a vote, we must exercise cau- tion; it is possible that the amicus played no role in the decision-making process and the values of π e simply reflect our modeling assumptions and/or ar- tifacts of the data. Without entering the minds of SCOTUS justices, or at least observing their closed- door deliberations, it is difficult to measure the in- fluence of amicus briefs on justices' decisions.</p><p>Justice Influenceability. The latent variable χ j measures the relative effect of amicus briefs on jus- tice j's vote IP; when χ j is large, justice j's vote probability is affected by amicus briefs more. Since χ j is shared between all cases that a justice partic- ipates in, χ j should correspond to how much they value amicus briefs. Some justices, such as the late Scalia, are known to be dubious of amicus briefs, preferring to leave the task of reading these briefs to their law clerks, who will pick out any notable briefs for them; we would expect Scalia to have a smaller χ than other justices. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, we compare the χ values of justices with how often they cite an amicus brief in any opinion they wrote <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Franze and Anderson, 2015)</ref>. The χ values estimated by our model are sides is −0.0549. On average, an amicus supports the winning side in 55% of cases. For the ACLU, ABA, CAC, and CWFA, the proportions are 44%, 50%, 47%, and 50% respectively. consistent with our expectations. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We note that the χ values correlate considerably with the general ideological leanings of the justices. This might be a coincidence or an inability of the model's specification to discern between ideological extremeness and influenceability.   econometrics estimates structural utility-based deci- sions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berry et al., 1995</ref>, inter alia).</p><p>Researchers have used SCOTUS texts to study authorship ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al., 2013)</ref>, historical changes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2012)</ref>, power relationships (Danescu- Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Mizil et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Prabhakaran et al., 2013)</ref>, and pragmatics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Goldwasser and Daumé, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a random utility model of the Supreme Court that is more comprehensive than earlier work. We considered an individual amicus' persuasiveness and motivations through two different utility func- tions. On the vote prediction task, our results are consistent with earlier work, and we can infer and compare the relative effectiveness of an individual amicus. Moreover, our opinions model and opinion utility function achieved better generalization per- formance than simpler methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Amici "persuasiveness" by organization type.

			<note place="foot" n="4"> Note that the amici IP model of Sim et al. (2015), Eq. 1, is a special case of this model where χj = 1 and each case has polarity parameters for each side; no information is shared across briefs written by the same amicus-entity for different cases.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> The positive off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for justice IPs (ψj) orient the issue-specific dimensions in the same direction (i.e., with conservatives at the same end) and provide shrinkage of IP in each dimension to their common mean across dimensions (Lauderdale and Clark, 2014).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> Capturing strategic amici agents (a petitioner amicus choosing brief topics considering a respondent amicus&apos; brief) would require a game-theoretic model and, we conjecture, would require a much richer representation of policy and goals. That idea is left for future research. 9 Sim et al. (2015) used a Euclidean distance for cost rather than Hellinger distance, which we believe is a better fit for probability distributions without sacrificing symmetry (cf. KL divergence).</note>
