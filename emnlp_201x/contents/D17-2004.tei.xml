<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Structures that reveal relationships between dif- ferent information units in a document collection, e.g. relations between mentioned organizations, have been proposed to support humans analyzing document collections. Especially in exploratory search scenarios, where the information need is complex and cannot be served by a simple key- word search <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Marchionini, 2006</ref>), these structures are deemed beneficial. Even without supporting software, humans were found to naturally create such structures for themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chin et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, many types of structures and ap- proaches to extract them from text have been pro- posed. These include concept hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Sanderson and Croft, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Yang, 2012)</ref>, concept maps ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Briggs et al., 2004</ref>), predicate-argument networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(van Ham et al., 2009)</ref>, entailment between propo- sitions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adler et al., 2012</ref>) or co-occurrences of named entities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benikova et al., 2014</ref>). All of them can be seen as labeled graphs in which nodes and edges represent different information units ex- tracted from a document collection.</p><p>However, what remains unclear is which of these graphs are most helpful for a specific doc- ument exploration task. Only few papers evalu- ate their proposed graphs in a user study and usu- ally just compare it to baselines such as keyword- based search. Direct comparisons between differ- ent types of graphs are missing.</p><p>Carrying out such a comparative user study is a difficult endeavor. Typically, one would have different groups of subjects that work on a given task under different conditions, e.g. with graph A or B. The subjects' performance on the task, measured for example in completion time or re- sult quality, would then be compared between the groups to draw conclusions on whether graph A or B is more helpful. The first challenge is that a full end-user application has to be built around a graph-extraction method for such an experiment, which usually involves a non-trivial amount of im- plementation work. Second, even if full systems are already available for comparison, they might not be usable: Every difference between two sys- tems, as small as different font sizes or colors, can influence a subject's performance. As a result, ob- served performance differences cannot be directly attributed to the different graphs. Figure 1: User interface: After entering a search term (1), the system displays retrieved documents (right) and a graph built from them (left). When clicking on a node or edge (2), documents are filtered and highlighted (3) according to the spans associated with the selected graph element. Active filters are shown at the top (4). Opening a document (5) shows its full text with all highlighted spans.</p><p>In this work, we present GraphDocExplore, a framework for graph-based document exploration. Due to the following properties, it is particularly useful to carry out user studies as described above:</p><p>User Interface The framework already contains a fully implemented, modern and intuitive web ap- plication for explorative search in documents that can be used for experimental studies.</p><p>Graph-Text-Integration Rather than showing the constructed graph independently, it is tightly integrated with the documents via navigation, fil- tering and highlighting features to ensure that a user can effectively make use of it (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>Logging All actions a user performs in the web application are captured in a detailed log for fur- ther analysis and reconstruction of user behavior.</p><p>Graph-Independence Different methods to ex- tract graphs can be plugged into a generic inter- face, such that fair experimental comparisons that effectively control for all other confounding fac- tors can be set up easily and quickly.</p><p>Dynamic Graphs Integrated methods for graph extraction are notified about all user actions and can dynamically modify their graph during a ses- sion, allowing to study the personalization of a graph based on the user actions.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as fol- lows: First, we review different types of graphs and corresponding systems proposed in the past ( §2). Then, we present our framework from a functional ( §3) and technical perspective ( §4). Fi- nally, we report results of a first user study ( §5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Many methods to structure document collections can be seen as different kinds of labeled graphs generated from the documents. Early work stud- ied concept hierarchies which are graphs with concepts as nodes and edges representing hy- ponomy relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Sanderson and Croft, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lawrie et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kummamuru et al., 2004</ref>). More recently, personalized versions were pro- posed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Yang, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Yang, , 2015</ref>. Concept maps are a more expressive variant of these graphs in which the edges have different labels defining their meaning rather than all being taxonomic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Novak and Gowin, 1984)</ref> and can be used for the same purpose ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Briggs et al., 2004</ref>). Another popu- lar type of graph shows keywords (Tixier et al., 2016) or entities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benikova et al., 2014</ref>) as nodes with unlabeled edges between them depicting co- occurrences. Other graphs were suggested to de- pict entailment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adler et al., 2012</ref>) or relations ex- pressed by a specific predicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(van Ham et al., 2009</ref>). All of these structures can be captured with the abstract graph model in our framework.</p><p>In addition to specific graphs, more complex applications have been developed to support document explo- ration by integrating many different techniques, including graphs, in a single application. In con- trast to our work, their focus is on productive use, while we are mainly interested in the experimental evaluation, requiring us to study the use of specific graphs in isolation. Moreover, note that graphs in which nodes represent full documents, as ob- tained by traditional document clustering or docu- ment chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Shahaf and Guestrin, 2010)</ref>, are less useful for our application because no fine-grained highlights can be provided for nodes and edges.</p><p>With regard to experimental evaluations, only few of the suggested graphs were extrinsically evaluated and proven to be helpful in an ex- ploratory search scenario. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kummamuru et al. (2004)</ref> and Yang (2012) compare their approaches with previous work in user studies, but restrict the comparison to other methods producing concept hierarchies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kang et al. (2011)</ref> compare the pow- erful Jigsaw system against simpler alternatives, including keyword-based search and pen and pa- per. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been carried out for other types of graphs, e.g. for concept maps, and there are no studies comparing different types of graphs against each other. Thus, the framework presented in this work is highly needed to make such comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Functionality</head><p>The system for graph-based document exploration was designed in the style of well-known search engine interfaces. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the list of search results is complemented by a visual- ization of the graph that has been extracted from the retrieved documents. This type of integration follows the popular paradigm of faceted search, in which different taxonomies, either predefined or extracted from the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hearst and Stoica, 2009)</ref>, are offered along with the results to filter them. Instead of the typically small, single-level taxonomies, our application takes this idea further by offering a comprehensive graph.</p><p>User Interaction After executing a query, a user can both scroll through the list of retrieved doc- uments or navigate through the generated graph. Every node and (optionally) edge in the graph is associated with at least one span in one of the re- trieved documents (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Note that these spans must not match the label of the graph ele- ment, but can be other phrases referring to it. If a user selects an element in the graph, the corre- sponding spans are highlighted in the document snippets and the results are filtered to the subset of documents that contain at least one associated span. Filters can be combined, which reduces the documents to those containing spans for all, can be temporally deactivated and can also be removed completely. In the result list, the number of corre- sponding spans for each filter is displayed. Colors of nodes in the graph, filter tags and highlighted spans match. In the result list, a user can switch to the full text view of a document, which also con- tains highlights according to the current filters.</p><p>Graph Layouts The application currently pro- vides two different graph visualizations that we found to yield useful renderings for graphs of dif- ferent sizes. At any point, a user can switch be- tween them using the buttons in the top left cor- ner. The left part of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> gives an example of the full layout, which is a force-directed layout showing the complete graph. It allows the user to zoom in and out and pan to fully inspect the graph. While it has the advantage that it can provide an overview of the complete graph, the visualization can become complex for large graphs.</p><p>As an alternative, the application offers a fo- cused layout, which is shown on the right side of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. It shows only one focus node and its direct neighbors at a time, while every neigh- bor node has a number indicating how many more edges are connected to it. Selecting one of the neighbors moves that node to the center and dis- plays its neighbors. This allows to go through the graph step by step and it usually yields much cleaner visualizations, as the number of visible nodes is limited. Both visualizations support di- rected and undirected graphs. The modular design of the application allows to add alternative visual- izations in the future.</p><p>Logging In order to be able to thoroughly study the behavior of users that are working with the ap- plication, it creates a comprehensive log of all ac- tions that a user performed. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates how such a log looks like for a user session. The user, working on documents about student loans, starts by issuing the query credit check. The cor- responding log entry lists the keyword and a list of the retrieved documents (1). Next, she scrolled through the result list and stopped with documents 3, 26 and 17 in the visible section of the list (2). Zooming the graph made a certain set of nodes vis- ible (3). She then selected one of the nodes (4), which automatically created a filter (5) and re- duced the result list correspondingly. From the filtered result list, she opened document 17 (6), scrolled to a certain position (7) and closed it af- terwards <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. She then switches to the alternative graph layout (9) and continues her search. Note that the actual log also contains timestamps.</p></div>

The server-side portion is realized in Java. To enable the keyword search, we inte- grated Apache Solr 3 to index the documents. Dif- ferent graph generation modules can be plugged into the system and have access to the documents. Several document collections can be loaded into the framework and used with different graphs. User actions are logged in a text-based format. In addition to the graphs, the modular design also allows to easily change the search engine, e.g. to Lucene, or the logging mechanism, e.g. to a database. On the client-side, the user interface de- scribed in the previous section is realized with An- gular JS. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The server exposes a REST API to han- dle all communication with the frontend.</p><p>Graph Interface As mentioned above, different graph generation modules can be used with the framework. A configuration file defines the ac- tive type of graph per document collection. When starting a new search, the framework instantiates the corresponding graph generator and provides the retrieved documents. The generator can then apply its custom processing logic to the documents and return the resulting graph. To offload expen- sive preprocessing work, a generator can also ac- cess precomputed data for each document. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 5</ref> shows the data structure in which a graph is represented in the framework. Both a node and an edge have a label, containing a description string used in the visualization and a list of spans in the documents. Note that the latter is crucial for the interaction between the graph and the docu- ments through filtering and highlighting. The sys-   </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Document * 1 * 1 * 2 1 1 1 1 * 1 * 1</formula><p>Figure 5: Data structure to capture different types of text graphs in UML-style class notation.</p><p>tem supports both labeled and unlabeled as well as directed and undirected graphs. As examples, we created two graph generation modules for our framework. The first is a file- based generator that simply reads a static graph for a document collection from a file. The second integrates DKPro Core (Eckart <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">de Castilho and Gurevych, 2014</ref>) to create co-occurrence graphs of automatically recognized entities. It demon- strates how a broad range of linguistic preprocess- ing tools can be easily made available and utilized in our framework. Similarly, many other graph generation methods can be used with the frame- work. When comparing them against each other in a user study, the common web application en- sures a controlled experimental setting.</p><p>Dynamic Graphs As part of the graph gener- ation interface, implementations are also notified about the actions that a user performs in the appli- cation. All events that are documented in the in- teraction log (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref> are provided through the interface. Further, a graph generator can mod- ify its generated graph after the initial creation. In case of a change to the graph, the user is notified and can trigger an update of the visualization in the frontend. This setup makes it possible to cre- ate dynamic instead of static graphs and to use the framework to study their usefulness. While some work has been done in this direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Yang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Shahaf and Guestrin, 2010)</ref>, the development of methods that interactively adapt and personalize a graph for document exploration to a specific user has received only little attention. With our appli- cation, we provide an important evaluation frame- work that is needed to move further into this inter- esting direction of research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">User Study</head><p>To verify whether the user interface and interac- tion of the presented application is in line with user expectations, we conducted a first preliminary user study. Since the focus was on usability, all subjects worked with the same graph rather than compar- ing different graph types. 20 researchers from our lab and students from the university participated. They used the application to explore a collection of web pages on student loans (as in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) and answered a questionnaire asking for feedback on different parts of the application.</p><p>The results showed that the application was per- ceived as being very intuitive. Subjects could eas- ily interpret the meaning of the graph and how it can be used to filter and highlight the documents. With regard to the different layouts, 60% preferred the focused layout because it was "clearer" and "less cluttered", while only 15% preferred the full layout, the rest being undecided. However, sev- eral subjects noted that the full layout is still use- ful to get the big picture, advocating to offer both options in the tool. In addition, the participants provided many useful suggestions to improve the application, e.g. adding tooltips, which have been incorporated into the current version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented GraphDocExplore, a framework for graph-based document explo- ration. Its web application augments a traditional keyword-search interface with a graph extracted from the search results. The graph can be used to navigate, filter and explore a collection of doc- uments in an intuitive way. With its generic graph generator interface, different approaches to extract graphs from text can be plugged into the frame- work, providing an ideal environment to compare these approaches in controlled experimental eval- uations with users. Further, the framework sup- ports graphs that are dynamically altered based on user interactions, allowing to study methods for the interactive personalization of navigation graphs. The framework and its source code are publicly available at https://github.com/ UKPLab/emnlp2017-graphdocexplore.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2: Layouts: Full (left): The graph is displayed completely and can be zoomed, panned and moved.
