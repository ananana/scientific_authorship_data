				<p>Review spam detection is a key task in opinion mining. To accomplish this type of detection , previous work has focused mainly on effectively representing fake and non-fake reviews with discriminative features, which are discovered or elaborately designed by experts or developers. This paper proposes a novel review spam detection method that learns the representation of reviews automatically instead of heavily relying on experts&apos; knowledge in a data-driven manner. More specifically , according to 11 relations (generated automatically from two basic patterns) between reviewers and products, we employ tensor decomposition to learn the embeddings of the reviewers and products in a vector space. We collect relations between any two entities (re-viewers and products), which results in much useful and global information. We concate-nate the review text, the embeddings of the reviewer and the reviewed product as the representation of a review. Based on such representations , the classifier could identify the opinion spam more precisely. Experimental results on an open Yelp dataset show that our method could effectively enhance the spam detection accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the development of E-commerce, more and more customers share their experiences about prod- ucts and services by posting reviews on the we- b. These reviews could heavily guide the purchas- ing behaviors of customers. The products which receive more positive reviews tend to attract more consumers and result in more profits. Studies on Yelp.com have shown that an extra half-star rating could cause a restaurant to sell out 19% more prod- ucts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson and Magruder, 2012)</ref>, and a one- star increase leads to a 5-9% profit increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Luca, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, more and more sellers and manu- facturers have begun to place emphasis on analyzing reviews. However, the question remains: is every online review trustful? It has been reported that up to 25% of the reviews on Yelp.com could be fraudu- lent <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Due to the great profit or reputation, impostors or spammers energetically post fake reviews on the web to promote or defame targeted products <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jindal and Liu, 2008)</ref>. Such fake reviews could mislead consumers and damage the online review websites' reputations. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to detect fake reviews (review spam).</p><p>To accomplish this goal, much work has been conducted. They commonly regard this task as a classification task and most efforts are devoted to exploring useful features for representing target re- views. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Li et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kim et al. (2015)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rayana and Akoglu (2015)</ref> use the combination of aforementioned features. According to the exist- ing studies, reviewers' behavioral features have been proven to be more effective than reviews' linguistic features for detecting review spam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mukherjee et al., 2013c)</ref>. It is because that foxy spammers could eas- ily disguise their writing styles and forge reviews, discovering discriminative linguistic features is very difficult. Recently, most of the researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rayana and Akoglu, 2015)</ref> have focused on the reviewer- s' behavioral features, the intuition behind which is to capture the reviewers' actions and supposes that those reviews written with spammer-like behaviors would be spam.</p><p>Although, the existing work has made signifi- cant progress in combating review spamming, they also have several limitations as follows. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(1)</ref> The representations of reviews rely heavily on experts' prior knowledge or developers' ingenuity. To dis- cover more discriminative features for representing reviews, previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mukherjee et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rayana and Akoglu, 2015)</ref> have spent lots of man- power and time on the statistics of the review datasets. Besides, experts' prior knowledge or de- velopers' ingenuity is not always reliable with the variations of domains and languages. For exam- ple, based on the datasets from Dianping site 4 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Li et al. (2015)</ref> find that the real users tend to review the restaurants nearby, but the spammers are not re- stricted to the geographical location, they may come from anywhere. However, it is not true in the Yelp datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mukherjee et al., 2013b</ref>). We found that 72% of the Yelp's review spam is posted from the areas near the restaurants, but only 64% of the au- thentic reviews are near the restaurants. Therefore, how to learn the representations of reviews direct- ly from data instead of heavily relying on the ex- perts' prior knowledge or developers' ingenuity be- comes crucial and urgent. (2) Furthermore, limited by the experts' knowledge, previous work only uses partial information of the review system. For exam- ple, traditional behavioral features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mukherjee et al., 2013c</ref>) only utilize the information of individual reviewer. Although the work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rayana and Akoglu, 2015</ref>) have tried to employ graph structure to consider the interac-tions among the reviewers and products, it is a kind of local interaction defined within the same produc- t review page. However, the interaction among the reviewers and products from different review pages also provides much useful and global information, which is ignored by the previous work.</p><p>To tackle the problems described above, we pro- pose a novel review spam detection method which can learn the representations of reviews instead of heavily relying on the experts' knowledge, develop- ers' ingenuity, or spammer-like assumption, and can reserve the original information with a global man- ner. Inspired by the work about distributional repre- sentation or embedding for text and knowledge base, we propose a tensor factorization-based model to learn the representation of each review automatical- ly. The finally learnt representation of each review is determined by the original data, rather than the fea- tures or clues found by experts. More specifically, we defined two basic patterns without any expert- s' knowledge, developers' ingenuity, or spammer- like assumptions. Based on the two basic patterns, we extended 11 interactive relations between entities (reviewers and products) in terms of time, locations, social contact, etc. Then, we build a 3-mode tensor on these 11 interactive relations between reviewers and products. In order to reserve the original infor- mation with a global manner, we collect the relation- s of any two entities regardless of whether they are from the same review page. In this way, we could reserve the original information of the data as much as possible, which dispenses with human selection. Next, we utilize tensor factorization to perform ten- sor decomposition, and the representations of re- viewers and products are embedded in a latent vector space by collective learning. Afterward, we could obtain vector representations (embeddings) for both the reviewers and products. Then, we concatenate the review text (e.g., bigram), the embedding of a reviewer and the reviewed product as the represen- tation of a review. In this way, the representations of reviews driven by data could be learnt in the en- tire review system in a global manner. Finally, such representations are fed into a classifier to detect the review spam.</p><p>In summary, this paper makes the following con- tributions:</p><p>• It addresses the spam detection issue with a</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 2 3 … N α1 α2 … αn β1 β2 … βm α1 α2 … αn β1 β2 … βm k X Factorize   A T A α i β j α i Concatenate Review Representation Input Classifier β j k R Review Data Product β j Reviewer α i</formula><p>Review Text τ k</p></div>

Specifically, it learns the rep- resentation of reviews directly from the da- ta. The key advantage is that it can represent the reviews instead of heavily relying on hu- man ingenuity cost, experts' knowledge or any spammer-like assumption.</p><p>• It collects the relations between any two en- tities regardless of whether they are from the same review page, which results in much global information. With the help of tensor factoriza- tion, it could collectively embed the informa- tion of different relations into the final repre- sentations of reviews, and further optimize the representations. Therefore it could faithfully reflect the original characteristics of the entire review system with a global manner.</p><p>• An extra advantage is that the learnt represen- tations of reviews are embeddings in a latent s- pace. They are hardly comprehended by human beings included spammers. It's a robust detec- tion method in contrast to the previous meth- ods in which the reviews are represented by the explicit detecting clues and features. Once have realized the explicit features that were captured, experienced spammers could change their spamming strategies.</p><p>• The method of this paper renders 89.2% F1-score in detecting restaurant review spam which is higher than the F1-score of 86.1% rendered by the method in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mukherjee et al., 2013b</ref>) (in hotel domain, it's 87.0% vs 84.8%). These experimental results give good confi- dence to the proposed approach, and the learnt representations of reviews are more robust and effective than in previous methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Proposed Method</head><p>In this section, we propose our method (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) in detail. Compared with the previous work, we address the review spam detection issue by learning the representation of the reviews automati- cally in a latent space without experts' knowledge. First, we extend 11 interactive relations between en- tities (reviewers and products) from the two basic patterns in terms of time, locations, social contact, etc. Then, our method generates 11 relation matrices of the reviewers (α i ) and products (β j ). After that, we construct a 3-mode tensor X, where each slice X k in X denotes the link relationship between the reviewers and products in the relation k. Second, we factorize the tensor X by employing the algorithm RESCAL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nickel et al., 2011</ref>). In the factorization results, A represents the embeddings of the review- ers (α i ) and products (β j ) in the latent space with the collective learning. Third, we concatenate the review text (bigram), the embedding of its reviewer and the reviewed product together, as the representa- tion of the review. Last, the concatenated embedding of the review is fed into a classifier (e.g., SVM) to detect whether it is a fake or non-fake review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Relation Matrices Generation</head><p>In the review system, there are two kinds of entities: reviewers and products <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . Each entity has several at- tributes, e.g., the attribute 'location' of a restaurant is Chicago (the restaurant is regarded as a product). More details are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>To learn the representations of reviews directly from the data instead of experts' knowledge, we de- fined two basic patterns:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Attribute</head><p>Product Attribute set of reviewed products set of reviewers set of reviews (rating score, time) set of reviews (rating score, time) website joining date average rating friend count review count location location Pattern 1:Record the relationships between two entities.</p><p>Pattern 2:Record the relationships between at- tributes of two entities.</p><p>These patterns do not contain any spammer-like prior assumption, just record the natural relation in the original review system. Based on the t- wo basic patterns, we extended 11 interactive rela- tions between entities and their attributes (showed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). They will be described in detail as follows. Meanwhile, we define that avg(a k,i ) = 1 n n k=1 a k,i . 1. Have reviewed: This relation records whether a reviewer has reviewed a product. If reviewer</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">α i reviewed product β j , the value X[i, j, 1] in this relation matrix X[:, :, 1] is 1, otherwise it's 0.</formula><p>2. Rating score: What score (1 to 5 star) a reviewer-rated product receives. The value X[i, j, 2] ∈ {1, 2, ..., 5}.</p><p>3. Commonly reviewed products: The number of products that a reviewer commonly reviewed with other reviewers. The value X[i, j, 3] = |P ij | , P ij = P i ∩ P j ; P i is the product set re- viewed by reviewer α i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Commonly reviewed time difference:</head><p>The time differences that a reviewer who commonly reviews with other reviewers on the same prod- ucts. The value X[i, j, 4] = t i − t j , where t i = avg(t k,i ); t k,i is the time that the reviewer α i reviewed the product β k in the P ij set.</p><p>5. Commonly reviewed rating difference: The rating differences that a reviewer who com- monly reviews with other reviewers on the same products. The value X[i, j, 5] = r i − r j , where r i = avg(r k,i ); r k,i is the score of the reviewer α i rated the product β k in P ij set.</p><p>6. Date difference of websites joined: The date differences of joining review websites between a reviewer and others. The value X[i, j, 6] = d i − d j , where d i is the date on which reviewer α i joining websites.</p><p>7. Average rating difference: The differences in the average rating of a reviewer over all his re- views compared with other reviewers. The val- ue X[i, j, 7] = γ r i −γ r j , where γ r i = avg(γ r k,i ); γ r k,i is the score with which the reviewer α i rat- ed the product β k in P i .</p><p>The differences in the average rating of a product over all its reviews compared with oth- er products.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X[i, j, 7] = γ p i − γ p j , where γ p i = avg(γ p k,i ); γ p k,i</formula><p>is the score of review k in R β i , which is the review set for product β i .</p><p>8. , where R β i is the reviews set of product β i .</p><p>According to the relations that we present above, we build 11 relation matrices among the reviewers and products. To unify the values of different ma- trices to a reference system, we normalize with the sigmoid function. Thus, the value '0' will be nor- malized to '0.5'. Moreover, we set the values that make no sense to '0', such as the value between t- wo products in Relation 1: Have reviewed. Then, we unite the 11 matrices to form the adjacent ten- sor. Each of the matrices is a slice of the tensor.</p><note type="other">The reviewers and products are regarded as the same en- tities in the tensor. We build two separate tensors for the hotel domain and restaurant domain respective- ly. Next, we perform tensor factorization to learn the representations (embeddings) of reviewers and prod- ucts. Note that the word "relation" is normally used for binary (0/1) relations, but some values of afore- mentioned relations could be between 0 and 1. How- ever, our experiments show that this type of rela- tion is actually practicable. Besides, there is not any spammer-like assumption in the relations. Namely, the values of relations don't indicate how suspicious the reviewers are. The values faithfully reflect the original characteristics of the entire review system.</note><p>This can help to reduce the need of carefully design- ing expert features and the understanding of domain- s as much as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Learning to Represent Reviews</head><p>In general case, a review contains the text, the re- viewer and the reviewed product. We firstly learn to represent reviewers and products. As mentioned above, based on the relations, we could construct an adjacency tensor X. Then, we convert the global re- lation information related reviewers and products in- to embeddings through tensor factorization, where an efficient factorization algorithm called RESCAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nickel et al., 2011</ref>) is employed. First, we intro- duce it briefly.</p><p>To identify latent components in a tensor for collective learning, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nickel et al. (2011)</ref> proposed RESCAL, which is a tensor factorization algorithm. Given a tensor X n ×n ×m , RESCAL aims to have a rank-r approximation, where each slice X k is fac- torized as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X k ≈ AR k A T , for all k = 1...m ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>A is an n × r matrix, where the i-th row denotes the i-th entity. R k is an asymmetric r × r matrix that describes the interactions of the latent components according to the k-th relation. Note that while R k differs in each slice, A remains the same.</p><p>A and R k are derived by minimizing the loss func- tion below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min A,R k f (A, R k ) + λ · g(A, R k ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where f (A,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R k ) = 1 2 ( k X k − AR k A T 2 F</formula><p>) is the mean-squared reconstruction error, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">g(A, R k ) = 1 2 ( A 2 F + k R k 2 F ) is the regularization term.</formula><p>In our method, slice X k is the k-th relation above. The i-th entity is the i-th reviewer or product.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 2.1, in order to obtain more useful and global information automatically, we collect the relations of any two entities no mat- ter whether they are from the same review page. Then we could embed the informations over multi- relations into the finally learnt representation by the tensor factorization. As Nickel et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2011)</ref> proved, all the relations have a determining influence on the learnt latent-component representation of the i-th entity. It removes the noise of the original data by learning through the global loss function. Conse- quently, we get the representation of reviewers and products with a further optimization by the collec- tive learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Detecting Review Spam in Latent Space</head><p>After learning the representations of reviewers and products, we begin to represent the reviews that were written by reviewers for the products. Our final pur- pose is to detect the review spam. We concatenate the review text (bigram), the embedding of a review- er and the reviewed product as the representation of a review. The representations of the review text by bigram have been proved to be effective in sever- al previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mukherjee et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rayana and Akoglu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kim et al., 2015</ref>). It's also a kind of data-driven representation. Then, we take the em- beddings of the reviews as the input to the classifiers. Here, we use the linear kernel SVM model to com- pare with the experimental results in (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) and (Rayana and Akoglu, 2015).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Datasets and Evaluation Metrics</head><p>Datasets: To evaluate the proposed method, we con- ducted experiments on Yelp dataset that was used in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mukherjee et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mukherjee et al., 2013c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rayana and Akoglu, 2015)</ref>. Al- though there are other datasets for evaluation, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jindal and Liu, 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Xie et al., 2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ott et al., 2011</ref>), they are generated by human labeling or crowd sourcing and have been proved not to be reliable since human labeling fake reviews is quite poor <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Ott et al., 2011)</ref>. There was lack of real-life and nearly ground truth data, until <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mukherjee et al. (2013c)</ref> proposed the Yelp review dataset. The statistics of the Yelp dataset are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The reviewed product here refers to a hotel or restaurant. Evaluation Metrics: We select precision (P), recall (R), F1-Score (F1) and accuracy (A) as metrics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Our Method vs. The State-of-the-art Methods</head><p>To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ap- proach, we select several state-of-the-arts for com- parison. The first one is SPEAGLE + (Rayana and Akoglu, 2015), which is a kind of graph-based method.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We u- tilize our learnt embeddings of reviewers (Ours RE), both of reviewers' embeddings and products' em- beddings (Ours RE+PE), respectively. Moreover, to perform fair comparison, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mukherjee et al. (2013b)</ref>, we add representations of the review text in classifier <ref type="bibr">(Ours RE+PE+Bigram)</ref>. From the result- s, we can observe that our method could outperform all state-of-the-arts in both the hotel and restaurant domains. It proves that our method is effective. Fur- thermore, the improvements in both the hotel and restaurant domains prove that our model possesses preferable domain-adaptability. It could represent the reviews more accurately and globally by learn- ing from the original data, rather than the experts' knowledge or assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Effectiveness of Learning to Represent Review</head><p>To further prove the representations learnt by our method are effective for detecting review spam, we compare the learnt representation (embeddings) of reviewers (Ours RE) <ref type="table">(Table 3</ref> (a,b) rows 7, 8) with existing behavioral features of reviewers (Mukher- jee BF) (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) <ref type="table">(Table 3</ref> (a,b) rows 3, 4). In results, using the learnt reviewer- s' representations in our method, results in around 2.0% (in 50:50) and 4.0% (in N.D.) improvement in F1 and A in the hotel domain, and results in around 2.1% (in 50:50) and 7.0%(in N.D.) improvement in F1 and A in the restaurant domain. These results show that our data-driven representations of review- ers are more helpful for review spam detection than existing reviewers' behavioral features, and that new method embeds more useful and accurate informa- tion from the original data. It isn't limited to expert- s' knowledge. Moreover, the latent representations are more robust because they are hardly perceived by spammers. Having realized the explicit existing behavioral features, crafty spammers tend to change their spamming strategies. Consider the feature "Re- view Length", which is used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mukherjee et al., 2013b)</ref>, as an example. They find that the average review length of the spammers is quite short com- pared with non-spammers. However, once a crafty spammer realizes that he left this type of footprint, he could produce a review that is as long as the non- (a) Hotel P R F1 A 80.5 83.2 81.8 82.5 1 50.1 70.5 58.6 82.0 2 82.8 88.5 85.6 83.3 3 48.2 87.9 62.3 78.6 4 84.5 87.8 86.1 86.5 5 48.9 87.3 62.7 82.3 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Classification results across the behavioral features (BF), the reviewer embeddings (RE) , product embeddings (PE) and bigram of the review texts.

According to the results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, the 11 generated relations (Rels) results in an obvious im- provement than the existing behavioral features (BF) (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) <ref type="table">(Table 3</ref> (a,b) row 3) in both the hotel and restaurant domains. It proves that the generated relations could obtain more useful and global informations, as they collect the relations of any entities (reviewers and products) regardless of whether they are from the same review page. Fur- thermore, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> also showed that the embeddings  of reviewers (RE) learnt by the tensor decomposi- tion perform better than the Rels. As we mentioned in Section 2.2, the tensor decomposition embeds the informations over all the relations collectively, and removes the noise of the original data by learning through the global loss function. Consequently, we get the representations with a further optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">The Effectiveness of Product Embeddings</head><p>In general case, a review contains the review tex- t, the reviewer and the reviewed product. But most of the previous work represent the reviews with the reviewers' behavioral features and the reviews' lin- guistic features. The products are seldom represent- ed. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> (a,b) rows 9,10 , the rep- resentations which added the products embeddings perform better than just using the reviewer embed- dings. Statistics of the datasets suggest that there are about 1% of spammers who not only write fake reviews, but also write non-fake reviews. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu (2015)</ref> also proved that some reviewers have contributed many genuine reviews and have built up their reputa- tion; then they started to spam for some businesses, or even sell their accounts to spammers. Compared with previous work, our method by adding produc- t embeddings could distinguish the reviews of the same reviewer for different products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">The Effects of Different Relations</head><p>We also drop relations of our method with a grace- ful degradation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows the performances of our method utilizing BF+PE+Bigram for hotel and restaurant domains. We found that dropping Rela- tions 1, 2 and 10 results in a relatively gentle re- duction (about 2.2%) in F1-score. According to our survey, the sparseness of the slices generated by Re- lation 1, 2 and 10 is about 99.9%. For this reason, the result is a relatively gentle reduction. Dropping other relations also result in a 2.5-4.0% performance reduction. It proves that each relation has an influ- ence on the learning to represent reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>Jindal and Liu (2008) first propose the problem of review spam detection.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>This paper proposes a new review spam detection method that learns the representations of reviews in- stead of heavily relying on experts' knowledge in a data-driven manner. A 3-mode tensor is built on the relations which are generated from two patterns, and a tensor factorization algorithm is used to auto- matically learn the vector representations of review- ers and products. Afterwards, we concatenate the review text, the embedding of a reviewer and the reviewed product as the representation of a review. Then, a classifier is applied to detect the review s- pam. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, which learns more robust re- view representations. In future work, we plan to ex- plore a more effective way to learn the embeddings of review text.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>rep- resent reviews with linguistic features; Lim et al.
