			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we propose a Connective-driven Dependency Tree (CDT) scheme to represent the discourse rhetorical structure in Chinese language, with elementary discourse units as leaf nodes and connectives as non-leaf nodes, largely motivated by the Penn Discourse Treebank and the Rhetorical Structure Theory. In particular, connectives are employed to directly represent the hierarchy of the tree structure and the rhetorical relation of a discourse, while the nu-clei of discourse units are globally determined with reference to the dependency theory. Guided by the CDT scheme, we manually annotate a Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) of 500 documents. Preliminary evaluation justifies the appropriateness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse analysis and the usefulness of our manually annotated CDTB corpus.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>It is well-known that interpretation of a text re- quires understanding of its rhetorical relation hierarchy since discourse units rarely exist in isolation. Such discourse structure is fundamen- tal to many text-based applications, such as summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Marcu, 2000</ref>) and question- answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Verberne et al., 2007)</ref>. Due to the wide and potential use of discourse structure, constructing discourse resources has been at- tracting more and more attention in recent years. In comparison with English, there are much fewer discourse resources for Chinese which largely restricts the researches in Chinese dis- course analysis.</p><p>The general notion of discourse structure mainly consists of discourse unit, connective, structure, relation and nuclearity. However, pre- vious studies on discourse failed to fully express these kinds of information. For example, the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref> represents a discourse as a tree with phrases or clauses as elementary dis- course units (EDUs). However, RST ignores the importance of connectives to a great extent. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref> gives an example tree structure with four EDUs (e1-e4). In comparison, Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Prasad et al., 2008</ref>) adopts the predicate-argument view of discourse rela- tion, with discourse connective as predicate and two text spans as its arguments. <ref type="bibr">Example (1)</ref> shows an explicit reason relation signaled by the discourse connective "particularly if" and an implicit result relation represented by the insert- ed discourse connective "so", with Arg1 in ital- ics and Arg2 in bold. However, as a connective and its arguments are determined in a local con- textual window, it is normally difficult to deduce a complete discourse structure from such a con- nective-argument scheme. In this sense, the PDTB at best only provides a partial solution to the discourse structure.</p><p>[Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services,] e1 <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[</ref>Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services will be difficult ] Arg1, they argue, will be difficult, particularly if [market conditions turn sour ] <ref type="bibr">Arg2</ref> .

Result) (0989)</p><p>Obviously, both RST and PDTB have their own advantages and disadvantages in represent- ing different characteristics of the discourse structure. In this paper, we attempt to propose a new scheme to Chinese discourse structure, adopt advantages of the tree structure from RST and connective from PDTB. Meanwhile, the special characteristics of Chinese discourse structure are well addressed.</p><p>First, it is difficult to define EDU in Chinese due to the frequent occurrence of the ellipsis of subjects, objects and predicates, and the lack of functional marks for EDU. Second, the connec- tives in Chinese omit much more frequently than those in English with about 82.0% vs. 54.5% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhou and Xue (2012)</ref>. In Example (2), there are even no explicit connectives. Third, previous studies have shown the difference in classifying Chinese discourse relations from English <ref type="bibr">(Xing, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang and Liao, 2011)</ref>. This suggests that the discourse relations defined for English (both RST and PDTB) are not readily suitable for Chinese. Finally, the nucleus of a Chinese dis- course relation is normally not directly related to a particular relation type but should be dynami- cally determined from the global meaning of a discourse.</p><p>Example <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> In this paper, we present a Connective-driven Dependency Tree (CDT) discourse representa- tion scheme, which takes advantage of both RST and PDTB, with elementary discourse units (limited to clauses) as leaf nodes and connec- tives as non-leaf nodes. Especially, we define EDU from three aspects, and employ the con- nective' level and semantic to indicate the rhe- torical structure and the discourse relation. Be- sides, the nuclearity of discourse units in a dis- course relation is decided on the overall dis- course meaning. On the basis, we adopt the CDT scheme to annotate a certain scale corpus, called Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) thereafter in this paper. Evaluation shows the appropriate- ness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse analysis.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews related work. In Section 3, we present the CDT discourse representation scheme. In Section 4, we describe the annotation of the CDTB corpus. Section 5 compares CDTB with other major discourse corpora. Section 6 gives the experimental results on EDU recogni- tion, the crucial step for discourse parsing. Final- ly, conclusion is given in section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In the past decade, several discourse corpora for English have emerged, with the Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Carlson et al., 2003</ref>) and the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Prasad et al., 2008</ref>) most prevalent.</p><p>In the RST framework, a text is represented as a discourse tree, with non-overlapping text spans (either phrases or clauses) as leaves, and adja- cent nodes are related through particular rhetori- cal relations to form a discourse sub-tree, which is then related to other adjacent nodes in the tree structure. According to RST, there are two types of discourse relations, mononuclear and multi- nuclear. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of discourse tree representation, following the notational convention of RST. Among the four EDUs (e1- e4), e1 and e2 are connected by a mononuclear relation "attribution", where e1 is the nucleus, the span (e1-e2) and the EDU e3 are further connected by a multi-nuclear relation "same- unit", where they are equally salient. Annotated according to the RST framework, the RST-DT consists of 385 documents from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Besides, the original 24 dis- course relations defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mann and Thompson (1988)</ref> are further divided into a set of 18 rela- tion classes with 78 finer grained rhetorical rela- tions in RST-DT.</p><p>As the largest discourse corpus so far, the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) contains over one million words from WSJ. With EDUs lim- ited to clauses, the PDTB adopts the predicate-argument view of discourse relations, with con- nective as predicate and two text spans as its arguments. Example (1) shows two annotation tokens for the connective "particularly if" and "so". The current version of PDTB 2.0 annotates 40600 tokens, including 18459 explicit relations of 100 distinct types (e.g. "particularly if" and "if" are the same type) and 16224 implicit dis- course relations of 102 distinct token types. Be- sides, PDTB provides a three level hierarchy of relation tags with the first level consisting of four major relation classes (Temporal, Contin- gency, Comparison, and Expansion), which are further divided into 16 types and 23 subtypes.</p><p>In comparison, there are few researches on Chinese discourse annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Xue, 2005a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yue, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Huang and Chen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhou and Xue, 2012)</ref>, with no exception employing existing RST or PDTB frameworks. For exam- ple, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhou and Xue (2012)</ref> use the PDTB annota- tion guidelines to annotate Chinese discourse with 98 files from Chinese Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xue et al., 2005b</ref>) of Xinhua newswire. In particular, they adopt a lexically grounded approach and make some adaptation based on the linguistic and sta- tistical characteristics of Chinese text, with Arg1 and Arg2 defined semantically and the senses of discourse relations annotated besides connec- tives and their lexical alternatives. The agree- ment on relation types reaches 95.1% and the agreement on implicit relations with exact span match reaches 76.9%.</p><p>Instead, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yue (2008)</ref> use RST to annotate Chinese discourse. Chen (2006) se- lects comma as the segmentation signal of EDUs (in Example (2), "据悉(According to reports)" will be segmented as an EDU), and finds that RST fails to deal with some special features of Chinese. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yue (2008)</ref> manually annotates a set of 97 texts according to RST and shows the cross- lingual transferability of RST to Chinese. How- ever, it also shows that EDUs in Chinese are much different from those in English, and many relation types in Chinese have no correspond- ence to English, and vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Connective-driven Dependency Tree</head><p>An appropriate representation scheme is funda- mental to linguistic resource construction. With reference to various theories and representation scheme on the tree structure and nuclearity of RST, the connective, relation and discourse structure of Chinese complex sentence <ref type="bibr">(Xing, 2001)</ref>, the sentence-group theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Cao, 1984)</ref>, the connective treatment of PDTB, the conjunc- tion dependent analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Feng and Ji, 2011</ref>) and the center theory of dependency grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hays, 1964)</ref>, we propose a new discourse representa- tion scheme for Chinese, called Connective- driven Dependency Tree (CDT), with EDUs as leaf nodes and connectives as non-leaf nodes, to accommodate the special characteristics of the Chinese language in discourse structure.</p><p>For instance, Example (3) consists of 2 sen- tences, which is part of a paragraph from "chtb_0001", and its corresponding CDT repre- sentation is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Here, the number of "|" in Example (3) stands for the level of EDUs in CDT and the numbers marked in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 2</ref> (such as 1, 2 etc.) distinguish EDUs. While an arrow points to the main EDU or main dis- course unit (called nucleus), the combination of different EDUs can be considered as EDUs in a higher level and the new discourse units can thus be combined into higher-level units from bottom to up. In this way, the discourse structure can be expressed as a tree structure via bottom-up com- bination of EDUs.</p><p>Obviously, such discourse structure is con- structed by two kinds of basic units, EDUs (leaf nodes) and connectives (non-leaf nodes). On the one hand, connectives can represent the dis- course structure by its hierarchical level in the tree. The discourse structure is independent on the connective level essentially, rather than the reverse. On the other hand, connectives them- selves can represent the discourse relation. This is why we call the scheme "Connective-driven". As for the abstract discourse relation, we can construct a set of discourse relations, mapping a connective to discourse relation, according to the users' specific requirements.</p><p>Example <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> actively, timely DI formulate and issuing 法规性 文件，||| 7 {使} 这些 经济 活动 一 出现就 被 statutory file, make these economic activity as soon as appear bei 纳入 法制 轨道。 bring into legality track.</p><p>"1 Pudong's development and opening up is a century- spanning undertaking for vigorously promoting Shanghai and constructing a modern economic, trade, and financial center. || 2 Because of this, new situations and new questions that have not been encountered before are emerging in great numbers. | 3 In response to this, Pudong is not simply adopting an approach of "work for a short time and then draw up laws and regula- tions only after experience has been accumulated."|| 4 Instead, Pudong is taking advantage of the lessons from experience of developed countries and special regions such as Shenzhen, ||||5 by hiring appropriate domestic and foreign specialists and scholars, ||||6 actively and promptly formulating and issuing regulatory documents. ||| 7 So these economic activities are incorporated into the sphere of influence of the legal system as soon as they appear." </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Elementary Discourse Unit</head><p>As the leaf nodes of CDT, EDUs are limited to clauses. In principle, EDUs play a crucial role to discourse analysis. Since from bottom-up dis- course combination, EDUs are the start of dis- course analysis, while from top-down discourse segmentation, they are the end of discourse analysis. Unfortunately, since there lacks obvi- ous distinction between Chinese sentence struc- ture and phrase structure, it is rather difficult to define Chinese EDU (clause). Till now, there is still no widely accepted definition in the Chinese linguistics community ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wang, 2010)</ref>. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li et al. (2013a)</ref>, we give the definition of Chinese EDU from three perspectives. First, from the syntactic structure perspective, an EDU should contain at least one predicate and express at least one proposition. Second, from the func- tional perspective, an EDU should be related to other EDUs with some propositional function, i.e. not act as a grammatical element of other EDUs. Finally, from the morphological perspec- tive, an EDU should be segmented by some punctuation, e.g. comma, semicolon and period. We use punctuation because there usually has a pause between clauses (EDUs), which can be shown in written commas, semicolons etc (Huang and Liao, 2011). Normally, it is easy to handle complex sentences and special sentence patterns (e.g. serial predicate sentences). For Example (4), A) is a single sentence with serial predicate; B) is complex sentence with two EDUs (clauses):</p><p>Example <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> Take as example, there exist 7 EDUs in Ex- ample (3), each marked with a number in front. According to our definition, the fragment "干一 段 时 间 ， … 法 规 条 例 "("work for a short time…has been accumulated" ) in EDU 3 is not segmented as a EDU since: 1) it acts as a gram- matical element of other EDUs and has no direct relationship with other EDUs on propositional function; 2) it is marked by a pair of quotation marks and does not end with any punctuation. In contrast, the fragment "而是借鉴发达…法制轨 道 "("but learn developed…legality track.") is segment as 4 EDUs since it meets the three crite- ria in our EDU definition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Connective</head><p>As non-leaf nodes in the CDT representation, connectives connect EDUs or discourse units. Thus, the main criterion of determining whether an expression is a connective is to check wheth- er the two fragments it connects are EDUs (or discourse units). In our scheme, the list of ex- plicit discourse connectives is judged by a data driven approach, i.e. with any discourse-like word or phrase marked as connective in the an- notation practice, e.g. "因此(therefore)", "对此 (to this)", "不是...而是...(is not...but....)", "使(so that), "正因为(just because)" in Example (3), "先...然后(first...then) ", "同时也(and at the same time)" in Example (5).</p><p>Example (5): Connective examples from CTB A) 1&lt;如果；只要&gt;建筑公司进区，| 2 有关部门先送 上这些法规性文件，|| 3 然后有专门队伍进行监督检 查。(chtb_0001) 1&lt;If ; As long as&gt;The construction company enters the region, |2 first the appropriate bureau delivers these regu- latory documents,|| 3 Then there is a specialized contin- gent that carries out a supervisory inspection. B) 1 加工贸易…, 2 同时 也 是粤港澳台经贸合作的 重要内容。(chtb_0031) 1 The processing trade …, | 2 and at the same time is important content in the economic and trade coop- eration between Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.</p><p>It is worthy of mention that from the part-of- speech perspective, connectives are not necessarily conjunctions. For example, in Example (3) and (5), adverbs "先...然后(first… then)", verb phrases "不是…而是(is not…but)", and preposition phrases " 对此(to this)" are determined as connectives. From the morphological perspective, a connective may contain more than one word, even discontinuous. As a common occurring phenomenon in Chinese discourse, there exist many paired Chinese connectives, e.g. "不是…而是 (is not…but)" in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Even in some paired connectives, such as " 因为… 所以(because…so)", a word in a paired connective can appear independently as a connective. Please note that this may not be applied to other cases, e.g. " 不是… 而是 (is not…but)" as appeared in Example (3). Moreo- ver, in many cases whether an expression is a connective or not depends on its meaning, e.g., "为 (in order to)" is a connective, while "为 (for)" is not. For the positional distribution, a connective may appear anywhere, i.e. in the be- ginning, middle, or the end of the first or second EDU. Example (3) and (5) show some of cases in different positions. The above characteristics pose special challenges on connective determi- nation in Chinese language.</p><p>According to the appearance of a connective or not, a discourse relation can be either explicit or implicit. Previous studies have shown the dif- ficulty of implicit relation recognition in English due to the omission of connectives ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pitler et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lin et al., 2009)</ref>. This becomes even worse in Chinese since compared with the im- plicit ratio of 54.5% in English connectives, this ratio rises up to about 82% in Chinese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhou and Xue, 2012)</ref>. It is worth noting that the majority of discourse relations in Chinese are implicit, so the insertion of a connective in an implicit posi- tion can significantly ease the understanding of the discourse. That is, a connective driven repre- sentation scheme is still applicable to a discourse with implicit connectives. To help determine implicit relations, two special strategies are pro- posed.</p><p>First, for each explicit connective, a decision is made whether or not it can be deleted without changing the rhetorical relation of a discourse. It should be emphasized that this constraint is largely semantic. The motivation behind the re- moval of explicit connectives is to enlarge im- plicit instances and help recognize implicit rela- tions. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we use the paired mark "()" to indicate that a connective can be deleted, e.g. connectives "(对此 to this)", "(因此 therefore)", "( 正因此 just because)", and the paired mark "{}" to indicate that a connective cannot be deleted, e.g. connectives "{ 使 so that}", "{不是…而是 is not…but}".</p><p>Second, since a connective can be inserted to represent an implicit relation, our scheme tries to insert a connective which can be easily inter- preted from the semantic perspective with little ambiguity into the most appropriate place. Most of the connective insertions for implicit relations occur between adjacent discourse spans. It is worth noting that not all implicit connectives are subjective to the language sense. To mark this difference, we cluster implicit connectives into two categories according to their language sens- es, either "good language intuition" or "bad lan- guage intuition". In our scheme, we use the paired mark "&lt;&gt;"to indicate inserted implicit connectives, e.g. connectives"&lt;例如 e.g.&gt;", "&lt; 却 but&gt;" with "good language sense", connec- tive "&lt;并且 and&gt;" with "bad language sense", as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>In some cases, it is possible that there exist several insertion options for an implicit connec- tive due to the ambiguity in a discourse. For ex- ample, in Example (5A), connectives "如果 (if)" and "只要 (as long as)" are inserted into the first level to show the two discourse relation options. As far as this happens, connectives are inserted and ordered according to annotators' first intui- tion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discourse Structure</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the paragraph is organized as a tree structure, in which EDUs appear in the leaf nodes and the connectives appear in the non-leaf ones. The adoption of tree structure conforms to traditional Chinese discourse theories and prac- tice. For example, a native Chinese speaker tends to determine the overall level boundary first and then the analysis goes on step by step to the individual clauses, when understanding a complex sentence. This process naturally forms a tree structure. Besides, tree structure is easier to formalize, compared with graph.</p><p>More specifically, the hierarchical structure of connectives indicates the hierarchical structure of discourse units. Apparently, discourse struc-ture analysis can be viewed as hierarchical anal- ysis of connectives, with hierarchical connective structure reflecting hierarchical combination of discourse units. Essentially, the discourse hierar- chy indicates the correlation degrees of semantic relations in the discourse, the deeper tree level of two discourse units, the higher correlation de- gree of their semantic relation. Therefore, a dis- course relation is the ultimate factor for the choice of hierarchical discourse structure. For a reference, please take Sentence 2 in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> as an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Discourse Relation</head><p>For discourse relation representation, a general approach is to assign an abstract relation type to a discourse relation directly, such as cause, con- junction, condition, purpose, etc, as done in RST-DT and PDTB. In our CDT scheme, we avoid to directly assign an abstract relation type to a discourse relation. Instead, we use the con- nective itself to express the discourse relation, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In this way, the difficulty of pre-defining a set of acknowledged discourse relations and selecting an exact discourse rela- tion can be avoided during the corpus annotation process. Since a Chinese discourse relation is largely controlled by connective <ref type="bibr">(Xing, 2001)</ref>, the key to determine a relation is to identify a suitable connective. Normally, most of relation annotations can easily map from connectives to abstract semantic classes of relations, if neces- sary, with the help of the discourse context. The majority of discourse relations in Chinese are implicit, but it makes sense to insist on a con- nective driven representation. With connective as a bridge, at least it makes discourse represen- tation easier.</p><p>For the abstraction of discourse relations, we leave it in a later separate stage. Of course, there are cases where a connective may represent more than one discourse relation. For example, connective "而" can denotes the continuous rela- tion "而 (especially)" and the transitional rela- tion "而 (however)". Compared with annotating discourse relation directly, annotator's intuition is more accurate for specific connective. We don't object to label discourse relation, referring to the general work and Chinese analysis prac- tice, give a set of relations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref>, regarding it as connective's semantics, and then annotate the connective with it. In this way, we can obtain a general relation set and resolve the connec- tive's polysemy problem. We believe that the connective itself is the foundation of discourse relation, and the relation set can be adjusted dy- namically according to the application require- ments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows a three-level set of discourse relations example. In the first level, this set con- tains four relations of causality, coordination, transition and explanation, which are further clustered into 17 sub-relations in the second lev- el. For example, relation causality contains 6 sub-relations, i.e. cause-result, inference, hypo- thetical, purpose, condition and background. In the third level, the connectives are under each sub-relation. For example, cause-result relation can be represented by "because", 'therefore' etc. The numbers shown in the parentheses illustrate the distributions of different relations in our cor- pus. For example, there are 1335 causality rela- tions in the first level, including 686 cause-result relations, 38 inference relations, 70 hypothetical relations, 335 purpose relations, 72 condition relations and 134 background relations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Nucleus and Satellite</head><p>Once discourse units are determined, adjacent spans are linked together via connectives to build a hierarchical structure. As stated above, discourse relations may be either mononuclear or multi-nuclear. A mononuclear relation holds between a nucleus and a satellite unit. Normally, the nucleus usually reflects the intention focus of the discourse and is thus more salient in the dis- course structure, while the satellite usually rep- resents supportive information for the nucleus.</p><p>In comparison, a multi-nuclear relation usually holds two or more discourse units of equal weight in the discourse structure. For nucleus determination, we adopt the de- pendency grammar, and select the unit which can stand for the relationship with other dis- course units in a discourse. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>, on the first level, discourse relation "对此 (to this)" has the latter unit " 浦东… 法制轨道 (Pudong…as soon as they appear.)" as nucleus and the former unit "浦东…新问题 (Pudong …new problem)" as satellite, since the latter unit agrees with the main purpose of the discourse, which emphasizes some methods for the progress of Pudong. Moreover, since the combination of 4, 5 and 6 has the cause relation with 7, we choose 7 as nucleus because it can stand for the combina- tion of 4, 5, 6 and 7, and has the selection rela- tionship with 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Chinese Discourse Treebank</head><p>Given above the CDT scheme, we choose 500 Xinhua newswire documents from the Chinese Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xue et al., 2005b</ref>) in our Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) annotation. In par- ticular, we annotate one discourse tree for each paragraph.</p><p>In this section, we address the key issues with the CDTB annotation, such as annotator training, tagging strategies, corpus quality, along with the statistics of the CDTB corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Annotator Training</head><p>The annotator team consists of a Ph.D. in Chi- nese linguistics as the supervisor (senior annota- tor) and four undergraduate students in Chinese linguistics as annotators (two pairs). The annota- tion is done in four phases. In the first phase, the annotators spend 3 months on learning the prin- ciples of CDT and the use of our developed dis- course annotation tool. In the second phase, the annotators spend 2 months on independently annotating the same 50 documents (about 260 paraphrases), and another 2 months on cross- checking to resolve the difference and to revise the guidelines. In the third phase, the annotators spend 9 months on annotating the remaining 450 documents. In the final phase, the supervisor spends 3 months carefully proofread all 500 documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Tagging Strategies</head><p>In the CDTB annotation, we employ a top-down strategy. That is, we determine the overall level first and then the analysis goes on step by step to the individual EDUs. This strategy is adopted in our annotation tool. The advantages of the top- down strategy are three folds. First, such a strat- egy can easily grasp the whole discourse struc- ture. This conforms to the global nature of dis- course analysis. Second, due to the lack of clear difference between Chinese sentence and phrase structure, such a strategy can largely avoid the error propagation in Chinese EDU segmentation. Since in such a top-down strategy, EDU seg- mentation becomes an end question, and even if an EDU segmentation error happens, its impact is localized, i.e. with little impact on the whole discourse structure. Our annotation practice shows that such strategy is effective. Third, such a strategy accords with the cognitive of Chinese characteristics, and conforms to the mental pro- cess of Chinese discourse understanding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang and Liao, 2011</ref>). However, we do not exclude the bottom-up strategy. In some cases, on the cognitive psychological process, annotator is combine top-down and bottom-up strategies.</p><p>Take Example <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> as an example, an annotator first finds the first level, with the period at the end of sentence 1, and chooses discourse rela- tion (either explicit or implicit), connective, and connective related information (e.g. whether can be added, deleted, and the language sense, etc.), nuclearity etc. Then, the annotator turns to sen- tence 1 and marks the second comma as level 2 with necessary information annotated, and goes on to sentence 2, recursively, until all EDUs are marked. In this way, a discourse tree with the CDT representation is constructed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Quality Assurance</head><p>A number of steps are taken to ensure the quality of CDTB. These involve two tasks: checking the validity of the trees and tracking inter-annotator consistency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Tree validation</head><p>We first manually check if a tree has a single root node and compare the tree with the docu- ment to check for missing sentence or fragments from the end of text. Then we check the attached information such as connectives, relations and nuclearity in the tree. We also check the tree with a tree traversal program to find the errors undetected by the manual validation process. Finally, all of the trees work successfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Consistency</head><p>To ensure the quality of CDTB, we adopt the inter-annotator consistency using Agreement and kappa on 60 documents (chtb0041-chtb 0100). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> illustrates the inter-annotator consistency in details.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we measure the agree- ment of EDU segmentation by determining whether punctuation (all period, comma etc. are considered) is treated as an EDU boundary. It shows that the agreement reaches 91.7% with Cohen's kappa value (Cohen, 1960) 0.91. This justifies the appropriateness of our EDU defini- tion. Explicit or Implicit agreement 94.7% is calculate by the same EDU boundary (intersec- tion) of two annotators. For the same explicit relation, the connective identification agreement is 82.3%, because this is strict measure when two annotators choose the same connective word. If we relax the measure to contain the same word, the agreement can reach 98%. For exam- ple, one annotate "也…并(also…and)", and the other annotate "并(and)" is wrong with our strict measure. It is not surprising that the agreement on im- plicit connective insertion with the same posi- tion and the same connective only reaches 74.6% since for some discourse relations, there may existing several connective alternatives. For example, both "so" and "therefore" can express the same causation relation. If we relax the con- straint to the compatible connective, the agree- ment on implicit connective insertion can reach up to 84.5%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Agreement</head><p>Finally, it shows that the agreement on overall discourse structure (with the same connectives as non-leaf nodes, the same EDUs as leaf nodes) reaches 77.4%. This justifies the appropriateness of our CDT scheme, given the inherent ambigui- ty in Chinese discourse structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Corpus Statistics</head><p>Currently, the CDTB corpus consists of 500 newswire articles from Chinese Treebank, which are further divided into 2342 paragraphs with a CDT representation for one paragraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> For EDUs, CDTB contains 10650 EDUs with</head><p>an average of 4.5 EDUs per tree. On average, there are 2 EDUs per sentence and 22 Chi- nese characters per EDU.  For discourse relations, CDTB contains 7310 relations, of which 1812 are explicit relations (24.8%) and 5498 are implicit relations (75.2%). This indicates that implicit relations occur much more frequently in Chinese than in English, e.g. 75.2% in CDTB (Chinese) vs. ~50% in PDTB (English).  With the deepest level of 9, most (98.5%) of discourse relations occur in level 1 (2342), level 2(2372), level 3(1532), level 4(712), and level 5(242). It also shows that 3557 (48.7%) relations are mononuclear relations with 2110 nucleus ahead, while the remain- ing 3754 relations are multi-nuclear. The numbers shown in the parentheses of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref> illustrate the distributions of different rela- tions. In comparison with the top 2 most fre- quently occurring relations in PDTB (Eng- lish), i.e. the coordination and explanation re- lations, there exist 3503 (47.9%) and 911 in- stances respectively, with regard to the ab- stract relation set as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>.  CDTB contains 282 connectives, among which 274 (140 can be deleted) appears as explicit connectives and 44 can be inserted in place of implicit connectives. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> lists the top 10 frequent explicit connectives and implicit connectives.    </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Preliminary Experimentation</head><p>In order to evaluate the computability of CDTB, we give the experimental results on EDU recog- nition, which is crucial in discourse parsing. Af- ter excluding sentence end punctuations (such as period, question mark, and exclamatory mark), which are certainly EDU boundaries, there re- mains 7625 punctuations as EDU boundaries (positive instances) and 4876 punctuations as non-EDU boundaries (negative instances). With various features as adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xue and Yang (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al. (2013b)</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref> shows the performance of EDU recognition on the CDTB corpus with 10-fold cross validation.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>, MaxEnt performs best, with accuracy up to 90.6% on gold standard parse tree, close to human agreement of 91.7%, and with accuracy up to 89% on automatic parse tree. This suggests the appropriateness of our definition of clause as EDU. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref> also gives the performance on both positive and negative instances. It shows better F1-measure on recog- nizing positive instances than negative instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we propose a Connective-driven Dependency Tree (CDT) structure as a represen- tation scheme for Chinese discourse structure. CDT takes advantage of both RST and PDTB, and well adapts to the special characteristics of Chinese discourse. In particular, we describe CDT in detail from various perspectives, such as EDU, connective, structure, relation and nucle- arity. Given the CDT scheme, we annotate 500 documents in a top-down segmentation process to keep consistent with Chinese native's cogni- tive habit. Evaluation of the CDTB corpus on EDU recognition justifies the appropriateness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse structure and the usefulness of our CDTB corpus.</p><p>In the future work, we will focus on enlarging the scale of the corpus annotation and develop- ing a complete Chinese discourse parser.</p><p>The contact author of this paper, according to the meaning given to this role by Soochow Uni- versity, is Guodong Zhou. The complete corpus is available for research purpose upon request.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example of discourse structure in RST Example (1): An example of the connective-argument scheme in PDTB A)[Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services will be difficult ] Arg1, they argue, will be difficult, particularly if [market</figDesc></figure>
