				<p>This paper introduces the SURFACE CONSTRUCTION LABELING (SCL) task, which expands the coverage of Shallow Semantic Parsing (SSP) to include frames triggered by complex constructions. We present DeepCx, a neu-ral, transition-based system for SCL. As a test case for the approach, we apply DeepCx to the task of tagging causal language in English, which relies on a wider variety of constructions than are typically addressed in SSP. We report substantial improvements over previous tagging efforts on a causal language dataset. We also propose ways DeepCx could be extended to still more difficult constructions and to other semantic domains once appropriate datasets become available.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Shallow semantic parsing (SSP) aims to tag the trig- gers of semantic relations and the phrases between which those relations hold. However, words are not the only bearers of relational meaning: multi-word expressions (MWEs) and even arbitrarily complex constructions can express relations and evoke se- mantic frames (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fillmore et al., 2012</ref>). For example, causation, concession, and comparison are frequently expressed using complex construc- tions (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). MWE research has made strides in identifying MWE strings (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baldwin and Kim, 2010)</ref>, but little work has addressed tagging arguments of such constructional triggers; many of the examples in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> remain a challenge for conventional SSP.</p><p>This paper introduces the broader task of SUR- FACE CONSTRUCTION LABELING (SCL; §3). Like SSP, SCL aims to tag the surface elements of a sentence that express and participate in relational meanings. But in SCL, triggers are not just words or lexical units, but instances of constructions of the sort described by CONSTRUCTION GRAMMAR (1) WE must regulate to inhibit unsound practices.</p><p>(2) THIS opens the way to applying the law more widely. (3) Judy's comments were SO OFFENSIVE that I left.</p><p>(4) We headed out in spite of the bad weather. (5) We value any contribution, no matter its size. (6) Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams! (7) More boys wanted to play than girls. (8) Andrew is as annoying as he is useless. (9) I'm poorer than I'd like. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Examples of causal (1-3), concessive (4- 6), and comparative (7-9) constructions, with triggers bolded. Arguments of causal examples are annotated as in the BECAUSE annotation scheme, with CAUSES in blue small caps, effects in red italics, and means in purple typewriter text.</p><p>(CxG; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fillmore et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldberg, 1995)</ref>: arbi- trarily complex sets of tokens that carry meaning. These constructions can consist of single words, fixed MWEs, gappy MWEs, or even grammatical patterns.</p><p>We propose a transition system for SCL that can tag multi-word, possibly gappy sequences of to- kens as triggers and arguments ( §4). As a test case for the approach, we address English causal lan- guage, a valuable target for semantic analysis in its own right. (Extensions to arbitrary frame and role types would be straightforward with appropri- ate data; see §8.) The transitions can handle most types of constructions, including those with multi- ple arguments, missing arguments, and even trig- gers that overlap or are interleaved with arguments. We present DeepCx, a neural network that tags causal language using this transition system ( §5). We also describe experiments applying DeepCx to the BECAUSE corpus ( §6), showing that DeepCx significantly outperforms prior construction-based work on predicting causal frames ( §7). Finally, we discuss how the transition system and tagger model could be adapted to more difficult SCL tasks ( §8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and related work 2.1 Shallow semantic parsing</head><p>SCL of course inherits from SSP, which has a vener- able tagging tradition. For PropBank data, dozens of taggers have been developed (see <ref type="bibr">Màrquez, 2004, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Surdeanu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hajič et al., 2009</ref>). These typically focus on argument tag- ging, since PropBank triggers are readily identified by their POS tags. One popular design is a multi- stage pipeline that identifies argument spans and then labels them. Another alternative is BIO-style classification of argument words, either with con- ventional classifiers or with neural networks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Foland and Martin, 2015)</ref>. More recent systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Roth and Lapata, 2016)</ref> use neural networks to score and label possible argument spans or heads.</p><p>FrameNet-based tagging is more difficult, as trig- gers must be identified and disambiguated. Many FrameNet taggers have taken a pipeline approach (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Das et al., 2014</ref>) in which targets are first identified with a whitelist or simple rules. They are then assigned frames, which determine the available frame elements, and finally the frame elements are identified and la- beled. Again, neural networks have also been used to score argument spans and heads <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">FitzGerald et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roth, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Systems in both paradigms are constrained by their underlying representations. PropBank cov- ers only verbs and certain nominal and adjectival predicates. FrameNet's frame-evoking elements are broader, including verbs, prepositions, adverbs, conjunctions, and even some MWEs, but must still be single words or MWEs that act like words. As <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> demonstrates, some semantic domains, such as causality, demand a more flexible approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Construction grammar</head><p>CxG, which posits that the fundamental units of language are CONSTRUCTIONS-pairings of mean- ings with arbitrary linguistic forms. For instance, so X that Y (example 3) is characterized by a sin- gle construction, where the form is so adjective X finite clausal complement Y and the mean- ing is X to an extreme that causes Y . Follow- ing <ref type="bibr">Dunietz et al. (2017a,b)</ref>, we borrow two core insights of CxG: first, that morphemes, words, MWEs, and grammar are all on equal footing as "learned pairings of form and function" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goldberg, 2013)</ref>; and second, that constructions pair patterns of surface forms directly with meanings. Thus, we can tag any surface realizations of construc- tions as meaning-bearing triggers (hence "surface construction labeling").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Causal language</head><p>To test the SCL approach, we examine causal lan- guage, which conveys essential semantic informa- tion and is especially rich in constructional triggers.</p><p>Our data representation for causal language comes from the BECAUSE 2.1 corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dunietz et al., 2017b)</ref>, which focuses on what causal mean- ings are explicitly stated in the text. It defines causal language as any construction which presents one event, state, action, or entity as promoting or hindering another, and which includes at least one lexical trigger to anchor the annotation. For each instance of causal language, up to three spans are annotated: the causal connective (the trigger of the causal relation), the cause span, the effect span, and occasionally a means span (if a means by which the cause produces the effect is specified). See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for examples of analyses of causal lan- guage under the BECAUSE scheme. The corpus includes 4,867 sentences (123,674 tokens) of news articles and Congressional hearing transcripts fully annotated for causal language.</p><p>The only prior work on construction-based se- mantic parsing that we know of is Causeway <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dunietz et al., 2017a)</ref>, also based on the BECAUSE cor- pus. Causeway detects causal connectives using lexico-syntactic patterns, then applies heuristics and classifiers to tag arguments and remove false positives. It achieves moderate performance, but requires extensive tuning and feature engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Transition-based systems</head><p>Transition-based systems have primarily been used for dependency parsing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nivre et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nivre, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi and Palmer, 2011a)</ref>. Indeed, our system borrows many imple- mentation elements from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dyer et al. (2015)</ref>, who describe a shift-reduce parser that embeds the stack and buffer as LSTMs. This parser employs the novel STACK LSTM data structure-an LSTM augmented with a stack pointer, enabling it to be rewound to a previous state.</p><p>Transition systems have been developed for se- mantic tasks, as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Titov et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Henderson et al. (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Swayamdipta et al. (2016)</ref> explore extensions of dependency parsing that in- terleave semantic parsing actions with syntactic parsing actions. Google's SLING ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ringgaard et al., 2017</ref>) applies a custom-designed transition scheme for frame-based parsing and coreference resolution. Vilares and Gómez-Rodríguez (2018) develop a transition system for Abstract Meaning Representa- tion parsing, and TUPA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hershcovich et al., 2017)</ref> does the same for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation. Both can handle discontinuous or reen- trant graph structures. Most directly relevant to <ref type="bibr">DeepCx is Choi and Palmer's (2011b)</ref> work, which defines a novel transition system for PropBank pars- ing. Our similar scheme for parsing causal con- structions builds on this one, extending it for cases where the spans are not contiguous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The SCL task for causal language</head><p>An SCL task closely resembles an SSP task, except that the triggers can be complex constructions. As a corollary, the arguments can also be discontinuous and/or overlap with each other or the trigger.</p><p>In the case of causal language, we define the task as reproducing the core elements of the BE- CAUSE scheme: connective, cause, effect, and means spans. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunietz et al. (2017a)</ref>, we split the task into two parts: discovering causal connectives (connective discovery) and delimit- ing and labeling the arguments (argument ID). Producing the additional metadata that BECAUSE records for each instance is left to future work.</p><p>Each span is defined as a set of tokens. This excludes sublexical constructions; we return to this limitation in §8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Transition system</head><p>Like Choi and Palmer, DeepCx's transition system first searches for a connective word, and once it has found one, compares it with each word to the right and to the left. In each comparison, it selects a tran- sition that labels the word as unrelated to the cur- rent connective word, as another connective word (or FRAGMENT), or as a member of some argument span(s). Once all words have been compared to the current connective, the system advances to the next possible initial connective word. In the worst case, then, each sentence takes O(n 2 ) transitions. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> gives the full set of transitions. The tran- sitions act on a state tuple (λ 1 , λ 2 , a, λ 3 , λ 4 , s, A). a is the index of the current possible "connective anchor"-the word being tentatively treated as the initial (i.e., leftmost) word of a connective. λ 1 is the list of word indices to a's left that have not yet been compared with it, and λ 2 represents the words to the left of a that have already been com- pared. Likewise, λ 3 and λ 4 contain the indices of compared and uncompared words, respectively, to the right. Thus, words move from λ 1 to λ 2 and from λ 4 to λ 3 as they are compared with a. s is a boolean indicating whether we are currently com- paring words in the sentence to a, i.e., whether a has been confirmed as a connective anchor. A is a set of partially-constructed causal language instances. Each instance consists of a set of con- nective word indices plus one set of argument word indices for each argument type. For formal descrip- tion, we represent A as a set of labeled arcs. The head a of each arc is the connective anchor of a causal language instance i (an arbitrary identifier). The label of the arc indicates what role the tail t plays with respect to i: Cause, Effect, or Means if t is a member of the corresponding argument span, and Frag if t is a connective fragment other than a.</p><p>As the algorithm scans from left to right, it as- signs a to each word index in turn. If it decides a is not a connective anchor, it issues a NO-CONN and moves on. If a is deemed to start a connective, a new instance is initialized with a NEW-CONN. DeepCx proceeds to compare a with each word to its left, in right-to-left order (i.e., starting from the closest word), then each word to the right (in left-to-right order). For each comparison, it issues a LEFT/RIGHT-ARC, CONN-FRAG, or NO- ARC, depending on whether the comparison word is deemed part of an argument, part of the connec- tive, or neither. For simplicity, we always consider the leftmost connective word to anchor the connec- tive, so all CONN-FRAG transitions occur between a connective word and a word to its right. After all words have been compared with a (i.e., once λ 1 and λ 4 are empty), an automatic SHIFT transition advances a to the next connective anchor candidate.</p><p>The initial state is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">λ 1 = λ 2 = λ 3 = [ ], a = 1, λ 4 = [w 1 . . w n ]</formula><p>, s = f, and A = ∅, where w i is the ith word in the sentence. The algorithm terminates when a = n and either λ 3 = λ 4 = [ ] or s is false-i.e., when no words remain to a's right, and either a is not a connective anchor or all words in the sentence have been compared with it. An example transition sequence is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Some transitions have preconditions, shown in- line <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> in a smaller font. In addition, several transitions have constraints on their ordering to en- sure semantic well-formedness. These constraints Transition schema Effect and preconditions <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: The DeepCx transitions. Pre-and post-transition states are expressed as tuples (λ 1 , λ 2 , a, λ 3 , λ 4 , s, A). x stands for Cause, Effect, Means, or any combination thereof. i indicates the instance under construction; thus, x i denotes an argument or fragment arc of instance i. Elements changed by the transition are bolded. Preconditions (small font in the starting states) enforce a consistent transition order by delaying rightward actions until all leftward actions are completed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">NO-CONN (λ1, λ2= [ ], a, λ3= [ ], [w | λ4], s=f, A) ⇒ ([λ1 | a], λ2, w, λ3, λ4, s, A) NEW-CONN (λ1, λ2, a, λ3, λ4, s=f, A) ⇒ (λ1, λ2, a, λ3, λ4, t, A) NO-ARC-LEFT ([λ1 | w], λ2, a, λ3= [ ], λ4, s=t, A) ⇒ (λ1, [w | λ2], a, λ3, λ4, s, A) NO-ARC-RIGHT (λ1= [ ], λ2, a, λ3, [w | λ4], s=t, A) ⇒ (λ1, λ2, a, [λ3 | w], λ4, s, A) LEFT-ARCx ([λ1 | w], λ2, a, λ3= [ ], λ4, s=t, A) ⇒ (λ1, [w | λ2], a, λ3, λ4, s, A ∪ {a x i / / w}) RIGHT-ARCx (λ1= [ ], λ2, a, λ3, [w | λ4], s=t, A) ⇒ (λ1, λ2, a, [λ3 | w], λ4, s, A ∪ {a x i / / w}) CONN-FRAG (λ1= [ ], λ2, a = w, λ3, [w | λ4], s=t, A) ⇒ (λ1, λ2, a, λ3, [w | λ4], s=t, A ∪ {a FRAG i / / w}) SHIFT (λ1= [ ], λ2, a, [w|λ3], λ4= [ ], s=t, A) ⇒ (λ2, [ ], w, [ ], λ3, f, A) SPLIT See text ( §4.1)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Transition λ1 λ2 a λ3 λ4 s A - [ ] [ ] 1 [ ] [1 . . 7] f ∅ NO-CONN [1] [ ] 2 [ ] [2 . . 7] f ∅ NO-CONN [1, 2] [ ] 3 [ ] [3 . . 7] f ∅ NO-CONN [1 . . 3] [ ] 4 [ ] [4 . . 7] f ∅ NEW-CONN [1 . . 3] [ ] 4 [ ] [4 . . 7] t {because4 (•, •)} LEFT-ARCEffect [1, 2] [3] 4 [ ] [4 . . 7] t {because4 (moved3, •)} LEFT-ARCEffect [1] [2, 3] 4 [ ] [4 . . 7] t {because4 (they 2 moved3, •)} NO-ARC-LEFT [ ] [1 . . 3] 4 [ ] [4 . . 7] t {because4 (they 2 moved3, •)} NO-ARC-RIGHT [ ] [1 . . 3] 4 [4] [5 . . 7] t {because4 (they 2 moved3, •)} CONN-FRAG [ ] [1 . . 3] 4 [4, 5] [6, 7] t {because4/of5 (they 2 moved3, •)} RIGHT-ARCCause [ ] [1 . . 3] 4 [4 . . 6] [7] t because4/of 5 (they 2 moved3, the6) RIGHT-ARCCause [ ] [1 . . 3] 4 [4 . . 7] [ ] t because4/of 5 (they 2 moved3, the6 schools7) SHIFT [1 . . 4] [ ] 5 [ ] [5 . . 7] f because4/of 5 (they 2 moved3, the6 schools7) NO-CONN [1 . . 5] [ ] 6 [ ] [6, 7]</formula><p>f because4/of 5 (they 2 moved3, the6 schools7)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">NO-CONN [1 . . 6] [ ] 7 [ ] [7]</formula><p>f because4/of 5 (they 2 moved3, the6 schools7) are listed in the supplementary material ( §A.3).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">NO-CONN -- - -- --</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">SPLIT transitions</head><p>In BECAUSE, a word from one connective can also be part of another connective. This most often oc- curs with conjoined arguments where portions of the connective are repeated. For example, in it'll take luck for us to succeed or even to survive, suc- ceed and survive are considered Effects of two dif- ferent causal instances whose connectives share the for. The SPLIT action handles such cases by com- pleting the current causal language instance and starting a new one, copying all connective and ar- gument words up to the repeated connective word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Differences from Choi and Palmer</head><p>Our scheme differs fourfold from Choi and Palmer:</p><p>1. They assume oracle PropBank predicates. DeepCx, lacking oracle connectives, starts new causal language instances with NEW-CONNs, and adds s to the state to track whether such a transition has occurred.</p><p>2. Unlike PropBank, BECAUSE allows a connec- tive to include multiple content words. Our sys- tem therefore adds a CONN-FRAG transition.</p><p>3. A connective word can be part of an argument- e.g., in enough food to live, the connective and Cause both include enough. DeepCx therefore compares each connective anchor with itself.</p><p>(This is why for each new connective anchor a, λ 4 starts out with a as its first element. It is also why the CONN-FRAG action does not advance to the next potential argument word: a connective fragment can be part of an argument.)</p><p>4. PropBank never posits two predicates for a sin- gle verb, but in BECAUSE, multiple connectives can share a connective word. This case is han- dled by the new SPLIT transition (see §4.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DeepCx neural network architecture</head><p>Given the experience of previous shallow seman- tic parsers (e.g., Roth, 2016), we expected perfor- mance to depend heavily on syntactic information. We therefore built our system on top of Dyer et al.'s LSTM parser, allowing us to directly incorporate the parser's embeddings. For example, a token's embedding can incorporate the parser's internal embedding of the subtree rooted at that token. At each step, the network computes a high-di- mensional state vector summarizing the internal data structures. That state feeds into a k-dimen- sional output layer, where k is the number of transi- tion types seen in training. Each vector component is the predicted log probability that the correspond- ing transition should come next. At test time, the highest-scoring predicted action is taken; in train- ing, gold-standard actions are executed instead. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows a schematic of the neural network structure. We elaborate on its components below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Final state and prediction layers</head><p>Beyond λ 1−4 , the inputs to the state vector are:</p><p>• h, the history of actions so far for the sentence.</p><p>• d, the path in the dependency parse tree between anchor a and the token being compared with it.</p><p>• The predicted probability of each transition T is computed from s using a softmax unit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p (T | s) = exp g T s + q T /z,</formula><p>where g T is a learned embedding of T , q T is a bias for T , and z is a normalizing constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Embedding the inputs to the state</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Embedding a token</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dyer et al. (2015)</ref>, each token t is repre- sented as a concatenation of three vector inputs:</p><p>• ˜ w t , a fixed word embedding for t's surface form.</p><p>• w t , a small additional word embedding of t, which allows the network to learn task-specific representations of words related to causality. This is the only component of a token's repre- sentation that is trained specifically for this task (i.e., that does not use an embedding from a pre- trained language model or a syntactic parsing model).</p><p>• p t , the LSTM parser's internal embedding of the POS tag it assigned to t in preprocessing.</p><p>The concatenation is passed through a linear transformation V (with a bias b t ) and a ReLU:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">t = max {0, V [ ˜ w t ; w t ; p t ] + b t }</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Embedding a list of tokens</head><p>For each input to the final state vector that is a list of tokens, we add an LSTM cell to the network. For the spans of the instance under construction- i.e., the connective, Cause, Effect, and Means spans-embedding token lists is straightforward: whenever a transition adds a token to one of these lists, that token's embedding is added to the cor- responding LSTM's input sequence. The LSTM's updated output is then used for all subsequent ac- tions until another transition modifies the span.</p><p>The procedure for embedding the λ's is more in- volved. As transitions are taken, tokens may need to be moved between lists-e.g., the argument to- ken is moved from λ 1 to λ 2 after a LEFT-ARC tran- sition, and the connective anchor token is moved from λ 4 to λ 1 on a NO-CONN.</p><p>We implement these transfers using stack LSTMs. Initially, all tokens' embeddings are input to λ 4 , but in reverse order, so that the leftmost to- ken is added last. Then, whenever λ 4 's leftmost to- ken t is to be moved-i.e., on a SHIFT, NO-CONN,  RIGHT-ARC, or NO-ARC-RIGHT-the λ 4 LSTM is rewound one step to its state before t was added. Storing λ 4 in reverse order offers the added benefit of tokens closer to the anchor holding greater sway, since LSTMs favor recently added inputs. λ 1 and λ 2 are a mirror image of λ 4 and λ 3 , re- spectively. Tokens are added to λ 1 on either a SHIFT or a NO-CONN. Thus, the λ 1 LSTM ends up representing an in-order list of tokens up to the cur- rent a. If a is then flagged as a connective anchor, tokens to its left are moved from λ 1 to λ 2 as they are compared. The rightmost token t in λ 1 is the first to be compared, so the λ 1 LSTM is rewound to remove t. t's embedding is then added to λ 2 , leaving λ 2 with a reversed list of compared tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Embedding a dependency path</head><p>The syntactic relationship between the connective anchor a and a candidate argument word t is given to the network as a DEPENDENCY PATH-the series of labels on the dependency arcs between a and t. To embed a dependency path, we again use the output of an LSTM cell, where each input is an embedding of a dependency label: for a label x, we directly use the LSTM parser's embedding for the syntactic parse action LEFT-ARC(x), if available, or <ref type="bibr">RIGHT-ARC(x)</ref> otherwise. We add one extra bit to each arc's embedding to indicate whether it was traversed forward or backward in this path. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4">Embedding the action history</head><p>During training, DeepCx learns vector representa- tions of each action. To embed the action history, these action embeddings are fed as inputs into yet another LSTM cell. This LSTM's output is the embedding of the history thus far.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Implementation details</head><p>DeepCx is implemented using a refactored version of the LSTM parser codebase that performs iden- tically to the original. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The neural network frame- work, which also underlies the LSTM parser, is an early version of DyNet ( <ref type="bibr">Neubig et al., 2017)</ref>. The LSTM parser model is pretrained on the usual Penn Treebank ( <ref type="bibr">Marcus et al., 1994)</ref> sections (training: 02-21; development: 22).</p><p>For˜wFor˜ For˜w, we use the same "structured skip n- gram" word embeddings as the LSTM parser. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dyer et al. (2015)</ref> for details about the embedding approach, hyperparameters, and training corpora. DeepCx gives no special treatment to out-of-vocab- ulary items, other than using the 0 vector for words not included in the pretrained embeddings.</p><p>The code for DeepCx is available on GitHub. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Dimensionalities</head><p>The pretrained LSTM parser model uses the same dimensionalities as the original LSTM parser.</p><p>Token embeddings are 48-dimensional; w is 10- dimensional. The remaining DeepCx neural net- work dimensionalities used in the experiments re- ported below are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. All LSTM cells use two layers of LSTMs before the final output. These values were chosen as an intuitive balance between values that worked well for other projects and what we could reasonably expect to train with the amount of data we have. Early exper- iments showed little sensitivity to dimensionality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Experimental setup and training setup</head><p>Due to the small corpus size, all experiments use 20-fold cross-validation, split by sentence. Within each fold, the available data-i.e., everything but the fold's held-out test set-is randomized, then split into 80% training and 20% development. Af- ter each sentence has been fed through the network, taking gold-standard transitions (see §5), backprop- agation is run on all predictions for the sentence. Development set performance is evaluated every 2500 sentences. After each epoch, the training and development sets are re-randomized and re-split. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Training ends when either the connective-level F 1 score 5 on the development data hits 0.999 or 85% of the past five epochs' evaluations have yielded lower scores than their immediate predecessors. All systems used the same folds. See the supple- mentary materials ( §A.4) for training parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Network variants tested in experiments</head><p>Ablation studies In addition to the vanilla con- figuration described above, we examined which non-essential model components contribute to per- formance. We were particularly interested in the effects of parse information. We tested eliminating the following components of the DeepCx model: (1) w, the task-specific word embeddings, which 3 https://github.com/duncanka/ lstm-causality-tagger. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Reusing the development data means the network can end up memorizing. However, early experiments with dedicated development data showed lower scores, presumably because too much training data was lost from each fold. Of course, our final evaluation is still performed on the fold's held-out data. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> For the experiment with oracle connectives, action-level prediction accuracy is used instead of F1 score. could contribute to overfitting; (2) a, the action history; and (3) d, the parse path between the con- nective anchor and the current comparison token.</p><p>Argument identification alone DeepCx has no separate argument tagging phase, so we tested per- formance on the subtask of argument identification by providing DeepCx with oracle transitions only for actions that act on the connective-i.e., NO- CONN, NEW-CONN, CONN-FRAG, and SPLIT. The system was then responsible for deciding between NO-ARC, LEFT-ARC, and RIGHT-ARC transitions.</p><p>Restricting generalization One of the strengths of the transition-based approach is its ability to rec- ognize previously unseen forms of causal language that resemble known connectives semantically and/ or linguistically. Given our relatively small dataset, however, it seemed possible that the system would not have enough data to make meaningful gener- alizations. We therefore tested a variant where DeepCx would refuse to allow a test-time NEW- CONN or CONN-FRAG transition unless adding the putative connective word would match the initial word sequence of some connective seen in training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Evaluation metrics</head><p>For connective discovery we measure precision, recall, and F 1 , requiring connectives to match ex- actly. For argument ID, we split metrics for Causes and Effects (we omit Means, as there are too few in the corpus to evaluate reliably). For each argument type, we report F 1 of connective/argument pairs, where matches must match exactly; F 1 of connec- tive/argument pairs, where half of the larger span's tokens must match; and the average Jaccard index for gold vs. predicted spans, given a correct con- nective. Punctuation is excluded from evaluation.</p><p>Jaccard indices convey how close argument tag- ging is when it does not match exactly. This metric is computed only over true positive connectives, as argument overlap cannot be evaluated automati- cally for false positives. Thus, Jaccard indices are not directly comparable between systems-they represent how well argument ID works given the previous stage, rather than in an absolute sense.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results and analysis</head><p>Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. For comparison, we also report on the best Causeway configurations.</p><p>All significance tests below are paired, two- tailed t-tests on the results from all 20 folds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connectives</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causes Effects</head><p>System variant P R F1 F1 F1@.5 J F1 F1@.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Results for all variants of DeepCx tested. As before, J indicates Jaccard index. For P /R/F 1 scores, the best non-oracle results are bolded, and the best results within each of the top two sections are italicized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Overall performance</head><p>The results show the DeepCx transition system to be a promising approach for SCL. The vanilla configuration unmistakably eclipses Causeway at connective discovery with a margin of 6.1 F 1 points, driven primarily by recall. Both F 1 scores have high standard deviations across folds (3.6-4.7 points), but the scores covary; some folds are simply harder. DeepCx usually leads Cause- way by at least 5 points, making the difference highly statistically significant (p 0.001). The gap comes primarily from recall, where DeepCx averages 9.6-10.7 points higher than Causeway. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> On end-to-end argument identification, DeepCx again outperforms Causeway, particularly on recall, with a 5-6-point gap in F 1 . The Jaccard indices for Causes and Effects are in the low 80's, indicating extensive overlap with gold-standard spans. They are on par with Causeway for Causes and higher for Effects, despite the fact that DeepCx's higher recall gives it more chances to be docked for mismatches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Argument identification alone</head><p>Argument ID scores remain high when oracle con- nectives are provided. Naturally, the end-to-end argument scores improve dramatically compared to non-oracle connectives, but the more important question is what fraction of the previous errors re- main when connective discovery is no longer a source of error. With oracle connectives, DeepCx achieves 73.5% F 1 on Causes and 67.8% on Effects, implying that the vanilla configuration's argument error was split roughly half and half between con- nective discovery failures and argument ID failures.</p><p>However, the F 1 metrics reflect exact span matches; it is counted as a mismatch if even a single word is off. Because in this experiment the system's entire task is to tag arguments, the Jac- card indices give an absolute measure of overlap between predicted and gold argument spans. By that measure, the neural network's treatment of ar- gument identification transitions looks quite robust. Jaccard indices do drop by a few points compared to non-oracle connectives, as expected: with the oracle, arguments are evaluated for every gold-stan- dard instance, including more difficult ones that the vanilla configuration misses. But despite the more exhaustive assessment, DeepCx maintains Jaccard indices of ∼80% for Causes and Effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Model ablation studies</head><p>No pieces of the model beyond the bare essentials improved connective scores. Removing these com- ponents did marginally lower argument ID scores, but few differences were statistically significant.</p><p>The meager effects of parse paths came as a surprise; indeed, our reason for building on the LSTM parser was to lean on its parse embeddings. That these paths made little difference suggests that the bulk of the information they provide is available in some isomorphic form from simpler inputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Constraining to known connectives</head><p>Constraining DeepCx to known connectives yields an interesting tradeoff. On the one hand, it boosts precision (p &lt; 0.036) and raises F 1 slightly (p &lt; 0.09). Inspecting the vanilla system's outputs ac- centuates the risks of letting it run wild inventing connectives: its odder proposals included an unfair effort to, is insanity, eight, and the dollar sign.</p><p>On the other hand, some generalizations were surprisingly perceptive. For instance, the phrase allowing states greater opportunity to regulate was not marked by annotators because allowing here seems to mean "providing." But DeepCx proposed allowing opportunity to as a connective-a plausi- ble candidate for annotation. Elsewhere DeepCx tagged catalyst for and fuel (as in fueled skepti- cism), both arguably annotator omissions.</p><p>Ultimately, then, whether to permit novel con- nectives depends on the user's prioritization of pre- cision, recall, and discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">What's needed for other constructions and domains?</head><p>Although the DeepCx transitions were designed for BECAUSE, it would be straightforward, given ap- propriate corpora, to extend the transition scheme and model structure to arbitrary frames and role la- bels as in PropBank and FrameNet. The scheme's arc transitions would need variants for each possi- ble role type, as is standard in existing transition- based SSP (e.g., SLING, Choi and Palmer). Like- wise, NEW-CONN could be changed to NEW- CONN(frame); the space of arc transitions for con- structing the rest of that instance could then be pruned to those relevant to the frame. As for the tagger state, there are several straightforward ways to modify it for open-ended role and frame labels. One option is to represent each instance's argu- ments as a list of role label, list of tokens tuples, and to add a frame label variable that is embedded as part of the state. Alternatively, we could fol- low SLING in providing the tagger a list of frame label, role label, token tuples. Applying SCL to domains beyond causality would be particularly useful for relations like com- parison and concession (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), where com- plex constructions abound. But as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fillmore et al. (2012)</ref> observe, many frames possess the odd non- lexical-unit trigger. For example, the Motion frame can be evoked by the "verb-way" construction (sang our way across Europe), and Measurement by the abstract pattern number unit noun (as in twelve-inch-thick). Expanding SSP to cover con- structions would allow parsing these cases, which are individually rare but collectively form a fat tail of frame instances.</p><p>DeepCx already covers most constructional quirks that interfere with SSP, including discontin- uous trigger and argument spans, overlaps between arguments, overlaps between trigger words and arguments, and overlaps between triggers. Still, several extensions might be needed for the full gamut of arbitrary constructions. Most notably, our scheme operates on words, but plenty of con- structions are sub-lexical (e.g., the comparative -er). One solution would be to operate on morphemes in- stead. Unfortunately, tagging would then be subject to errors in morphological analysis, and morpheme- or character-based embeddings would be needed. A simpler but less elegant solution would be to tag the entire word containing the morpheme (e.g., bigger) as part of the construction.</p><p>A second challenge is constructions with no lex- ical trigger, as in I can't come; I have rehearsal. The simplest fix would be to add a JUXT transition as a sibling of NEW-CONN. This transition would anchor a new relation instance at the boundary be- tween the words currently being compared, indi- cating that the mere juxtaposition of two argument spans conveys a relation between them.</p><p>Cross-sentential constructions-e.g., discourse connectives whose arguments can be in another sentence-pose a third challenge: our sentence- oriented scheme ignores sentential juxtaposition and cross-sentential grammatical relations as con- struction possibilities. While it would not be too difficult to alter the scheme to allow, say, argu- ments in the previous k sentences, it might make randomized training more difficult.</p><p>Finally, SPLITs make strong assumptions about how two connectives sharing words will interact. Constructions violating these assumptions may re- quire more drastic surgery on the scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Contributions and takeaways</head><p>This paper has introduced surface construction la- beling as an expansion of shallow semantic parsing. It has also presented DeepCx, a neural transition framework unifying connective discovery and argu- ment ID for causal constructions. DeepCx achieves strong performance on parsing such constructions. Although the transition system targets causal lan- guage, its flexibility makes it promising for other domains, as well. We hope DeepCx will inspire further work on SCL. This includes applying more sophisticated tagging techniques such as bidirec- tional LSTMs, attention, and dynamic oracles, but most importantly developing new data and tasks to which the approach can be applied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Schematic of the overall neural network architecture.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> This embedding is similar to that proposed by Roth and Lapata (2016). However, their dependency paths include the words encountered along the way and their POS tags. We experimented with adding these elements to our dependency paths, but found that they consistently reduced performance. 2 https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser/ tree/easy-to-use.</note>
