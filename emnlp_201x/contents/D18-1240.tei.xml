				<p>High-level semantics tasks, e.g., paraphrasing , textual entailment or question answering , involve modeling of text pairs. Before the emergence of neural networks, this has been mostly performed using intra-pair features , which incorporate similarity scores or rewrite rules computed between the members within the same pair. In this paper, we compute scalar products between vectors representing similarity between members of different pairs, in place of simply using a single vector for each pair. This allows us to obtain a representation specific to any pair of pairs, which delivers the state of the art in answer sentence selection. Most importantly, our approach can outperform much more complex algorithms based on neural networks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Answer sentence selection (AS) is an impor- tant subtask of open-domain Question Answering (QA). Its input are a question Q and a set of can- didate answer passages A = {A 1 , A 2 , ..., A N }, which may, for example, be the output of a search engine. The objective consists in selecting A i , i ∈ {1, ..., N } that contain correct answers.</p><p>Pre-deep learning renaissance approaches to AS typically addressed the task by modeling Q-to-A (intra-pair) similarities <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Yih et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heilman and Smith, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wang and Manning, 2010)</ref>. Q-to-A similarity and align- ment are indeed crucial, but, in practice, it is very difficult to automatically extract meaningful rela- tions between Q and A. For example, consider two positive Q/A pairs in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. If we want to learn a model based only on the intra-pair Q- to-A matches, simple lexical matching (marked with italics) will not be enough. One would need to conduct more complex processing and identify * Professor at the University of <ref type="bibr">Trento.</ref> that movie and film are synonyms, and that the n- gram play in the movie or be in the movie can be paraphrased as star. While the former can be easily detected using an external lexical resource, e.g., WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>, the latter would require more complex inference.</p><p>On the other hand, Q 1 and Q 2 contain the same pattern who ... in the movie ..., and their respec- tive answers contain film ... starring .... If we know that P 1 = (Q 1 , A 1 ) is a positive AS example and want to classify P 2 = (Q 2 , A 2 ), then high Q 2 - to-Q 1 and A 2 -to-A 1 cross-pair similarities can suggest that P 1 and P 2 are likely to have the same label. This idea, for example, was exploited by <ref type="bibr">Severyn and Moschitti (2012)</ref>, whose system mea- sures syntactic-semantic similarities directly be- tween structural syntactic tree representations of Q 1 /Q 2 and A 1 /A 2 . This model still exhibited state-of-the-art performance in 2016 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tymoshenko et al., 2016a</ref>).</p><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) also naturally use such cross-pair similarity when modeling two input texts, and then further combine it with intra- pair similarity, for example, by means of atten- tion mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Shen et al., 2017)</ref>, compare- aggregate architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bian et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang and Jiang, 2017)</ref>, or fully-connected layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Severyn and</ref><ref type="bibr">Moschitti, 2015, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rao et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we observe that: (i) the high accu- racy of the kernel model by <ref type="bibr">Severyn and Moschitti (2012)</ref> was due not only to the use of syntactic structures, but also to the use of cross-pair simi- larities; and (ii) the success of DNNs for QA can be partially attributed to an implicit combination of cross-and intra-pair similarity.</p><p>More specifically, we investigate, whether sim- ple similarity metrics, e.g., cosine similarity be- tween standard vector representations, can per- form competitively to the state-of-the-art neural models when employed as cross-pair kernels.</p></div>

L. Travers.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Question/Answer Sentence pairs from WikiQA corpus. We use italic font to mark intra-pair lexical matches between Q1 and A1, Q2 and A2, and bold font to mark the cross-pair matches between Q1 and Q2, A1 and A2.</p><p>To this end, we apply linear and cosine kernels to Q i /Q j and A i /A j pairs (i, j = 1, ..., N ) repre- sented as a bag-of-words (BoW) or an averaged sum of their pretrained word embeddings. Then, we combine them with the cross-pair Tree Kernels (TKs) and kernels applied to the traditional Q/A intra-pair similarity feature vector representations in a composite kernel and use it in an SVM model.</p><p>We experiment with three reference datasets, WikiQA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al., 2015</ref>), TREC13 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yao et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al., 2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Task 3.A (Nakov et al., 2016</ref>, using a number of lexical-overlap/syntactic kernels. The latter chal- lenge refers to a community question answering (cQA) task. It consists in reranking the responses to user questions from online forums. It is the same setting as AS, but the text of questions and answer sentences can be ungrammatical due to the nature of the online forum language.</p><p>We obtain competitive results on WikiQA and SemEval tasks, showing that: (i) simple BoW rep- resentations, when used in cross-pair kernels, per- form comparably to and even outperform hand- crafted intra-pair features. (ii) In cQA, simple cross-pair embedding-and BoW-based similar- ity features outperform domain-specific similar- ity features, which are hand-crafted from intra- pair members. The simple features also perform comparably to syntactic TKs. (iii) We show that a combination of simple cosine-intra-and cross- pair kernels with TKs can outperform the most re- cent state-of-the-art DNN architectures.</p><p>Assuming the conjecture of our paper correct, cross-pair modeling is the major neural network contribution, the last point above is not surpris- ing as on relatively small datasets kernels-based models can exploit syntactic information very ef- fectively while neural models cannot.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. We de- scribe the kernels incorporating intra-and cross- pair matches in Sec. 3.2, list the simple cross- and intra-pair features in Sec. 3.3, describe strong hand-crafted baseline features in Sec. 4, and report the experimental results in Sec. 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Early approaches to AS typically focused on mod- eling intra-pair Q-to-A alignment similarities. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Yih et al. (2013)</ref> proposed a latent alignment model that employed lexical-semantical Q-to-A alignments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al. (2007)</ref> mod- eled syntactic alignments with probabilistic quasi- synchronous grammar, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heilman and Smith (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yao et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wang and Manning (2010)</ref> employed Tree Edit Distance-based Q-to- A alignments.</p><p>Originally, the idea of cross-pair similarity was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zanzotto and Moschitti (2006)</ref> and applied to the recognizing textual entailment task, which consists in detecting whether a text T en- tails a hypothesis H. They assumed that if two H/T pairs H 1 , T 1 and H 2 , T 2 share the same T-to-H "rewrite rules", they are likely to share the same label. Based on this idea, they proposed an al- gorithm applying TKs to (H 1 , H 2 ) and (T 1 , T 2 ) syntactic tree representations, enriched with H-to- T intra-pair rewrite rule information. More con- cretely, such algorithm aligns the constituents of H with T and then marks them with symbols di- rectly in the trees. This way the alignment infor- mation can be matched by tree kernels applied to cross-pair members.</p><p>Then, a line of work on AS, started by Sev- eryn and Moschitti <ref type="bibr">(2012,</ref><ref type="bibr">2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Severyn et al. (2013)</ref>, was inspired by a similar idea of incor- porating "rewrite rules" directly into the tree rep- resentations of Q 1 /A 1 and Q 2 /A 2 . They represent Q and A as syntactic trees enhanced with Q-to-A relational information, and apply TKs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Moschitti, 2006</ref>) to (Q 1 , Q 2 ) and (A 1 , A 2 ). Thus they model cross-pair similarity, and learn important patterns occurring in Q and A separately. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Tymoshenko et al., 2016a</ref>), this approach is compet- itive with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).</p><p>In our approach, instead of using only one TK, we employ a number of different word-based kernels, most of which can be computed more efficiently than TKs.</p><p>Most recent AS models are based on Deep Neu- ral Networks (DNNs), which learn distributed rep- resentations of the input data. DNNs are trained to apply series of non-linear transformations to the input Q and A, represented as compositions of word or character embeddings. DNN architectures learn AS-relevant patterns using intra-pair similar- ities as well as cross-pair, Q-to-Q and A-to-A, sim- ilarities, when modeling the input texts. For exam- ple, the CNN network by <ref type="bibr">(Severyn and Moschitti, 2015</ref>) has two separate embedding layers for Q and A, which are followed by the respective con- volution layers, whose output is concatenated and then passed through the final fully-connected joint layer. The weights in the Q and A convolution layers are learned by means of the backpropaga- tion algorithm on the training Q/A pairs. Thus, obviously, classifying a new Q/A pair is partially equivalent to performing the implicit cross-pair Q- to-Q and A-to-A comparison.</p><p>Additionally, the DNN approaches model the Q-to-A relatedness explicitly in a variety of ways, e.g., by: (i) using a Q-to-A transformation matrix and simple Q-to-A similarity features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Severyn and Moschitti, 2015)</ref>, (ii) relying on RNN and LSTM architectures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wang and Nyberg, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Shen et al., 2017)</ref>, (iii) employing at- tention components <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Yin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Shen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wang et al., 2016a</ref>), (iv) decomposing input into similarity and dissimilarity matches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2016b</ref>) or (v) using the compare-aggregate method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang and Jiang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bian et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>We believe that the ability of DNNs to implic- itly capture cross-pair relational matching, i.e., the capacity of learning from (Q 1 , Q 2 ) and (A 1 , A 2 ), is a very important factor to their high perfor- mance. This is of course paired with their abil- ity to learn non-linear patterns and capture Q-to- A relatedness by means of attention mechanisms. It should be noted that the latter are typically hard-coded in kernel models as lexical match- ing/similarity ( <ref type="bibr">Severyn and Moschitti, 2012</ref>). This is effective as much as the attention approach, at least with standard-size dataset, also in neural models <ref type="bibr">(Severyn and Moschitti, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In our work, we model Q-to-A, Q-to-Q and A- to-A similarities with intra-and cross-pair ker- nels and show that such combination also exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the reference cor- pora. In addition, our approach can be applied to smaller datasets as it utilizes less parameters, and can provide insights on future DNN design.</p><p>3 Cross-pair similarity kernels for text</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Background on Kernel Machines</head><p>Kernel Machines (KMs) allow for replacing the dot product with kernel functions directly applied to examples, i.e., they avoid mapping examples into vectors. The main advantage of KMs is a much lower computational complexity than the dot product as the kernel computation does not de- pend on the size of the feature space.</p><p>KMs are linear classifiers: given a labeled train- ing dataset S = {(x i , y i ) : i = 1, . . . , n}, their classification function can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f (x) = w · x + b = n i=1 α i y i x i · x + b.</formula><p>where x is a classification example, w is the gra- dient of the separating hyperplane, and b its bias. The equation shows that the gradient is a linear combination of the training points x i ∈ R n mul- tiplied by their labels y i ∈ {−1, 1} and their weights α i ∈ R + . Note that the latter are differ- ent from zero only for the support vectors: this reduces the classification complexity, which will be lower than O(n) for each example.</p><p>We can replace the scalar product with a ker- nel function directly defined over a pair of ob-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">jects, K(o i , o) = φ(o i )φ(o)</formula><p>, where φ : O → R n maps from objects to vectors of the final feature space. The new classification function becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (o) = n i=1 α i y i K(o i , o) + b,</formula><p>which only needs the initial input objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Inter-and intra-pair match kernel</head><p>We cast AS as a text pair classification task: given a pair, P = (Q, A), constituted by a question (Q) and a candidate answer sentence (A), we classify it as either correct or incorrect. We used KMs, where K (·, ·) operates on two pairs, P 1 = (Q 1 , A 1 ) and P 2 = (Q 2 , A 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Intra-pair similarity</head><p>A traditional baseline approach would (i) repre- sent Q/A pairs as feature vectors, where the com- ponents are similarity metrics applied to Q and A, e.g., a world overlap-based similarity; and (ii) train a classification model, e.g., an SVM using the following kernel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K IP (P 1 , P 2 ) = K v V Q 1 ,A 1 , V Q 2 ,A 2 , (1)</formula><p>where K v can be any kernel operating on the fea- ture vectors, e.g., the polynomial or linear (as in our work) kernel.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">V T 1 ,T 2 is a vector built on N similarity features, f 1 (·, ·), f 2 (·, ·), ..., f N (·, ·),</formula><p>extracted by applying similarity metrics to two texts, T 1 and T 2 (see Sec. 3.3 for the list of the sim- ilarity metrics we used). K IP merely uses intra- pair similarities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Cross-pair similarity</head><p>We incorporate the intuition, similar questions are likely to demand similar answer patterns, by means of a cross-pair kernel, which measures sim- ilarity between questions and answers from P 1 and P 2 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">K CP (P 1 , P 2 ) = V Q 1 ,Q 2 · V A 1 ,A 2 = N i=1 f i (Q 1 , Q 2 ) · f i (A 1 , A 2 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>K CP measures P 1 -to-P 2 similarity in terms of a sum of the products of Q 1 -to-Q 2 and A 1 -to-A 2 similarities. Note, that within</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">K IP , f i (Q i , A i )</formula><p>is merely an i-th feature in the V Q i ,A i feature vector. At the same time, within K CP , f i (·, ·) becomes a kernel, which takes the (Q 1 , Q 2 ) or (A 1 , A 2 ) pairs as input. In other words, V Q 1 ,Q 2 · V A 1 ,A 2 is a sum of products of f i (·, ·) kernels ap- plied to the (Q 1 , Q 2 ) and (A 1 , A 2 ) pairs. K CP is a valid kernel if the similarity metrics used to compute the f i (·, ·) are valid kernel functions. Finally, combining K IP and K CP enables learning of two different kinds of valuable cross- and intra-pair AS patterns. We combine various K IP and K CP by summing them or by training a meta-classifier on their outputs. See Section 5.4 for more details. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> summarizes the dif- ferences between the K IP and K CP computation processes described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Similarity features</head><p>We employ three similarity feature types as f i (·, ·). Two of them are computed using the co- sine similarity metrics and differ only in terms of the input texts, T 1 and T 2 , representations. The other type is constituted by TKs applied to the structural representations of T 1 and T 2 . Note that, since cosine similarity and TKs are valid kernels,  K CP (P 1 ,P 2 )=V Q1,Q2 !

The {t, l, s} in- dex describes an n-gram representation configura- tion: t denotes whether the n-grams are assembled of word lemmas (L), or their part-of-speech tags (P OS), or lemmas concatenated with their respec- tive POS-tags (L P OS ); l is a (n 1 , n 2 ) tuple, with n 1 and n 2 being the minimal and maximal length of n-grams considered, respectively; and s is Y ES if the representation discards the stopwords and N O, otherwise.</p><p>We used {t, l, s} configurations from the following set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">C = ({L, L P OS } × {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3)} × {Y ES, N O}) ∪ ({P OS} × {(1, 4), (2, 4)} × {Y ES}).</formula><p>It follows that |C| = 23, which means we have 23 similarity features, f t,l,s B (T 1 , T 2 ), in total, in the intra-pair setting. The respective cross-pair ker- nels are a composite kernel summing 23 products of cosine kernels applied to 23 different (Q 1 , Q 2 ) and (A 1 , A 2 ) bag-of-ngram representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Embedding-based similarities (E).</head><p>We represent an input text as an average of em- beddings of its lemmas from pre-trained word embedding models. Then, the embedding fea- ture f E model (T 1 , T 2 ) is the cosine kernel ap- plied to the embedding-based representations of T 1 and T 2 . We use two pretrained embed- dings: <ref type="bibr">Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) and <ref type="bibr">GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), resulting in three 1 embedding-based features (see Sec. 5 for more technical details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Tree-kernel based similarities</head><p>Following the framework defined in ( <ref type="bibr">Severyn et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tymoshenko et al., 2016a</ref>), we rep- resent T 1 and T 2 as syntactico-semantic structures and use TKs as semantic similarity metrics. When computing K CP with TK as similarities, in Eq.2, we employ summation instead of multiplication 2 .</p><p>More specifically, we represent T 1 and T 2 as (i) constituency trees and apply subset TK (SST); or (ii) shallow chunk-based trees, similar to the one presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, and apply partial tree (PTK) kernel. In the shallow trees, lemmas are leaves and POS tags are pre-terminals. POS nodes are grouped under chunk nodes, and then under the sentences nodes. These representations en- code also some intra-pair similarity information, e.g., prefix REL denotes the lexical Q-to-A match. In a structural representation, we prepend it to the parent and grand-parent nodes of lemmas which occur both in Q and A, e.g., "Mary" in the first example of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Then, for factoid QA 3 , we mark focus words in Q and entities in A, if the answer contains any named entities of types matching the question expected answer type (EAT) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . More specifically, we mark the semantic Q-to-A match by prepend- ing the REL-FOCUS-&lt;EAT&gt; label to the answer chunk nodes that contain such named entities and also to the question focus word. Here, &lt;EAT&gt; stands for the EAT label. For example, in the Q 1 /A 1 pair in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the Q 1 EAT is HUMan, and the matching named entities include "Julie Andrews", "David Tomlinson" and others. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig- ure 2</ref> depicts Q 1 annotated both with REL-and REL-FOCUS links. We detect both question focus and EAT automatically. Due to the space limita- <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We use Word2Vec embeddings trained on two different corpora, which result in two features, and GloVe trained on one corpus. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We have opted to use summation in this case to follow the earlier work.</p><p>3 WikiQA and TREC13 are the factoid AS datasets, as their questions ask for a specific fact, e.g. date or a name. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For example, the PERson named entity type matches the HUMan EAT.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Results and discussion</head><p>Intra-pair kernels. Taking into account intra- pair similarity is the standard approach in the ma- jority of the previous non-DNN work. In our ex- periments, we implement this approach as K IP using B, E, V groups of similarity features. K IP performs worse than the state-of-art (SoA) DNN systems on all the datasets (see tables 5, 6 and 7, for the SoA systems).</p><p>The results on WikiQA are particularly low even when the best K IP system, B+V+E, is used, which scores up to 15 points less than the state of the art. This confirms the <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al. (2015)</ref> observation on WikiQA, according to which, sim- ple word matching methods are likely to under- perform on its data, considering how it was built. Nevertheless, despite its simplicity, B+V+E per- forms comparably to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al. (2015)</ref> reim- plementation of LCLR, the complex latent struc- tured approach employing rich lexical and seman- tic intra-pair similarity features <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Yih et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al. (2015)</ref> report that on WikiQA LCLR obtains MRR of 60.86 and MAP of 59.93.</p><p>Then, on TREC13 and SemEval-2016, the intra-pair V, V+E and B+V+E kernels exhibit rather high performance, however, they are still significantly below the state of the art, thus con- firming our hypothesis that intra-pair similarity alone does not guarantee top results.</p><p>Cross-pair kernels. B cr and E cr obtain rather high results on WikiQA and SemEval. On Wik- iQA, both B cr and B cr + E cr outperform all the intra-pair kernels by a large margin, while, on Se- mEval, they perform comparably to the manually engineered domain-specific V features of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nicosia et al. (2015)</ref>. On the contrary, on TREC13, V outperforms both B cr and E cr , thus showing that TREC13 is indeed biased towards intra-pair relat- edness features by construction.</p><p>More complex PTK and SST cross-pair kernels, both alone and combined with B cr , E cr , typically outperform the standalone B cr and E cr on all the corpora (PTK on TREC13 and WikiQA, and SST and B cr +E cr +PTK on SemEval). This can be ex- plained by the fact that PTK and SST are able to learn complex syntactic patterns and also con- tain some information about intra-pair relations, namely REL-labels described in Sec. 3.2. Thus, it is natural that they outperform simpler cross-pair kernels. Nevertheless, on WikiQA-DEV, B cr +E cr performs very close to PTK. Moreover, on Se- mEval, B cr +E cr outperforms PTK and is behind SST for less than 1 point in terms of MAP. This can be explained by the fact that Q and A, in Se- mEval, are frequently ungrammatical as the cQA corpus is collected from online forums.</p><p>Finally, note that the B cr +E cr +PTK system, which does not use any cQA domain-specific fea- tures, is only 0.56 MAP points behind KeLP, the best-performing system in the SemEval competi- tion (see Line 1 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7)</ref>.</p><p>Kernels combining the intra-and cross-pair similarities.

Moreover, V+B cr +E cr +E is only less than 0.5 points behind the #1 system of the SemEval- 2016 competition (see Tab. 7). We recall that V+B cr +E cr +E only uses basic n-gram overlap- based cross-and intra-similarity features and embedding-based cosine similarities.</p><p>Finally, when we add tree kernel models to the combination, i.e., V+B cr +E cr +E+PTK or V+B cr +E cr +E+SST, we note improvement for Se- mEval and TREC13 tasks.</p><p>Ensemble models. We ensemble cross-and intra-pair kernels-based models by summing the predictions of the standalone SVM classifiers (SUM models) or by training a logistic regression meta-classifier on them (META models). We build the meta-classifiers on the outputs of the stan- dalone system BASE and TKs, namely PTK and SST. The "Ensemble" section of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows that meta-system combinations mostly outperform the standalone kernels.</p><p>In general, combining cross-pair and intra-pair similarities (with kernel sum or meta-classifiers) provides state-of-the-art results without using deep learning. Additionally, the outcome is de- terministic, while the DNN accuracy may vary de- pending on the type of the hardware used or the random initialization parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Crane, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Tables 5, 6</ref> and 7 report the performance of the most recent state-of-the-art systems on WikiQA, TREC13 and SemEval in comparison with our best results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Comparison with the state of the art</head><p>WikiQA. As already mentioned earlier, Wik- iQA contains many questions without correct an- swer (see <ref type="table">Tab.</ref> 3). When evaluated on the full data, even the oracle system will achieve at most 38.38 points of MAP. Moreover, as originally ob- served in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al., 2007)</ref>, the questions that do not have either correct answers or incorrect answers are not useful for comparing the perfor- mance of different answer sentence selection sys- tems. Therefore, they are typically removed from WikiQA and TREC13 before the evaluation.</p><p>There has been some discrepancy in the com- munity when evaluating on WikiQA. The original baselines proposed for the corpus in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al., 2015)</ref> were evaluated in the "clean" setting 15 . We no all − clean MRR MAP MRR MAP LCLR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al., 2015)</ref> impl. of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Yih et al., 2013)</ref> 61.83 60.92 60. <ref type="bibr">86</ref>    n/a 79.5 AI-CNN ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref> n/a 80.14 Our model <ref type="bibr">(V+Bcr+Ecr+E+SST)</ref> 86.52 79.79 also evaluate in the "clean" setting. However, the performance of the most recent state-of-the- art systems listed in the Tab. 5 is reported in the "no all − " setting, in the respective papers, i.e., they keep the all + questions 16 . Thus, they have 6 extra questions always answered correctly by de- fault. To account for this discrepancy, in Tab. 5, we report the results in both settings. It is trivial to convert the performance figures from one setting to another. In the table, we mark the conversion results with italic.</p><p>Our SUM BASE;P T K system (i) outperforms all the state-of-the-art systems, including the sophisti- cated architectures with attention, such as IWAN- att ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Shen et al., 2017)</ref>, and compare-aggregate (C/A) frameworks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang and Jiang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bian et al., 2017</ref>) in terms of MRR; and (ii) has the same MAP as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bian et al., 2017)</ref>. Obviously, this improvement is not statistically significant with re- <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We deduced that from the corpus statistics reported by the authors of the papers. They all report having 243 test questions, which corresponds to the "no all − " setting spect to C/A systems by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bian et al. (2017)</ref>. Nev- ertheless, ours is a very promising result, consid- ering that we only use linear models with simple kernels and do not tune any learning parameter of such models.</p><p>TREC13. As shown in Tab. 6, our models do not outperform the state of the art on TREC13, but they still perform comparably to the recent DNN HyperQA model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tay et al., 2018)</ref>. In general, our model is behind the state-of-the-art IWAN-att sys- tem by 4.55 points in terms of MAP. Note, how- ever, that TREC13 test set contains only 68 ques- tions, therefore this difference in performance is not likely to be statistically significant <ref type="bibr">17</ref> .</p><p>Semeval. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref> compares performance of B cr + E cr + V + E + SST system on Semeval to that of KeLP and ConvKN, the two top systems in the SemEval 2016 competition, and also to the per- formance of the recent DNN-based HyperQA and AI-CNN systems. In the Semeval 2016 competi- tion, our model would have been the first 18 , with #1 KeLP system being 0.6 MAP points behind. Then, it would have outperformed the state-of-the- art AI-CNN system by 0.35 MAP points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>This work proposes a simple, yet effective ap- proach to the task of answer sentence selection based on the intuition that similar patterns in ques- tions are likely to demand similar patterns in an- swers. We showed that this hypothesis provides an improvement on three benchmark datasets, Wik- iQA, TREC13, Semeval-2016, and, moreover, it enables simple features to achieve the state of the art on WikiQA and Semeval-2016, outperform- ing many of state-of-the-art DNN-based systems. There is significant room for further elaboration of this approach, for example, by expanding feature spaces with more syntactic and semantic features, employing new types of kernels for measuring the inter-question/answer pair similarity or trying to implement the same idea in DNN architectures. <ref type="bibr">Aliaksei Severyn and Alessandro Moschitti. 2012</ref>.</p><p>Structural relationships for large-scale learning of answer re-ranking.
