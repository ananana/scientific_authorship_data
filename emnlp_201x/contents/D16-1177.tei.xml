				<p>We present a framework for augmenting data sets from the Universal Dependencies project with Universal Decompositional Semantics. Where the Universal Dependencies project aims to provide a syntactic annotation standard that can be used consistently across many languages as well as a collection of corpora that use that standard, our extension has similar aims for semantic annotation. We describe results from annotating the English Universal Dependencies treebank, dealing with word senses, semantic roles, and event properties.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper describes the Universal Decompositional Semantics (Decomp) project, which aims to aug- ments Universal Dependencies (UD) data sets with robust, scalable semantic annotations based in lin- guistic theory. The UD project 1 aims to provide (i) a syntactic dependency annotation standard that can be used consistently across many languages and (ii) a collection of corpora that use that stan- dard <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(De Marneffe et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nivre et al., 2015)</ref>. Decomp provides complementary semantic annota- tions that scale across different types of semantic in- formation and different languages and can integrate seamlessly with any UD-annotated corpus.</p><p>Decomp has two mutually supportive tenets- semantic decomposition and simplicity. As we dis- cuss further in the next section, these tenets allow us to collect annotations from everyday speakers of a language that are rooted in basic, commonsensical <ref type="bibr">1</ref>   aspects of meaning and that can be straightforwardly explained and generally agreed upon in context. In this paper, we describe Decomp protocols for three domains-semantic role decomposition, event decomposition, and word sense decomposition- and we present annotation results on top of the En- glish UD v1.2 (EUD1.2) treebank. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We begin in §2 by connecting Decomp with previous work on de- composition in linguistic theory. In §3, we present PredPatt, which is a software package for prepro- cessing UD annotated corpora for input into De- comp protocols. In §4, we present a major revi- sion to <ref type="bibr">Reisinger et al.'s (2015)</ref> semantic role de- composition protocol (SPR1). Our revision, SPR2, brings SPR1 into full alignment with Decomp while adding various new features. In §5, we present Decomp-aligned annotation of event properties, fo- cusing specifically on event realis. Finally, in §6, we describe a Decomp-aligned word sense decomposi- tion protocol and associated set of annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Universal Decompositional Semantics</head><p>A range of perspectives suggest that the proper rep- resentation for word meanings is decompositional.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dowty (1979)</ref> followed by a sub- stantial amount of research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jackendoff 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rappaport-Hovav and Levin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2005)</ref> suggests that word meanings can be factored into (i) idiosyncratic, item-specific components and (ii) general components, such as CAUSATION, that are used across the lexicon. In the domain of thematic roles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dowty (1991)</ref> argues that notions such as AGENT should be decomposed into simpler, more primitive properties such as voli- tional participation in an event. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pustejovsky (1991)</ref> decomposes word meanings into qualia structures that again incorporate more primitive properties of events and individuals. In spite of this wealth of theory, existing annotation protocols rarely take the idea into account, operating at the level that the above approaches decompose with very few excep- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Greene and Resnik, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hartshorne et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reisinger et al., 2015</ref>). Decomp's premise is that a decompositional approach to large-scale an- notation has benefits for both the annotation pro- cess and downstream uses of annotated data (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">He et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bos et al. 2017</ref> for recent non- decompositional approaches).</p><p>To capture these benefits, Decomp incorporates semantic decomposition directly into its protocols by mapping from decompositional theories, such as Dowty's, into straightforward questions on binary properties that are easily answered. This method of constructing annotation protocols gives rise to simplicity in the protocol, since the resulting ques- tions are much more commonsensical and easily ex- plained than the concepts they are decomposing. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dowty (1991)</ref> decomposes the relatively unintuitive notion (for ordinary speakers) of AGENT into much simpler properties, such as VOLITION and MOVEMENT. Instead of asking about whether a ver- bal argument is an AGENT (with the concomitant complex training process for annotators), a Decomp protocol might then ask about whether the referent of the argument had volition in or moved as a result of the event. Simplicity in the protocol in turn al- lows a Decomp protocol to gather annotations from untrained native (and na¨ıvena¨ıve) speakers of a language. In large part, the current paper is focused on devel- oping questions that everyday speakers can agree on and that are key for lexical representations.</p><p>An added benefit of questions on binary proper- ties is they allow the use of ordinal prompts (Likert scales), allowing annotators to record subjective un- certainty of a property in a given context, which can then be aggregated across multiple responses with less severe impact to inter-annotator agreement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Predicative patterns</head><p>In this section, we introduce PredPatt, which is a lightweight tool for identifying the structure of pred- icates and arguments from Universal Dependencies. We use the PredPatt's output as input to the Decomp- aligned annotation protocols we describe in §4 - §6.</p><p>To ensure that this output is accurate, we evaluate on multiple UD-annotated corpora: automatically gen- erated English parses and gold treebanks in Chinese, English, Hebrew, Hindi, and Spanish. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> PredPatt employs deterministic, unlexicalized rules over UD parses. We provide a high-level overview of the process here. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Input UD Parse with Universal POS tags 1. Predicate and argument root identification 2. Argument resolution 3. Predicate and argument phrase extraction 4. Optional Post-processing Output collection of predicate-argument structures UD Parse A universal dependency (UD) parse, is a set of labeled pairs. Each pair has the form RE- LATION(DEPENDENT, GOVERNOR). The UD parse also includes a sequence of Universal POS tags. An example of a UD parse is in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Predicate and argument root identification Predicate and argument roots (i.e., dependency tree nodes) are identified by local configurations- specifically, edges in the UD parse. The simplest example is NSUBJ(s, v) and DOBJ(o, v), which indicate that v is a predicate root, and that s and o are argument roots. Similarly, roots of clausal subjects and clausal complements are also predicate roots. Nominal modifiers inside adverbial modifiers <ref type="bibr">3</ref> While we are not aware of a similar tool for Universal Dependencies, PredPatt is similar to ClausIE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013</ref>) and ArgOE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gamallo et al., 2012)</ref>, which sup- ports Spanish, Portuguese, Galician and English. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> A detailed description of PredPatt is available at https: //github.com/hltcoe/PredPatt. PredPatt derives from the system described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rudinger and Van Durme (2014)</ref>. are arguments to the verb being modified, e.g., Investors turned away from [the stock market]. PredPatt also extracts relations from appositives, possessives, copula, and adverbial modifiers.</p><p>Argument resolution PredPatt includes argu- ment resolution rules to handle missing arguments of many syntactic constructions, including predi- cate coordination, relative clauses, and embedded clauses. Argument resolution is crucial in lan- guages that mark arguments using morphology, such as Spanish and Portuguese, because there are more cases of covert subjects. Other common cases for argument resolution are when predicates appear in a conjunction, e.g., Chris likes to sing and dance, has no arc from dance to its subject Chris. In rela- tive clauses, the arguments of an embedded clause appear outside the subtree, e.g., borrowed in The books John borrowed from the library are overdue. has books as an argument and so does are-overdue.</p><p>Predicate extraction PredPatt extracts a descrip- tive name for complex predicates. For example, <ref type="bibr">[PredPatt]</ref> finds <ref type="bibr">[structure]</ref> in <ref type="bibr">[text]</ref> has a 3-place predicate named (?a finds ?b in ?c). The primary logic here is (a) to lift mark and case tokens (e.g., in) out of the argument subtree, (b) to add adverbial modifiers, auxiliaries, and negation (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[Chris]</ref> did not sleep quietly). PredPatt uses the text order of to- kens and arguments to derive a name for the pred- icate; no effort is made to further canonicalize this name, nor align it to a verb ontology.</p><p>Argument phrase extraction Argument extrac- tion filters tokens from the dependency subtree be- low the argument root. These filters primarily sim- plify the subtree, e.g., removing relative clauses and appositives inside an argument. The default set of filters were chosen to preserve meaning, since it is not generally the case that all modifiers can safely be dropped (more aggressive argument simplifica- tion settings are available as options).</p><p>Post-processing PredPatt implements a number of optional post-processing routines, such as conjunc- tion expansion, argument simplification (which fil- ters out non-core arguments, leaving only subjects  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Results of manual evaluation of PredPatt on UD and objects), and language-specific hooks. 5</p><p>Gold treebanks in multiple languages We eval- uated PredPatt manually on several randomly sam- pled sentences taken from the UD banks of Chinese, English, Hebrew, Hindi and Spanish. This evalua- tion runs PredPatt with the gold standard UD parse.</p><p>We report the number of sentences evaluated along with the number of extractions from those sentences (a proxy for recall) and precision (95% confidence interval) for each language in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Semantic role decomposition</head><p>A decompositional strategy has been successfully used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reisinger et al. (2015)</ref> to annotate thematic role information under their Semantic Proto-Role la- beling protocol (SPR1), which is based on Dowty's (1991) seminal thematic proto-role theory. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In this section, we present a major revision to SPR1 aimed at strengthening and generalizing the protocol beyond Reisinger et al.'s dataset. We present three pilots aimed at validating our new pro- tocol as well as a bulk annotation of a large subset of core arguments in EUD1.2. Finally, we describe, deploy, and validate methods for extending SPR2's reach beyond this subset, resulting in SPR2.1.</p></div>

Filtering and data collection In Reisinger et al. 2015, verbs were excluded that occur in certain syntactic environments that interfere with property judgments. In particular, participles and impera- tives were excluded, as well as verbs in embedded clauses, in questions, and under negation or auxil- iaries. We carry these filters forward to our own bulk annotation by implementing them over PredPatt out- put and then show how these filters can be lifted.</p><p>Annotators To ensure internal consistency of the judgments, Reisinger et al.'s data was based on a sin- gle Amazon Mechanical Turk annotator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">SPR2 protocol</head><p>First we update both the set of questions and the method for presenting these questions in order to streamline the annotation process and simplify Reisinger et al.'s protocol. Second, to deal with po- tentially ungrammatical sentences, as well as to add an extra layer of quality control to the generation of property questions, we add an acceptability judg- ment question to the protocol. Finally, we collect an- notations from multiple trusted annotators with two- way redundancy, allowing us to normalize the data in a way that is impossible with SPR1.</p><p>Property questions While Reisinger et al.'s prop- erties were mainly motivated by linguistic theory, in the process of developing SPR2 we identified several redundancies as well as potential sources of error; these changes are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table  2</ref>. Redundancies include stationary being es- sentially the negation of change of location, and predicate changed argument being almost identical to change of state. The property exists as physical was dropped because it is a purely referential (non-relational) property of the argument; thus, it is redundant with our more elaborated decompositional word sense protocol. The location of event and physical contact properties were removed because of lower interannotator agreement and high within-annotator response variance in SPR1. In addition to this streamlining, we added three new properties that target new types of arguments: benefactives, partitives, and incremental themes. Benefactive arguments and partitive arguments of- ten have special morphosyntactic properties in many languages. In English, for example, benefactives can appear in double-object constructions with verbs like buy, and in many languages they correlate with special morphology. Partitives involve partial af- fectedness and similarly are often marked with mor- phological case <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kiparsky, 1998)</ref>. The third new property, change of state continuous, is a plain-language version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dowty's (1991)</ref> incre- mental theme proto-role property, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reisinger et al. (2015)</ref> did not include. An argument is an INCREMENTAL THEME with respect to an event if the temporal progress of the event can be measured in terms of, or put into correspondence with, the part-whole structure of that argument which under- goes some gradual change <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tenny, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krifka, 1989, a.o.)</ref>. For example, in an event of mowing the lawn, the lawn is an incremental theme because the progress of mowing is directly related to the por- tion of the lawn that has been mowed. Though in- cremental theme is quite abstract in comparison to other proto-role properties, it is widely agreed that something like this property is involved in linking thematic roles to syntactic position.</p><p>Dynamic reveal The question corresponding to the change of state continuous property presupposes that the argument under consideration did, in fact, undergo some change of state. This means that if an annotator has previously deter- mined that the property change of state does not apply, then asking about change of state continuous is at best inefficient, since we can de- terministically predict that the answer should be NA, and at worst confusing to the annotator, since the question triggers a presupposition failure.</p><p>To avoid such presupposition failures in SPR2, which we suspect led to additional noise and anno- tation time as part of SPR1, we modified the an- notation interface so that certain questions are re- vealed dynamically based on the answers to other questions. The set of questions is now orga- nized hierarchically instead of as a flat list. In this hierarchical structure, change of state is a parent of change of state continuous, which means that the latter question only appears if the annotator gives a high ordinal value to the for- mer. Questions that remain hidden are assumed to have NA as their answer. For SPR2, this pair of prop- erties is the only one affected by the dynamic reveal feature, though this aspect of the protocol will be extended in later versions.</p><p>Acceptability judgments Two kinds of grammat- ical acceptability judgments were collected. The first kind, collected on a five-point scale, asked about the acceptability of the sentence containing the ar- gument in question. The second kind, collected as a binary judgment, asked whether the question was hard to answer because of grammatical errors. This second was triggered only when annotators gave a response on the bottom three values of the ordinal scale for the relevant property question. We do not analyze these judgments here for reasons of space, but they are available as part of the released dataset.</p><p>Multiple annotators with redundancy Reisinger et al.'s (2015) reason for not using redundant an- notations was that a single annotator would pro- vide internally consistent judgments, but this con- sistency comes at the cost of potential bias in the judgments. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In order to evaluate bias, we move to <ref type="bibr">7</ref> For example, in analyzing the SPR1 dataset that Reisinger et al. make available, we noted that their annotator has a some- what idiosyncratic way of answering the was used question, which aims at identifying instruments: the annotator marks him two-way redundancy (and later versions of the pro- tocol are compatible with greater redundancy).</p><p>Heterogeneous data SPR2 extends the coverage of Semantic Proto-Role Labeling to heterogeneous genres. The SPR1 dataset contains only annotations of newswire text. This is not ideal for either prac- tical or scientific purposes, since newswire tends to be biased toward otherwise rare word senses-often pertaining to financial markets-but low coverage of otherwise common word sense.</p><p>To remedy these coverage issues, we extend SPR1 to the English Universal Dependencies (version 1.2) treebank (EUD1.2). EUD1.2 is based on the Lin- guistic Data Consortium's English Web Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bies et al., 2012</ref>) and contains a much wider set of genres than the Penn Treebank-including we- blogs, newsgroup discussions, emails from the En- ronSent Corpus, reviews from English Google re- views, and answers from Yahoo! Answers. EUD1.2 has the added benefit of being natively annotated with gold-standard Universal Dependencies (UD) parses (Nivre et al., 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Pilot experiments</head><p>In this section, we present three pilot experiments conducted on a subset of EUD1.2 and aimed at val- idating the updated protocol in preparation for de- ployment of the full task. In the first, we use the SPR1 protocol to obtain judgments on a small sam- ple of EUD1.2 sentences from the same trusted an- notator that produced SPR1. In the second, we open the same task to multiple annotators. And in the third, we deploy our updated SPR2 protocol on the in (i) as likely to have been used in carrying out the advising. This is a general pattern for this question for this annotator.</p><p>same subset of EUD1.2-again, open to multiple an- notators. We use these three pilots to evaluate in- terannotator agreement within and across protocols (where possible) and to construct a pool of trusted annotators to work on the full annotation task.</p><p>Item selection For each pilot, the same set of sen- tences were used. These sentences were selected based on properties of both the predicate and its corresponding arguments in each sentence. The pi- lot experiments were limited to the same 10 verbs (want, put, think, see, know, look, say, take, tell, give) that were considered in Reisinger et al.'s pilot. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reisinger et al. 2015</ref>, tokens were excluded with verbs that occur in certain syntactic environ- ments that interfere with property judgments. We used the same filters described by those authors, modified for UD. Additionally, verbs occurring as the second item in a conjunction were removed, as EUD1.2 does not have sufficient annotation to iden- tify all arguments of such verbs from the syntax.</p><p>Verbal arguments were defined as the subtrees governed by a verb via a core grammatical relation (nsubj, nsubpass, dobj, and iobj). In addi- tion, occurrences of the pronoun it in subject posi- tion were excluded because of inconsistencies in the annotation of expletive subjects in EUD1.2.</p><p>Pilots 1 &amp; 2: SPR1 protocol Pilot 1, designed to compare SPR1 directly to SPR2, used the same pro- tocol described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reisinger et al. 2015</ref> and was de- ployed on 99 argument tokens selected based on the method above. 8 To ensure that the only difference between SPR1 and this pilot was which sentences were annotated, we obtained the AMT identifier for the SPR1 annotator from Reisinger et al. Thus, the only annotator in this pilot was the same one that produced all the annotations for the SPR1 dataset.</p><p>The data from this pilot cannot be compared to the SPR1 dataset on a token level, since the items do not come from the same dataset. But these data can be compared to the SPR1 dataset on a type level by averaging responses to particu- lar questions asked about particular argument po- sitions (e.g., nsubj, dobj, etc.) for a particular predicate (e.g., want, put, etc.) and then comparing the correlation between these averages. The aver- age type-level correlation between the average by- predicate, by-argument relation ratings in the SPR1 dataset and those in the current pilot was high for all verb-argument pairs (Spearman ρ=0.82).</p><p>Pilot 2 uses the same materials and protocol as Pilot 1. The only difference between the two is that this pilot was open to multiple annotators. A total of 33 annotators participated, one of whom was the same annotator that produced all the annotations for the SPR1 dataset and participated in Pilot 1.</p><p>For each argument token, we collected five judg- ments per property question. Interannotator agree- ment was calculated by argument token for the like- lihood responses using pairwise Spearman rank cor- relations. The mean ρ across all annotator pairs and argument tokens was 0.562 (95% CI=[0.549, 0.574]) and, due to heavy left skew, the median was 0.618 (95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[0.603, 0.631]</ref>). This agreement is rela- tively high, suggesting that different annotators tend to agree on the relative likelihood of a property ap- plying to an argument.</p><p>Since the SPR1 and Pilot 1 annotator was among this group, we can also assess the extent to which the Pilot 1 annotator is consistent with other annotators. Comparing this annotator to every other annotator that annotated the same argument token, the mean ρ was 0.499 (95% CI=[0.451, 0.546]), and the me- dian was 0.565 (95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[0.504, 0.637]</ref>). This sug- gests that, on average, the other annotators are even more consistent with each other than they are with the original SPR1 annotator, vindicating the use of multiple annotators.</p><p>Pilot 3: SPR2 protocol Pilot 3 uses the same ma- terials as Pilots 1 and 2 but introduces the SPR2 pro- tocol laid out above. A total of 57 annotators par- ticipated in this pilot. For each argument token, we again collected five judgments per property.</p><p>Interannotator agreement was calculated by argu- ment token for the likelihood responses using pair- wise Spearman rank correlations. The mean ρ across all annotator pairs and argument tokens was 0.622 (95% CI=[0.610, 0.634]) and, again due to heavy left skew, the median was 0.677 (95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[0.662, 0.690]</ref>). This higher agreement compared to Pilot 2 likely arises due to the fact that we have fewer ques- tions in the SPR2 protocol and suggests that we suc-ceeded in removing noisy questions without adding questions that were similarly noisy.</p><p>Since we use the same materials as Pilots 1 and 2, we can also compare the SPR1 and SPR2 proto- cols on the subset of questions they share. We find similar mean agreement, at 0.593 (95% CI=[0.580, 0.607]), and median agreement, at 0.665 (95% CI=[0.652, 0.672]), to that we found within the Pi- lots 2 and 3 results. This suggests that the addi- tion and subtraction of questions does not substan- tially alter annotators' judgments on the questions that both protocols share.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Trusted annotator pool</head><p>To ensure annotation consistency in our bulk an- notation, we constructed a pool of trusted annota- tors from those annotators that participated in Pi- lots 2 and 3. We used two metrics to construct this pool: rating agreement and applicability agreement. Both of these metrics control for various factors that might raise or lower agreement independent of the annotator-e.g., the particular question, the partic- ular sentence, the particular argument type, etc.- using generalized linear mixed effects models. This pool contains a total of 86 trusted annotators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Bulk task</head><p>For our bulk task, we used the SPR2 protocol to an- notate a total of 3,806 argument tokens spanning 2,759 unique predicate lemmas. These argument tokens were part of a filtered set constructed using Reisinger et al.'s filtering scheme described above.</p><p>We collected two judgments per property, per ar- gument token. Interannotator agreement was calcu- lated in the same way as for the pilots. The mean ρ was 0.617 (95% CI=[0.611, 0.623]), and the median was 0.679, (95% CI=[0.673, 0.686]). This agree- ment is very close to that found in the pilots, sug- gesting that rating consistency extends beyond the constrained set of predicates used in the pilots.</p><p>One issue with SPR1 that remains unaddressed in SPR2 is the use of filters. This significantly reduces the potential coverage of the protocol and relies on extremely rich syntactic annotation. This second is not problematic when we have gold standard tree- banks like EUD1.2, but it becomes an issue when moving beyond such treebanks.</p><p>To alleviate this filter issue, we propose a further revision of SPR2. In this version (SPR2.1), we al- ter the SPR2 instructions to take into account cases where the property questions may be difficult to an- swer. These fall into at least three categories: even- tualities that haven't happened (irrealis eventuali- ties), generics, and habituals. In SPR2.1, annotators are instructed about each case and to answer as if a specific event of that kind did actually happen.</p><p>We annotated predicates that occurred in a sen- tence from the previous bulk task but were filtered from that task based on <ref type="bibr">Reisinger et al.'s (2015)</ref> fil- ters. We have so far annotated all such predicates with less than 100 instances in all of EUD1.2 and plan to continue annotation to get full coverage of these sentences.</p><p>A total of 26 annotators from our trusted pool par- ticipated in this annotation. As in the previous bulk task, we collected two judgments per property, per argument token. The interannotator agreement was calculated in the same way as for the previous bulk task and pilots and was reasonably high with a mean ρ of 0.528 (95% CI=[0.522, 0.535]) and median ρ of 0.571 (95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[0.563, 0.580]</ref>). This somewhat lower agreement is to be expected, since these pred- icates were selected to be harder than those in the previous task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Discussion</head><p>We presented a major revision to <ref type="bibr">Reisinger et al.'s (2015)</ref> decompositional Semantic Proto-Role Label- ing protocol (SPR1) and deployed this revised proto- col (SPR2) in three validation pilots and a bulk task. We then described two extensions to this protocol aimed at expanding the annotable arguments.</p><p>One issue that arises with SPR2.1 is that it sub- stantially complicates the instructions, clashing with Decomp simplicity tenet. In the next section, we de- scribe a task aimed at allowing us to better target predicates that need these more elaborated instruc- tions, allowing us to use the simpler SPR2 protocol where possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Event decomposition</head><p>As discussed in §4, SPR1 and SPR2 employ filters that run on top of dependency parses to ensure that proto-role property questions about particular argu- <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Example of the event decomposition task ments are answerable. We showed that these filters can be bypassed by altering the instructions given to annotators. This approach substantially increases the length of the tasks instructions, however, and so ideally, these lengthened instructions should be used only when absolutely necessary. One place it seems likely to be necessary is when the event in a sentence did not in fact occur.</p><p>In this section, we present a protocol, inspired by the one developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">de Marneffe et al. (2012)</ref>, for targeting these sorts of sentence with special instruc- tions in future versions of SPR (see also Saurí and Pustejovsky 2012). A major benefit of this protocol is that it produces a foundation for future decompo- sitional event annotations.</p><p>Protocol The protocol has four major compo- nents: questions about (i) whether or not a particu- lar word refers to an eventuality (event or state); (ii) whether the sentence is understandable; (iii) whether or not, according to the author, the event has already happened is currently happening; and (iv) how con- fident the annotator is about their answer to (iii).</p><p>The first two components were included to filter out items that are either incorrectly labeled as pred- icates or that the annotator could not annotate for components (iii) and (iv), and if an annotator an- swered no to either for a particular predicate candi- date, (iii) and (iv) did not appear. Thus, like SPR2.x, this protocol incorporates a hierarchy of questions that can be elaborated in future versions.</p><p>Data collection We applied this protocol to every predicate candidate found in an EUD1.2 sentence annotated under SPR2 and SPR2.1. This yields an- notations for a superset of the predicates annotated under SPR2.x, and thus components (i) and (ii) of these annotations can be used as a post hoc filter on the SPR2.x annotations or to decide on whether to include a predicate for future SPR2.x tasks. A total of 6,930 predicate candidates were an- notated in batches of 10 by 24 unique annotators recruited from the trusted annotator pool built for SPR2.x. Each predicate candidate was judged by two distinct annotators.</p><p>Data validation For each of the four components interannotator agreement was computed by each group of 10 predicates. For the categorical re- sponses, we would ideally use Cohen's κ, but there were so many cases of perfect agreement for the cat- egorical responses that Cohen's κ is ill-defined in many cases. As such, we report raw agreement here.</p><p>The mean raw agreement for whether each pred- icate candidate was a predicate was 0.955 (95% CI=[0.950, 0.960]). The mean raw agreement for whether the sentence was understandable was [0.976, (95% CI=[0.971, 0.980]); and the mean raw agreement for whether the eventuality happened or was happening was 0.820 (95% CI=[0.811, 0.829]).</p><p>Discussion We presented the first version of a new event decomposition protocol. This protocol inte- grates with and is in the same spirit as the SPR2.x protocols produced in the previous section.</p><p>In the next section, we describe a complemen- tary protocol for decomposing word sense, focusing specifically on noun senses. This last protocol com- pletes a picture wherein we decompose predicate ar- gument semantics into three parts: the properties of a predicate independent of its arguments, the prop- erties of a predicate's arguments in relation to the event the predicate denotes, and the properties of an argument independent of the predicate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Word sense decomposition</head><p>In §4 and §5, we focused on semantic questions that deal with eventualities. In this section, we describe a Decomp protocol for decomposing word sense. Our goal is similar to that in previous sections: elicit re- sponses from everyday speakers of the language re- garding basic properties, in relation to the context of a natural language sentence.</p><p>Protocol If directly following the strategy ex- plored thus far, we would create an interface that enumerated many dozens (or hundreds) of seman- tic properties one might ask about a word in context, and in further developments of Decomp there may be specific properties that are deemed essential for direct querying of annotators. However, here we rely on the rich pre-existing taxonomy of lexical knowl- edge captured in the WordNet hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Miller, 1995)</ref> in order to more efficiently gather implicit property responses. Everyday speakers can per- form basic word sense disambiguation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Snow et al., 2008)</ref>: this falls under the simplicity tenant of De- comp. Once a word is disambiguated in context we then can infer automatically whether an instance is, e.g., a physical object.</p><p>While WordNet is a valuable resource, the selec- tion of a specific categorical sense under an enu- merated set of prespecified options is troubling in a similar way as Dowty was concerned with thematic roles (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kilgarriff 1997)</ref>. Therefore we follow a path similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sussna (1993)</ref> in asking annotators for zero or more senses that are appropriate. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Candidate senses are extracted from WordNet synsets. We have grounded argument tokens in WordNet in order to make efficient use of existing lexical semantic resourses, but this protocol could in principle be used with any other lexical semantic re- source. We believe these annotations will be useful already in the context of the other annotations, but in addition, future work will use these sense ground- ings to derive commonsense properties beyond those directly encoded in the WordNet hierarchy.</p><p>Data collection A total of 18,054 word tokens (arguments) in 10,833 total sentences extracted from EUD1.2 were annotated for sense by at least three annotators recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each token had an average of 5.63 candidates senses for annotators to choose from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>). In total, 1,065 unique annotators participated. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Not only does this weaken the commitment to a single cat- egorical meaning, but it also reduces concerns of annotators be- ing confused by overly fine-grain definitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Navigli, 2006</ref>).</p><p>Data validation Inter-annotator agreement was computed by lemma by taking the Jaccard index for each pair of annotators that judged the senses for that lemma: # of senses checked by both annotators # of senses checked by either annotator . The overall inter-annotator agreement using this measure was 0.592: this is reasonably high considering the ex- tremely low chance-level.</p><p>In total, 9,317 token-sense pairs were agreed upon by all annotators. We refer to these token-sense pairs as gold word sense(s) for the token. If we relax the agreement threshold for a token-sense pair to be gold to 0.5-i.e. half or more annotators agreed on that pair-the number of gold word sense(s) goes up to 27,326. Out of 18,054 individual arguments, 8,553 of them have a single gold word sense and 370 have two or more gold word senses as in the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Similarly, if we relax the agreement threshold down to 0.5, 9,656 arguments have a sin- gle gold word sense and 17,281 arguments have two or more gold word senses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have described the Universal Decompositional Semantics (Decomp) project, which aims to con- struct and deploy a set of cross-linguistically ro- bust semantic annotation protocols that are based in linguistic theory and that integrate seamlessly with the Universal Dependencies project. We then proposed Decomp-aligned protocols for three domains-semantic role decomposition, event de- composition, and word sense decomposition-and presented annotations, all freely available, that use these protocols and are constructed on top of the En- glish UD v1.2 treebank. In future work, we intend to further revise and extend these protocols as well as produce novel protocols aligned with Decomp.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Decompositional semantics atop syntax.</figDesc></figure>
