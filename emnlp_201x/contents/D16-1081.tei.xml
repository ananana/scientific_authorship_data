				<p>Chinese character riddle is a riddle game in which the riddle solution is a single Chi-nese character. It is closely connected with the shape, pronunciation or meaning of Chi-nese characters. The riddle description (sen-tence) is usually composed of phrases with rich linguistic phenomena (such as pun, simile , and metaphor), which are associated to different parts (namely radicals) of the solution character. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework to solve and generate Chinese character riddles. Specifically, we learn the alignments and rules to identify the metaphors between phrases in riddles and radicals in characters. Then, in the solving phase, we utilize a dynamic programming method to combine the identified metaphors to obtain candidate solutions. In the riddle generation phase, we use a template-based method and a replacement-based method to obtain candidate riddle descriptions. We then use Ranking SVM to rerank the candidates both in the solving and generation process. Experimental results in the solving task show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods. We also get very promising results in the generation task according to human judges.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The riddle is regarded as one of the most unique and vital elements in traditional Chinese culture, which is usually composed of a riddle description * The work was done when the first author and the third author were interns at Microsoft Research Asia. and a corresponding solution. The character rid- dle is one of the most popular forms of various rid- dles in which the riddle solution is a single Chinese character. While English words are strings of let- ters together, Chinese characters are composed of radicals that associate with meaning or metaphor. In other words, Chinese characters are usually posi- tioned into some common structures, such as upper- lower structure, left-right structure, inside-outside structure, which means they can be decomposed into other characters or radicals. For example, "好" (good), a character with left-right structure, can be decomposed into "女" (daughter) and "子" (son). As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(a), the left part of "好" is "女" and the right part is "子". "女" and "子" are called the "radical" of "好". One of the most important characteristics of char- acter riddle lies in the structure of Chinese charac- ters. Unlike the common riddles which imply the object in the riddle descriptions, character riddles pay more attention to structures such as combination of radicals and decomposition of characters. Ac- cording to these characteristics, metaphors in the 千 里 会 千 金 riddles always imply the radicals of characters.</p><p>We show an example of a Chinese character rid- dle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The riddle description is "千 里 会 千 金" and the riddle solution is "妈". In this exam- ple, "千 里" (thousand kilometer) aligns with "马" (horse) because in Chinese culture it is said that a good horse can run thousands of kilometers per day. Furthermore, "千 金" (thousand gold) aligns with "女" (daughter) because of the analogy that a daugh- ter is very important in the family. The final solution "妈" is composed of these two metaphors because the radical "女" meets the radical "马". Radicals can be derived not only from the meaning of metaphors, but also from the structure of characters. We will de- scribe the alignments and rules in detail in Section 3.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a statistical framework to solve and generate Chinese character riddles. We show our pipeline in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. First, we learn the common alignments and the combination rules from large riddle-solution pairs which are mined from the Web. The alignments and rules are used to identify the metaphors in the riddles. Second, in the solving phase, we utilize a dynamic programming algorithm on the basis of the alignments and rules to figure out the candidate solutions. For the generating phase, we use a template-based method and a replacement- based method based on the decomposition of the character to generate the candidate riddles. Finally, we employ Ranking SVM to rank the candidates in both the solving and generation task. We conduct the evaluation on 2,000 riddles in the riddle solving task and 100 Chinese characters in the riddle gener- ation task. Experimental results show that the pro- posed method outperforms baseline methods in the solving task. We also get very promising results in the generation task according to human judges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has studied on Chinese riddles. For other languages, there are a few approaches concentrated on solv- ing English riddles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pepicello and Green (1984)</ref> de- scribe the various strategies incorporated in riddles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(De Palma and Weiner, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Weiner and De Palma, 1993)</ref> use the knowledge representation system to solve English riddles that consist of a single sen- tence question followed by a single sentence an- swer. They propose to build the relation between the phonemic representation and their associated lexi- cal concepts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Binsted and Ritchie (1994)</ref> imple- ment a program JAPE which generates riddles from humour-independent lexical entries and evaluate the behaviour of the program by 120 children ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Binsted et al., 1997</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Olaosun and Faleye (2015)</ref> identify meaning construction strategies in selected English riddles in the web and account for the mental pro- cesses involved in their production, which shows that the meaning of a riddle is an imposed mean- ing that relates to the logical, experiential, linguistic, literary and intuitive judgments of the riddles. Be- sides, there are some studies in Yoruba <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akínyemí, 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akínyemí, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Magaji, 2014</ref>). All of these works focus on the semantic meaning, which is different from Chinese character riddles that focus on the structure of characters.</p><p>Another popular word game is Crossword Puzzles (CPs) that normally has the form of a square or rect- angular grid of white and black shaded squares. The white squares on the border of the grid or adjacent to the black ones are associated with clues. Compared with our riddle task, the clues in the CPs are derived from each question where the radicals in solution are derived from the metaphors in the riddles. Proverb ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Littman et al., 2002</ref>) is the first system for the au- tomatic resolution of CPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ernandes et al. (2005)</ref> utilize a web-search module to find sensible candi- dates to questions expressed in natural language and get the final answer by ranking the candidates. And the rule-based module and the dictionary module are mentioned in his work. The tree kernel is used to rerank the candidates proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barlacchi et al. (2014)</ref> for automatic resolution of crossword puz- zles.</p><p>From another perspective, there are a few projects</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Riddle Solving</head><p>Offline Learning</p><p>Riddle/Solution Pairs Phrase-Radical Alignment and Rule Learning Alignment  (2012) generate Chinese poems with the given topic words by combining a statistical machine translation model with an ancient poetic phrase taxonomy. Fol- lowing the approaches in SMT framework, it is valid to regard the metaphors with its radicals as the align- ments. There are several works using neural network to generate Chinese poems( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhang and Lapata, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yi et al., 2016</ref>). Due to the limited data and strict rules, it is hard to transfer to the riddle generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Phrase-Radical Alignments and Rules</head><p>The metaphor is one of the key components in both solving and generation. On the one hand we need to identify these metaphors since each of them aligns a radical in the final solution. On the other hand, we need to integrate these metaphors into the rid- dle descriptions to generate riddles. Thus, how to extract the metaphors of riddles becomes a big chal- lenge in our task. Below we introduce our method to extract the metaphors based on the phrase-radical alignments and rules. We exploit the phrase-radical alignments as to de- scribe the simple metaphors, e.g. "千 里" aligns "马", which aligns the phrase and the radical by the meaning. We employ a statistical framework with a word alignment algorithm to automatically mine phrase-radical metaphors from riddle dataset. Con- sidering the alignment is often represented as the matching between successive words in the riddle and a radical in the solution, we propose two methods specifically to extract alignments. The first method in according with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Och and Ney, 2003</ref>) is described as follows. With a riddle description q and corre- sponding solution s, we tokenize the input riddle q to character as (w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n ) and decompose the solution s into radicals as (r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r m ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">We count all ([w i , w j ], r k )(i, j ∈ [1, n], k ∈ [1, m])</formula><p>as alignments. The second method takes into ac- count more structural information of characters. Let (w 1 , w 2 ) denote two successive characters in the rid- dle q. If w 1 is a radical of w 2 and the rest parts of w 2 as r appear in the solution q, we strongly sup- port that ((w 1 , w 2 ), r) is a alignment. It is identical if w 2 is a radical of w 1 . We count all alignments and filter out the alignments whose occurrence number is lower than 3. Some high-frequency alignments are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. For example, "四方"(square) aligns "口"(mouth) because of the similar shape and "二十载"(two decades) aligns "艹"(grass) because "艹" looks like two small "十"s.</p><p>Besides alignments are represented as common collocations, there is another kind of common metaphors concentrating on the structure of char- acters. We define 6 categories of rules shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> to identify this kind of metaphors. A LeftRemove remove the left-side radical of the matched placeholder</p></div>

For example, the character "上" (up) is usu- ally represented as an operation to get the upper radical of the corresponding character. We extract the rules from the phrase-radical alignments we just obtain. In a phrase-radical alignment, if a radi- cal appears in the one part of a character, we sup- port that this radical is derived from this charac- ter, which means the other words in the phrase may describe an operation to this character. We replace this radical to a placeholder and generate a candidate rule with the corresponding direction by the radical position in this character. Thus, for each phrase-radical alignment ([w 1 , w n ], r), we count (w 1 , . . . , w i−1 , (.), w i+1 , . . . , w n ) as a poten- tial rule only if r is a radical of w i . We count all rules learned from data, and filter out the rules whose oc- currence number is lower than 5. Some rules are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The word or phrase in the rule "A-B" mostly has the analogous meaning of "re- moving". The word or phrase in the rule "Half" mostly has the analogous meaning of "half". As for the rules "LeftRemove", "RightRemove", "Up- perRemove" and "LowerRemove", there are usually a word or phrase that means "removing" as well as the others mean the "position" and "direction". We mine 14,090 phrase-radical alignments in to- tal. More than 1,000 Chinese characters have at least one alignment, and there are 27 characters with more than 100 alignments. Common radicals are almost all contained in our alignments set. Chinese char- acter is mostly composed of these common radical, so these alignments are enough for our task. We ex- tract 193 rules in total for all categories of rules, all of them are applied to the riddle solving and the rid- dle generation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(.)[字]0,1[左西] (.)[character](0,1)[left,west]</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Solving Chinese Character Riddles</head><p>The process of solving riddles has two components. First, we identify the metaphors in the riddle as much as possible by matching the phrase-radical alignments and rules, and integrate these metaphors to obtain a candidate set of solutions. Each candi- date contains the corresponding parsing clues that imply how and why it is generated as its features. Second, we employ a ranking model to determine the best solution as output. Below we introduce our method to generate solution candidates, and we will R S A F Path <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref> -&gt; 山</p></div>

It is common that two metaphors do not share a character and the metaphor is composed of succes- sive characters. Therefore, we utilize a dynamic pro- gramming algorithm based on the CYK algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kasami, 1965)</ref> to identify the metaphors with the help of the learned alignments and the predefined rules. We describe the algorithm in Algorithm 1.</p><p>An example to illustrate our algorithm is "上 岗 必 戴 安 全 帽", where the corresponding solution is "密". As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, "上 岗"(on sentry) aligns "山" by matching the rule "上(up) (.)" which means to take the upper part of the character "岗". "必" and "戴" aligns itself. And the phrase "安 全 帽"(safety helmet) aligns to the radical "宀" by the alignments because of the analogical shape. Our ranking model will get the final solution "密" by these clues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Generating Chinese Character Riddles</head><p>Two major components are required in the process of riddle generation. The first step is to generate a list of candidates of riddle descriptions for a Chi- nese character as the solution. The second step is to rank the candidate riddle descriptions and select the top-N (e.g. 10) candidates as the output. Below we Algorithm 1: Candidate generation for riddle solving Input : Riddle q, Alignment, Rule Output: Path <ref type="bibr">[1,n]</ref> 1 Tokenize the input riddle q to w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n ; 2 for len ← 0 to n − 1 do introduce our method to generate candidates of rid- dle descriptions, and we will introduce the ranking model in Section 4.3.</p><p>We propose two strategies to generate the candi- date riddle descriptions for a given Chinese charac- ter, called the template-based method and the re- placement based-method, respectively. First we show our template-based method to generate rid- dles. The most natural method is to connect the metaphor of each radical. For a character and its possible splitting RD = rd i , we select a correspond- ing metaphor by the alignment or rule, and then we connect all metaphor without any other conjunction words to form a riddle. The further method is to add a few conjunction words between each metaphor, which can make the riddle more coherent. We re- move the recognized metaphors in riddle sentences, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correct Radical number of radicals matched Missing Radical number of radicals not matched Disappearing Radical number of radicals that disappear in all characters of riddle descriptions Single Matching number of clues derived from character itself Alignment Matching number of clues derived from alignments Rule Matching number of clues derived from rules Length Rate</head><p>ratio of the length of clues Frequency prior probability of this character as a solution  and count the unigram and bigram word frequency of the rest words. These words are usually common conjunctions. We sample these words based on the frequency distribution and add them into the riddles to connect the metaphor of each radical. Second, we use an alternative replacement-based method to generate the candidate riddle descriptions. Instead of generating the riddle descriptions totally from scratch, we try to replacement part of an ex- isting riddle to generate a new riddle description. Let w = (w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n ) denote the word se- quence of a riddle description on our dataset, where n denotes the length of the riddle in character. Let [w i , w j ] (i,j ∈ [1,n]) denote the word span that can be aligned to a radical rd, and let X=(x 1 , . . . , x m ) denotes the corresponding phrase descriptions of rd. We then replace [w i , w j ] ∈ X with the other alter- native phrases descriptions of rd in X. We try all the possible replacements to generate riddle candidates. This method can generate candidate riddles that are more natural and fluent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ranking Model</head><p>Above we introduce the algorithm to solve and gen- erate candidates, respectively. Then, we develop a ranking model to determine the final output. Below we show the ranking model.</p><p>The ranking score is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Score(c) = m i=1 λ i * g i (c)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where c represents a candidate, g i (c) represents the i-th feature in the ranking model, m represents the number of features in total, and λ i represents the weight of the feature. The features of riddle solving and riddle generation are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3 and Table 4</ref>, re- spectively. We use Ranking SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Joachims, 2006)</ref> 1 to do the model training to get the feature weights. The weights of the features are trained with riddle- solution pairs. Specifically, in the riddle solving task, for the set of solution candidates, we hold that the original solution as the positive sample and oth- ers are the negative samples. Using the dynamic programming algorithm to obtain a list of solution candidates, the training process try to optimize the feature weights so that the ranking score of the orig- inal solution is greater than any of the ones from the candidate list. In the riddle generation task, we se- lect 100 characters on the basis of the frequency dis- tribution of characters as a solution. For each char- acter we use the riddle generation module to gener- ate a list of riddle candidates. And we label these candidates manually where the better riddle descrip- tions get the higher score. Then the training process optimizes the feature weights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Dataset</head><p>We crawl 77,308 character riddles including riddle descriptions with its solution from the Web. All of these riddle-solution pairs concentrate on the struc- ture of characters. A stroke table, that contains 3,755 characters en- coded in the first level of GB2312-80, is provided to describe how a Chinese character is decomposed into its corresponding radicals. Characters may have more than one splitting forms and a character is typ- ically composed of no more than 3 radicals.</p><p>The data for training language model in riddle style include two parts: One is the corpus of rid- dles mentioned above, and the other is a corpus of Chinese poem and Chinese couplets because of the similar language style. We follow the method that proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(He et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhou et al., 2009)</ref>, to download the &lt;Tang Poems&gt;,&lt;Song Poems&gt;, &lt;Ming Poems&gt;, &lt;Qing Poems&gt;, &lt;Tai Poems&gt; from the Internet, and use the method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fan et al. (2007)</ref> to recursively mine those data with the help of some seed poems and couplets. It amounts to more than 3,500,000 sentences and 670,000 couplets. Besides the language model trained in riddle style, we also train a general lan- guage model with the web documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluation on Riddle Solving</head><p>We randomly select 2,000 riddles from the riddle dataset as the test data, and 500 riddles as the de- velopment data, while the rest as training data.</p><p>Our system always returns a ranking list of candi- date solutions, so we use the Acc@k (k = 1, 5, 10) as the evaluation metric. The Acc@k is the fraction of questions which obtain correct answers in their top-k results.</p><p>Giza++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Och, 2001</ref>) is a common tool to extract   the alignment between bilingual corpuses. We use it as our baseline system that extracts the alignments automatically. And we use the Jaccard similarity co- efficient as the baseline ranking metric. The Jaccard similarity coefficient is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">J(A, B) = A B A B (2)</formula><p>where A means the radicals set of the solution and B means the radicals set of the candidate.</p><p>The results are reported in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> and Ta- ble 6. The baseline method can only give about one-tenth correct solution at the Acc@1. Compared with the baseline model, by using the alignments extracted by our method, the system can improve 6.7% at the Acc@1 and 6.3% at Acc@10. A phe- nomenon is that only using the alignments we ex- tract has the better results than combining it with the alignments from Giza++ because metaphors match- ing between phrases and characters are particular in our riddle task. Small changes in the phrase can affect the character that it implies and it may be not a metaphor even if a character in phrase is changed. Furthermore, by using rules to identify the metaphors in riddles, we get an improvement of 10.1% at Acc@1, which proves the validity of the Score <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Criterion  5  Elegant metaphors, totally coherent  4  Correct metaphors, mostly coherent  3  Acceptable metaphors, more of less coherent  2  Tolerable metaphors, little coherent  1</ref> Wrong metaphors, incoherent rule we define. The results prove that it is valid to use the alignments and rules that we extract to iden- tify the metaphors in our character riddle task. The comparison between Jaccard similarity coefficient and our Ranking SVM method shows that the Rank- ing SVM is better with an improvement of 2.6% at Acc@1, which prove that compared to the Jaccard similarity coefficient, the Ranking SVM determine the solution more correct if we successfully iden- tify all metaphors in riddle descriptions. Moreover, there is less improvement beyond Acc@5, which means the ranking model gets better results even if the system cannot identify all metaphors in riddle descriptions. We think that unlike the Jaccard sim- ilarity coefficient which only uses the features be- tween the candidate character and the correct solu- tion, the ranking model uses extra features in the riddles descriptions, e.g. the number of disappear- ing radicals, which helps to exclude obvious wrong candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Evaluation on Riddle Generation</head><p>Because there is no previous work about Chinese riddle generation, in order to prove its soundness, we conduct human evaluations on this task in accor- dance with the following two reasons. Firstly, the generated riddles, which is different from the certain and unique solution in the riddle solving task, are varied. So it is hard to measure the quality of gen- erated riddles with a well defined answer set. Sec- ondly, small differences in riddles have a great effect on the corresponding solution. It may imply distinct radicals even if only a character in the metaphors is changed. The existing metrics such as BLEU, are not suitable for our task. Based on above analysis, each riddle that the system generates is evaluated by human annotators according to a 5 division criterion described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref>.</p><p>We randomly sample 100 characters following the distribution of the character as a solution.

Some- times the riddles we generate exist in our training data. We remove these riddles for the reason that we want to evaluate the ability of generating new riddles. In order to avoid the influence of annota- tors and compare the riddles generated by the sys- tem with the riddles written by human beings, the riddles are randomly disordered so that the annota- tors do not know the generating method of each rid- dle. For each character, we select 5 riddles generated by the template-base method, 5 riddles generated by the replacement-based method, and 2 riddles from the riddles dataset written by human beings, which form a set of 12 riddles in total.

We consider that the replacement-based method retains some human in- formation, which makes the generated riddles more coherent.</p><p>Another result is that the riddle whose solution is a common character or is composed of common radicals gets the higher score, which is explicit that we can get the better results if we have the more alternative metaphors of a radical.</p><p>Below we show two examples of the riddle de- scriptions generated with the solution "思"(miss) which often decompose into "田"(field) and "心"(heart) shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b).</p><p>• 三 星 伴 月 似 画 里 (Three stars with the moon, like in the picture): The radical "田" is the inside part of "画". The shape of "心" is three points and a curved line, which looks like three stars around a crescent.</p><p>• 日 日 相 系 在 心 头 (Every day in my heart):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>853</head><p>The radical "田" is composed of two "日"s, and "心" occurs in the riddle description. The char- acter "头"(top) means the radical "田" is on the top position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We introduce a novel approach to solving and gen- erating Chinese character riddles. We extract align- ments and rules to capture the metaphors of phrases in riddle descriptions and radicals in the solution characters. In total, we obtain 14,090 alignments that imply the metaphors between phrases and rad- icals as well as 193 rules in 6 categories formed as regular expressions. To solve riddles, we utilize a dynamic programming algorithm to combine the identified metaphors based on the alignments and rules to obtain the candidate solutions. To gener- ate riddles, we propose a template-based method and a replacement-based method to generate candidate riddle descriptions. We employ the Ranking SVM to rank the candidates on both the riddle solving and generation. Our method outperforms baseline meth- ods in the solving task. We also get promising re- sults in the generation task by human evaluation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (Figure 1 :</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Examples of the structure of Chinese characters</figDesc></figure>
