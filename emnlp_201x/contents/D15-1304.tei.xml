				<p>Sentiment analysis has been a major area of interest, for which the existence of high-quality resources is crucial. In Arabic, there is a reasonable number of sentiment lexicons but with major deficiencies. The paper presents a large-scale Standard Ara-bic Sentiment Lexicon (SLSA) that is publicly available for free and avoids the deficiencies in the current resources. SLSA has the highest up-to-date reported coverage. The construction of SLSA is based on linking the lexicon of AraMorph with Sen-tiWordNet along with a few heuristics and powerful back-off. SLSA shows a relative improvement of 37.8% over a state-of-the-art lexicon when tested for accuracy. It also outperforms it by an absolute 3.5% of F1-score when tested for sentiment analysis .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and extracting subjective information using Nat- ural Language Processing (NLP). It helps identi- fying opinions and extracting relevant information that lies behind the analyzed data. Sentiment anal- ysis has received enormous interest in NLP, and in particular in the context of web content. This includes social media, blogs, discussions, reviews and advertisement.</p><p>While there has been extensive work on senti- ment analysis in English and other languages of interest, less work has been done for Arabic. A major concern in Arabic NLP is the morphological complexity of the language along with the limited number of resources, corpora in particular.</p><p>The goal of this work is to build a publicly available large-scale Sentiment Lexicon for Stan- dard Arabic (SLSA). For every lemma and part- of-speech (POS) combination that exists in a large Standard Arabic lexicon, SLSA assigns the scores of three sentiment labels: positive, negative and objective, in addition to the English gloss. The positive and negative scores range between zero and one, while the objective score is defined as 1 - (positive score + negative score).</p><p>The existence of SLSA is valuable to the field of Arabic sentiment analysis, which is expected to receive considerable focus during the current decade. SLSA is the first sentiment lexicon for Arabic to combine the following four strengths. High coverage SLSA lists the sentiment of about 35,000 lemma and POS combinations, which is the highest coverage reported for Standard Arabic sentiment lexicons. High quality Unlike many of the current lexicons whose construction is based on semi-supervised learning and heuristic-based approaches, SLSA is not constructed via machine learning models, while the use of heuristics is minimal. Richness As opposed to sparse surface-based lex- icons, SLSA is a lemma-based resource that at- taches POS and English gloss information to each lemma, where the information of a lemma is appli- cable to its inflected forms. This makes the lexicon more useful when used by other research. Public Availability SLSA is based on free re- sources and is publicly available for free. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Work on building Arabic sentiment lexicons mainly falls into two categories: 1) linking an Ara- bic sentiment lexicon with an English one, and 2) applying semi-supervised or supervised learning techniques on Arabic resources. We summarize these two types in turn.</p><p>We start with a survey of work based on trans- lation, which our work falls into as well. The most similar work to the one presented in this paper is ArSenL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Badaro et al., 2014</ref>). ArSenL is considered the first publicly available large- scale Standard Arabic sentiment lexicon. It was constructed using a combination of SentiWordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baccianella et al., 2010)</ref>, Arabic WordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Black et al., 2006</ref>) and SAMA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graff et al., 2009)</ref>. Ar-SenL outperforms the state-of-the-art Arabic sen- timent lexicons. However, we show that SLSA has better coverage and quality. Moreover, Ar- SenL uses SAMA which is not publicly available for free, as opposed to SLSA which is based on free resources.</p><p>Another similar work to ArSenL is the resource developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alhazmi et al. (2013)</ref>. They linked the Arabic WordNet to SentiWordNet via the pro- vided synset offset information. However, the con- structed lexicon has a limited coverage of nearly 10K lemmas, which makes it not very useful for further applications.</p><p>Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2014) presented SANA, a subjectivity and sentiment lexicon for Arabic. The lexicon combines pre-existing lexi- cons and involves automatic machine translation, manual annotations and gloss matching across several resources such as THARWA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Diab et al., 2014</ref>) and SAMA. SANA includes about 225K entries, where many of them are duplicates, in- flected or not diacritized, which makes the re- source noisy and less useable. Additionally, the automatic translation does not utilize the POS in- formation, which affects the quality of the re- source.</p><p>Other work that follows the translation ap- proach includes the one presented by El-Halees (2011) where SentiStrength ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Thelwall et al., 2010</ref>) was translated using a dictionary along with man- ual correction. Another instance is SIFAAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012)</ref>, an earlier ver- sion of SANA but with more reliance on transla- tion. Another lexicon was built by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Elarnaoty et al. (2012)</ref> who manually translated the MPQA lex- icon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wilson et al., 2005</ref>). The common aspect among those resources is the lack of adequate cov- erage and quality.</p><p>Mobarz et al. (2011) created a sentiment Ara- bic lexical Semantic Database (SentiRDI) by us- ing a dictionary-based approach. The database has many inflected forms, i.e., it is not lemma-based. Moreover, the authors reported insufficient quality and plan to try other alternatives.</p><p>We now turn to work based entirely on Arabic resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mahyoub et al. (2014)</ref> created an Ara- bic sentiment lexicon that assigns sentiment scores to the words in Arabic WordNet using a lexicon- based approach. The lexicon was initially based on a few words and then expanded by exploit- ing synset relations in a semi-supervised learning manner. However, the lexicon is limited to about 23k lemmas and is not publicly available.</p><p>Another Arabic sentiment lexicon was created by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Elhawary and Elfeky (2010)</ref>. The lexicon was built using a similarity graph where the edges have similarity scores. A major drawback is the low coverage of the lexicon. Moreover, expanding the graph requires a huge corpus with polarity and se- mantic annotations and adds more sparsity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head><p>Following the example of ArSenL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Badaro et al., 2014</ref>), SLSA is constructed by linking the lexicon of an Arabic morphological analyzer with Senti- WordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baccianella et al., 2010)</ref>. Unlike Ar- SenL, SLSA uses AraMorph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buckwalter, 2004</ref>), a morphological analyzer for Standard Arabic. An AraMorph entry represents a morpheme and con- tains the surface, lemma, part of speech (POS), and gloss information. The gloss information consists of a list of gloss terms, each of which contains one or more words (such as "time limit / end"). On the other side, SentiWordNet is a large-scale sentiment lexicon for English that as- signs sentiment scores (positive, negative and ob- jective) to the synsets in English WordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Miller et al., 1990</ref>) along with the POS and gloss infor- mation. Upon linking the two resources, the sen- timent scores in SentiWordNet are applied to the entries of AraMorph to construct SLSA. The ques- tion this paper addresses is how to link these two resources, and we present a new linking algorithm compared to that used by ArSenL, with improved performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preparing the Resources</head><p>It might seem intuitive to join the entries of AraMorph and SentiWordNet based on their glosses, but this does not work as expected. AraMorph and SentiWordNet were developed for different reasons and have different gloss struc- tures (synonyms in AraMorph versus detailed de- scriptions in SentiWordNet). Mapping the glosses is one of the major bottlenecks in ArSenL, which is not able to find a match for 24% of the en- tries in SAMA. Instead, we link the two resources by relating the glosses of AraMorph to the synset terms in SentiWordNet. Additionally, we take POS into consideration as the glosses and synset terms might not be enough to disambiguate an en- try. Next, we discuss the preparation steps that al- low for the linking of the resources.</p><p>Cleaning-up AraMorph Some POS and lemma decisions in AraMorph are erroneous or not optimal. For example, some entries are as- signed wrong POS tags, such as the NO FUNC cases, or have inconsistent spellings of the lem- mas. Also, some adverbs are redundant as they have the same lemma as an adjective. Accord- ingly, we cleaned up AraMorph in a way that al- lows for a better linking with SentiWordNet. The cleaned-up AraMorph is closer to SAMA (used in ArSenL), which is itself a modified version of AraMorph. Practically, SAMA can replace AraMorph. However, the integration of AraMorph allows the lexicon to be publicly available for free, which SAMA prohibits.</p><p>Gloss Normalization Since the entries in AraMorph are bound to stems, the English glosses are inflected for number. As a result, we lem- matize the English glosses in AraMorph in or- der to be able to match to the synset terms in SentiWordNet. The lemmatization is done using Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Manning et al., 2014</ref>). Additionally, we remove from the glosses any descriptive text be- tween parentheses, as well as the stop words be, a, an and the (unless be is the actual lemma of the AraMorph gloss). Moreover, if any of the lemma- tized words in an AraMorph gloss does not match any of the synset terms in SentiWordNet and has a regular morphological derivation, the effect of the derivation is removed if the removal results in an existing synset term, e.g., voluntariness is con- verted to voluntary and orientalization becomes orientalize. We created the list of the deriva- tional patterns manually by examining AraMorph glosses.</p><p>POS Mapping AraMorph has a rich POS tagset, while SentiWordNet has only four tags corresponding to nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs. Accordingly, AraMorph POS tags are mapped to the four tags in SentiWordNet. Some AraMorph POS types, such as particles, pronouns and prepositions, do not map to any SentiWord- Net tags, and we exclude them as they have zero polarity scores, by definition.</p><p>AraMorph Rearrangement We collapse all the entries in AraMorph that have the same (lemma, POS) pair, and the English glosses become the union of the normalized glosses before the collapse. For example, a lemma might appear in two entries with two POS tags; VERB PERFECT and VERB IMPERFECT . Af- ter the preparation, the POS tags in both entries become the same (VERB), and the two entries col- lapse into one entry whose gloss is the union of the lemmatized past-tense and present-tense glosses. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a sample of AraMorph before and after the preparation process (the Arabic translit- eration is in the Buckwalter scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buckwalter, 2004)</ref>).</p><p>SentiWordNet Rearrangement We extract all the unique combinations of synset terms and POS tags in SentiWordNet, while the indices of the synset terms are stripped off. However, since a synset term might appear in different synsets un- der the same POS with different indices and sen- timent scores, the sentiment scores of an extracted entry is calculated as the average of all the sen- timent scores that appear with the corresponding synset term and POS. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows a sample of SentiWordNet before and after the preparation process.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Linking the Resources</head><p>We start out by creating a link between an AraMorph entry and a SentiWordNet entry if any of the AraMorph one-word gloss terms and the POS match the SentiWordNet. Upon linking, we assign the AraMorph entry the sentiment scores of the matching one in SentiWordNet. The linking condition above applies successfully to 83.6% of the entries in AraMorph. If the condition does not apply, we relax it to allow for a more le- nient POS agreement where NOUN and ADJ POS tags are used interchangeably, while the VERB entries in AraMorph become matchable with the ADJ ones in SentiWordNet. The reasons be- hind the decisions above are that AraMorph has hundreds of cases where the same lemma ap- pears as NOUN and ADJ, while it is frequent that AraMorph assigns an adjectival gloss (preceded by be) to VERB entries. The relaxed condition enables linking an additional 6.7% of AraMorph entries. If the relaxed condition is still not appli- cable for an AraMorph entry, the linking condi- tion becomes more lenient by completely ignoring the POS agreement. The sentiment scores in that case become the average of the sentiment scores of the corresponding synset term across all the POS types. The latter condition allows matching addi- tional 0.6% of AraMorph entries.</p><p>It might happen that none of the one-word gloss terms matches a synset term, or the gloss does not have any one-word gloss terms. In such a case, we consider multi-word gloss terms. We first re- move the stop words, and then we test the relaxed condition on each word separately, starting with the shortest terms first. The process succeeds if a match could be established for all the words in a gloss term, and the sentiment scores become the average sentiment scores of the matching synset terms. The relaxed condition on multi-word terms solves additional 7.9% of the cases. Finally, if no match could be established across all the differ- ent gloss terms (1.2% of the entries), default neu- tral sentiment scores are assigned. The analysis of such cases is discussed in section 4.</p><p>Sometimes, a multi-word gloss term consists of words that denote excess (e.g., most and more), scarcity (e.g., less and few) or negation (e.g., not). We do not match such words to synset terms. In- stead, they affect the polarity scores; we double the score, halve the score and swap the sign, re- spectively. We created the list of such words man- ually by examining AraMorph glosses.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, while examples from the final lexicon are listed in   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Intrinsic Evaluation</head><p>As mentioned in section 3, no match could be es- tablished for 1.2% of AraMorph entries. We man- ually investigate these cases more closely. About 75% of the entries that are not covered in SLSA have lemmas that express Arabic or Islamic sub- jects that do not have English counterparts such as hamozap (an Arabic name) and kunAfap (an Ara- bic food). Another 5% of the cases are countries or nationalities that are not listed in SentiWord- Net such as EAjiy (Ivorian). Additional 2% of the cases are due to misspelled or non-English glosses in AraMorph such as bon appetit. The remaining cases (around 18%) have glosses that do not match any of the synset terms in SentiWordNet.</p><p>We then conduct an intrinsic evaluation of SLSA where the performance is compared to that of ArSenL, which is the most similar state-of-the- art lexicon (see Section 2). First, we randomly select 400 (lemma, POS) pairs for the evaluation. Only four pairs (1%) are not covered in SLSA. On the other side, 103 pairs (26%) are absent in Ar- SenL, which is consistent with the claim of the authors of ArSenL that only 76% of SAMA en- tries are matched in SentiWordNet. We then eval- uate the random entries that exist in both SLSA and ArSenL (297 entries). We ask human anno-tators to judge the correctness of the values in the two lexicons. ArSenL may have several sentiment values for the same entry, each with its own confi- dence score, so we used the sentiment values with the highest confidence score (averaged in the case of multiple answers). Since judging the values as real numbers is hard for humans, we map the senti- ment scores into three classes of intensity (zero, up to 0.55 and above 0.55). An entry is correct only if the values of the positive and negative polarity classes are both correct. Each entry was judged by two annotators (without knowing its origin). They had to discuss and come to an agreement in the cases of disagreement (about 15% of the cases). SLSA and ArSenL have the exact same scores in 58.2% of the cases, which increases to 83.5% when mapping to the intensity classes. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> lists the accuracy of a majority baseline (neutral), SLSA and ArSenL for the different POS types 2 . SLSA gives error reductions of 58.7% and 37.8% over the baseline and ArSenL, respectively. About 93% of SLSA errors are cases where the sentiment scores are doubtful in SentiWordNet, while the other errors are due to incorrect glosses in AraMorph. It might happen that an AraMorph entry is incorrectly linked to a SentiWordNet entry causing an error, but we do not see this in any of the manually analyzed data.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Accuracy results of a majority baseline (neutral), SLSA and ArSenL, evaluated on a test set that is covered in both SLSA and ArSenL</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Extrinsic Evaluation</head><p>We conduct an extrinsic evaluation of SLSA on the task of sentiment analysis where a subjective sentence is classified to be either positive or nega- tive. The performance is compared to that of Ar- SenL. We use an evaluation setup similar to the one described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Badaro et al., 2014</ref>) using the corpus developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abdul-Mageed et al. (2011)</ref>. The corpus involves 400 documents from the Penn Arabic Treebank (part 1 version 3) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Maamouri et al., 2004</ref>) where the sentences are tagged as objective, subjective-positive, subjective-negative and subjective-neutral. The evaluation only in- volves the sentences tagged as subjective-positive and subjective-negative. Random 80% of the sen- tences are used for training, while the rest are left for testing. We train a Support Vector Machines classifier, through LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), using sentence vectors of three features representing the averages of the positive scores, negative scores and objective scores of the non-stop words in the sentence divided by the count of the underlying words. The scores are obtained by querying the lexicon using the lemma and POS information.</p><p>We optimize the classification to obtain the best F1-score based on five-fold cross validation on the training set using different SVM kernels and parameters. Polynomial kernels give the best weighted-average F1-score 3 of 68.6% (us- ing SLSA), which is an absolute 0.2% improve- ment over linear kernels. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> lists the preci- sion, recall and F1-score of a majority baseline (subjective-negative), SLSA and ArSenL. SLSA provides absolute weighted-average F1-score im- provements of 22.9% and 3.5% over the baseline and ArSenL, respectively.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Sentiment analysis results of a majority baseline (subjective-negative), SLSA and ArSenL</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have presented a publicly available large-scale Standard Arabic Sentiment Lexicon (SLSA) that avoids the deficiencies in the current lexicons. The construction of SLSA is based on linking the lex- icon of AraMorph with SentiWordNet along with a few heuristics and powerful back-off. SLSA has the highest up-to-date reported coverage. SLSA shows a relative improvement of 37.8% over a state-of-the-art lexicon when tested for accuracy. It also outperforms it by an absolute 3.5% of F1- score when tested for sentiment analysis. The future plans include manually correcting SLSA to reach a nearly 100% accuracy. Addi- tionally, the work will be extended to the Arabic dialects for which AraMorph-like morphological analyzers are available. We also plan to study the cases where English and Arabic translations have different sentiments due to cultural differences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A sample of the original AraMorph (the upper table) and the processed version (the lower table).
