				<p>Learning to determine when the time-varying facts of a Knowledge Base (KB) have to be updated is a challenging task. We propose to learn state changing verbs from Wikipedia edit history. When a state-changing event, such as a marriage or death, happens to an entity, the in-fobox on the entity&apos;s Wikipedia page usually gets updated. At the same time, the article text may be updated with verbs either being added or deleted to reflect the changes made to the infobox. We use Wikipedia edit history to distantly supervise a method for automatically learning verbs and state changes. Additionally, our method uses constraints to effectively map verbs to infobox changes. We observe in our experiments that when state-changing verbs are added or deleted from an en-tity&apos;s Wikipedia page text, we can predict the entity&apos;s infobox updates with 88% precision and 76% recall. One compelling application of our verbs is to incorporate them as triggers in methods for updating existing KBs, which are currently mostly static.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Extracting relational facts between entities and storing them in knowledge bases <ref type="bibr">(KBs)</ref> has been a topic of active research in recent years. The result- ing KBs are generally static and are not updated as the facts change ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Suchanek et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Carlson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fader et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mitchell et al., 2015)</ref>. One possible approach to updating KBs is to extract facts from dynamic Web content such as news <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Nakashole and Weikum, 2012)</ref>. In this paper, we propose to predict state changes caused by verbs acting on entities in text. This is differ- ent from simply applying the same text extraction pipeline, that created the original KB, to dynamic Web content.</p><p>In particular, our approach has the following ad- vantages: (1) Consider for example the SPOUSE relation, both marry and divorce are good patterns for extracting this relation. In our work, we wish to learn that they cause different state changes. Thus, we can update the entity's fact and its tem- poral scope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Wijaya et al., 2014a)</ref>. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2)</ref> Learning state changing verbs can pave the way for learn- ing the ordering of verbs in terms of their pre-and post-conditions.</p><p>Our approach learns state changing verbs from Wikipedia revision history. In particular, we seek to establish a correspondence between infobox ed- its and verbs edits in the same article. The infobox of a Wikipedia article is a structured box that sum- marizes an entity as a set of facts (attribute-value pairs) . Our assumption is that when a state- changing event happens to an entity e.g., a mar- riage, its Wikipedia infobox is updated by adding a new SPOUSE value. At approximately the same time, the article text might be updated with verbs that express the event, e.g., X is now married to Y. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is an example of an infobox of an entity changing at the same time as the article's main text to reflect a marriage event.</p><p>Wikipedia revision history of many articles can act as distant supervision data for learning the cor- respondence between text and infobox changes. However, these revisions are very noisy. Many in- fobox slots can be updated when a single event happens. For example, when a death happens, slots regarding birth e.g., birthdate, birthplace, may also be updated or added if they were miss- ing before. Therefore, our method has to handle these sources of noise. We leverage logical con- straints to rule out meaningless mappings between infobox and text changes. In summary, our contributions are as follows: (1) we present an algorithm that uses Wikipedia edit histories as distantly labeled data to learn which verbs result in which state changes to en- tities, and experimentally demonstrate its success, (2) we make available this set of distantly la- beled training data on our website 1 , and (3) we also make available our learned mappings from verbs to state changes, as a resource for other re- searchers, on the same website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data Construction</head><p>We construct a dataset from Wikipedia edit histo- ries of person entities whose facts change between the year 2007 and 2012 (i.e., have at least one fact in YAGO KB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Suchanek et al., 2007</ref>) with a start or end time in this period). We obtain Wikipedia URLs of this set of entities P from YAGO and crawl their article's revision history. Given a per- son p, his/her Wikipedia revision history R p has a set of ordered dates T p on which revisions are made to his/her Wikipedia page (we consider date granularity). Each revision r p,t ∈ R p is his/her Wikipedia page at date t where t ∈ T p .</p><p>Each Wikipedia revision r p,t is a set of infobox slots S p,t and textual content C p,t . Each infobox slot s ∈ S p,t is a quadruple, s att , s value , s start , s end containing the attribute name (non-empty), the attribute value, and the start and end time for 1 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ dwijaya/postcondition.html which this attribute-value pair holds in reality.</p><p>A document d p,t in our data set is the difference 2 between any two consecutive revisions separated by more than 24 hours i.e., d p,t = r p,t+2 − r p,t , where r p,t+2 is the first revision on date t + 2 and r p,t is the last revision on date t (as a page can be revised many times in a day).</p><p>A document d p,t is therefore a set of infobox changes ∆S p,t and textual changes ∆C p,t . Each slot change δs ∈ ∆S p,t = s att , δs value , δs start , δs end is prefixed with + or − to indicate whether they are added or deleted in r p,t+2 . Similarly, each text change δc ∈ ∆C p,t is prefixed with + or − to indicate whether they are added or deleted.</p><p>For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, a docu- ment d kim, 05/23/2014 = r kim,05/25/2014 − r kim,05/23/2014 is a set of slot changes: SPOUSE, +"Kanye West", +"2014", " ", PARTNER, −"Kanye West", −"2012-present; engaged", " " and a set of text changes: +"Kardashian and West were married in May 2014", −"She began dating West", −"they became engaged in October 2013".</p><p>For each d p,t , we use ∆S p,t to label the docu- ment and ∆C p,t to extract features for the docu- ment. We label d p,t that has a new value or start time added to its infobox: s att , +δs value , * , * * ∈ ∆S p,t or s att , * , +δs start , * * ∈ ∆S p,t with the la- bel begin-s att and label d p,t that has a new end time added to its infobox: s att , * , * , +δs end ∈ ∆S p,t with the label end-s att .</p><p>The label represents the state change that happens in d p,t . For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, d kim, 05/23/2014 is labeled with begin-spouse.</p><p>The revision history dataset that we make avail- able for future research consists of all documents d p,t , labeled and unlabeled, ∀t ∈ T p , t ∈ [01/ <ref type="bibr">01/2007, 12/31/2012]</ref>, and ∀p ∈ P ; a to- tal of 288,184 documents from revision histories of 16,909 Wikipedia entities. Using our labeling process, we find that out of 288,184 documents, only 41,139 have labels (i.e., have their infobox updated with new values/start/end time). The dis- tribution of labels in the dataset is skewed towards birth and death events as these are life events that happen to almost all person entities in Wikipedia. The distribution of labels in the dataset that we re- lease can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. We show only labels that we evaluate in our task.</p><p>For our task of learning state changing verbs from this revision history dataset, for each la- beled d p,t , we extract as features, verbs (or verbs+prepositions) v ∈ ∆C p,t of which its sub- ject (or object) matches the Wikipedia entity p and its object (or subject resp.) matches an in- fobox value, start or end time: (v subject , v object ) = (arg1, arg2) or (v subject , v object ) = (arg2, arg1), where arg1= p and s att ,arg2, * , * * or s att , * ,arg2, * * or s att , * , * ,arg2 ∈ ∆S p,t . We use Stanford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) to dependency parse sentences and extract the subjects and ob- jects of verbs. We find that 27,044 out of the 41,139 labeled documents contain verb edits, but only 4,735 contain verb edits with two arguments, where one argument matches the entity and an- other matches the value of the infobox change. We use the latter for our task, to improve the chance that the verb edits used as features are related to the infobox change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Model</head><p>We use a Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) clas- sifier 3 given a set of training data = {(v d , y)} where</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v d = (v 1 , v 2 , ... v |V | ) ∈ R |V | is the |V |- dimensional representation of a labeled document d</formula><p>where V is the set of all verbs in our training data, and y is the label of d as defined in 2.1.</p><p>These training documents are used to estimate a set of weight vectors w = {w 1 , w 2 , ... w |Y | }, w y ∈ R |V | , one for each label y ∈ Y , the set of all labels in our training data. The classifier can then be applied to classify an unlabeled document d u using:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(y|v du ) = exp(w y · v du ) y exp(w y · v du )<label>(1)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Feature Selection using Constraints</head><p>While feature weights from the MAXENT model allow us to identify verbs that are good features for predicting a particular state change label, our distantly supervised training data is inherently noisy. Changes to multiple infoboxes can hap- pen within our revision. We therefore utilize con- straints among state changes to select consistent verb features for each type of state change.</p><p>We use two types of constraints: (1) mutual ex- clusion (Mutex) which indicate that mutex state changes do not happen at the same time e.g., up- date on birthdate should not typically happen with update on deathcause. Hence, their state changing verbs should be different. (2) Simultaneous (Sim) constraints which indicate that simultaneous state changes should typically happen at the same time e.g., update on birthdate should typically happen with other birth-related updates such as birthplace, birthname, etc. We manually specified these two types of constraints to all pairs infoboxes where they apply. We have 10 mutex constraints and 23 simultaneously updated constraints. The full list of constraints can be found in our website.</p><p>Given a set of constraints, a set of labels Y , and a set of base verbs 4 B in our training data, we solve a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) for each base verb b ∈ B to estimate whether b should be a feature for state change y ∈ Y .</p><p>We obtain label membership probabilities {P (y|b) = count(y, b)/ y count(y , b)} from our training data. The MIP takes the scores P (y|b) and constraints as input and produces a bit vector of labels a b as output, each bit a y b ∈ {0, 1} repre- sents whether or not b should be a feature for y.</p><p>The MIP formulation for a base verb b is pre- sented by Equation 2. For each b, this method tries to maximize the sum of scores of selected labels, after penalizing for violation of label constraints. Let ζ y,y be slack variables for Sim constraints, and ξ y,y be slack variables for Mutex constraints.   <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Distribution of labels we evaluate in our task in the revision history dataset.</p><p>Solving MIP per base verb is fast; we reduce the number of labels considered per base verb i.e., we only consider a label y to be a candidate for b if  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∃ v i ∈ V s.t.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>We use 90% of our labeled documents that have verb edits as features (section 2.1) as training data and test on the remaining 10%. Since revision his- tory data is noisy, we manually go through our test data to discard documents that have incorrect in- fobox labels by looking the text that changed. The task is to predict for each document (revision), the label (infobox slot change) of the document given its verbs features. We compute precision, recall, and F1 values of our predictions and compare the values before and after feature selection <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the task to learn state-changing verbs in terms of states defined in existing knowledge bases and learning it from Wikipedia edit histories is novel. There is no pre- vious approach that can be used as baseline; there- fore we have compared our structured prediction using MIP and MAXENT with a majority class baseline. Both our approaches (MAXENT and MAXENT + MIP) perform better than the majority class baseline <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>We observe the value of doing feature selec- tion by asserting constraints in an MIP formula- tion. Feature selection improves precision; re- sulting in a better F1. By asserting constraints, some of the inconsistent verb features for the la-Label Verb begin- +(arg1) die on (arg2), +(arg1) die (arg2), deathdate +(arg1) pass on (arg2) begin- +(arg1) be born in (arg2), +(arg1) bear in (arg2), birthplace +(arg1) be born at (arg2) begin- +(arg1) succeed (arg2), +(arg1) replace (arg2), predecessor +(arg1) join cabinet as (arg2), +(arg1) join as (arg2) begin- +(arg1) lose seat to (arg2), +(arg1) resign on (arg2), successor +(arg1) resign from post on (arg2) begin- +(arg1) be appointed on (arg2), +(arg1) serve from (arg2), termstart +(arg1) be elected on (arg2) begin- +(arg1) marry on (arg2), +(arg1) marry (arg2), spouse +(arg1) be married on (arg2), -(arg1) be engaged to (arg2) end-spouse +(arg1) file for divorce in (arg2), +(arg1) die on (arg2), +(arg1) divorce in (arg2) begin- +(arg1) start career with (arg2), youthclubs +(arg1) begin career with (arg2), +(arg1) start with (arg2) <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Comparison of verb phrases learned be- fore and after feature selection for various labels (infobox types).

For example, before feature selection, the verbs: "marry", and "be married to" were high-weighted features for both begin- spouse and end-spouse. After asserting constraints that begin-spouse is mutex with end-spouse, these verbs (whose base form is "marry") are filtered out from the features of end-spouse. We show some of the learned verb features (after feature selection) for some of the labels in <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. In average, we have about 18 verbs per infobox state change in our state changing verb resource that we make available for future research.</p></div>

A popular task in this re- gard is that of Wikipedia edit history categoriza- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2013)</ref>. This task involves characterizing a given edit instance as one of many possible categories such as spelling error correction, paraphrasing, vandalism, and textual entailment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Nelken and Yamangil, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cahill et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Recasens et al., 2013)</ref>. Prior methods target various tasks different from ours. Learning State Changing Verbs. Very few works have studied the problem of learning state changing verbs. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hosseini et al., 2014</ref>) learned state changing verbs in the context of solving arithmetic word problems. They learned the effect of words such as add, subtract on the current state.</p><p>The VerbOcean resource was automatically gener- ated from the Web ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chklovski and Pantel, 2004</ref>). The authors studied the problem of fine-grained semantic relationships between verbs. They learn relations such as if someone has bought an item, they may sell it at a later time. This then involves capturing empirical regularities such as "X buys Y" happens before "X sells Y". Unlike the work we present here, the methods of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chklovski and Pantel, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hosseini et al., 2014</ref>) do not make a connection to KB relations such as Wikipedia in- foboxes. In a vision paper, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Wijaya et al., 2014b)</ref> give high level descriptions of a number of possi- ble methods for learning state changing methods. They did not implement any of them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we presented a method that learns state changing verb phrases from Wikipedia revi- sion history. We first constructed and curated a novel dataset from Wikipedia revision history that is tailored to our task. We showed that this dataset is useful for learning verb phrase features that are effective for predicting state changes in the knowl- edge base (KB), where we considered the KB to be infoboxes and their values. As future work we wish to explore the usefulness of our verb resource to other KBs to improve KB freshness. This is im- portant because existing KBs are mostly static. We wish to also explore the application of the learned verb resource to domains other than Wikipedia in- fobox and text e.g., for predicting state changes in the knowledge base from news text.</p><p>In this paper, we learned post-conditions of verbs: state changes that occur when an event ex- pressed by a verb happens. As future work we would also explore the feasibility of learning pre- conditions of verbs from Wikipedia revisions. Ad- ditionally, most Wikipedia revisions only have text changes without the associated infobox change. Therefore, another line of future work is to also learn from these unlabeled documents.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A snapshot of Kim Kardashian's Wikipedia revision history, highlighting text and infobox changes.
