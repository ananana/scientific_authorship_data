				<p>Word-sense recognition and disambigua-tion (WERD) is the task of identifying word phrases and their senses in natural language text. Though it is well understood how to disambiguate noun phrases, this task is much less studied for verbs and verbal phrases. We present Werdy, a framework for WERD with particular focus on verbs and verbal phrases. Our framework first identifies multi-word expressions based on the syntactic structure of the sentence; this allows us to recognize both contiguous and non-contiguous phrases. We then generate a list of candidate senses for each word or phrase, using novel syntactic and semantic pruning techniques. We also construct and leverage a new resource of pairs of senses for verbs and their object arguments. Finally, we feed the so-obtained candidate senses into standard word-sense disambiguation (WSD) methods, and boost their precision and recall. Our experiments indicate that Werdy significantly increases the performance of existing WSD methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Understanding the semantics of words and multi- word expressions in natural language text is an important task for automatic knowledge acquisi- tion. It serves as a fundamental building block in a wide area of applications, including semantic parsing, question answering, paraphrasing, knowl- edge base construction, etc. In this paper, we study the task of word-sense recognition and dis- ambiguation (WERD) with a focus on verbs and verbal phrases. Verbs are the central element in a sentence, and the key to understand the relations between sets of entities expressed in a sentence.</p><p>We propose Werdy, a method to (i) automati- cally recognize in natural language text both sin- gle words and multi-word phrases that match en- tries in a lexical knowledge base (KB) like Word- Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>, and (ii) disambiguate these words or phrases by identifying their senses in the KB. WordNet is a comprehensive lexical resource for word-sense disambiguation (WSD), covering nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and many multi- word expressions. In the following, the notion of an entry refers to a word or phrase in the KB, whereas a sense denotes the lexical synset of the entry's meaning in the given sentence.</p><p>A key challenge for recognizing KB entries in natural language text is that entries often consist of multiple words. In WordNet-3.0 more than 40% of the entries are multi-word. Such entries are challenging to recognize accurately for two main reasons: First, the components of multi-word en- tries in the KB (such as fiscal year) often consist of components that are themselves KB entries (fis- cal and year). Second, multi-word entries (such as take a breath) may not appear consecutively in a sentence ("He takes a deep breath."). Werdy addresses the latter problem by (conceptually) matching the syntactic structure of the KB entries to the syntactic structure of the input sentence. To address the former problem, Werdy identifies all possible entries in a sentence and passes them to the disambiguation phase (take, breath, take a breath, . . . ); the disambiguation phase provides more information about which multi-word entries to keep. Thus, our method solves the recognition and the disambiguation tasks jointly.</p><p>Once KB entries have been identified, Werdy disambiguates each entry against its possible senses. State-of-the-art methods for WSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Navigli, 2009</ref>) work fairly well for nouns and noun phrases. However, the disambiguation of verbs and verbal phrases has received much less atten- tion in the literature.</p><p>WSD methods can be roughly categorized into (i) methods that are based on supervised training over sense-annotated corpora (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhong and Ng (2010)</ref>), and (ii) methods that harness KB's to as- sess the semantic relatedness among word senses for mapping entries to senses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ponzetto and Navigli (2010)</ref>). For these methods, mapping verbs to senses is a difficult task since verbs tend to have more senses than nouns. In WordNet, in- cluding monosemous words, there are on average 1.24 senses per noun and 2.17 per verb.</p><p>To disambiguate verbs and verbal phrases, Werdy proceeds in multiple steps. First, Werdy obtains the set of candidate senses for each recog- nized entry from the KB. Second, it reduces the set of candidate entries using novel syntactic and semantic pruning techniques. The key insight be- hind our syntactic pruning is that each verb sense tends to occur in a only limited number of syn- tactic patterns. For example, the sentence "Al- bert Einstein remained in Princeton" has a sub- ject ("Albert Einstein"), a verb ("remained") and an adverbial ("in Princeton"), it follows an SVA clause pattern. We can thus safely prune verb senses that do not match the syntactic structure of the sentence. Moreover, each verb sense is com- patible with only a limited number of semantic argument types (such as location, river, person, musician, etc); this phenomena is called selec- tional preference or selectional restriction. Senses that are compatible only with argument types not present in the sentence can be pruned. Our prun- ing steps are based on the idea that a verb selects the categories of its arguments both syntactically (c-selection) and semantically (s-selection). In the final step, Werdy employs a state-of-the-art gen- eral WSD method to select the most suitable sense from the remaining candidates. Since incorrect senses have already been greatly pruned, this step significantly gains accuracy and efficiency over standard WSD.</p><p>Our semantic pruning technique builds on a newly created resource of pairs of senses for verbs and their object arguments. For example, the WordNet verb sense play-1 (i.e., the 1st sense of the verb entry "play") selects as direct object the noun sense sport-1. We refer to this novel re- source as the VO Sense Repository, or VOS repos- itory for short. 1 It is constructed from the Word- Net gloss-tags corpus, the SemCor dataset, and a small set of manually created VO sense pairs.</p><p>We evaluated Werdy on the SemEval-2007 coarse-grained WSD task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Navigli et al., 2007)</ref>, both with and without automatic recognition of en- tries. We found that our techniques boost state-of- the-art WSD methods and obtain high-quality re- sults. Werdy significantly increases the precision and recall of the best performing baselines.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of Werdy compo- nents. Section 3 presents the entry recognition, and Sections 4 and 5 discuss our novel syntac- tic and semantic pruning techniques. Section 6 presents the Semantic VO Repository and how we constructed it. Section 7 gives the results of our evaluation. Section 8 discusses related work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview of Werdy</head><p>Werdy consists of four steps: (i) entry recognition, (ii) syntactic pruning, (iii) semantic pruning, and (iv) word-sense disambiguation. The novel con- tribution of this paper is in the first three steps, and in the construction of the VO sense repository. Each of these steps operates on the clause level, i.e., we first determine the set of clauses present in the input sentence and then process clauses sep- arately. A clause is a part of a sentence that ex- presses some statement or coherent piece of infor- mation. Clauses are thus suitable minimal units for automatic text understanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013)</ref>; see Sec.3 for details.</p><p>In the entry-recognition step (Sec. 3), Werdy obtains for the input sentence a set of potential KB entries along with their part-of-speech tags. The candidate senses of each entry are obtained from WordNet. For instance, in the sentence "He takes a deep and long breath", the set of potential entries includes take (verb, 44 candidate senses), take a breath (verb, 1 candidate sense), and breath (noun, 5 candidate senses). Note that in contrast to Werdy, most existing word-sense disambiguation methods assume that entries have already been (correctly) identified.</p><p>In the syntactic-pruning step (Sec. 4), we elim- inate candidate senses that do not agree with the syntactic structure of the clause. It is well- established that the syntactic realization of a clause is intrinsically related with the sense of its verb <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Quirk et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hanks, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker et al., 1998;</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Quirk et al. (1985)</ref> identified seven possible clause types in the English language (such as "subject verb adverbial", SVA). We make use of techniques inspired by Del <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Corro and Gemulla (2013)</ref> to iden- tify the clause type of each clause in the sen- tence. We then match the clause type with the set of WordNet frames (e.g., "somebody verb some- thing") that WordNet provides for each verb sense, and prune verb senses for which there is no match.</p><p>In the semantic-pruning step (Sec. 5), we fur- ther prune the set of candidate senses by taking the semantic types of direct objects into account. Sim- ilarly to the syntactic relation mentioned above, a verb sense also imposes a (selectional) restric- tion on the semantic type of its arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Quirk et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hanks, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker et al., 1998;</ref>). For instance, the verb play with sense participate in games or sports requires an object argument of type game-1 2 , game-3, or sport-1. Senses that do not match the arguments found in the clause are pruned. This step is based on the newly constructed VOS Repository (Sec. 6). Note that when there is no di- rect object, only the syntactic pruning step applies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Entry Recognition</head><p>The key challenge in recognizing lexical KB en- tries in text is that entries are not restricted to sin- gle words. In addition to named entities (such as people, places, etc.), KB's contain multi-word ex- pressions. For example, WordNet-3.0 contains en- tries such as take place (verb), let down (verb), take into account (verb), be born (verb), high school (noun), fiscal year (noun), and Prime Min- ister (noun). Note that each individual word in a multi-word entry is usually also an entry by itself, and can even be part of several multi-word en- tries. To ensure correct disambiguation, all poten- tial multi-word entries need to be recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Finlayson and Kulkarni, 2011</ref>), even when they do not appear as consecutive words in a sentence.</p><p>Werdy addresses these challenges by explor- ing the syntactic structure of both the input sen- <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We use the notation WordNet entry-sense number. tence and the lexical KB entries. The structure of the sentence is captured in a dependency parse (DP). Given a word in a sentence, Werdy con- ceptually generates all subtrees of the DP starting at that word, and matches them against the KB. This process can be performed efficiently as Word- Net entries are short and can be indexed appro- priately. To match the individual words of a sen- tence against the words of a KB entry, we follow the standard approach and perform lemmatization and stemming <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Finlayson, 2014)</ref>. To further han- dle personal pronouns and possessives, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arranz et al. (2005)</ref> and normalize personal pro- nouns (I, you, my, your, . . . ) to one's, and reflex- ive pronouns (myself, yourself, . . . ) to oneself.</p><p>Consider the example sentence "He takes my hand and a deep breath". We first identify the clauses and their DP's ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) using the method of Del <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Corro and Gemulla (2013)</ref>, which also processes coordinating conjunctions. We obtain clauses "He takes my hand" and "He takes a deep breath", which we process separately. To obtain possible entries for the first clause, we start with its head word (take) and incrementally consider its descendants (take hand, take one's hand, . . . ). The exploration is terminated as early as possible; for example, we do not consider take one's hand because there is no WordNet entry that contains both take and hand. For the second clause, we start with take (found in WordNet), then expand to take breath (not found but can occur together), then take a breath (found), then take a deep breath (not found, cannot occur together) and so on.</p><p>Note that the word "take" in the sentence re- fer to two different entries and senses: "take" for the first clause and "take a breath" for the sec- ond clause. In this stage no decisions are made about selecting entries and disambiguating them; these decisions are made in the final WSD stage of Werdy.</p><p>We tested Werdy's entry-recognizer on the SemEval-2007 corpus. We detected the correct en-  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Clause types and examples of matching WordNet frames tries for all but two verbs (out of more than 400). The two missed entries (take up and get rolling) resulted from incorrect dependency parses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Syntactic Pruning</head><p>Once the KB entries have been recognized, Werdy prunes the set of possible senses of each verb entry by considering the syntactic structure of the clause in which the entry occurs. This pruning is based on the observation that each verb sense may occur only in a limited number of "clause types", each having specific semantic functions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Quirk et al., 1985)</ref>. When the clause type of the sentence is incompatible with a candidate sense of an entry, this sense is eliminated. Werdy first detects in the input sentence the set of clauses and their constituents. A clause con- sists of one subject (S), one verb (V), and option- ally an indirect object (O), a direct object (O), a complement (C) and one or more adverbials (A). Not all combinations of clause constituents ap- pear in the English language. When we classify clauses according to the grammatical function of their constituents, we obtain only seven different clause types <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Quirk et al., 1985)</ref>; see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For example, the sentence "He takes my hand" is of type SVO; here "He" is the subject, "takes" the verb, and "my hand" the object. The clause type can (in principle) be determined by observing the verb type and its complementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, consider the SVA clause "The stu- dent remained in Princeton". The verb remain has four senses in WN: (1) stay the same; remain in a certain state (e.g., "The dress remained wet"), (2) continue in a place, position, or situation ("He remained dean for another year"), (3) be left; of persons, questions, problems ("There remains the question of who pulled the trigger") or (4) stay be- hind ("The hostility remained long after they made up"). The first sense of remain requires an SVC pattern; the other cases require either SV or SVA. Our example clause is of type SVA so that we can safely prune the first sense.</p><p>WordNet provides an important resource for ob- taining the set of clause types that are compatible with each sense of a verb. In particular, each verb sense in WordNet is annotated with a set of frames (e.g., "somebody verb something") in which they may occur, capturing both syntactic and semantic constraints. There are 35 different frames in to- tal. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We manually assigned a set of clause types to each frame (e.g., SVO to frame "somebody verb something"). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows an example frame for each of the seven clause types. On average, each WordNet-3.0 verb sense is associated with 1.57 frames; the maximum number of frames per sense is 9. The distribution of frames is highly skewed: More than 61% of the 21,649 frame annotations belong to one of four simple SVO frames (num- bers 8, 9, 10 and 11), and 22 out of the 35 frames have less than 100 instances. This skew makes the syntactic pruning step effective for non-SVO clauses, but less effective for SVO clauses.</p><p>Werdy directly determines a set of possible frame types for each clause of the input sentence. Our approach is based on the clause-type detection method of Del Corro and Gemulla (2013), but we also consider additional information that is cap- tured in frames but not in clause types. For ex- ample, we distinguish different realizations of ob- jects (such as clausal objects from non-clausal ob- jects), which are not captured in the clause type. Given the DP of a clause, Werdy identifies the  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Flow chart for frame detection set of WN frames that can potentially match the clause as outlined in the flowchart of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Werdy walks through the flowchart; for each question, we check for the presence or absence of a specific constituent of a clause (e.g., a direct object for Q 1 ) and proceed appropriately until we obtain a set of possible frames. This set is further reduced by considering additional information in the frames (not shown; e.g., that the verb must end on "-ing").</p><p>For our example clause "The student remained in Princeton", we first identify possible frames { 1, 2, 12, 13, 22, 27 } using the flowchart (Q 1 no, Q 2 no, Q 3 yes); using the additional information in the frames, Werdy then further prunes this set to { 1, 2, 22 }. The corresponding set of remaining candidate sense for remain is as given above, i.e., { remain-2, remain-3, remain-4 }.</p><p>Our mapping of clause types to WordNet frames is judiciously designed for the way WordNet is or- ganized. For instance, frames containing adver- bials generally do not specify whether or not the adverbial is obligatory; here we are conservative in that we do not prune such frames if the input clause does not contain an adverbial. As another example, some frames overlap or subsume each other; e.g, frame "somebody verb something" (8) subsumes "somebody verb that clause" <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. In some word senses annotated with the more general frame, the more specific one can also apply (e.g., point out-1 is annotated with 8 but not 26; 26 can apply), in others it does not (e.g., play-1 is also annotated with 8 but not 26; but here 26 can- not apply). To ensure the effectiveness of syntactic pruning, we only consider the frames that are di- rectly specified in WordNet. This procedure often produces the desired results; in a few cases, how- ever, we do prune the correct sense (e.g., frame 26 for clause "He points out that . . . ").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Semantic Pruning</head><p>A verb sense imposes a restriction on the semantic type of the arguments it may take and vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Quirk et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hanks, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kipper et al., 2008)</ref>. This allows us to further prune the verb candidate set by discarding verb senses whose se- mantic argument is not present in the clause.</p><p>WordNet frames potentially allow a shallow type pruning based on the semantics provided for the clause constituents. However we could solely distinguish people ("somebody") from things ("something"), which is too crude to obtain sub- stantial pruning effects. Moreover, this distinction is sometimes ambiguous.</p><p>Instead, we have developed a more powerful approach to semantic pruning based on our VOS repository. We remove from the verb candidate set those senses whose semantic argument cannot be present in the sentence. For instance, consider the clause "The man plays football." Suppose that we know that the verb entry play with sense play- 1 ("participate in sports") takes an object of type sport-1; i.e., we have a tuple play-1, sport-1 in our repository. Then, we check whether any of the possible senses of football-(i) sport or (ii) ball-is of type sport-1. Here the first sense has the correct type (the second sense does not); thus we retain play-1 as a possible sense for the verb entry play. Next, suppose that we consider sense play-3 ("play on an instrument"), which accord- ing to our corpus takes instrument-6 as argument (i.e., there is a tuple play-3, instrument-6 in our VOS repository). Since none of the senses of foot- ball is of type instrument-6, we can safely drop play-3 from our candidate set. We perform this procedure for every verb sense in the candidate set.</p><p>Semantic pruning makes use of both VOS repository and the hypernym structure of the noun senses in WordNet. For each sentence, we obtain the possible senses of the direct-object argument of the verb. We then consider each candidate sense of the verb (e.g., play-1), and check whether any of its compatible object-argument senses (from our repository) is a hypernym of any of the possi- ble senses of its actual object argument (in the sen- tence); e.g., sport-1 is a hypernym of football- 1. If so, we retain the verb's candidate sense. If not, either the candidate sense of the verb is in- deed incompatible with the object argument in the sentence, or our repository is incomplete. To han- dle incompleteness to some extent, we also con- sider hyponyms of the object-argument senses in our repository; e.g., if we observe object sport in a sentence and have verb-sense argument football- 1 in our corpus, we consider this a match. If the hyponyms lead to a match, we retain the verb's candidate sense; otherwise, we discard it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Verb-Object Sense Repository</head><p>We use three different methods to construct the repository. In particular, we harness the sense- annotated WordNet glosses 4 as well as the sense- annotated SemCor corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Landes et al., 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The major part of the VOS repository was ac- quired from WordNet's gloss tags. According to <ref type="bibr">Atkins and Rundell (2008)</ref>, noun definitions should be expressed in terms of the class to which they belong, and verb definitions should refer to the types of the subjects or objects related to the action. Based on this rationale, we extracted all noun senses that appear in the gloss of each verb sense; each of these noun senses is treated as a possible sense of the object argument of the cor- responding verb sense. For example, the gloss of play-1 is "participate in games or sports;" each noun is annotated with its senses (2 and 3 for "games", 1 for "sports"). We extract tuples play- 1, game-2, play-1, game-3, and play-1, sport- 1 from this gloss. Note that we only extract direct-object arguments, i.e., we do not consider the type of the subject argument of a verb sense. Since the constituents of the predicate are much more important than the subject to determine or describe a verb sense, lexical resources rarely con- tain information on the subject <ref type="bibr">(Atkins and Rundell, 2008</ref>). Similarly, WordNet glosses typically do not provide any information about adverbials. Overall, we collected arguments for 8,657 verb senses (out of WordNet's 13,767 verb senses) and a total of 13,050 verb-#, object-#-pairs.</p><p>We leveraged the sense-annotated SemCor cor- pus to further extend our VOS repository. We parsed each sentence in the corpus to obtain the respective pairs of verb sense and object sense. Since sentences are often more specific than glosses, and thus less helpful for construct- ing our repository, we generalized the so-found object senses using a heuristic method. In particu- lar, we first obtained all the object senses of each verb sense, and then repeatedly generalized sets of at least two senses that share a direct hypernym to this hypernym. The rationale is that we only want to generalize if we have some evidence that a more general sense may apply; we thus require at least two hyponyms before we generalize. Us- ing this method, we collected arguments for 1,516 verb senses and a total of 4,131 sense pairs. Finally, we noticed that the most frequent senses used in the English language are usually so general that their glosses do not contain any relevant semantic argument. For instance, one of the most frequent verbs is see-1, which has gloss "perceive by sight-3". The correct semantic ar- gument entity-1 is so general that it is omitted from the gloss. In fact, our gloss-tag extractor generates tuple see-1, sight-3, which is incorrect. We thus manually annotated the 30 most frequent verb senses with their object argument types.</p><p>Our final repository contains arguments for 9,335 verb senses and a total of 17,181 pairs. Pairs from SemCor tend to be more specific because they refer to text occurrences. The assumption of taking the nouns of the glosses as arguments seems to be mostly correct, although some errors may be introduced. Consider the pair play-28, stream- 2 extracted from the gloss "discharge or direct or be discharged or directed as if in a continu- ous stream-2". Also, in some cases, the glosses may refer to adverbials as in play-14, location-1, taken from gloss "perform on a certain location- 1". Note that if an argument is missing from our repository, we may prune the correct sense of the verb. If, however, there is an additional, incorrect argument in the repository, the correct verb sense is retained but pruning may be less effective.</p></div>

Each entry is assigned the sense with highest term overlap between the en- try's context (words in the sentence) and both the sense's gloss <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000</ref>) as well as the glosses of its neighbors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003)</ref>. A sense is output only if the overlap exceeds some threshold; we used thresholds in the range of 1-20 in our experi- ments. There are many subtleties and details in the implementation of SimpleExtLesk so we used two different libraries: a Java implementation of WordNet::Similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pedersen et al., 2004</ref>), <ref type="bibr">8</ref> which we modified to accept a context string, and DKPro-WSD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miller et al., 2013</ref>) version 1.1.0, with lemmatization, removal of stop words, paired overlap enabled and normalization disabled.</p><p>Degree Centrality. Proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Navigli and Lapata (2010)</ref>. The method collects all paths con- necting each candidate sense of an entry to the set of candidate senses of the words the entry's con- text. The candidate sense with the highest degree in the resulting subgraph is selected. We imple- mented this algorithm using the Neo4j library. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We used a fixed threshold of 1 and vary the search depth in range 1-20. We used the candidate senses of all nouns and verbs in a sentence as context.</p><p>It-Makes-Sense (IMS). A state-of-the-art, pub- licly available supervised system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhong and Ng, 2010</ref>) and a refined version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chan et al. (2007)</ref>, which ranked first in the SemEval-2007 coarse grained task. We modified the code to accept KB entries and their candidate senses. We tested both in WordNet-2.1 and 3.0; for the later we mapped Werdy's set of candidates to WordNet-2.1.</p><p>Most Frequent Sense (MFS). Selects the most frequent sense (according to WordNet frequen- cies) among the set of candidate senses of an en- try. If there is a tie, we do not label. Note that this procedure differs slightly from the standard of picking the entry with the smallest sense id. We do not follow this approach since it cannot handle well overlapping entries.</p><p>MFS back-off. When one of the above meth- ods fails to provide a sense label (or provides more than one), we used the MFS method above with a threshold of 1. This procedure increased the per- formance in all cases.</p><p>Methodology. The disambiguation was per- formed with respect to coarse-grained sense clus- ters. The score of a cluster is the sum of the indi- vidual scores of its senses (except for IMS which provides only one answer per word); the cluster with the highest score was selected. Our source code and the results of our evaluation are publicly available <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . The SemEval-2007 task was not designed for automatic entry recognition, for each word or multi-word expression it provides the WordNet entry and the POS tag. We proceeded as follows to handle multi-word entries. In the WSD step, we considered the candidate senses of all recognized entries that overlap with the gold entry. For exam- ple, we considered the candidate senses of entries take, breath, and take a breath for gold entry take a breath.</p><p>The SemEval-2007 task uses WordNet-2.1 but Werdy uses WordNet-3.0. We mapped both the sense keys and clusters from WordNet-2.1 to WordNet-3.0. All senses in WordNet-3.0 that could not be mapped to any cluster were consider to belong each of them to a single sense cluster. Note that this procedure is fair: for such senses  the disambiguation is equivalent to a fine-grained disambiguation, which is harder.</p><note type="other">Algorithm Gold Pruning MFS threshold Verbs (clause heads) F1 Entry back-</note><p>Results. Our results are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>We ran each algorithm with the gold KB entries provided by in the dataset (+ in column "gold en- try) as well as the entries obtained by our method of Sec. 3 (-). We also enabled (+) and disabled (-) the pruning steps as well as the MFS back-off strategy. The highest F1 score was achieved by SimpleExtLesk (DKPro) with pruning and MFS back-off: 81.18 with gold entries and 78.52 with automatic entry recognition. In all cases, our syn- tactic and semantic pruning strategy increased per- formance (up to +10.85 F1 points). We next dis- cuss the impact of the various steps of Werdy in detail.</p><p>Detailed Analysis. When no gold entries were provided, perfor- mance dropped due to the increase of sense can- didates for multi-word expressions, which include the possible senses of the expression itself as well as the senses of the entry's parts that are them-  Step-by-step results selves WordNet entries. Our entry recognizer tends to do a good job since it managed to cor- rectly identify all the relevant entries except in two cases (i.e. "take up" and "get rolling"), in which the dependency parse was incorrect. The drop in F1 for our automatic entry recognition was mainly due to incorrect selection of the correct entry of a set of alternative, overlapping entries. Syntactic pruning did not prune the correct sense in most cases. In 16 cases (with gold en- tries), however, the correct sense was pruned. Five of these senses were pruned due to incorrect de- pendency parses, which led to incorrect frame identification. In two cases, the sense was not annotated with the recognized frame in WordNet, although it seemed adequate. In the remaining cases, a general frame from WordNet was incor- rectly omitted. Improvements to WordNet's frame annotations may thus make syntactic pruning even more effective.</p><p>Semantic pruning also improves performance. Here the correct sense was pruned for 11 verbs, mainly due to the noisiness and incompleteness of our VOS repository. Without using gold en- tries, we found in total 237 semantic matches be- tween possible verbs senses and possible object senses (200 with gold entries). We also found that our manual annotations in the VOS repository (see Sec. 6) did not affect our experiments.</p><p>The results show that syntactic and semantic pruning are beneficial for verb sense disambigua- tion, but also stress the necessity to improve ex- isting resources. Ideally, each verb sense would be annotated with both the possible clause types or syntactic patterns in which it can occur as well as the possible senses of its objects. Annotations for subjects and adverbial arguments may also be beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Related Work</head><p>WSD is a classification task where for every word there is a set of possible senses given by some ex- ternal resource (as a KB). Two types of methods can be distinguished in WSD. Supervised systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dang and Palmer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dligach and Palmer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Palmer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhong and Ng, 2010)</ref> use a classifier to assign senses to words, mostly relying on manually annotated data for training. In principle, these systems suffer from low coverage since the training data is usually sparse. Some authors have tried to overcome this limitation by exploiting linked resources as train- ing data <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cholakov et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>The second WSD approach corresponds to the so-called KB methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agirre and Soroa, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Miller et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agirre et al., 2014</ref>). They rely on a back- ground KB (typically WordNet or extended ver- sions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012)</ref>), where related senses appear close to each other. KB-based al- gorithms often differ in the way the KB is ex- plored. It has been shown that a key point to en- hance performance is the amount of semantic in- formation in the KB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Miller et al., 2012)</ref>. Our framework fits this line of work since it is also unsupervised and enriches the background knowledge in order to enhance perfor- mance of standard WSD algorithms. A compre- hensive overview of WSD systems can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Navigli (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Navigli (2012)</ref>.</p><p>To bring WSD to real-world applications, the mapping between text and KB entries is a funda- mental first step. It has been pointed that the ex- istence of multi-word expressions imposes multi- ple challenges to text understanding tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sag et al., 2002</ref>). The problem has been addressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arranz et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Finlayson and Kulkarni (2011)</ref>. They find multi-word entries by match- ing word sequences allowing some morphological and POS variations according to predefined pat- terns. Our method differs in that we can recognize KB entries that appear discontinuously and in that we do not select the correct entry but generate a set of potential entries.</p><p>Linguists have noted the link between verb senses and the syntactic structure and argument types <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Quirk et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hanks, 1996)</ref>, and supervised WSD systems were devel- oped to capture this relation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dang and Palmer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Palmer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dligach and Palmer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cholakov et al., 2014)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dang and Palmer (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Palmer (2009)</ref>, it is shown that WSD tasks can be improved with features that capture the syntactic structure and in- formation about verb arguments and their types. They use features as shallow named entity recog- nition and the hypernyms of the possible senses of the noun arguments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dang and Palmer (2005)</ref> also included features extracted from PropBank ( ) from role labels and frames. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dligach and Palmer (2008)</ref> generated a corpus of verb and their arguments (both surface forms), which was used to incorporate a semantic feature to the supervised system.</p><p>In our work, we also incorporate syntactic and semantic information. Instead of learning the re- lation between the verb senses and the syntactic structure, however we incorporate it explicitly us- ing the WordNet frames, which provide informa- tion about which verb sense should be consider for a given syntactic pattern. We also incorporate explicitly the semantic relation between each verb sense and its arguments using our VOS repository.</p><p>Different resources of semantic arguments for automatic text understanding tasks have been con- structed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kipper et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nakashole et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Flati and Navigli, 2013</ref>). In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kipper et al., 2008;</ref>, the classifica- tion of verbs and arguments is focused toward se- mantic or thematic roles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nakashole et al. (2012)</ref> uses semantic types to construct a taxonomy of bi- nary relations and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Flati and Navigli (2013)</ref> col- lected semantic arguments for given textual ex- pressions. For instance, given the verb "break", they extract a pattern "break body part-1". In contrast to existing resources, our VOS repository disambiguates both the verb sense and the senses of its arguments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>We presented Werdy, a framework for word-sense recognition and disambiguation with a particular focus on verbs and verbal phrases. Our results indicate that incorporating syntactic and seman- tic constraints improves the performance of verb sense disambiguation methods.
