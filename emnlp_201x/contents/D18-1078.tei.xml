			<abstract>
				<p>This paper presents a task for machine listening comprehension in the argumentation domain and a corresponding dataset in English. We recorded 200 spontaneous speeches arguing for or against 50 controversial topics. For each speech, we formulated a question, aimed at confirming or rejecting the occurrence of potential arguments in the speech. Labels were collected by listening to the speech and marking which arguments were mentioned by the speaker. We applied baseline methods addressing the task, to be used as a benchmark for future work over this dataset. All data used in this work is freely available for research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is the NLP task equivalent to reading comprehension tests that assess the understanding of written texts by humans. MRC is usually realized as a ques- tion answering (QA) task through multiple-choice questions or as a cloze test ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Richardson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hill et al., 2015)</ref>. With the abundance of multimedia content nowa- days, this line of work has been extended to speech, by applying QA methods to speech tran- scripts, i.e. the output of automatic speech recog- nition (ASR). In such works, the task is conse- quently referred to as 'spoken question answer- ing' ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2018</ref>), 'question answering over speech transcripts' ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Turmo et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lamel et al., 2008)</ref> or machine listening comprehension (MLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chung and Glass, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>We continue this line of work, and present a lis- tening comprehension task and associated bench- mark data over argumentative content. In the argu- mentation domain, such as political debates, peo- ple are often exposed directly to the audio (or * * This work was done at IBM within Project Debater; the first 3 authors equally contributed to this work. the video), without access to a written version. Human comprehension is then done in real-time through listening. We simulate this scenario in our dataset. Namely, annotation is carried out by lis- tening to debate speeches rather than by reading transcripts as done in prior work. The auditory modality is richer than written text in terms of the signal available to listeners, e.g., prosody. Simi- larly, machine comprehension can make use of the extra-lexical signal. The dataset we construct and release enables utilizing such signals, as done for instance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lippi and Torroni, 2016</ref>) for detecting claims in debates.</p><p>Most often, in both reading and listening com- prehension tasks, the answer is explicitly men- tioned in the text; frequently, the answer is even an actual segment of the text, as in SQuAD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>, one of the most popular MRC datasets. Conversely, in argumentation, presuppo- sitions are fundamental ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Habernal et al., 2018)</ref>, in- ferences are more subtle and the answer may rely on common knowledge. Going beyond the fac- toid level, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tseng et al. (2016)</ref> presented a listening comprehension task over TOEFL listening tests. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In comparison, our data consists of spontaneous speech and is not adapted for non-native speakers.</p><p>We use data from iDebate 2 , a high-quality, cu- rated database of controversial topics -referred to as "motions", as in formal parliamentary propos- als -with a list of arguments for and against each motion. We selected 50 motions, and recorded ex- perienced debaters making four speeches for each of them (two for and two against the motion). We then asked annotators to listen to a speech and presented them with a list of arguments that were proposed independently in iDebate for the motion. The annotators had to mark which of these argu-ments were mentioned in the speech (see Section 2 for further details). Example 1 shows one such ar- gument alongside a speech snippet, demonstrating the unique nature of this domain and data. Specif- ically, the argument against the motion is implied from the speech, but is not explicitly mentioned in it.</p><p>Example 1 (Positively labeled argument) Motion: We should introduce goal line technology [in sports] Argument: Controversy and debate are a part of the game Speech stance: opposing ("con") ... people also like it to some extent when officials make mistakes, because it adds to some of the like drama, the, oh, what if this happened? ... And I think that one of the biggest things that fans enjoy bonding over is when refs make mistakes that are blatantly wrong.</p><p>iDebate was chosen since its arguments are good candidates to construct comprehension ques- tions: more than half of the assessed arguments are mentioned in our recorded speeches, and the large majority of the speeches contain at least one of the arguments suggested by iDebate. Further- more, each argument in iDebate is coupled with a counter-argument. Those, in turn, may be used to rebut each argument that was detected through MLC, suggesting intriguing future directions to explore the released data. In a task related to ours, Boltu˘ zi´czi´c and ˘ Snajder (2014) have searched iDe- bate arguments in user argumentative comments. Their work, though, consisted of only two motions and included written, rather than audio data.</p><p>We release our annotated data and the results of baseline methods applied to it as a benchmark dataset for the MLC task. The dataset includes 200 speeches for 50 motions, in English. For each speech we include the following: (i) the audio version of the speech; (ii) manual and automatic transcripts; (iii) a labeled listening comprehension question, consisting of a set of arguments from iDebate that potentially appear in the speech.</p><p>The main contributions of this work are: (i) pro- posal of the new task of listening comprehension over argumentative content, a domain very differ- ent from those previously used for reading or lis- tening comprehension tasks; (ii) a comprehensive and rich labeled dataset of 200 speeches cover- ing 50 topics, transcribed both automatically and manually, and labeled for the listening comprehen- sion task; (iii) establishment of baselines over the dataset.</p><p>All the recordings, their transcripts and labels are available for research at https: //www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ dept/vst/debating_data.shtml.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>iDebate iDebate contains a list of controversial topics, phrased as parliamentary motions. Each motion is associated with arguments (referred to as "points") supporting or contesting it. Each argu- ment may be comprised of several sentences and is briefly summarized in a title.</p><p>Selecting iDebate motions At the time of this research, iDebate contained 684 motions. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We selected 50 clearly-defined motions, and simpli- fied their phrasing when necessary. For ex- ample, we rephrased "This House believes that cannabis should be legalised" to "We should le- galize cannabis".</p><p>Producing debate speeches We recorded argu- mentative speeches for each motion. First, two speeches supporting each motion were recorded by two experienced debaters. In doing so, we followed the process described in ( <ref type="bibr">Mirkin et al., 2018)</ref>, where a speaker is presented with a motion and its description and is instructed to record a few minutes speech that supports it, with 10 minutes to prepare, but without checking any online ma- terials. Given a speech supporting the motion, we asked another debater to listen to it and then record a speech rebutting it, and in consequence -oppos- ing the motion. These response speeches are of different nature than the initial speeches beyond the opposite stance, as they often contain refer- ences and rebuttal to arguments mentioned in this initial speech.</p><p>Through this process, we produced in total 200 speeches recorded by 14 different speak- ers, equally distributed between the motions, and between the "pro" and "con" stances. Each speech was transcribed automatically using Wat- son ASR. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The transcripts were split automatically into sentences using a bi-directional LSTM that was trained on spoken language corpora ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pahuja et al., 2017)</ref>. For completeness of the dataset, for each ASR transcript we include a manually- corrected "reference" human transcript, including manually added punctuation. Based on the hu- man transcripts, we computed the word error rate (WER) of the ASR transcripts: 8.03% on average. For comparison, the WER of the ASR transcripts in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2018</ref>) is 22.73%.</p><p>Labeling Given the recorded speeches, we car- ried out a labeling task employing experienced annotators, all of whom are highly proficient English-speakers. Given a motion and a speech, the annotators were instructed to listen to it once, preferably without pausing, and select which ones of iDebate argument titles were mentioned in it, or None if none of them was. Specifically, they were instructed to answer positively if it would be cor- rect to say that "the speaker argued that arg ..." where arg is the argument's title. A single ques- tion contained all the iDebate titles for the mo- tion, which have the suitable stance for the given speech. Each of the 200 questions was answered by five annotators.</p><p>On average, the labeled data contains 4.4 argu- ment titles per speech, where a title contains 10.5 words and an argument text includes 6 sentences and 156 words.</p><p>Labeling results In 173 (86.5%) of the speeches, at least one iDebate argument was found, and 248 (∼56%) of the iDebate arguments were labeled as positive at least once.</p><p>In order to analyze agreement between annota- tors, we transformed each multiple-choice ques- tion to a set of binary questions containing a speech and a single argument title. This amounted to 878 annotated speech-argument pairs, of which 354 (40.3%) are labeled as positive (i.e. an aver- age of ∼1.8 positive arguments per speech). The average pairwise Cohen's Kappa <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cohen, 1960)</ref> score over the labels is 0.52 (0.55 for support- ing and 0.50 for opposing speeches). The Fleiss' <ref type="bibr">Kappa (Fleiss, 1971</ref>) is 0.52. Noteworthy, 78.5% of the labels were of high confidence: four or five annotators agreed on the label. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the distribution of positive answers over the binary questions.</p><p>We analyzed a sample of arguments-speech pairs that had low agreement between annotators, i.e., those that have two or three positive labels. One reason for disagreement that we identified concerns argument titles that contain two claims, of which only one is argued by the speaker. An example is the title "Gambling is associated with other forms of addiction and harmful behaviour" concerning the motion "We should ban gambling". In a speech about this motion, only "addiction" was mentioned but not "harmful behaviour", re- sulting with two annotators accepting it and three rejecting it. Another possible source of disagree- ment is argument titles that are semantically sim- ilar, but not identical to the arguments presented in the speech. For instance, two of five annotators accepted the argument "on-line gambling affects families" when the speaker argued on the effects of gambling on families, but did not mention on- line gambling specifically.</p><p>Listening vs. reading To corroborate the reli- ability of our labeling through listening, we re- peated the task for 40 randomly sampled speeches, replacing only the audio with manual human tran- scripts of the speeches. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The average pairwise Cohen's Kappa score over the labels is 0.59 and the Fleiss' Kappa is 0.60. While these may in- dicate that the reading task is somewhat easier (e.g. because the annotator can read the text mul- tiple times), it was encouraging to discover that audio-based labeling achieves similar results to text-based labeling: we compared the labels ob- tained via reading and via listening and found that 87% of them were identical. Labeling by listen- ing is closer to the task of listening comprehen- sion than labeling via reading. Another advantage is that it removes the need to manually transcribe the speeches (in our experience, ASR transcripts are not ideal for labeling). As mentioned, in our released dataset we do provide human transcripts for all speeches.</p><p>Analysis of potential bias Recent works showed undesired artifacts in natural language inference datasets, namely that in some datasets for inferring relations between two texts, infer- ence can in fact be done by only considering one of them ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schwartz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gururangan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tsuchiya, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Poliak et al., 2018)</ref>. To explore this issue in our dataset, we assessed the correlation between several features of the argument title and the label. Specifically, we computed the Spearman's correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Spearman, 1904)</ref> between the label and the title's length, occurrences of named entities or negation words in the title, and the correlation between the labels and the titles' 100 most frequent words, stopwords excluded. This resulted in low correlation coeffi- cients, summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. This preliminary analysis suggests that naive features extracted from the title are not sufficient for predicting its label. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature</head><p>Spearman ρ Title length -0.07 Named entity -0.08 Negation -0.03 Frequent words 0.14 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Spearman correlation between labels and fea- tures of argument titles. For the frequent words, the fig- ure shown is the maximum (absolute) correlation found between positive labels and words from the titles. The words which yielded this correlation were "women" and "environment".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>Next, we establish baselines for our annotated dataset. All baselines are based on simple un- supervised text similarity methods for selecting which arguments were mentioned in a debate speech. Strictly, this is an entailment task rather than a similarity task, and similarity serves here as an approximation. Below we describe the estab- lishment of the baselines.</p><p>Evaluation configurations We considered two ways of representing a speech and two ways of representing an argument, to a total of four dif- ferent experimental configurations. A speech can be represented as a single text or as the set of its sentences. When a speech is represented by a set of sentences, we considered the maximum simi- larity score obtained by a sentence in the speech. For the speech text we used the ASR transcripts of the audio speeches, with the automatic split into sentences, as described in Section 2. The sentence-based configurations, therefore, depend on the specific automatic splitting of the texts into sentences. An argument can be represented us- ing only its title or by its extended text. The va- lidity of matching an argument's text against the speech while labels refer to titles stems from en- tailment transitivity: under the observation that in our data an argument text typically entails its title, if an argument text is mentioned in the speech (i.e. is entailed by it), its title is also entailed by the speech (that is, given that typically arg ⇒ title, if speech ⇒ arg then speech ⇒ title.)</p><p>Evaluation metric The performance of each method is calculated as the average accuracy over speeches in the test set, where the accuracy of a speech is the ratio of correct answers out of the number of choices presented for it. This ensures that each speech contributes equally to the overall accuracy regardless of the number of potential ar- guments associated with it. Since there is an equal number of speeches per motion, this is also the av- erage accuracy over motions. 7</p><p>Development and test sets We randomly split the data into development and test sets (dev and test below), such that 60% of the motions (30 motions, 120 speeches, 60 of each of supporting and opposing speeches) are in dev and 40% (80 speeches) are in test. For each method, we select a threshold that maximizes accuracy over dev, and apply it to test. In other words, an argument is con- sidered to be mentioned in the speech if its simi- larity score is above the threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Assessed methods</head><p>All-yes baseline As a reference point, we com- pute the accuracy obtained when all arguments are predicted to be mentioned in the speech, resulting in 39.8% accuracy.</p><p>word2vec (w2v) We create a <ref type="bibr">w2v (Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) vector representation for each text, removing stopwords; each word is represented by a 200-dimensional word embedding learned over Wikipedia. A tfidf -weighted average of the word embeddings represents each text, where idf val- ues are counted when considering each Wikipedia sentence as a document. Given a pair of texts, their score is the cosine similarity between their vector representations.</p><p>skip-thought (ST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref> presented a general sentence encoder, that has been applied successfully to a variety of tasks such as seman- tic relatedness and paraphrase detection, often ob- taining state of the art results. We use its available implementation to encode the texts as vectors, and compute the cosine similarity between them. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> shows the accuracy of all w2v config- urations. Representing an argument using its more verbose several-sentences-long content out- performs using its short single-sentence title. On the speech side, considering each sentence sepa- rately is preferable to using the entire speech. We compared the results of the best w2v-based config- uration (arg-sentence), to the performance of the skip-thought auto-encoder. In this setting, encod- ing individual speech sentences and an argument, the accuracy of skip-thought was 60.2%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Accuracy (%) all-yes 39.8 w2v title-speech 49.8 w2v arg-speech 57.6 w2v title-sentence 55.8 w2v arg-sentence 64.6 ST arg-sentence 60.2 The highest scoring method, w2v arg-sentence, reaches, then, a rather modest accuracy of 64.6%. One weakness of this method, revealed through analysis of its false positive predictions, is its ten- dency to prefer longer sentences. It is nevertheless substantially superior to the trivial all-yes base- line, as well as its all-no counterpart.</p><p>As explained, we chose accuracy as the main metric for this benchmark as it enables comput- ing macro-average scores over speeches with a variable number of arguments. For reference, the micro-average precision and recall scores of the w2v arg-sentence are 57.1% and 43% respectively, with an F 1 score of 49.1%. Optimizing for this metric enables controlling the trade-off between precision and recall with a threshold, depending on the end-application needs.</p><p>In sum, we have set a baseline for this task by computing similarity between averaged word em- beddings vectors. This simple method can be used as a starting point for future works on this dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>Machine listening comprehension is a challeng- ing task, whose complexity stems, among other things, from the difficulty to handle spoken lan- guage and from errors due to automatic transcrip- tion. The argumentation domain, often with com- plex and elaborate reasoning, relying on presuppo- sitions and world knowledge, adds another dimen- sion to this complexity. In this work, we suggest a task and a corresponding benchmark dataset to assess comprehension in this domain. We focused on the task of confirming the occurrence of argu- ments in a speech, which -as shown in this work -can be handled to some degree with standard textual inference methods. Other types of ques- tions can be formulated over this data in following work. We release a rich dataset, accompanied with benchmarks, that can drive various studies in lis- tening comprehension and argumentation mining.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The percentage of binary questions labeled as positive by 0 to 5 annotators.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,307.28,62.81,226.77,129.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
