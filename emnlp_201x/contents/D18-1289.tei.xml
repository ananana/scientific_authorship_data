				<p>In this paper, we present a crowdsourcing-based approach to model the human perception of sentence complexity. We collect a large corpus of sentences rated with judgments of complexity for two typologically-different languages , Italian and English. We test our approach in two experimental scenarios aimed to investigate the contribution of a wide set of lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic phenomena in predicting i) the degree of agreement among annotators independently from the assigned judgment and ii) the perception of sentence complexity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Linguistic complexity is a well-studied and mul- tifaceted notion for which several measures have been proposed in different frameworks ranging from First and Second Language Acquisition, lan- guage typology and readability assessment. Such measures depend on the perspective from which linguistic complexity is considered. According to one established distinction, linguistic complexity should be divided into an absolute vs a relative notion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Miestamo, 2008)</ref>. While the former is driven by theory and aims at assessing the com- plexity of a language according to some formal properties of the linguistic system, the latter de- fines complexity in relation to the language user (e.g. speaker, listener or learner) thus considering complexity in terms of processing difficulty. From this second perspective, sentence complexity is analyzed in terms of cognitive load, which can be inferred using both off-line (e.g. complexity judg- ments, error rates on comprehension test, prefer- ence for a structure over a meaning-equivalent one in elicited production tasks) and online process- ing measures (e.g. eye-tracking data such as to- tal gaze time, fixation duration and pupil dilation).</p><p>To operationalize factors underlying sentence pro- cessing performance, several complexity metrics have been proposed which consider properties of single word and sentence, as well as experience- based expectations. Word-level predictors shown to correlate with greater processing difficulties are e.g. word frequency, age of acquisition, root fre- quency effect, orthographic neighbourhood fre- quency. At syntactic level, a well-studied mea- sure of sentence complexity takes into account de- pendency length <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gibson, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gibson, , 2000</ref>), which has been used to explain a wide range of psycholin- guistic phenomena, such as the subject/object rel- ative clauses asymmetry or the garden path effect in main verb/reduced-relative ambiguities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gordon et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Staub et al., 2010)</ref>, as well as vari- ations in word order patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gildea and Temperley, 2010</ref>), also in a diachronic perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gulordava and Merlo, 2015)</ref>. Alternatively, process- ing difficulty has been explained in terms of sur- prisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hale, 2001</ref>). Computational models to cal- culate lexical and syntactic surprisal have been de- veloped by e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roark et al. (2009)</ref> using a broad- coverage probabilistic PCFG parser and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Demberg and Keller (2009)</ref>, who introduced Prediction The- ory, which aims at unifying Dependency Length Theory with syntactic surprisal, by making use of a psycholinguistically-motivated version of tree- adjoining grammar.</p><p>Unlike more conventional studies on human sentence processing carried out in experimental settings, in this study we rely on crowdsourcing methods to investigate how people perceive sen- tence complexity. The reliability of crowdsourced data for linguistics and computational linguistics research is well acknowledged as shown in the sur- vey by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Munro et al. (2010)</ref> proving that the qual- ity of findings obtained from the crowd is com- parable, if not higher, to controlled laboratory ex- periments. In addition, crowdsourcing reaches a broader population, in terms of age, education, profession etc. and it is thus more suitable to catch the "layman" intuition of sentence complexity. For these reasons, this method has been used in recent works in the field of readability and text simpli- fication; it is the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lasecki et al. (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Clercq et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brunato et al. (2016)</ref> where the crowd was asked to evaluate the level of com- plexity or the degree of informativeness of simpli- fied sentences compared to the original one.</p><p>In our study, we adopted a similar perspective relying on a crowdsourcing approach to collect a wide resource containing multiple annotations of sentence complexity given by humans. Unlike tra- ditional studies which typically assess either lex- ical or structural complexity phenomena, we fo- cused on the analysis of a wide set of linguistic features to investigate how all contribute to human perception of sentence complexity. This choice is also motivated by previous studies focused on the "form" of a text all related to the assess- ment of complexity, e.g. readability assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collins-Thompson, 2015)</ref>, first language acqui- sition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sagae et al., 2005</ref>) and Native Language Identification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Malmasi et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our Contributions</head><p>Our contribution to the study of sentence complex- ity is multiple:</p><p>• we address two research questions aimed to investigate the role played by a set of linguis- tic phenomena in characterizing a) the agree- ment among annotators when they rated the sentences independently from the assigned score and b) the human perception of com- plexity.</p><p>• we introduce a new crowdsourcing-based method to assess how people perceive sen- tence complexity and we test it for two lan- guages;</p><p>• we collect two corpora of sentences anno- tated by humans with a judgment of complex- ity;</p><p>The two research questions refer to two phenom- ena that are by definition highly subjective and dif- ficult to define. Our study intends to address this vagueness providing the following main contribu- tions: i) detecting the main linguistic phenom- ena involved in the prediction of agreement and ii) which phenomena characterize a sentence that is perceived complex by a high number of human subjects. All the data discussed here are made available at www.italianlp.it/resources/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head><p>We collected a dataset of rated sentences through a crowdsourcing task in which annotators were asked to give a score of complexity to a sentence. The task was carried out on two languages, Ital- ian and English, which have different morpho- syntactic and syntactic properties such as morpho- logical richness and word order freedom. This choice was aimed to investigate whether there are linguistic complexity parameters shared by typo- logically different languages. Starting from the collected rated sentences, we automatically ex- tracted a wide set of features spanning across mul- tiple levels of linguistic description, which have been acknowledged in the literature on human sen- tence processing to be involved in sentence com- plexity. The contribution of these features in mod- eling the perception of sentence complexity was tested in two different scenarios: i) a classifi- cation experiment to assess which features con- tribute more in the automatic prediction of the de- gree of agreement among annotators and which features vary in a statistically significant way be- tween agreed and not-agreed sentences; ii) a re- gression experiment to evaluate if the considered features allow predicting the complexity judgment assigned by humans and how they contribute to the prediction.</p><p>In what follows, we introduce the three main in- gredients of our approach, i.e. the set of linguis- tic features (Section 3.1), the datasets of sentences (Section 3.2) and the crowdsourcing task (Section 3.3). In the rest of the paper, we describe the ex- perimental scenarios raised by our two research questions and discuss the results (Sections 4 and 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linguistic Features</head><p>The set of features considered in this study cap- tures different aspects of sentence complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Raw text features:</head><p>word length, i.e. average number of characters per words (char tok in all tables and figures that follow) and sentence length, i.e. average number of words per sentence (n tokens), which are typi- cally used as a proxy of lexical and syntactic com- plexity in traditional readability metrics <ref type="bibr">(CollinsThompson, 2015</ref>);</p><p>Morpho-syntactic features: distribution of part-of-speech types; type/token ratio, calculated as the ratio between the number of lexical types, the number of tokens, in terms of both lemma and forms (ttr form, ttr lemma); ver- bal features, i.e. the distribution of verbs accord- ing to mood (verbs mood), tense (verbs tense) and persons (verbs num per), and lexical density (lex density), calculated as the ratio of content words (verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs) to the total tokens in a text. Psycholinguistic stud- ies highlight that higher lexical density implies greater cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gibson, 1993)</ref>;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Syntactic features:</formula><p>probability of syntactic dependency types e.g. subject, direct object, modifier, etc., calculated as the distribution of each type out of the total de- pendency types. Some syntactic relations have been shown to be harder to process, e.g. object- relative clauses and prepositional-phrase attach- ments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gibson and Pearlmutter, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gibson, 2000)</ref>, or the subject and object relations espe- cially in free word-order languages; distribution of verbal roots, i.e. the distribution of verbal roots out of the total of sentence roots. A lower percentage of verbal roots implies a higher number of nominal sentences which have a less- standard structure due to verb ellipsis thus possi- bly causing processing ambiguity; parse tree depth features: the depth of the whole parse tree (max depth), calculated in terms of the longest path from the root of the dependency tree to some leaf; the depth of embedded complement chains governed by a nominal head and including either prepositional complements or nominal and adjectival modifiers, calculated as the total num- ber of prepositional chains (n prep chains) and the average depth of chains (prep chain l); the distri- bution of embedded complement chains by depth, calculated as the number of chains out of the total number of chains in a sentence (prep depth). All these features are related to length factors and cor- relate with processing difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Frazier, 1985)</ref>, as in the case of long sequences of embedded prepo- sitional complements; verbal predicate features: the distribution of ver- bal head (verb head); the arity of verbs, meant as the average number of instantiated dependency links sharing the same verbal head covering both arguments and modifiers verb arity); the distribu- tion of verbal head by arity, calculated as the total number of verbal heads with the same arity in a sentence (verb head arity); the relative ordering of subject and object with respect to the verbal head (order subj and order obj); subordination features include the distribution of main vs. subordinate clauses (n subord clauses and n princ clauses; the average depth of chains of embedded subordinate clauses, calcu- lated as the total number of subordinate chains (n subord chain) and the average depth of sub- ordinate chains (subord chain l); the distribution of embedded subordinate clauses chains by depth, calculated as the number of chains out of the to- tal number of chains in a sentence (subord depth). We also calculated the order of the subordi- nate clause with respect to the main clause (or- der subord), since according to e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Miller and Weinert, 1998)</ref>, sentences containing subordinate clauses in postverbal than in preverbal position are easier to process; length of dependency links calculated as the number of words between the syntactic head and the dependent: the feature includes the length of all dependency links (links len) and of the maxi- mum dependency links (max links l). It is widely known that long-distance constructions cause cog- nitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gibson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gildea and Temperley, 2010)</ref>; clause length measured as the number of tokens occurring within a clause (token clause). Syntac- tic metrics relying on this feature, such as the T- Unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hunt, 1966)</ref>, are widely used e.g. in first and second language acquisition to assess the develop- ment of syntactic competence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data</head><p>The experiments were carried out on a subset of sentences extracted from two manually revised treebanks. We chose this kind of data in order to prevent possible errors produced by the automatic annotation of sentences. Specifically, we consid- ered the newspaper section of the Italian Universal Dependency Treebank (UDT) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Simi et al., 2014</ref>) and the automatically converted Wall Street Jour- nal section of the Penn Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McDonald et al., 2013</ref>). Since we wanted to investigate the human perception of complexity with respect to standard language, we didn't use the English version of the UDT containing different genres of web media (e.g. blogs, emails). Although the two selected treebanks have different annotation schemes, the annotation scheme of the UDT project <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(McDonald et al., 2013</ref>) is based on an evolution of (uni- versal) Stanford dependencies (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marneffe et al., 2006</ref>). This allowed us to compare linguistic phe- nomena correlated with sentence complexity mini- mizing possible cross-linguistic differences due to not uniform principles of sentence structure rep- resentation. In order to reduce the influence of lexicon on the study of sentence complexity we pruned from the two treebanks those sentences containing low-frequency lemmas with respect to a lemma frequency list that we automatically ex- tracted from a large reference corpus, excluding numerals and proper nouns. For what concerns Italian, we used as a reference corpus PAIS´APAIS´ PAIS´A ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lyding et al., 2014</ref>), which is one of the biggest cor- pus of authentic contemporary Italian texts. For English, we selected a large corpus of sentences from the Wall Street Journal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nivre et al., 2007</ref>). For both languages, all the sentences contained in the two treebanks were grouped into 6 bins based on a different sentence length, i.e. 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 tokens (only for Italian with a range of +/- 1 tokens each). This was meant to investigate if some linguistic features that are known to corre- late with sentence length (e.g. parse tree depth fea- tures and dependency links) still play an influence on sentence complexity judgments when sentence length is controlled. Sentences in each subset were then ranked according to the sum of the average frequency of their lemmas. We extracted for each bin the first 200-top ranked sentences, with the ex- ception of Italian for which the last bin contains 123 sentences. As a result of the whole selection process, we obtained 1,200 sentences for English and 1,123 for Italian used for experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Collection of Judgments of Complexity</head><p>To collect human complexity judgments, we ad- ministered a crowdsourcing task through the plat- form CrowdFlower <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . For each language we re- cruited 20 native speakers who were asked to read a sentence and rate how difficult it was on a 7- point scale where 1 means "very easy" and 7 "very difficult". Sentences were randomly ordered and 1 www.crowdflower.com presented on distinct pages containing five sen- tences each. To improve the quality of the col- lected annotations we chose workers with a "high quality" level assigned by the platform on the ba- sis of their performance in previous tasks and we set a minimum of ten seconds to complete a page. We computed the Krippendorff's alpha reliability corresponding to the number of annotators who as- signed the same judgment. We obtained a reliabil- ity of 26% for Italian and 24% for English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Studying the Agreement between Human Judgments</head><p>Our first research question concerned the inves- tigation of linguistic phenomena characterizing the agreement among annotators in assigning the same judgment of complexity to a sentence. To this end, we split the whole set of rated sentences into ten sets corresponding to the number of an- notators giving a judgment of complexity within a same range, hereafter referred to degrees of agree- ment 2 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> reports the number of sentences for each degree of agreement. For both languages, if we consider a minimum number of 10 agree- ing annotators, very few sentences were discarded (∼50 for Italian and 70 for English). As the num- ber of agreeing annotators increases, the number of sentences progressively decreases but we still have a considerable number of sentences (∼600) when 14 annotators agree. To study the linguistic phenomena characteriz- ing the agreement, we firstly extracted the features described in Section 3.1 from sentences on which annotators agreed (agreed sentences) and from the rest of sentences (not-agreed sentences); we as- sessed if the difference is statistically significant using Wilcoxon Rank-sum test. This was done for each agreement threshold.</p><p>We then performed a feature selection process to identify the features that maximize the accu- racies of a classifier in predicting agreed vs not- agreed sentences. To create a ranking of feature</p><note type="other">relevance, we used the Recursive Feature Elimi- nation (RFE) algorithm implemented in the Scikit- learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011), using Linear SVM as estimator algorithm, and we dropped 1 feature in each iteration. We evaluated the clas- sifier performance using a 3-fold cross validation method. At the end of this process we selected the top ranked features. This procedure was iterated 10 times for each degree of agreement.</note><p>In order to evaluate the accuracy of the SVM classifier we computed a baseline corresponding to the performance of the classifier using a most- likely class classification method, where each sen- tence is always classified into the most likely class. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reports the features that vary in a sta- tistically significant way (in table) and the ones selected in classification (marked with ) for both languages and degrees of agreement levels. As it can be seen, there is an opposite trend between the statistically significant features and those se- lected by the classifier as the degree of agreement increases. For what concerns the Wilcoxon test, very few features have significantly different val- ues at lower degrees of agreement. That is to say that very few features are involved in discriminat- ing the agreed vs not-agreed sentences, especially when the agreement is lower than 14.</p><p>For both languages, raw text features (n tokens and char tok) vary significantly at all degrees of agreement. Interestingly, these two features are not considered by the classifier which uses more complex syntactic features, such as features related to subordination (e.g. subord depth) and nominal modification (e.g. prep chain l). Syntac- tic features start to vary significantly as the agree- ment increases, e.g. parse tree depth features such as the depth of the whole parse tree (max depth) and the complement chains (dep mark), and fea- tures related to the use of subordination. Com- paring the two languages we also found a number of differences. For example, at the lowest agree- ment (degree 10), features of all types turned out to vary significantly for English, while the Ital- ian agreed and not-agreed sentences do not vary for any features. At higher agreement, Italian agreed sentences are characterized by the varia- tion of two language-specific features: the posi- tion of the object with respect to the verb head (order obj) and some verbal morphological fea- tures (verbs num pers, verbs tense), which also contributes to the classification only for Italian. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> reports the accuracy of SVM classi- fier for each degree of agreement 3 and the base- line. At lower degrees of agreement (i.e. &lt;14) the classifier achieves lower accuracy compared to the baseline showing that the selected features do not contribute to discriminate agreed vs not- agreed sentences. Instead, these features start to have a greater impact for the classification of sen- tences at degrees 14, 15, 16, 17. This means that at these degrees of agreement the values of the fea- tures characterizing the agreed sentences are sig- nificantly different from those of the not-agreed sentences. In addition, even though for these sen- tences a very high number of features are consid- ered statistically significant by the Wilcoxon test the classifier needs less features to assign the cor- rect class (as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Correlation of Linguistic Features with Sentence Complexity</head><p>The second research question aims to model the human perception of complexity studying the cor- relation between the set of linguistic features ex- tracted from sentences and the judgments of com- plexity assigned to each sentence. We firstly cal- culated the average complexity judgments for the six bins of sentences of the same length (i.e. 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 tokens). As expected, long sentences were judged as more complex for both languages even though all sentences were always rated as more complex for Italian (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). We then calculated the Spearman's rank correla- tion coefficient between the values of each feature and the average judgments of complexity thus ob- taining a ranking of features. The correlation was computed at two distinct degrees of agreement, i.e. 10 and 14. We chose these two thresholds since at 10 the agreed sentences correspond to almost all the rated sentences and at 14 the SVM classifier starts to outperform the baseline (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Be- sides, at 14 we still have a quite large set of agreed sentences allowing a reliable statistical study of the features (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Only at threshold 10  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  IT  EN  IT  EN  IT  EN  IT  EN  IT  EN  IT  EN  IT  EN  IT  EN  char tok       - -          cpos ADJ       - - -  -       cpos ADP       - -  - - - -     cpos ADV   -  -  - - - - -  -  -  - cpos AUX   -  -  -  - - - - -  -  - cpos CONJ       - -  -        cpos PRON   -  -  - - -  -  -  -  - cpos DET  -  -  - - -  -  -  -  -  cpos</ref>  <ref type="table">depth  -                subord depth       -           token clause  -     - - - - - - -     ttr form  -                ttr lemma                  verb arity       -           verb head arity                  verb head       -           verbs num pers   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - verbs tense   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Table 1</ref>: Linguistic features that vary statistically () and the ones selected by the SVM classifier in at least 50% of the 10 runs () for Italian and English at different degrees of agreement.  we also calculated the ranking of the features with respect to the six bins of sentences of the same length (L10, L15, L20, L25, L30, L35). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  3</ref> reports the ranking of features with p &lt;0.05. Positive numbers mean that the higher the feature value the more complex the sentence was judged (i.e. the feature ranked +1 is the top-ranked one since it is the most positively correlated). Instead, negative numbers mean that the lower the feature value, the more complex the sentence was judged (i.e. the feature ranked -1 is the highest nega- tively correlated). In both languages, the corre- lation between the top 20 ranked features and the complexity judgment is extremely high, ranging from 0.30 to 0.85 when we consider sentences at agreement 14. At the two agreement thresholds, for all lengths (columns T10, T14), they concern not only sentence length but also deep syntactic features, in terms of e.g. the depth of the whole parse tree (max depth), the length of dependency links (links len), and features related to subordi- nation (e.g. n subord clauses). Specifically, the 1st-ranked feature in Italian (parse tree depth) and the one in English (sentence length) have a cor- relation of 0.64 and 0.84 respectively. Nominal modification (n prep chains) is also highly corre- lated (Italian r s =0.59, English 0.54) and similarly ranked in the two languages at 3rd position. The distribution of verbs num pers makes the sentence harder only for Italian; this is possibly related to the higher complexity of verbal morphology since the 3rd person verb in impersonal structures might increase the ambiguity of the sentence with re- spect to the referent. Only in English, sentence complexity is affected by the distribution of car- dinal numbers (cpos NUM) and the dependency type "numeric modifier" (dep num), in line with the difficulty of numerical information shown in readability studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bautista and Saggion, 2014)</ref>. Conversely, the verbal arity and the relative or- dering of subjects with respect to the verb have a lower position in the negative ranking, suggest- ing that these features make a sentence easier: this might be due to a more fixed predicate-argument structure and word order in this language.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">NUM - - - - - - - - cpos PROPN - - - - - - - - - cpos PUNCT - - - - - - - - - cpos SCONJ - - - - - - - - - - cpos VERB - - - - - - - - dep acl - - - - - - - - - dep acl:relcl - - - - - - - - - - dep adpobj - - - - - - - - - - - - dep advcl - - - - - - - - - dep amod - dep appos - - - - - - - - - - - - - dep attr - - - - - - - - - - - dep aux - - - - - - - - - - dep case - - - - - - - - - - dep cc - - - - dep ccomp - - - - - - - - - - dep compmod - - - - - - - - - - dep conj - - - dep det - - - - - - - - - dep dobj - - - - - - - - - - dep mark - dep nmod - - - - dep nsubj - - - - - - - - dep num - - - - - - - - dep partmod - - - - - - - - - - - dep poss - - - - - - - - - - dep punct - - - - - - - - - dep rcmod - - - - - - - - - - dep xcomp - - - - - - - - - - - lex density - - - - - - - - - links len - max depth - - max links l - n prep chains n principal clauses - - n subord chain - n subord clauses - - - - - - - - n tokens - order obj - - - - - - - - - - - order subj - - - - - - - - - - - order subord - prep chain l - - - prep</formula><p>If we focus on sentences of the same length, features considered as a proxy of lexical complex- ity are in the top positions in both languages. It is the case of the average word length (char tok) and the lexical density (lex density) only for En- glish. Interestingly, while for English the major- ity of features are similarly ranked in all bins of sentences of the same length, for Italian we ob- serve differences between the rankings of features extracted from sentences ≤ and ≥20 token long. Namely, when the average sentence length is ≥20 tokens, features related to subordination make the sentence more complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Predicting Human Complexity Judgments</head><p>To asses the contribution of the linguistic fea- tures to predict the judgment of sentence com- plexity we trained a linear SVM regression model with default parameters. We performed a 3-fold cross validation over each subset of agreed sen- tences at agreement 10 and 14. We measured two performance metrics: the mean absolute error to evaluate the accuracy of the model to predict the same complexity judgment assigned by humans; the Spearman correlation to evaluate the correla- tion between the ranking of features produced by the regression model with the ranking produced by the human judgments. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> reports the results and the average score of the two metrics. As it can be seen, the model is very accurate and achieves a very high correlation (&gt;0.56 with p &lt;0.001) with an average error difference (avg mean abs err) be- low 1. In particular, the model obtained higher performance in predicting the ranking of features extracted from sentences at agreement 14. This might be due to the fact these sentences are charac- terized by a more uniform distribution of linguistic phenomena and that these phenomena contribute to predict the same judgment of complexity. This is in line with the results obtained by the SVM classifier in predicting agreement <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. This is particularly the case of English and it possibly suggests that the set of sentences similarly judged by humans are characterized by a lower variability of the values of the features.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we introduced a method to model the human perception of sentence complexity re- lying on a new corpus of Italian and English sen-      tences rated with human complexity judgments. We tested the contribution of a wide set of lin- guistic features automatically extracted from these sentences in two experimental scenarios. The first one highlighted that we can reliably predict the de- gree of agreement between human annotators, in- dependently from the assigned judgment of com- plexity: given the high subjectivity of the task, this is a quite notable result that to our knowledge has never been reported. We observed in particular that deep syntactic features related to e.g. the use of subordination and nominal modification play a main role in the automatic prediction of human agreement. This is true for the two languages even though we found that some features resulted to be more relevant in the classification of agreed Ital- ian sentences, e.g. the relative ordering of the ob- ject. Interestingly, we also noticed that the classi- fier needs few features to predict agreed sentences when more than half of annotators shares the same judgment.</p><p>In the second experiment, we studied the cor- relation between linguistic features and complex- ity judgments. The resulting ranking highlighted the key role played by syntactic phenomena: fea- tures related to sentence structure are among the top-ranked features characterizing sentences that were rated highly complex by a given number of agreeing annotators. When sentence length was controlled, the relevance of the considered fea- tures changes in particular for Italian: e.g. features concerning the use of subordination make the sen-tence more complex when sentence length is ≥20 tokens. As showed by the results of the regression model, the set of studied features contribute sig- nificantly to automatically predict the human judg- ment of sentence complexity.</p><p>In addition, the presented corpus can be use- ful for different applications. From a psycholin- guistic perspective, it can be used for compari- son with data collected through controlled experi- mental scenarios assessing sentence complexity in terms of cognitive measures (offline and online), which are also more constrained and costly to ac- quire in large-dimensions. The corpus also allows to study whether features of linguistic complexity are implied in modeling other properties of texts, such as the level of engagement or subjectivity. From a NLP perspective, the corpus can be ex- ploited to train systems able to predict people's perception of complexity. For example, it can sup- port a range of related tasks, such as the devel- opment of linguistically-informed algorithms for the automatic assessment of text difficulty, as well as in Natural Language Generation tasks, going from text simplification to the automatic genera- tion/evaluation of highly-engaging texts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Number of sentences at different degrees of agreement.</figDesc></figure>
