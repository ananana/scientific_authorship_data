				<p>Questions play a prominent role in social interactions, performing rhetorical functions that go beyond that of simple infor-mational exchange. The surface form of a question can signal the intention and background of the person asking it, as well as the nature of their relation with the interlocutor. While the informational nature of questions has been extensively examined in the context of question-answering applications , their rhetorical aspects have been largely understudied. In this work we introduce an unsupervised methodology for extracting surface motifs that recur in questions, and for grouping them according to their latent rhetorical role. By applying this framework to the setting of question sessions in the UK parliament, we show that the resulting ty-pology encodes key aspects of the political discourse-such as the bifurcation in questioning behavior between government and opposition parties-and reveals new insights into the effects of a legislator&apos;s tenure and political career ambitions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Why do we ask questions? Perhaps we are seek- ing factual information that others hold, or maybe we are requesting a favor. Alternatively we could be simply making a rhetorical point, perhaps at the start of an academic paper.</p><p>Questions play a prominent role in social inter- actions <ref type="bibr">(Goffman, 1976)</ref>, performing a multitude of rhetorical functions that go beyond mere factual information gathering <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kearsley, 1976)</ref>. While the informational component of questions has been well-studied in the context of question-answering applications, there is relatively little computational work addressing the rhetorical and social role of these basic dialogic units.</p><p>One domain where questions have a particularly salient rhetorical role is politics. The ability to question the actions and intentions of governments is a crucial part of democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pitkin, 1967)</ref>, par- ticularly in parliamentary systems. Consequently, scholars have studied parliamentary questions in detail, in terms of their origins <ref type="bibr">(Chester and Bowring, 1962)</ref>, their institutionalization (Eggers and <ref type="bibr">Spirling, 2014)</ref> and their importance for over- sight ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Proksch and Slapin, 2011</ref>). In particular, the United Kingdom's House of Commons, renowned for theatrical questions periods, has been stud- ied in some depth. However, those accounts are largely qualitative in nature ( <ref type="bibr">Bull and Wells, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bates et al., 2014</ref>). The present work: methodology. In order to approach these problems computationally, we in- troduce an unsupervised framework to structure the space of questions according to their rhetori- cal role. First, we identify common ways in which questions are phrased. To this end, we automati- cally extract these recurring surface forms, or mo- tifs, based on the lexico-syntactic structure of the questions posed (Section 4). To capture rhetorical aspects we then group these motifs according to their role, relying on the intuition that this role is encoded in the type of answer a question receives. To operationalize this intuition we construct a la- tent question-answer space in which question mo- tifs triggering similar answers are mapped to the same region (Section 5). The present work: application. We apply this general framework to the political discourse that occurs during parliamentary question sessions in the British House of Commons, a new dataset which we make publicly available (Section 3).</p><p>Our framework extracts intuitive question types ranging from narrow factual queries to pointed criticisms disguised as questions (Section 5, Ta- ble 1). We validate our framework by aligning these types with prior understandings of parlia- mentary proceedings from the political science lit- erature (Section 6). In particular, previous work ( <ref type="bibr">Bates et al., 2014</ref>) has categorized questions asked in Parliament according to the intentions of the asker (e.g., to help the answerer, or to adver- sarially put them on the spot); we find a clear, pre- dictive mapping between these expert-coded cate- gories and the induced typology. We further show that the types of questions specific legislators tend to ask vary with whether they are part of the gov- erning or opposition party, consistent with well- established accounts of partisan differences <ref type="bibr">(Cowley, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Spirling and McLean, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eggers and Spirling, 2014)</ref>. Concretely, government legisla- tors exhibit a preference for overtly friendly ques- tions, while the opposition slants towards more ag- gressive question types.</p><p>We then apply our methodology to provide new insights into how a legislator's questioning be- havior varies with their career trajectory. The pressures faced by legislators at various stages in their career are cross-cutting, and multiple possi- ble hypotheses emerge. Younger, more enthusi- astic legislators may be motivated to ask harder- hitting questions, but risk being passed over for future promotion if they are too combative <ref type="bibr">(Cowley, 2002</ref>). Older legislators, whose opportunities for promotion are largely behind them and hence have "less to lose", may act more aggressively <ref type="bibr">(Benedetto and Hix, 2007)</ref>; or simply seek a quiet path to retirement. Viewing each group's behav- ior through the questions they ask brings evidence for the latter hypothesis that more tenured legis- lators are more aggressive, even when questioning their own leaders. In this way, their presence in the House of Commons, and their refusal to simply 'keep their heads down', facilitates a core compo- nent of democracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Question-answering. Computationally, questions have received considerable attention in the con- text of question-answering (QA) systems-for a survey see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gupta and Gupta (2012)</ref>-with an em- phasis on understanding their information need <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Harabagiu, 2008)</ref>. Techniques have been devel- oped to categorize questions based on the nature of these information needs in the context of the TREC QA challenge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Harabagiu et al., 2000</ref>), and to identify questions asking for similar informa- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Shtok et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zhang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jeon et al., 2005</ref>); questions have also been classified by topic <ref type="bibr">(Cao et al., 2010</ref>) and quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Treude et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ravi et al., 2014</ref>). In contrast, our work is not concerned with the information need central to QA applications, and instead focuses on the rhetorical aspect of questions.</p><p>Question types. To facilitate retrieval of fre- quently asked questions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lytinen and Tomuro (2002)</ref> manually developed a typology of surface question forms (e.g., 'what'-and 'why'-questions) starting from Lehnerts' conceptual question cat- egories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Lehnert, 1978)</ref>. Question types were also hand annotated for dialog-act labeling, dis- tinguishing between yes-no, wh-, open-ended and rhetorical questions ( <ref type="bibr">Dhillon et al., 2004</ref>). To complement this line of work, this paper intro- duces a completely unsupervised methodology to automatically build a domain-tailored question ty- pology, bypassing the need for human annotation.</p><p>Pragmatic dimensions. One important prag- matic dimension of questions that has been pre- viously studied computationally is their level of politeness (Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr">Mizil et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aubakirova and Bansal, 2016)</ref>; in the specific con- text of making requests, politeness was shown to correlate with the social status of the asker. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sachdeva and Kumaraguru (2017)</ref> studied another rhetorical aspect by examining linguistic attributes distinguishing serviceable requests addressed to police on social media from general conversa- tion. Previous research has also been directed at identifying rhetorical questions ( <ref type="bibr">Bhattasali et al., 2015)</ref> and understanding the motivations of their "askers" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ranganath et al., 2016)</ref>. Using the rela- tionship between questions and answers, our work examines the rhetorical and social aspect of ques- tions without predefining a pragmatic dimension and without relying on labeled data. We also com- plement these efforts in analyzing a broader range of situations in which questions may be posed without an information-seeking intent.</p><p>Political discourse. Finally, our work contributes to a rapidly growing area of NLP applications to political domains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Monroe et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Card et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gonzalez-Bailon et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Niculae et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grimmer and Stewart, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grimmer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Iyyer et al., 2014b</ref>, inter alia). Particularly relevant are applications to discourse in congres- sional and parliamentary settings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Thomas et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Boydstun et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rheault et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data: Parliamentary Question Periods</head><p>The bulk of our analysis focuses on the questions asked, and responses given during parliamentary question periods in the British House of Com- mons. Below, we provide a brief overview of key features of this political system in general, as well as a description of the question period setting. Parliamentary systems. Legislators in the House of Commons (Members of Parliament, henceforth MPs or members) belong to two main voting and debating affiliations: a government party which controls the executive and holds a majority of the seats in the chamber, and a set of opposition par- ties. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The executive is headed by the Prime Min- ister (PM) and run by a cabinet of ministers, high- ranking government MPs responsible for various departments such as finance and education. Question periods. The House of Commons holds weekly, moderated question periods, in which MPs of all affiliations take turns to ask questions to (and theoretically receive answers from) govern- ment ministers for each department regarding their specific domains. Such events are a primary way in which legislators hold senior policy-makers re- sponsible for their decisions. In practice, beyond narrow requests for information about specific pol- icy points, MPs use their questions to critique or praise the government, or to self-promote; indeed, certain sessions, such as Questions to the Prime Minister, have gained renown for their partisan clashes, often fueled by the (mis)handling of a cur- rent crisis. The following question, asked to the Prime Minister by an opposition MP about con- tamination of the meat supply in 2013, encapsu- lates this odd mix of purposes:</p><p>"The Prime Minister is rightly shocked by the revelations that many food products contain 100% horse. Does he share my concern that, if tested, many of his answers may contain 100% bull?" 2</p><p>The moderated, relatively rigid format of ques- tions periods, along with the multifaceted array of underlying incentives and interpersonal relation- ships, yields a structurally controlled setting with a rich variety of social interactions, taking place in the realm of important policy discussions. This complexity makes question periods a particularly fruitful and consequential setting in which to study questions as social signals, and expand our under- standing of their role beyond factual queries. Dataset description. Our dataset covers ques- tion periods from May 1979 to December 2016, encompassing six different Prime Ministers. For each question period, we extract all question- answer pairs, along with the identity of the asker and answerer. Because our focus here is on how questions are posed in a social setting, and not on the subsequent dialogue, we ignore questions which were tabled prior to the session, as well as any followup back-and-forth dialogue between the asker and answerer.</p><p>We augment this collection with metadata about each asker and answerer, including their political party, the time when they first took office, and whether they were serving as a minister at a given point in time. Such information is used to validate our methodology and interpret our results in light of the social context in which the questions were asked, described further in Sections 6 and 7.</p><p>In total there are 216,894 question-answer pairs in our data, occurring over 4,776 days and 6 prime-ministerships. The questions cover 1,975 different askers, 1,066 different answerers, and a variety of government departments with respon- sibilities ranging from defense to transport. We make this dataset publicly available, along with the code implementing our methodology, as part of the Cornell Conversational Analysis Toolkit. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Question Motifs</head><p>The first component of our framework identifies lexico-syntactic phrasing patterns recurring in a collection of questions, which we call motifs. Intu- itively, motifs constitute wordings commonly used to pose questions. To find motifs in a given col- lection, we first extract relevant fragments from each question. We then group sets of frequently co-occurring fragments into motifs.</p><p>Question fragments. Our goal is to find motifs which reflect functional characteristics of ques- tions. Hence, we start by extracting the key fragments within a question which encapsulate its functional nature. Following the intuition that the bulk of this functional information is contained in the root of a question's dependency parse along with its outgoing arcs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Iyyer et al., 2014a</ref>), we take the fragments of a question to be the root of its parse tree, along with each (root, child) pair. To capture cases when the operational word in the question is not connected to its root (such as "What..."), we also consider the initial unigram and bigram of a question as fragments. The fol- lowing question has 5 fragments: what, what is, going→*, is←going and going→do.</p><p>(1) What is the minister going to do about ... ?</p><p>Because our goal is to capture topic-agnostic patterns, we ignore all fragments which contain a noun phrase (NP) or pronoun. NP subtrees are identified based on their outgoing dependencies to the root; 4 in the event that an NP starts with a WH- determiner (WDT), we consider (root, WDT) to be a fragment and drop the remainder of the NP. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Finally, we note that some questions consist of multiple sub-questions ("What does the Minister think <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref>, and why [...]?"). For such questions, we recursively extract fragments from each child sub- tree in the same manner, starting from their roots. From fragments to motifs. We define motifs as sets of question fragments that frequently co-occur (in at least n questions). We find motifs by ap- plying the apriori algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal and Srikant, 1994)</ref> to find these common itemsets. This results in a collection of motifs M which correspond to different question phrasings. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Examples of motifs are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Motifs can identify phrasings to varying degrees of specificity. For example, the singleton mo- tif {what is} corresponds to all questions starting with that bigram, while {what is, going→do} nar-rows these down to questions also containing the fragment going→do. To model the specificity re- lation between motifs, we structure M as a di- rected acyclic graph where an edge points from a motif m 1 to another motif m 2 if the latter has exactly one more fragment in addition to those in m 1 , corresponding to a narrower set of phrasings. Motif-representation of a question. Finally, a question q contains a motif if it includes all of the fragments comprising that motif. We can hence capture the phrasing of a given question q using the subset of motifs it contains, structured as the subgraph M q ⊂ M induced by this subset. This directed subgraph represents the question at mul- tiple levels of specificity simultaneously; in par- ticular, the set of sinks (i.e., nodes with outdegree 0; henceforth sink motifs) of M q is the most fine- grained way to specify the phrasing of q. For ex- ample {what is, is←going, going→do} is the only sink motif of the question in example (1); its entire subgraph is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 3</ref> in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Latent Question Types</head><p>The second component of our framework struc- tures the space of questions according to their functional roles, thus going beyond the lexico- syntactic representation captured via motifs. The main intuition is that the nature of the answer that a question receives provides a good indication of its intention. Therefore, if two questions are phrased differently but answered in similar ways, the parallels exhibited by their answers should re- flect commonalities in the askers' intentions.</p><p>To operationalize this intuition, we first con- struct a latent space based on answers, and then map question motifs (Section 4) to the same space. Using the resultant latent representations, we can then cluster questions with similar rhetorical func- tions, even if their surface forms are different. Constructing a space of answers. In line with our focus on functional characterizations, we ex- tract the fragments from each sentence of an an- swer, defined in the same way as question frag- ments. We then construct a term-document ma- trix, where terms correspond to answer fragments, and documents correspond to individual answers in the corpus. We filter out infrequent fragments occurring less than n A times, reweight the rows of this matrix with tf-idf reweighting, and scale to unit norm, producing a fragment-answer ma- trix A. We perform singular value decomposi-tion on A and obtain a low-rank representation A ≈ ˆ A = U A SV T A , for some rank d, where rows of U A correspond to answer fragments and rows of V A correspond to answers. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Latent projection of question motifs. We can draw a natural correspondence between a ques- tion motif m and answer term t if m occurs in a question whose answer contains t. This enables us to compute representations of question motifs in the same space asˆAasˆ asˆA. Concretely, we construct a motif-question matrix Q = (q ij ) where q ij = 1 if motif i occurred in question j; we scale rows of Q to unit norm. To represent Q in the latent answer space, we solve forˆQforˆ forˆQ in Q = ˆ QSV T A asˆQ asˆ asˆQ = QV A S −1 , again scaling rows to unit norm. Row i ofˆQofˆ ofˆQ then gives a d-dimensional represen- tation of motif i, denotedˆqdenotedˆ denotedˆq i .</p><p>Grouping similar questions. Finally, we iden- tify question types-broad groups of similar mo- tifs. Intuitively, if two motifs m i and m j have vec- tors q i and q j which are close together, they elicit answers that are close in the latent space, so are functionally similar in this sense. We use the K- Means algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>) to clus- ter motif vectors into k clusters; these clusters then constitute the desired set of question types.</p><p>To determine the type of a particular question q * , we transform it to a binary vector (q * i ) where q * i = 1 if motif i is a sink motif of q * ; using only sink motifs at this stage allows us to characterize a question according to the most specific represen- tation of its phrasing, thus avoiding spurious asso- ciations resulting from more general motifs. We scale q * , project it to the latent space as before, and assign the resultant projectionˆqprojectionˆ projectionˆq * to a cluster t, hence determining its type.</p><p>Since question motifs and answer fragments have both been mapped to the same latent space (as rows ofˆQofˆ ofˆQ and U A respectively), we can also assign each answer fragment to a ques- tion type. This further facilitates interpretabil- ity through characterizing the answers commonly triggered by a particular type of question. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We experimented with grouping answer fragments into motifs as well, but found that most of the motifs produced were one fragment large. While future work could focus more on understanding consistent phrasings of answers, we note that at least in our chosen corpus, answers are longer and encompass a much greater variation of possible phrasings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Validation</head><p>We now apply our general framework to the par- ticular setting of parliamentary question periods, structuring the space of questions posed within these sessions according to their rhetorical func- tion. To validate the induced typology, we quanti- tatively show that it recovers asker intentions in an expert-coded dataset, and qualitatively aligns with prior findings in the political science literature on parliamentary dynamics. Question types in Parliament. We apply our mo- tif extraction and question type induction pipeline to the questions in the parliamentary dataset. 8 Over 90% of the questions in the dataset contain at least one of the resulting 2,817 motifs; in sub- sequent analyses we discard questions without a matching motif. We apply our pipeline to the questions in the parliamentary dataset, and induce a typology of k = 8 question types to capture the rich array of questions represented in this space while preserving interpretability. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> displays extracted types, along with ex- ample questions, answers, and motifs. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The sec- ond author, a political scientist with domain ex- pertise in the UK parliamentary setting, manually investigated each type and provided interpretable labels. For example, in questions of type 4, the asker is aware that his main premise is supported by the minister, and thus will be met with a pos- itive statement backing the thrust of the question; we call this the agreement cluster. Types 6 and 7 are much more combative: in type 6 questions the asker explicitly attempts to force the minister to concede/accept a point that would undermine some government stance, while type 7 contains condemnatory questions that prompt the minis- ter to justify a policy that is self-evidently bad in the eyes of the asker. In contrast, type 2 consti- tutes tamer narrow queries that require the min- ister to simply report on non-partisan matters of policy. (Extended interpretations in the appendix.) Quantitative validation. We compare our out- put to a dataset of 1,256 questions asked to vari- ous Prime Ministers labeled by <ref type="bibr">Bates et al. (2014</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Question types automatically extracted from the parliamentary question periods, along with representative motifs and question-answer pairs. The number of questions in our dataset assigned to each type is shown in parantheses. Interpretations and more examples in <ref type="table">Tables 2 &amp; 3 in the appendix.</ref> (also included in our data distribution). Each ques- tion in this data is hand-coded by a domain ex- pert with one of three labels indicating the rhetor- ical intention of the asker: compared to stan- dard questions-denoting straightforward factual queries, helpful questions serve as prompts for the PM to talk favorably about their government, while unanswerable questions are effectively ve- hicles for delivering criticisms that the PM cannot respond to. Questions which are unanswered by the PM are also labeled. If our framework cap- tures meaningful rhetorical dimensions, we expect a given label to be over-represented in some of our induced types, and under-represented in others.</p><note type="other">) Type Question motifs Answer fragments Example question-answer pairs 0: Issue update (16,693) {what,are←taking}, {will←update} continue→work, met→discuss Q: What steps are the Department taking to create a system for asylum-seekers?

In particular, helpful ques- tions are highly associated with the agreement type (constituting 28% of questions of that type compared to 14% over the entire dataset; bino- mial test p &lt; 0.01), reinforcing our interpretation that this type captures MPs cheerleading their own government. Conversely, unanswerable questions are frequently of the concede/accept type (20% in-type vs. 11% overall), while condemnatory questions are often unanswered (43% vs. 24% overall), suggesting that questions of these types have an increased tendency to be posed as aggres- sive criticisms packaged as questions.</p><p>We also validate our framework in a prediction setting using these labels, in three binary clas- sification tasks: distinguishing helpful vs. stan- dard, unanswerable vs. standard, and unanswered vs. answered questions. (In each task, we bal- ance the two classes.) To control for asker affil- iation effects, we consider only questions asked by government MPs for the helpful task, and op- position questions in the unanswerable and unan- swered tasks; we train on questions to Conserva- tive PMs and evaluate on Labour PMs. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> For each setting, we train logistic regression classifiers; as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: A: Log-odds ratios of questions of each type asked by government and opposition MPs, com- pared to MPs not of the respective affiliation; 95% confidence intervals (sometimes imperceptible) are depicted.

Stars indicate statistically significant differences at the p &lt; 0.05 (*), p &lt; 0.01 (**) and p &lt; 0.001 (***) levels (Wilcoxon test).</p><p>features we compare the latent representation of each question to a unigram BOW baseline. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> In the unanswerable and unanswered tasks, we find that the BOW features do not perform sig- nificantly better than a random (50%) baseline. However, the latent question features produced by our framework bring additional predictive sig- nal and outperform the baseline when combined with BOW (binomial p &lt; 0.05), achieving ac- curacies of 66% and 62% respectively (compared with 55% and 50% for BOW alone). This suggests that our representation captures useful rhetorical information that, given our train-test split, gen- eralizes across parties. None of the models sig- nificantly outperform the random baseline on the helpful task, perhaps owing to the small data size. Qualitative validation: question partisanship. We additionally provide a qualitative validation of our framework by comparing the question- asking activity of government and opposition- affiliated MPs-as viewed through the extracted question types-to well-established characteriza- tions of these affiliations in the political science lit- erature. In particular, prior work has examined the bifurcation in behavior between government and opposition members, in their differing focus on various issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Louwerse, 2012)</ref>, and in settings such as roll call votes <ref type="bibr">(Cowley, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Spirling and McLean, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eggers and Spirling, 2014</ref>). Since government MPs are elected on the same party ticket and manifesto, they primarily act to sup-port the government's various policies and bolster the status of their cabinet, seldom airing disagree- ments publicly. In contrast, opposition members tend to offer trenchant partisan criticism of gov- ernment policies, seeking to destabilize the gov- ernment's relationship with its MPs and create negative press in the country at large. In character- izing the question-asking activity of government and opposition MPs, this friendly vs. adversarial behavior should also be reflected in a rhetorical ty- pology of questions. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Concretely, to quantify the relationship between a particular question type t and asker affiliation P, we compute the log-odds ratio of type t questions asked by MPs in P, compared to MPs not in P. 13 <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref> shows the resultant log-odds ratios of each question type for government and opposition members. Notably, we see that agreement-type questions are significantly more likely to origi- nate from government than from opposition MPs, while the opposite holds for concede/accept and condemnatory questions (binomial p &lt; 10 −4 for each, comparing within-type to overall propor- tions of questions from an affiliation). No such <ref type="bibr">12</ref> While we induce the typology over our entire dataset, we perform all subsequent analyses on a filtered subset of 50,152 questions. In particular, we omit utterances with mul- tiple questions-i.e. multiple question marks-to ensure that we don't confound effects arising from different co-occurring question types. Our filtering decisions are also determined by the availability of information about the asker and answerers' roles in Parliament. Further information about these filtering choices can be found in the appendix. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The log-odds values are not symmetric between govern- ment and opposition, because they includes questions asked by MPs not in the official opposition. slant is exhibited in the narrow factual type, fur- ther reinforcing the role of such questions as infor- mational queries about relatively non-partisan is- sues. These results strongly cohere with the "text- book" accounts of parliamentary activity in the lit- erature, as well as our interpretation of these types as bolstering or antagonistic.</p><p>Moreover, we find that the same MP shifts in her propensity for different question types as her affiliation changes. When a new political party is elected into office, MPs who were previously in the opposition now belong to the government party, and vice versa. Such a switch occurs within our data between the Major and Blair governments <ref type="bibr">(Conservative to Labour, 1997)</ref>, and between the Brown and Cameron governments <ref type="bibr">(Labour to Conservative, 2010)</ref>. For both switches, we con- sider all MPs who asked at least 5 questions both before and after the switch, resulting in 88 mem- bers who became government MPs and 102 who became opposition MPs. For an MP M we com- pute P M,t , their propensity for a question type t, as the proportion of questions they ask which are from t. Comparing P M,t before and after a switch, we replicate the key differences observed above-for instance, we find that former opposi- tion MPs who become government MPs decrease in their propensity for condemnatory questions, while newly opposition MPs move in the other di- rection (Wilcoxon p &lt; 0.001, <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>). This suggests that the general trends we observed be- fore are driven by the shift in affiliation, and hence parliamentary role, of individual MPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Career Trajectory Effects</head><p>We now apply our framework to gain further in- sights into the nature of political discourse in Par- liament, focusing on how questioning behavior varies with a member's tenure in the institution. As stated in the introduction, two alternative hy- potheses arise: younger MPs may be more vig- orously critical out of enthusiasm, but are poten- tially tempered by their stake in future promo- tion prospects compared to older members <ref type="bibr">(Cowley, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">(Cowley, , 2012</ref>. Alternatively, older MPs who have less at stake in terms of prospects of further promotion may ask more antagonistic questions. Throughout, young and old refer to tenure-i.e., how many years someone has served as an MP- rather than biological age.</p><p>In order to understand the extent to which young or old members contribute a specific type of ques- tion, for each question type t we compute the median tenure of askers of each question in t, and compare the median tenures of different ques- tion types, for each affiliation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A</ref>). <ref type="bibr">14</ref> We see that among both affiliations, more aggres- sive questions tend to originate more from older members, reflected in significantly higher median tenures (for types 6 in both affiliations, and 7 in government MPs; Mann Whitney U test p &lt; 0.001 comparing within-type median tenure with outside-type median tenure); whereas standard is- sue update questions tend to come from younger members (p &lt; 0.001, both affiliations). Notably, the disproportionate aggressiveness of older mem- bers manifests even among government MPs who direct these questions towards their own govern- ment. This supports the "less to lose" intuition, offering a rhetorical parallel to previous findings about the increased tendency to vote contrary to party lines from MPs with little chance of minis- terial promotion <ref type="bibr">(Benedetto and Hix, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, we find that these differential preferences across member tenure also manifest at a finer granularity than simply less to more ag- gressive. For instance, younger opposition mem- bers tend to contribute more condemnatory ques- tions compared to older members (Mann Whitney U test p &lt; 0.01), who disproportionately favor concede/accept questions. While further work is needed to fully explain these differences, we spec- ulate that they are potentially reflective of strate- gic attempts by younger MPs to signal traits that could facilitate future promotion, such as partisan loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kam, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>To discount the possibility of these effects be- ing solely driven by a few very prolific young or old MPs, we also consider a setting where type propensities are macroaveraged over MPs. For each affiliation we compare the cohort of younger MPs who are newly voted in at the 1997 and 2010 elections, with older MPs who have been in of- fice prior to the election. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> We compute the type propensities of these two cohorts over the ques- tions they asked during the subsequent parliamen- tary sitting, and replicate the tenure effects ob- served previously ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>). This suggests that these parliamentary career effects reflect behav- ioral changes at the level of individual MPs, whose incentives evolve over their tenure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this work we introduced an unsupervised frame- work for structuring the space of questions accord- ing to their rhetorical role. We instantiated and validated our approach in the domain of parlia- mentary question periods, and revealed new inter- actions between questioning behavior and career trajectories.</p><p>We note that our methodology is not tied to a particular domain. It would be interesting to ex- plore its potential in a variety of less structured do-mains where questions likewise play a crucial role. For example, examining how interviewers in high- profile media settings (e.g., Frost on Nixon) can use their questions to elicit substantive responses from influential people would aid us in the broader normative goal of holding elites to account, by gaining a better understanding of what and how to ask, and what (not) to accept as an answer.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, future work could also augment the representation of questions and answers presently used in our framework, be- yond our heuristic of using root arcs without noun phrases. Richer linguistic representations, as well as more judicious ways of weighting different fragments and motifs, could enable us to capture a wider range of possible surface and rhetorical forms, especially in settings where phrasings are potentially less structured by institutional conven- tions. Additionally, as with most unsupervised methods, our approach is limited by the need to hand-select parameters such as the number of clus- ters, and manually interpret the typology's output. Having annotations of these corpora could better motivate the methodology and enable further eval- uation and interpretation; we hope to encourage such annotation efforts by releasing the dataset.</p><p>Inevitably, drawing causal lessons from obser- vational data is difficult. Moving forward, experi- mental tests of insights gathered through such ex- plorations would enable us to establish causal ef- fects of question-asking rhetoric, perhaps offering prescriptive insights into questioning strategies for objectives such as information-seeking <ref type="bibr">(Dillman, 1978)</ref>, request-making ( <ref type="bibr">Althoff et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mitra and Gilbert, 2014</ref>) and persuasion ( <ref type="bibr">Tan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zhang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wang et al., 2017)</ref>.   <ref type="table">Tables 2 and 3</ref> provide further examples of rep- resentative questios and motifs from each of the eight question types we induce on our dataset of parliamentary question periods. Additionally, we include extended interpretations of each of these types, provided by the second author, a political scientist with domain expertise in the UK parlia- mentary setting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Details about data filtering decisions</head><p>Here we provide further details about how we se- lected the subset of 50,152 questions which was used in the analyses described in Sections 6 &amp; 7. First, we restrict our analysis to the questions which consist of only one question, as opposed to a series of questions (as delimited by multiple sen- tences ending in question marks; constituting 52% of the data). We omit these multi-question utter- ances in order to ensure that we don't confound ef- fects arising from different co-occurring question types. Next, we only include questions for which information about the asker and answerers' party affiliations and ministership positions are available (such data is provided consistently from the Blair government onwards). Finally, we omit questions asked by opposition members who are specifically appointed by their party to shadow a government minister, and are hence obliged by their appoint- ment to ask more critical questions. Our choice to omit such questions eliminates the possibility that our observed differences in question prefer- ence are driven by official appointment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 Details about the labeled PMQ dataset</head><p>Here we provide further details about the size of the labeled Questions to the Prime Minister (PMQ) dataset from <ref type="bibr">Bates et al. (2014)</ref> used in the quantitative validation of our typology (Sec- tion 6). The dataset contains 931 standard, 186 helpful and 139 unanswerable questions. Addi- tionally, 445 answers to questions are labeled as answered, while 305 are labeled as not answered; the rest are labeled as deferred answer, meaning the Prime Minister did not have the knowledge or capability to provide an answer.</p><p>We restrict all analysis done using the unan- swered vs. answered labels to standard questions, i.e., questions for which the PM has an opportu- nity to provide a legitimate answer.</p><p>The helpful vs. standard classification task con- tains 264 train and 108 test examples; the unan- swerable vs. standard classification task contains 190 train and 86 test examples; the unanswered vs. answered classification task contains 166 train and 84 test examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4 Example motif subgraph</head><p>Figure 3 illustrates a section of the motif DAG M and highlights (in bold) the subgraph M q corre- sponding to the phrasing of the question in exam- ple (1). Nodes that are higher in the graph serve as general representations, and capture similarities between broad sets of phrasings: e.g., {is←going going→do, is←going, what is} groups together example (1) with a question like "When is he go- ing to get a grip on [the scandal]". By projecting such motifs into our latent question-answer space (Section 5) we capture characteristics shared be- tween these phrasings and allow for generalizabil- ity. Nodes which are lower in the graph constitute more specific representations, disambiguating be- tween phrasings. In particular, sink motifs serve as the most specific representation of a question, delineating the region of the latent space (and thus the question type) that best captures its phrasing. For instance, this additional specificity allows us to draw contrasts between "What is the minis- ter going to do [about the policy]?" (sink motif: {what is, is←going, going→do}) and the more aggressive "When is he going to get a grip on [the scandal]?" (sink motif: {when is, is←going}). Narrow queries about relatively minor policy issues which are either extremely local in nature (perhaps referring to implications for a given constituency) or limited in scope (constituting a small issue within a much broader context of policy). Questions are precise if not especially penetrating. Answers typically explain the ministry response in narrow, non-ideological terms. Q: What funding will be given to the new postgraduate institute at the Edinburgh College of Dentistry? Q: Will the Minister make a statement on where we are with the website for the [National Health Service appraisals toolkit for general practitioners]? Q: What will happen to the French if they are found guilty of infringing the rules of the Commission?</p><p>Question motifs: {what←made}, {what←happen, will←happen}, {what←given, given→to}, {will←make, Requests for comments, or information, especially on a meeting that has taken place between a minister and con- stituents, colleagues, or opposite numbers, the contents of which would not normally be immediately accessible to MPs. The asker seeks that the minister clarifies policy where none might presently exist. Q: Will the Secretary of State tell us which Minister has been appointed to be responsible for green economic growth? Q: Can [the Secretary of State] confirm whether train platform capacity will be a part of the discussions between the city council and Network Rail? Q: What would the Prime Minister say to a borough council which is considering rejecting Government funding and instead <ref type="bibr">[taxing]</ref> my constituents more?</p><p>Question motifs: {what←say,say→to}, {will←tell}, {can←confirm, confirm→be}, {what←say, would←say} <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Interpretation for the first four types, with examples of representative questions and motifs. Q: Does the Minister agree that UK taxpayers need to be considered at every single step of the way when it comes to our aid spending?</p><p>Question motifs: {does←agree, agree→is}, {is→important}, {does←agree, agree→with}, {does←agree, agree→need} 5: Self-promotion</p><p>Here, "awareness" is entirely rhetorical: either the minister is aware and agrees or the minister is not aware and will investigate. These questions allow the question asker to be seen to be bringing local concerns to broader attention, but in a way that is more assertive than in type 2 (narrow factual). Aggressive demand for minister to concede to, or accept, a fault. The premise of such questions is that the minister has been incompetent, or that the government has the wrong policy; these questions do not constitute a genuine attempt to obtain information. Question motifs: {will←accept}, {is→not, is→true}, {will←acknowledge}, {will←concede}</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7: Condemnatory</head><p>Similar to type 6 (concede, accept) but more aggressive and hectoring in tone, asking the minister to explain themselves and be contrite on the basis of very broad ideological premises that are difficult to answer without 'self- incrimination'. These questions often rely on rhetorical grandstanding and lacks any subtlety or policy detail on which minister can comment precisely.</p><p>Q: When members of the armed forces are facing a pay freeze, how can the Secretary justify bonuses to senior offices in the civil service? Q: Why does the right hon Gentleman not have an industrial strategy to build that recovery? Q: Will the Government now apologise for their complacent decision to scrap the future jobs fund, [given that] long-term youth unemployment is rising?</p><p>Question motifs: {can←explain}, {how←justify, can←justify}, {why does}, {will←apologise} <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Interpretation for the last four types, with examples of representative questions and motifs. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>"</head><label></label><figDesc>We'd now like to open the floor to shorter speeches disguised as questions..." -Steve Macone, New Yorker cartoon caption</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> We use affiliation to refer broadly to the government and opposition roles, independent of the identity of the current government and opposition parties. In subsequent analysis we only consider the largest, &quot;official&quot; opposition party as the opposition. 2 MPs almost always address each other in 3rd person.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We take as NPs subtrees connected to the root with the following: nsubj, nsubjpass, dobj, iobj, pobj, attr. 5 In the particular case of the Parliament dataset, removing NPs also removes conventional, partisan address terms (e.g. &quot;my hon. Friend&quot;). 6 In some cases, a pair of motifs almost always co-occurs in the same questions, making them redundant. We treat two motifs m1 and m2 as equivalent if, for some probability p, Pr(m1|m2) &gt; p and Pr(m2|m1) &gt; p; we keep the smaller of the two as the representative motif, or pick one of them arbitrarily if they are of equal sizes.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> We consider questions to be sentences ending in question marks. If an utterance consists of multiple questions, we extract fragments sets from each question separately, and take the motifs of the utterance to be the union of motifs of each component question. We set n = 100, p = 0.9, nA = 100 and d = 25. The choice of parameters was done via manual inspection of the dataset. 9 Each type contains a few hundred question motifs and answer fragments.</note>
