			<abstract>
				<p>Task oriented dialog systems typically first parse user utterances to semantic frames comprised of intents and slots. Previous work on task oriented intent and slot-filling work has been restricted to one intent per query and one slot label per token, and thus cannot model complex compositional requests. Alternative semantic parsing systems have represented queries as logical forms, but these are challenging to annotate and parse. We propose a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing that allows the representation of compositional queries, and can be efficiently and accurately parsed by standard constituency parsing models. We release a dataset of 44k annotated queries 1 , and show that parsing models outperform sequence-to-sequence approaches on this dataset.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Intelligent personal assistants are now ubiquitous, but modeling the semantics of complex compo- sitional natural language queries remains chal- lenging. Typical systems classify the intent of a query (e.g. GET DIRECTIONS) and tag the necessary slots (e.g. San Francisco) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mesnil et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liu and Lane, 2016)</ref>. It is dif- ficult for such representations to adequately rep- resent nested queries such as "Driving direc- tions to the Eagles game", which is composed of GET DIRECTIONS and GET EVENT intents. We explore a hierarchical representation for such queries, which dramatically improves the expres- sive power while remaining accurate and efficient to annotate and parse (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>We introduce a Task Oriented Parsing (TOP) representation for intent-slot based dialog sys- tems. This hierarchical representation is expres- sive enough to capture the semantics of com- 1 http://fb.me/semanticparsingdialog plex nested queries, but is easier to annotate and parse than alternative representations such as logi- cal forms or dependency graphs. We show empir- ically that our representation is expressive enough to model the vast majority of human-generated re- quests in two domains.</p><p>A key advantage of our representation is that it has a structure similar to standard constituency parses, allowing us to easily adapt algorithms de- veloped for phrase structure parsing for inference. In particular, we use linear-time Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (RNNG) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dyer et al., 2016)</ref> and show that the inductive bias provided by this model significantly improves the accuracy com- pared to strong sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on CNNs, LSTMs and Transform- ers.</p><p>Our contributions in this paper are: 1. A hierarchical semantic representation for task oriented dialog systems that can model compositional and nested queries. 2. A publicly available dataset of 44k requests annotated with our representation. We show that our representation has very high cover- age of these requests, and that inter-annotator agreement is high. 3. We show that the representation is learnable by standard algorithms. In particular, we show that the RNNG parsing model outper- forms seq2seq baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Representation</head><p>Designing semantic annotation schemes requires trade-offs between how expressive the representa- tion is on one hand, and how easily can it be anno- tated, parsed, and executed on the other. Most ex- isting annotations for task oriented dialog systems have fallen on the extremes of non-recursive intent and slot tagging, such as in the ATIS dataset <ref type="table">(Mes-IN:GET DIRECTIONS                 2  2  2  2  2  2  2</ref> Driving directions to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SL:DESTINATION IN:GET EVENT h h h h h h h &amp; &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SL:NAME EVENT Eagles SL:CAT EVENT game IN:GET DISTANCE       2 2 2 2 2 2</formula><p>How far is  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liu and Lane, 2016)</ref>, and full log- ical forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2012)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">SL:DESTINATION IN:GET RESTAURANT LOCATION       ¥ ¥ $ $ $ $ $</formula><p>We introduce a hierarchical representation, sim- ilar to a constituency syntax tree, with words as terminals. Non-terminals are either intents or slots, and the root node is an intent. We allow intents to be nested inside a slot, resulting in the ability to compose requests and call multiple APIs. Using this compositional tree representation, we can enable answering compositional queries over multiple domains.</p><p>We introduce the following constraints in our representation: 1. The top level node must be an intent, 2. An intent can have tokens and/or slots as children, 3. A slot can have either tokens as children or one intent as a child.</p><p>Executing queries such as those in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> is straightforward because of the explicit tagging of the outer location slot: first we fetch 'the Eagles game' event (or the relevant coffee shop), extract the location, and pass it as the destination slot to the navigation domain intent.</p><p>Compositional queries are frequent. In our dataset of crowd-sourced utterances, we found that 30% could not be adequately represented with tra- ditional intent-slot tagging. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> This shows that more expressive representations are often necessary.</p><p>While our representation is capable of model- ing many complex queries, some utterances are beyond its scope. For example, in Set an alarm at 8 am for Monday and Wednesday, 8 am needs to be associated with both Monday and Wednes- day which would require graph-structured repre-sentations. However, we found that just 0.3% of our dataset would require a more expressive rep- resentation to model adequately. 3 More expres- sive representations, such as dependency graphs or logical forms, would only bring marginal gains but would add significant challenges for annota- tion and learning.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that our tree- structured approach offers a useful compromise between traditional intent-slot tagging and logical forms, by providing very high coverage of queries while avoiding the complexities of annotating and learning more expressive representations.</p><p>In summary, our representation has the follow- ing attractive properties:</p><p>• Expressiveness Compared to traditional intent-slot annotations, it can express com- plex hierarchical queries, improving cover- age of queries by 30%. We found that more general representations are required for only 0.3% of queries.</p><p>• Easy Annotation Annotating our representa- tion simply requires labeling spans of a sen- tence, which is much more straightforward than alternatives such as creating a logical form for the sentence, or an arbitrary depen- dency graph. This fact allows us to quickly create a large dataset.</p><p>• Efficient and Accurate Parsing Since our representation closely resembles syntactic trees, we can easily re-use models from the large literature on constituency parsing.</p><p>• Execution Our approach can be seen as a simple generalization of traditional dialog systems, meaning that existing infrastructure can easily be adapted to execute the intents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dataset</head><p>We asked crowdsourced workers to generate nat- ural language sentences that they would ask a system that could assist in navigation and event queries. These requests were then labeled by two annotators. If these annotations weren't identi- cal then we adjudicated with a third annotator. If all three annotators disagreed then we discarded the utterance and its annotations. 63.40% of ut- terances were resolved with 2 annotations and 94.09% were resolved after getting 3 annotations.</p><p>We also compared percentage of utterances that were resolved after 2 annotations for depth ≤ 2 (traditional slot filling) and for depth &gt; 2 (com- positional): 68.87% vs 62.03%, noting that the agreement rate is similar.</p><p>We collected a total of 44783 annotations with 25 intents and 36 slots, randomly split into 31279 training, 4462 validation and 9042 test utterances. The dataset has utterances that are focused on nav- igation, events, and navigation to events.</p><p>The median (mean) depth of the trees is 2 (2.54), and the median (mean) length of the utter- ances is 8 (8.93) tokens. 35% of trees have depth more than 2. The dataset has 4646 utterances that contain both navigation and event intents. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  2</ref> shows the distribution of instances in the full dataset over the utterance length and tree depth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Models</head><p>We experiment with two types of models: stan- dard sequence-to-sequence learning models, and a model adapted from syntactic parsing, Recur- rent Neural Network Grammars (Dyer et al., 2016) (RNNG). RNNG is a top-down transition-based parser and was originally proposed for parsing syntax trees and language modeling. We trained the RNNG parser discriminatively and not gen- eratively to reduce training time of the model. While sequence-to-sequence learning can model arbitrary sequence transduction, we hypothesize that parsing models like RNNG, which can only output well-formed trees, will give better inductive bias and flexibility for predicting compositional and cross-domains scenarios on the fly, particu- larly for domains with less training data available.</p><p>We briefly review the RNNG model -The parse tree is constructed using a sequence of transitions, or 'actions'. The transitions are defined as a set of SHIFT, REDUCE, and the generation of intent and slot labels. SHIFT action consumes an input token (that is, adds the token as a child of the right most 'open' sub-tree node) and REDUCE closes a sub-tree. The third set of actions is generating non-terminals -the slot and intent labels. Note that at each step, there are only a subset of valid actions. For examples, if all the input tokens have been added to the tree, the only valid action is RE- DUCE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baselines</head><p>We compared RNNG with implementa- tions of sequence-to-sequence models using CNNs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gehring et al., 2017)</ref>, LSTMs (Wise- man and Rush, 2016) and Transformer net- works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Vaswani et al., 2017</ref>) in fairseq <ref type="bibr">4</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metrics</head><p>We used three metrics to evaluate the systems. Ex- act match accuracy is defined as the number of utterances whose full trees are correctly predicted. The second metric is a commonly used scoring method for syntactic parsing -labeled bracketing F 1 scores ( <ref type="bibr">Black et al., 1991</ref>) (called F 1 hence- forth). We used the pre-terminals as well in the calculations. One downside of this metric is that it only considers the token spans for a given non- terminal but not the internal structure. Tree sub- structures are rather important for task completion. Thus, we introduce a third metric, Tree-Labeled (TL) F 1 , which compares the sub-tree structure for a non-terminal, instead of just the token span. Ex- act match accuracy is the strictest metric and F 1 is the least strict metric. Tree Validity is the percent- age of predictions which formed valid trees (via bracket matching).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preprocessing and Hyperparameters</head><p>We used the same preprocessing of unknown words as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dyer et al., 2016)</ref> and mapped numbers to a constant. We used pre-trained GloVe embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) and tuned hyperparameters on the validation set.</p><p>• RNNG -We used 2-layer 164-unit LSTM with a bidirectional LSTM compositional   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The experimental results in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> show that existing approaches for syntactic pars- ing, such as RNNG, perform well for this task, achieving perfect outputs on over 75% of queries. RNNG performs better than sequence-to-sequence models, especially in predicting exact trees, which is important for task completion. We present re- sults for the CNN and LSTM models with an out- put terminal token vocabulary of just a single el- ement (LOTV), which performed better than the regular token vocabulary (exact match accuracy of 75.63% and 68.39%, respectively). We believe LOTV makes the models focus on learning to pre- dict the tree structure rather than to reproduce the input tokens. But we observed that this vocabu- lary reduction resulted in significantly poorer per- formance for the Transformer model.</p><p>Below we discuss how varying the beam size during inference affects accuracy. The seq2seq re- sults in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> are accuracy for the top prediction when a beam of size 5 was run and the RNNG results are for greedy inference. For RNNG, the accuracy of top prediction did not change much when a beam of size 5 was run. We also mea- sured how often the correct tree annotation was in the top k predictions for the models when a beam of size k was run during inference, called as Top- k. For RNNG, Top-3 was 90.21 and Top-5 was 92.48, compared to 78.51 for k=1. For seq2seq- CNN, the Top-3 score was 88.08 and Top-5 score was 90.21. For seq2seq-LSTM, Top-3 was 86.55 and Top-5 was 88.76. We note that Top-5 is sub- stantially higher than the accuracy of the top pre- diction. These top-k predictions could be used by a hypothesis ranker downstream, which can take into account agent capabilities.</p><p>We also experimented with more minimal rep- resentations of the RNNG model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kuncoro et al., 2017)</ref>. Removing the actions LSTM dropped Ex- act match score slightly to 78.08. Separately, re- moving the stack LSTM dropped it to 75.31. Re- moving the buffer LSTM caused a unusable de- crease to 13.78.</p><p>While sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong parsing performance when trained on very large amounts of data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Vinyals et al., 2015)</ref>; in our setting the inductive bias provided by the RNNG model is crucial to achieving high performance. The model has several useful biases, such as guaranteeing a well-formed output tree, and shortening the dependencies between intents and their slots.</p><p>A further advantage of RNNG is that inference has linear time complexity, whereas seq2seq mod- els are quadratic because attention is recomputed at every time step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Many annotation schemes have previously been proposed for representing the semantics of natu- ral language. We briefly compare our method with these.</p><p>Most work on task oriented dialog systems has focused on identifying a single user intent and then filling the relevant slots -for example, the repre- sentations used on the ATIS dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mesnil et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liu and Lane, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zhu and Yu, 2017)</ref> and in the Dialog State Tracking Challenge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Williams et al., 2016)</ref>. We showed that hierarchical repre- sentations with nested intents can improve cover- age of requests in our domains.</p><p>The semantic parsing literature has focused on representing language with logical forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Liang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kwiatkowski et al., 2010)</ref>. Logical forms are more expressive than our representation, as they are less tightly coupled to the input query, and can be exe- cuted directly. However, logical forms are difficult to annotate and no large-scale datasets are avail- able.</p><p>While we used a tree-structured representation, others have used arbitrary graphs, such as Abstract Meaning Representation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banarescu et al., 2013)</ref> and Alexa Meaning Representation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fan et al., 2017)</ref>. These approaches can represent complex constructions that are beyond the scope of our ap- proach, but with significantly challenging parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Artzi et al., 2015)</ref>. We showed that such cases are very rare in our data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>Drawing on ideas from slot-filling and seman- tic parsing, we introduce a hierarchical gener- alization of traditional intents and slots that al- lows the representation of complex nested queries, leading to 30% higher coverage of user requests. We show that the representation can be annotated with high agreement. We are releasing a large dataset of annotated utterances at http://fb. me/semanticparsingdialog.

			<note place="foot" n="2"> In our dataset, 35% of queries have depth &gt;2, which means that the traditional intent-slot tagging systems would not have been able to annotate or predict these annotations. In addition, to avoid the depth-based statistic being influenced by our label set specification, we manually performed analysis of 100 samples that showed that 30% of the queries required compositional representation.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Utterances that could not be annotated with the label sets and corresponding instructions were marked as &apos;unsupported&apos; (9.14% of the dataset), including the ones that needed more expressive representation than a tree. Analysis of a random sample of 120 unsupported utterances shows that only four instances cannot be supported because of the tree representation constraint, estimating that there are only 0.3% queries that would require a more general (e.g graph-based) representation.</note>
