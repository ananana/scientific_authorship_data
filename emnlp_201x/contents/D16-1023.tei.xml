			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we study cross-domain sentiment classification with neural network archi-tectures. We borrow the idea from Structural Correspondence Learning and use two auxiliary tasks to help induce a sentence embedding that supposedly works well across domains for sentiment classification. We also propose to jointly learn this sentence embedding together with the sentiment classifier itself. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed joint model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the growing need of correctly identifying the sentiments expressed in subjective texts such as product reviews, sentiment classification has re- ceived continuous attention in the NLP community for over a decade ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pang et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pang and Lee, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hu and Liu, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Choi and Cardie, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nakagawa et al., 2010)</ref>. One of the big challenges of sentiment classification is how to adapt a senti- ment classifier trained on one domain to a different new domain. This is because sentiments are often expressed with domain-specific words and expres- sions. For example, in the Movie domain, words such as moving and engaging are usually positive, but they may not be relevant in the Restaurant do- main. Since labeled data is expensive to obtain, it would be very useful if we could adapt a model trained on a source domain to a target domain.</p><p>Much work has been done in sentiment analysis to address this domain adaptation problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blitzer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pan et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bollegala et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ponomareva and Thelwall, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bollegala et al., 2016</ref>). Among them, an appealing method is the Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blitzer et al., 2007)</ref>, which uses pivot fea- ture prediction tasks to induce a projected feature space that works well for both the source and the tar- get domains. The intuition behind is that these pivot prediction tasks are highly correlated with the orig- inal task. For sentiment classification, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blitzer et al. (2007)</ref> first chose pivot words which have high mu- tual information with the sentiment labels, and then set up the pivot prediction tasks to be the predictions of each of these pivot words using the other words.</p><p>However, the original SCL method is based on traditional discrete feature representations and lin- ear classifiers. In recent years, with the advances of deep learning in NLP, multi-layer neural net- work models such as RNNs and CNNs have been widely used in sentiment classification and achieved good performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Socher et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dong et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dong et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tang et al., 2015)</ref>. In these models, dense, real-valued feature vectors and non-linear classification func- tions are used. By using real-valued word embed- dings pre-trained from a large corpus, these mod- els can take advantage of the embedding space that presumably better captures the syntactic and se- mantic similarities between words. And by using non-linear functions through multi-layer neural net- works, these models represent a more expressive hy- pothesis space. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore how these neural network models could be extended for cross-domain sentiment classification.</p><p>There has been some recent studies on neural network-based domain adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Glorot et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yang and Eisenstein, 2014</ref>). They use Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders (SDA) to induce a hidden representation that presumably works well across domains. However, SDA is fully unsupervised and does not consider the end task we need to solve, i.e., the sentiment classification task. In contrast, the idea behind SCL is to use carefully- chosen auxiliary tasks that correlate with the end task to induce a hidden representation. Another line of work aims to learn a low dimensional represen- tation for each feature in both domains based on predicting its neighboring features <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Yang and Eisenstein, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollegala et al., 2015)</ref>. Different from these methods, we aim to directly learn sentence em- beddings that work well across domains.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to extend the main idea be- hind SCL to neural network-based solutions to sen- timent classification to address the domain adapta- tion problem. Specifically, we borrow the idea of using pivot prediction tasks from SCL. But instead of learning thousands of pivot predictors and per- forming singular value decomposition on the learned weights, which all relies on linear transformations, we introduce only two auxiliary binary prediction tasks and directly learn a non-linear transformation that maps an input to a dense embedding vector. Moreover, different from SCL and the auto-encoder- based methods, in which the hidden feature repre- sentation and the final classifier are learned sequen- tially, we propose to jointly learn the hidden feature representation together with the sentiment classifi- cation model itself, and we show that joint learning works better than sequential learning.</p><p>We conduct experiments on a number of different source and target domains for sentence-level sen- timent classification. We show that our proposed method is able to achieve the best performance com- pared with a number of baselines for most of these domain pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Domain Adaptation: Domain adaptation is a gen- eral problem in NLP and has been well studied in recent years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Blitzer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Daum√© III, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jiang and Zhai, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dredze and Crammer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Titov, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yu and Jiang, 2015)</ref>. For sen- timent classification, most existing domain adap- tation methods are based on traditional discrete feature representations and linear classifiers. One line of work focuses on inducing a general low- dimensional cross-domain representation based on the co-occurrences of domain-specific and domain- independent features <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blitzer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pan et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pan et al., 2011</ref>). Another line of work tries to derive domain-specific sentiment words <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bollegala et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al., 2012)</ref>. Our proposed method is similar to the first line of work in that we also aim to learn a general, cross-domain representation (sen- tence embeddings in our case). Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification: A recent trend of deep learning enhances various kinds of neural network models for sentiment clas- sification, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recursive Neural Network (ReNNs) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs), which have been shown to achieve competitive results across different benchmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Socher et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dong et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dong et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tang et al., 2015</ref>). Inspired by their success in standard in- domain settings, it is intuitive for us to apply these neural network models to domain adaptation set- tings. Denoising Auto-encoders for Domain Adapta- tion: Denoising Auto-encoders have been exten- sively studied in cross-domain sentiment classifica- tion, since the representations learned through multi- layer neural networks are robust against noise during domain adaptation. The initial application of this idea is to directly employ stacked denoising auto- encoders (SDA) by reconstructing the original fea- tures from data that are corrupted with noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Glorot et al., 2011), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2012)</ref> proposed to analytically marginalize out the corruption during SDA training. Later <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yang and Eisenstein (2014)</ref> fur- ther showed that their proposed structured dropout noise strategy can dramatically improve the effi- ciency without sacrificing the accuracy. However, these methods are still based on traditional discrete representation and do not exploit the idea of using auxiliary tasks that are related to the end task. In contrast, the sentence embeddings learned from our method are derived from real-valued feature vectors and rely on related auxiliary tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>In this section we present our sentence embedding- based domain adaptation method for sentiment clas- sification. We first introduce the necessary notation and an overview of our method. we then delve into the details of the method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Notation and Method Overview</head><p>We assume that each input is a piece of text consist- ing of a sequence of words. For the rest of this paper, we assume each input is a sentence, although our method is general enough for longer pieces of text. Let x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . .) denote a sentence where each x i ‚àà {1, 2, . . . , V } is a word in the vocabulary and V is the vocabulary size. Let the sentiment label of x be y ‚àà {+, ‚àí} where + denotes a positive sentiment and ‚àí a negative sentiment. We further assume that we are given a set of labeled training sentences from a source domain, denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D s = {(x s i , y s i )} N s i=1</formula><p>. Also, we have a set of unlabeled sentences from a target domain, denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D t = {x t i } N t i=1</formula><p>. Our goal is to learn a good sentiment classifier from both D s and D t such that the classifier works well on the tar- get domain.</p><p>A baseline solution without considering any do- main difference is to simply train a classifier using D s , and with the recent advances in neural network- based methods to sentence classification, we con- sider a baseline that uses a multi-layer neural net- work such as a CNN or an RNN to perform the clas- sification task. To simplify the discussion and focus on the domain adaptation ideas we propose, we will leave the details of the neural network model we use in Section 3.5. For now, we assume that a multi- layer neural network is used to transform each input x into a sentence embedding vector z. Let us use f Œò to denote the transformation function parameter- ized by Œò, that is, z = f Œò (x). Next, we assume that a linear classifier such as a softmax classifier is learned to map z to a sentiment label y.</p><p>We introduce two auxiliary tasks which presum- ably are highly correlated with the sentiment classi- fication task itself. Labels for these auxiliary tasks can be automatically derived from unlabeled data in both the source and the target domains. With the help of the two auxiliary tasks, we learn a non-linear transformation function f Œò from unlabeled data and use it to derive a sentence embedding vector z from sentence x, which supposedly works better across domains. Finally we use the source domain's train- ing data to learn a linear classifier on the represen- tation z ‚äï z , where ‚äï is the operator that concate- nates two vectors. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> gives the outline of our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Auxiliary Tasks</head><p>Our two auxiliary tasks are about whether an in- put sentence contains a positive or negative domain- independent sentiment word. The intuition is the following. If we have a list of domain-independent positive sentiment words, then an input sentence that contains one of these words, regardless of the do- main the sentence is from, is more likely to contain an overall positive sentiment. For example, a sen- tence containing the word good is likely to be over- all positive. Moreover, the rest of the sentence ex- cluding the word good may contain domain-specific words or expressions that also convey a positive sen- timent. For example, in the sentence "The laptop is good and goes really fast," we can see that the word fast is a domain-specific sentiment word, and its sentiment polarity correlates with that of the word good, which is domain-independent. Therefore, we can hide the domain-independent positive words in a sentence and try to use the other words in the sen- tence to predict whether the original sentence con- tains a domain-independent positive word. There are two things to note about this auxiliary task: (1) The label of the task can be automatically derived pro- vided that we have the domain-independent positive word list. (2) The task is closely related to the orig- inal task of sentence-level sentiment classification. Similarly, we can introduce a task to predict the ex- istence of a domain-independent negative sentiment word in a sentence.</p><p>Formally, let us assume that we have two domain- independent sentiment word lists, one for the posi- tive sentiment and the other for the negative senti- ment. Details of how these lists are obtained will be given in Section 3.5. Borrowing the term from SCL, we refer to these sentiment words as pivot words. For each sentence x, we replace all the oc- currences of these pivot words with a special token UNK. Let g(¬∑) be a function that denotes this pro- cedure, that is, g(x) is the resulting sentence with  UNK tokens. We then introduce two binary labels for g(x). The first label u indicates whether the original sentence x contains at least one domain- independent positive sentiment word, and the sec- ond label v indicates whether x contains at least one domain-independent negative sentiment word. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref> shows an example sentence x, its modified ver- sion g(x) and the labels u and v for x. We further use</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D a = {(x i , u i , v i )} N a i=1</formula><p>to denote a set of train- ing sentences for the auxiliary tasks. Note that the sentences in D a can be from the sentences in D s and D t , but they can also be from other unlabeled sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Sentence Embeddings for Domain Adaptation</head><p>With the two auxiliary tasks, we can learn a neural network model in a standard way to produce sen- tence embeddings that work well for the auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we still use Œò to denote the pa- rameters of the neural network that produces the sen- tence embeddings (and f Œò the corresponding trans- formation function), and we use Œ≤ + and Œ≤ ‚àí to de- note the parameters of two softmax classifiers for the two auxiliary tasks, respectively. Using cross- entropy loss, we can learn Œò by minimizing the fol- lowing loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">J(Œò , Œ≤ + , Œ≤ ‚àí ) = ‚àí (x,u,v)‚ààD a log p(u|f Œò (g(x)); Œ≤ + ) + log p(v|f Œò (g(x)); Œ≤ ‚àí ) ,</formula><p>where p(y|z; Œ≤) is the probability of label y given vector z and parameter Œ≤ under softmax regression.</p><p>With the learned Œò , we can derive a sentence em- bedding z from any sentence. Although we could simply use this embedding z for sentiment classi- fication through another softmax classifier, this may not be ideal because z is transformed from g(x), which has the domain-independent sentiment words removed. Similar to SCL and some other previous work, we concatenate the embedding vector z with the standard embedding vector z for the final classi- fication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Joint Learning</head><p>Although we can learn Œò using D a as a first step, here we also explore a joint learning setting. In this setting, Œò is learned together with the neural net- work model used for the end task, i.e., sentiment classification. This way, the learning of Œò depends not only on D a but also on D s , i.e., the sentiment- labeled training data from the source domain.</p><p>Specifically, we use Œò to denote the parameters for a neural network that takes the original sentence x and transforms it to a sentence embedding (and f Œò the corresponding transformation function). We use Œ≥ to denote the parameters of a softmax classifier that operates on the concatenated sentence embed- ding z ‚äï z for sentiment classification. With joint learning, we try to minimize the following loss func-tion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">J(Œò, Œò , Œ≥, Œ≤ + , Œ≤ ‚àí ) = ‚àí (x,y)‚ààD s log p(y|f Œò (x) ‚äï f Œò (g(x)); Œ≥) ‚àí (x,u,v)‚ààD a log p(u|f Œò (g(x)); Œ≤ + ) + log p(v|f Œò (g(x)); Œ≤ ‚àí ) .</formula><p>We can see that this loss function contains two parts. The first part is the cross-entropy loss based on the true sentiment labels of the sentences in D s . The second part is the loss based on the auxiliary tasks and the data D a , which are derived from unlabeled sentences.</p><p>Finally, to make a prediction on a sentence, we use the learned Œò and Œò to derive a sentence embed- ding f Œò (x) ‚äï f Œò (g(x)), and then use the softmax classifier parameterized by the learned Œ≥ to make the final prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Implementation Details</head><p>In this section we explain some of the model details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pivot Word Selection</head><p>Recall that the two auxiliary tasks depend on two domain-independent sentiment word lists, i.e., pivot word lists. Different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blitzer et al. (2007)</ref>, we employ weighted log-likelihood ratio (WLLR) to se- lect the most positive and negative words in both do- mains as pivots. The reason is that in our prelimi- nary experiments we observe that mutual informa- tion (used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blitzer et al. (2007)</ref>) is biased towards low frequency words. Some high frequency words including good and great are scored low. In com- parison, WLLR does not have this issue. The same observation was also reported previously by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al. (2009)</ref>.</p><p>More specifically, we first tokenize the sentences in D s and D t and perform part-of-speech tagging using the NLTK toolkit. Next, we extract only ad- jectives, adverbs and verbs with a frequency of at least 3 in the source domain and at least 3 in the tar- get domain. We also remove negation words such as not and stop words using a stop word list. We then measure each remaining candidate word's relevance to the positive and the negative classes based on D s by computing the following scores: r(w, y) = Àú p(w|y) logÀúp logÀú logÀúp(w|y)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Àú p(w|¬Ø y) ,</formula><p>where w is a word, y ‚àà {+, ‚àí} is a sentiment label, ¬Ø y is the opposite label of y, andÀúpandÀú andÀúp(w|y) is the empir- ical probability of observing w in sentences labeled with y. We can then rank the candidate words in de- creasing order of r(w, +) and r(w, ‚àí). Finally, we select the top 25% from each ranked list as the final lists of pivot words for the positive and the nega- tive sentiments. Some manual inspection shows that most of these words are indeed domain-independent sentiment words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural Network Model</head><p>Our framework is general and potentially we can use any neural network model to transform an in- put sentence to a sentence embedding vector. In this paper, we adopt a CNN-based approach because it has been shown to work well for sentiment classi- fication. Specifically, each word (including the to- ken UNK) is represented by a word embedding vec- tor. Let W ‚àà R d√óV denote the lookup table for words, where each column is a d-dimensional em- bedding vector for a word type. Two separate CNNs are used to process x and g(x), and their mecha- nisms are the same. For a word x i in each CNN, the embedding vectors inside a window of size n cen- tered at i are concatenated into a new vector, which we refer to as e i ‚àà R nd . A convolution operation is then performed by applying a filter F ‚àà R h√ónd on e i to produce a hidden vector h i = m(Fe i + b), where b ‚àà R h is a bias vector and m is an element- wise non-linear transformation function. Note that we pad the original sequence in front and at the back to ensure that at each position i we have n vectors to be combined into h i . After the convolution op- eration is applied to the whole sequence, we obtain H = [h 1 , h 2 , . . .], and we apply a max-over-time pooling operator to take the maximum value of each row of H to obtain an overall hidden vector, i.e., z for x and z for g <ref type="bibr">(x)</ref>.</p><p>It is worth noting that the two neural networks corresponding to f Œò and f Œò share the same word embedding lookup table. This lookup table is ini- tialized with word embeddings from word2vec 1 and is updated during our learning process. Note that the token UNK is initialized as a zero vector and never updated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Differences from SCL</head><p>Although our method is inspired by SCL, there are a number of major differences: (1) Our method is based on neural network models with continuous, dense feature representations and non-linear trans- formation functions. SCL is based on discrete, sparse feature vectors and linear transformations. (2) Although our pivot word selection is similar to that of SCL, in the end we only use two auxiliary tasks while SCL uses much more pivot prediction tasks. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> We can directly learn the transformation function f Œò that produces the hidden representation, while SCL relies on SVD to learn the projection function. <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> We perform joint learning of the auxil- iary tasks and the end task, i.e., sentiment classifica- tion, while SCL performs the learning in a sequential manner. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments using five benchmark data sets. The data sets are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Movie1 2 and Movie2 3 are movie reviews labeled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pang and Lee (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Socher et al. (2013)</ref>, respectively. Cam- era 4 are reviews of digital products such as MP3 players and cameras ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hu and Liu, 2004</ref>). Laptop and Restaurant 5 are laptop and restaurant reviews taken from SemEval 2015 Task 12.</p><p>We consider 18 pairs of data sets where the two data sets come from different domains. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> For neural network-based methods, we randomly pick 200 sen- tences from the target domain as the development set for parameter tuning, and the rest of the data from the target domain as the test data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Baselines and Hyperparameters</head><p>We consider the following baselines: Naive is a non-domain-adaptive baseline based on bag-of-word representations. SCL is our implementation of the Structural Corre- spondence Learning method. We set the number of induced features K to 100 and rescale factor Œ± = 5, and we use 1000 pivot words based on our prelimi- nary experiments. mDA is our implementation of marginalized De- noising Auto-encoders ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2012</ref>), one of the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, which learns a shared hidden representation by re- constructing pivot features from corrupted inputs. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yang and Eisenstein (2014)</ref>, we employ the efficient and effective structured dropout noise strategy without any parameter. The top 500 fea- tures are chosen as pivots based on our preliminary experiments.</p><p>NaiveNN is a non-domain-adaptive baseline based on CNN, as described in Section 3.5.</p><p>Aux-NN is a simple combination of our auxiliary tasks with NaiveNN, which treats the derived la- bel of two auxiliary tasks as two features and then appends them to the hidden representation learned from CNN, followed by a softmax classifier. SCL-NN is a naive combination of SCL with NaiveNN, which appends the induced representation from SCL to the hidden representation learned from CNN, followed by a softmax classifier. mDA-NN is similar to SCL-NN but uses the hidden representation derived from mDA. Sequential is our proposed method without joint learning, which first learns Œò based on D a and then learns Œò and Œ≥ based on D s with fixed Œò . Joint is our proposed joint learning method, that is, we jointly learn Œò and Œò .  For Naive, SCL and mDA, we use LibLinear 7 to train linear classifiers and use its default hyperpa- rameters. In all the tasks, we use unigrams and bi- grams with a frequency of at least 4 as features for classification. For the word embeddings, we set the dimension d to 300. For CNN, we set the window size to 3. Also, the size of the hidden representa- tions z and z is set to 100. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kim (2014)</ref>, the non-linear activation function in CNN is Relu, the mini-batch size is 50, the dropout rate Œ± equals 0.5, and the hyperparameter for the l 2 norms is set to be 3. For Naive, SCL and mDA, we do not use the 200 sentences in the development set for tuning parameters. Hence, for fair comparison, we also in- clude settings where the 200 sentences are added to the training set. We denote these settings by ++.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, we report the results of all the methods. It is easy to see that the performance of Naive is very limited, and the incorporation of 200 reviews in the development set (Naive++) brings in 4.3% of improvement on average. SCL++ and mDA++ can further improve the average accuracy respectively by 0.8% and 1.9%, which verifies the usefulness of these two domain adaptation methods. However, we can easily see that the performance of these domain adaptation methods based on discrete, bag-of-word representations is even much lower than the non- domain-adaptive method on continuous representa- tions (NaiveNN). This confirms that it is useful to develop domain adaptation methods based on em- bedding vectors and neural network models.</p><p>Moreover, we can find that the performance of simply appending two features from auxiliary tasks to <ref type="bibr">NaiveNN (i.e., Aux-NN)</ref> is quite close to that of NaiveNN on most data set pairs, which shows that it is not ideal for domain adaptation. In addi- tion, although the shared hidden representations de- rived from SCL and mDA are based on traditional bag-of-word representations, SCL-NN and mDA- NN can still improve the performance of NaiveNN on most data set pairs, which indicates that the de- rived shared hidden representations by SCL and by mDA can generalize better across domains and are generally useful for domain adaptation.</p><p>Finally, it is easy to see that our method with joint learning outperforms SCL-NN on almost all the data set pairs. And in comparison with mDA- NN, our method with joint learning can also outper-  form it on most data set pairs, especially when the size of the labeled data in the source domain is rela- tively large. Furthermore, we can easily observe that for our method, joint learning generally works bet- ter than sequential learning. All these observations show the advantage of our joint learning method.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>, we also show the comparison between mDA-NN and our model under a setting some la- beled target data is used. Specifically, we randomly select 100 sentences from the development set and mix them with the training set. We can observe that our method Joint outperforms NaiveNN and mDA- NN by 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively, which further confirms the effectiveness of our model. But, in comparison with the setting where no target data is available, the average improvement of our method over NaiveNN is relatively small.</p><p>Hence, to give a deeper analysis, we further show the comparison of Joint and NaiveNN with respect to the number of labeled target data in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Note that for space limitation, we only present the results on MV2 ‚Üí RT and MV2 ‚Üí CR. Similar trends have been observed on other data set pairs. As we can see from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, the difference between the per- formance of NaiveNN and that of Joint gradually decreases with the increase of the number of labeled target data. This indicates that our joint model is much more effective when no or small number of labeled target data is available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Case Study</head><p>To obtain a better understanding of our method, we conduct a case study where the source is CR and the target is RT.</p><p>For each sentiment polarity, we try to extract the most useful trigrams for the final predictions. Re- call that our CNN models use a window size of 3, which corresponds to trigrams. By tracing the final prediction scores back through the neural network, we are able to locate the trigrams which have con- tributed the most through max-pooling. In <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, we present the most useful trigrams of each polarity extracted by NaiveNN and by the two components of our sequential and joint method. Sequential- original and Joint-original refer to the CNN cor- responding to f Œò while Sequential-auxiliary and Joint-auxiliary refer to the CNN corresponding to f Œò , which is related to the auxiliary tasks.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, we can easily observe that for NaiveNN, the most important trigrams are domain- independent, which contain some general senti- ment words like good, great and disappointing. For our sequential model, the most important tri- grams captured by Sequential-original are simi- lar to NaiveNN, but due to the removal of the pivot words in each sentence, the most impor- tant trigrams extracted by Sequential-auxiliary are domain-specific, including target-specific sentiment words like oily, friendly and target-specific aspect words like flavor, atmosphere. But since aspect words are irrelevant to our sentiment classification <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Comparison of the most useful trigrams chosen by our method and by NaiveNN on CR ‚Üí RT. Here * denotes a "padding", which we added at the beginning and the end of each sentence. The domain-specific sentiment words are in bold.</p><p>task, it might bring in some noise and affect the performance of our sequential model. In contrast to Sequential-auxiliary, Joint-auxiliary is jointly learnt with the sentiment classification task, and it is easy to see that most of its extracted trigrams are target-specific sentiment words. Also, for Joint- original, since we share the word embeddings of two components and do not remove any pivot, it is intuitive to see that the extracted trigrams contain both domain-independent and domain-specific sen- timent words. These observations agree with our motivations behind the model.</p><p>Finally, we also sample several sentences from the test dataset, i.e., RT, to get a deeper insight of our joint model. Although NaiveNN and Sequen- tial correctly predict sentiments of the following two sentences:</p><p>1. "I've also been amazed at all the new addi- tions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for!"</p><p>2. "The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for!" Both of them give wrong predictions on another three sentences containing to die for:</p><p>3. "Try their chef's specials-they are to die for." 4. "Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for." 5. "It's to die for!". However, since to die for co-occurs with some general sentiment words like fantastic, best and great in previous two sentences, our joint model can implicitly learn that to die for is highly correlated with the positive sentiment via our auxiliary tasks, and ultimately make correct predictions for the lat- ter three sentences. This further indicates that our joint model can identify more domain-specific sen- timent words in comparison with NaiveNN and Se- quential, and therefore improve the performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We presented a domain adaptation method for senti- ment classification based on sentence embeddings. Our method induces a sentence embedding that works well across domains, based on two auxil- iary tasks. We also jointly learn the cross-domain sentence embedding and the sentiment classifier. Experiment results show that our proposed joint method can outperform several highly competi- tive domain adaptation methods on 18 source-target pairs using five benchmark data sets. Moreover, fur- ther analysis confirmed that our method is able to pick up domain-specific sentiment words.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The Outline of our Proposed Method.</figDesc></figure>
