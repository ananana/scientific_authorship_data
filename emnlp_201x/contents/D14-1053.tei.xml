			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a semi-supervised bootstrap-ping algorithm for analyzing China&apos;s foreign relations from the People&apos;s Daily. Our approach addresses sentiment target clustering, subjective lexicons extraction and sentiment prediction in a unified framework. Different from existing algorithms in the literature, time information is considered in our algorithm through a hierarchical bayesian model to guide the bootstrapping approach. We are hopeful that our approach can facilitate quantitative political analysis conducted by social scientists and politicians.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Lord Palmerston</head><p>Newspapers, especially those owned by official governments, e.g., Pravda from Soviet Union, or People's Daily from P.R. China, usually pro- vide direct information about policies and view- points of government. As national policies change over time, the tone that newspapers adopt, es- pecially sentiment, changes along with the poli- cies. For example, there is a stark contrast be- tween the American newspapers' attitudes towards Afghanistan before and after 911. Similarly, con- sider the following examples extracted from the People's Daily 1 :</p><p>• People' Daily, Aug 29th, 1963</p><p>All those who are being oppressed and exploited, Unite !! Beat US Imperialism and its lackeys.</p><p>• People's Daily, <ref type="bibr">Oct, 20th, 2002</ref> A healthy, steady and developmental relationship be- tween China and US, conforms to the fundamental in- terests of people in both countries, and the trend of his- torical development.</p><p>Automatic opinion extraction from newspapers such as people's daily can facilitate sociologists 'or political scientists' research or help political pundits in their decision making process. While our approach applies to any newspaper in princi- ple, we focus here on the People's Daily 2 (Renmin Ribao), a daily official newspaper in the People's Republic of China. While massive number of works have been in- troduced in sentiment analysis or opinion target extraction literature (for details, see Section 2), a few challenges limit previous efforts in this spe- cific task: First, the heavy use of linguistic phe- nomenon in the People's Daily including rhetoric, metaphor, proverb, or even nicknames, makes ex- isting approaches less effective for sentiment in- ference as identifying these expressions is a hard NLP problem in nature.</p><p>Second, as we are more interested in the degree of sentiment rather than binary classification (i.e., positive versus negative) towards an entity (e.g. country or individual) in the news article, straight- forward algorithms to apply would be document- level sentiment analysis approaches such as vector machine/regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pang et al., 2002</ref>) or super- vised LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blei and McAuliffe, 2010)</ref>. A single news article, usually contains different attitudes towards multiple countries or individuals simul- taneously (say praising "friends" and criticizing "enemies"), as shown in the following example from the People's Daily of <ref type="bibr">Mar. 17th, 1966:</ref> US imperialism set up a puppet regime in Vietnam and sent expeditionary force. . . People of Vietnam prevailed over the modern-equipped US troops with a vengeance. . . The re- sult of Johnson Government's intensifying invasion is that. . . .</p><p>There will be the day, when people from all over the world ex- ecute the heinous US imperialism by hanging on a gibbet. . . .</p><p>The heroic people of Vietnam, obtained great victory in the struggle against the USA imperialism. . .</p><p>The switching of praising of Vietnam and criticizing of the USA would make aforemen-tioned document-level machine learning algo- rithms based on bags of words significantly less effective if not separating attitudes towards Viet- nam from toward the USA in the first place. Mean- while, the separating task is by no means trivial in news articles. While US imperialism, US troops, Johnson Government, invaders, Ngo Dinh Diem 3 all point to the USA or its allies, People of Viet- nam, the Workers' party 4 , Ho Chi Minh 5 , Viet- nam People's Army point to North Vietnam side. Clustering entities according to sentiment, espe- cially in Chinese, is fundamentally a difficult task. And our goal, trying to identify entities towards whom an article holds the same attitudes, is dif- ferent from standard coreference resolution, since for us the co-referent group may include several distinct entities.</p><p>To address the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we propose a sentiment analysis approach based on the following assumptions:</p><p>1. In a single news article, sentiment towards an entity is consistent.</p><p>2. Over a certain period of time, sentiments to- wards an entity are inter-related.</p><p>The assumptions will facilitate opinion analy- sis: (1) if we can identify the attitude towards an entity (e.g., Vietnam) in a news article as posi- tive, then negative attitudes expressed in the arti- cle are about other entities. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2)</ref> The assumption enables sentiment inference for unseen words in a bootstrapping way without having to employ so- phisticated NLP algorithms. For example, from 1950s to 1960s, USA is usually referred to as "a tiger made of paper" in translated version. It is a metaphor indicating things that appear powerful (tiger) but weak in nature (made of paper). If it is first identified that during the designated time pe- riod, China held a pretty negative attitude towards the USA based on clues such as common nega- tive expressions (e.g., "evil" or "reactionary"), we can easily induce that "a tiger made of paper", is a negative word.</p><p>Based on aforementioned two assumptions, we formulate our approach as a semi-supervised model, which simultaneously bootstrap sentiment target lists, extracts subjective vocabularies and performs sentiment analysis. Time information is considered through a hierarchical bayesian model to guide time-, document-, sentence-and term- level sentiment inference. A small seed set of sub- jective words constitutes our only source of super- vision.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. We propose a semi-supervised bootstrapping algorithm tailored for sentiment analysis in the People's daily where time information is incorporated. We are hope- ful that sentiment cues can shed insights on other NLP tasks such as coreference or metaphor recognition.</p><p>2. In Analytical Political Science, the quantitative evalu- ation of diplomatic relations is usually a manual task <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Robinson and Shambaugh, 1995)</ref>. We are hopeful that our algorithm can enable automated political analysis and facilitate political scientists' and historians' work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Works</head><p>Significant research efforts have been invested into sentiment analysis and opinion extraction. In one direction, researchers look into predicting over- all sentiment polarity at document-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pang and Lee, 2008)</ref>, aspect-level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jo and Oh, 2011</ref>), sentence-level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yang and Cardie, 2014</ref>) or tweet-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Go et al., 2009)</ref>, which can be treated as a clas- sification/regression problem by employing stan- dard machine-learning techniques, such as Naive Bayesian, SVM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pang et al., 2002</ref>) or supervised- LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei and McAuliffe, 2010</ref>) with different types of features (i.e., unigram, bigram, POS). Other efforts are focused on targeted sentiment extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kim and Hovy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kim and Hovy, 2006</ref>). Usu- ally, sequence labeling models such as CRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) or HMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(LIU et al., 2004</ref>) are employed for identifying opinion holders ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Choi et al., 2005</ref>), topics of opinions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008)</ref> or opinion expressions (e.g. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Breck et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Johansson and Moschitti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang and Cardie, 2012)</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kim and Hovy (2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2006)</ref> identified opinion holders and targets by exploring their semantics rules related to the opinion words. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi et al.

Concretely, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Qiu et al. (2011)</ref> proposed a rule- based semi-supervised framework called double propagation for jointly extracting opinion words and targets. Compared to existing bootstrapping approaches, our framework is more general one with less restrictions 6 . In addition, our approach harness global information (e.g. document-level, time-level) to guide the bootstrapping algorithm. Another related work is the approach introduced by O' <ref type="bibr">Connor et al. (O'Connor et al., 2013</ref>) that extracts international relations from political con- texts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Target and Expression extraction</head><p>We first extract expressions (attitude or sentiment related terms or phrases) and target (entities to- ward whom the opinion holder (e.g., the People's Daily) holds an attitude). See the following exam- ples:</p><p>While the majority of subjective sentences omit the opinion holder, as in Examples 1 and 2, there are still a few circumstances where opinion hold- ers (e.g., "we", "Chinese people", "Chinese gov- ernment") are retained (Example 3). Some words (i.e. U.S. imperialism) can be both target and ex- pression, and there can be multiple targets (Exam- ple 2) within one sentence.</p><p>We use a semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-CRFs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Okanohara et al., 2006</ref>) algorithm for target and expression extraction. Semi-CRF are CRFs that relax the Markovian assumptions and allow for se- quence labeling at the segment level. It has been demonstrated more powerful that CRFs in multi- ple sequence labeling applications including NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Okanohara et al., 2006</ref>), Chinese word segmenta- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrew, 2006</ref>) and opinion expression iden- tification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang and Cardie, 2012)</ref>. Our approach is an extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang and Cardie (2012)</ref>'s sys- tem <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . Features we adopted included:</p><p>• word, part of speech tag, word length.</p><p>• left and right context words within a window of 2 and the correspondent POS tags.</p><p>• NER feature.</p><p>• subjectivity lexicon features from dictio- nary <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . The lexicon consists of a set of Chi- nese words that can act as strong or weak cues to subjectivity.</p><p>• segment-level syntactic features defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yang and Cardie, 2012</ref>). Most existing NER systems can barely recog- nize entities such as [ Vietnamese People's Army ] as a unified name entity in that Chinese parser usu- ally divides them into a series of separate words, namely [ Vietnamese/People's Army ]. To han- dle this problem, we first employ the Stanford NER engine <ref type="bibr">11</ref> and then iteratively 'chunk' con- secutive words, at least one of which is labeled as a name entity by the NER engine, before check- ing whether the chunked entity matches a bag of words contained in Chinese encyclopedia, e.g., Baidu Encyclopedia 12 and Chinese Wikipedia <ref type="bibr">13</ref> . <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Yang and Cardie's system focuses on expression extrac- tion (not target) and identifies direct subjective expression (DSE) and expressive subjective expression (ESE </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Notation</head><p>Here we describe the key variables in our model. Let C i denote the name entity of country i, G i denote its corresponding collection of news ar- ticles. G i is divided into 60*4=240 time spans (one for each quarter of the year, 60 years in to- tal), G i = {G i,t }. G i,t is composed of a series of documents {d}, and d is composed of a series of sentences {S}, which is represented as a tuple S = {E S , T S }, where E S is the expression and T S is the target of current sentence. Sentiment Score m: As we are interested in the degree of positiveness or negativeness, we divided international relations into 7 categories: Antag- onism (score 1), Tension (score 2), Disharmony (score 3), Neutrality (score 4), Goodness (score 5), Friendliness (score 6), Brotherhood (Comrade- ship) (score 7) based on researches in political sci- ence literature <ref type="bibr">14</ref> .</p><note type="other">Each of G i,t , document d, sen- tence S and expression term w is associated with a sentiment score m i,t , m d , m S and m w , respec- tively. M denotes the list of subjective terms, M = {w, m w } Document Target List T d i : We use T d i to denote the collection of entity targets in document d ∈ G i which the People's daily holds similar attribute to- wards. For example, suppose document d belongs to Vietnam article collection (</note><formula xml:id="formula_0">C i = V ietnam), T d i</formula><p>can be {Vietnam, Workers' party, People's Army, Ho Chi Minh}. While U.S., U.S. troops and Lyn- don Johnson are also entity targets found in d, they are not supposed to be included in T d i since the au- thor holds opposite attributes. Sentence List d i : We further use d i denotes the subset of sentences in d talking about entities from target list T d i . Similarly, in a Vietnam related arti- cle, sentences talking about the U.S. are not sup- posed to be included in d i .</p></div>

We man- ually labeled 600 sentences and performed 5-fold cross validation for evaluation. We compare semi- CRF to Standard CRF. We report performances on two settings in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. The first setting, Total, corresponds to performance on the whole dataset, while second one Single, denotes the performance on the set of sentences with only one target, which we are more interested in because multiple-target sentences are discarded in our algorithm. It turned out that semi-CRF significantly outputs standard CRF, approaching 0.90 F-1 score on Single setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Foreign Relation Evaluation</head><p>Gold-standard foreign relations are taken from Po- litical Science research at the Institute of Modern International Relations, Tsinghua University, ex- tracted from monthly quantitative China foreign relations reports with 7 countries (U.S., Japan, Russia/Soviet, England, France, India, and Ger- many) from 1950 to 2012 20 . We consider several baselines. For fair compar- ison, we use identical processing techniques for each approach. Some baselines make article-level predictions, for which we obtain time-period level relation prediction by averaging the documents.</p><p>Coreference+Bootstrap <ref type="formula">(</ref>  tem <ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref>. We then bootstrap sentiment terms and score based on entity coreference. No-time: A simplified version of our approach where each article is considered as an independent unit and no time-level information is considered. m d is obtained by averaging its containing sen- tences and used for later bootstrapping.</p><p>SVR-d: Uses SVM light (Joachims, 1999) to train a linear SVR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pang and Lee, 2008</ref>) for document-level sentiment prediction using the un- igram feature. The 100 labeled documents are used as training data.</p><p>SLDA: supervised-LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei and McAuliffe, 2010)</ref> for document-level label prediction. Topic number is set to 10, 20, 50, 100 respectively and we report the best result. SVR-S: Sentence-level SVR to sentences with presence of entity C i 21 . We obtain document-level prediction by averaging its containing sentences and then time-period level prediction by averaging its containing documents.</p><p>We report the Pearson Correlation with gold standards in table 3. As we can observe, simple document-level regression models, i.e., SVR and SLDA do not fit this task. The reason is sim- ple: one article d can appear in different collec- tions. Recall the Vietnam example in Section 1, it appears in both G V ietnam and G the U.S. . Sen- timent prediction for d should be totally opposite in the two document collections: very positive in G V ietnam and very negative in G U SA . But doc- ument level prediction would treat them equally. Our approach outperforms No-Time, illustrating the meaningfulness of exploiting time-level infor- mation in our task. Our system approaches around 0.9 correlation with the gold standards. The reason why No-Time is better than CB is also simple: CB includes only coreferent entities in the target list (e.g., America for the USA article collection), and therefore overlooks rich information provided by non-coreferent entities (e.g., President Nixon or <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Features we explore include word entities in current sen- tence, POS, a window of k ∈ {1, 2} words from the target and the expression and corresponding POS, and the depen- dency path between target and expression. Nixon Government). No-Time instead groups en- tities according to attitude, thereby enabling more information to be harnessed. For SVR-S, as the regression model trained from limited labeled data can hardly cover unseen terms during testing, the performance is just OK. SVR-S also suffers from overlooking rich sources of information since it only considers sentences with exact mention of the name entity of the corresponding country. </p></div>

We choose 6 countries and report results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. One of interesting things we can observe from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> is that foreign attitudes are usually divergent towards two opposing forces: Sino-American relation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>(a)) began to improve when the Sino-Soviet relation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  5</ref>(b)) reached its bottom at the beginning of 1970s. Similar patterns appear for Sino-Pakistan (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 5(c)</ref>), Sino-India relations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>(d)) <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Top coreference terms Towards USA and Soviet Union/Russia versus time.

Red denotes words that are both Target and negative words in M in early 1960s <ref type="bibr">22</ref> , and Sino-Vietnam 5(f)), Sino- American relations in late 1970s. On the con- trast, attitudes are usually consistent toward allied forces: Sino-Japan relations with Sino-USA re- lations before 1990s, and Sino-Vietnam relations with Sino-Soviet relations in late 1970s and 1980s. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> presents top clustering target (T d i ) in the USA and Soviet Union/Russia article collec- tion. As some of vocabulary terms can be both target and expression, we use blue to label terms with positive sentiment, red to label negative ones. As we can see from <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, targets(T ) extracted by our model show a very clear pattern where al- lies and co-referent entities are grouped. Another interesting thing is, the subjectivity of target words from different times is generally in accord with the relation curves shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a sentiment analy- sis algorithm to track China's foreign relations from the People's Daily. Our semi-supervised al- gorithm harnesses higher level information (i.e., document-level, time-level) by incorporating a hi- erarchical Bayesian approach into the framework, to resolve sentiment target clustering, create sub- jective lexicons, and perform sentiment prediction simultaneously. While we focus here on the Peo- ple's Daily for diplomatic relation extraction, the idea of our approach is general and can be ex- tended broadly. Another contribution of this work is the creation a comprehensive Chinese subjec- <ref type="bibr">22</ref> A fan of history can trace the crucial influence of the USSR in Sino-India relation in 1960s tive lexicon list. We are hopeful that our approach can not only facilitate quantitative research by po- litical scientists, but also shed light on NLP appli- cations such as coreference and metaphor, where sentiment clues can be helpful.</p><p>It is worth noting that, while harnessing time- level information can indeed facilitate opinion analysis, especially when labeled data is limited in our specific task, it is not a permanent-perfect as- sumption, especially considering the diversity and treacherous currents at the international political stage.</p><p>At algorithm-level, to avoid error propagation due to limitations of current sentiment analysis tools (even though semi-CRF produces state-of-art performance in target and expression extraction task, a performance of 0.8 F-value, when applied to the whole corpus, can by no means satisfy our requirements), we discard a great number of sentences, among which is contained much useful information. How to resolve these problems and improve opinion extraction performance is our long-term goal in sentiment analysis/opinion extraction literature.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Inference For each document d ∈ G i,t , m d is sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean value of m i,t .</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="4,307.28,62.81,230.40,95.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
