				<p>Web reviews have been intensively studied in argumentation-related tasks such as sentiment analysis. However, due to their focus on content-based features, many sentiment analysis approaches are effective only for reviews from those domains they have been specifically modeled for. This paper puts its focus on domain independence and asks whether a general model can be found for how people argue in web reviews. Our hypothesis is that people express their global sentiment on a topic with similar sequences of local sentiment independent of the domain. We model such sentiment flow robustly under uncertainty through abstraction. To test our hypothesis , we predict global sentiment based on sentiment flow. In systematic experiments, we improve over the domain independence of strong baselines. Our findings suggest that sentiment flow qualifies as a general model of web review argumentation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The web is full of user-generated reviews on prod- ucts, services, and works of art, like those from Amazon, TripAdvisor, and Rotten Tomatoes. Such web reviews provide facts, positive opinions, and negative opinions on different aspects. By that, the reviews express, implicitly or explicitly, an overall opinion on the topic in question. From an abstract viewpoint, the argumentation of a web review can thus be seen as a composition of local sentiments used to justify some global sentiment.</p><p>Both local and global sentiment of reviews are in the focus of numerous sentiment analysis ap- proaches (cf. Section 2 for details). Many of these approaches model reviews primarily with content- based features, derived from the words in the re- views. The use of words, however, varies strongly across domains, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> for a product, a hotel, and a movie review. As a con- sequence, sentiment analysis suffers from domain dependence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wu et al., 2010)</ref>, i.e., high effective- ness is often achieved only in the domain an ap- proach has been specifically modeled for. To adapt to other domains, prior knowledge about these domains or about domain-independent features is needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>This paper considers the question as to whether the overall argumentation of web reviews can be modeled in a general way in order to increase do- main independence in sentiment analysis. We ob- serve that people structure web reviews largely sequentially-in contrast to the complex struc- tures of many other argumentative texts. While the reviewed aspects differ between domains, our as- sumption is that the overall argumentation of a web review is generally represented by a sequence of local sentiments, called the review's sentiment flow ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mao and Lebanon, 2007</ref>). In particular, we hypothesize that, under an adequate model, similar sentiment flows express similar global sentiments, also across domains. All reviews in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>, for instance, express neutral global sentiment starting with positive, continuing with negative, and end- ing with positive local sentiment.</p><p>Unlike in our previous approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wachsmuth et al., 2014a</ref>), we analyze the major abstraction steps when modeling sentiment flow to represent global sentiment. A general model should abstract from both content and other domain differences, such as a review's length or the density of local sentiment in it. Based on web review corpora with known sentiment flows, we empirically analyze several model variants across three domains. Our results offer clear evidence for the truth of our hypothe- sis, indicating the generality of sentiment flow as a model of web review argumentation.</p><p>The abstract nature of sentiment flow, however, does not directly achieve domain independence, as</p></div>

Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems. The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV -very impressive. Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player -I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this. (Why did I buy it if I had freeview already? It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying. But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.</head><p>[...] The film was intense and pulsating when it zoomed in on Heather's travails, but lost something when it brought unnecessary action into play, such as a child kidnapping and the problem of drugs being sold in school. There was no place to go in developing Heather's character by adding these major societal problems to Heather's story <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref>. Solondz knows his subject well, <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref> and the result is an unusual movie that focuses in on a subject very few filmmakers have chosen to do. It was unfortunate that Heather never evolved, so the cruelty we observed in the beginning of the film was also the way she was observed when the film ended; nevertheless, an honest effort was put forth by the filmmaker to see how school age children cope with their unique problems they have.</p></div>

In systematic cross-domain exper- iments with the given corpora, we classify global sentiment based on sentiment flow without any do- main adaptation. While not being perfectly effec- tive, our approach improves over the domain ro- bustness of strong baselines. Altogether, the paper's main contributions are: 1. Evidence that sentiment flow qualifies as a general model of the overall argumentation of web reviews across domains. 2. A domain-robust approach for the classifica- tion of the global sentiment of web reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>As surveyed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pang and Lee (2008)</ref> and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liu (2012)</ref>, numerous sentiment analysis approaches have been proposed for different text types, lev- els of granularity, sentiment scales, and domains. We target at global text-level sentiment of web reviews. While we distinguish three sentiment classes here, our approach can be adapted to other scales. Our goal is not to optimize sentiment anal- ysis in a specific domain, but to find a model that supports sentiment analysis across domains. As common in text classification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Manning et al., 2008)</ref>, sentiment analysis often relies on words and other content features, which tends to be prone to domain dependence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wu et al., 2010)</ref>. Existing domain adaptation techniques for sentiment analy- sis require a few training texts from each target do- main or a few domain-independent pivot features to align domain-specific features <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010)</ref>. Our model complements these tech- niques and could be leveraged for pivot features. In tasks like authorship attribution and argumenta- tive zoning, non-topical words benefit domain in- dependence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Menon and Choi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ó Séaghdha and Teufel, 2014</ref>). Instead, we focus on the local sentiment on different aspects in a review here.</p><p>Aspect-based sentiment analysis extracts fine- grained opinions from a review ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Popescu and Etzioni, 2005</ref>). These aspects in turn impact the re- view's global sentiment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang et al., 2010)</ref>. How- ever, relevant aspects naturally tend to be domain- specific, like the picture quality of HDD players or the beds of hotels (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1)</ref>. While weakly- supervised approaches to extract aspects and local sentiment exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brody and Elhadad, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lazaridou et al., 2013</ref>), it is not clear how to align aspects from different domains. We ignore aspects here, only preserving the local sentiment itself.</p><p>State-of-the-art approaches for classifying local sentiment within a domain model the composition of words, e.g., relying on deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Socher et al., 2013</ref>). We do not compete with such an approach, but we use it to then predict global sen- timent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Täckström and McDonald (2011)</ref> observe that local and global sentiment correlate, aiming for the opposite direction, though. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wachsmuth et al., 2014b</ref>), we already compute frequent flows of local sentiment, but we neither analyze their generality, nor do we use them for prediction.</p><p>The idea of modeling sentiment flow was intro- duced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mao and Lebanon (2007)</ref> who classify local sentiment based on neighboring local sen- timent in a review. When inferring global senti- ment from a flow, however, the authors model only single flow positions, not their ordering. In con- trast, we capture the overall structure of reviews in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wachsmuth et al., 2014a</ref>) by measuring the simi- larity of a given flow to known sentiment flow pat- terns. We point out the domain robustness of sen- timent flow there, but we still use domain-specific local sentiment classifiers and we do not handle some major domain differences of web reviews. Both limitations are addressed in this paper, where we align flows similar to how <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Persing et al. (2010)</ref> align essay organizations.</p><p>We claim that sentiment flow models a review's argumentation, such that local sentiments ressem- ble rhetorical moves. Comparable simplifications are common for scientific argumentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Teufel, 2014)</ref>. Usually, argumentative texts are studied more deeply, considering different types of argu- ment components and their relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mochales and Moens, 2011)</ref>. Mining such structure is get- ting increasing attention recently ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Habernal et al., 2014)</ref>, also in the analysis of reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Villalba and Saint-Dizier, 2012</ref>). To express global sentiment, however, web reviews argue in simpler ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Web Review Argumentation</head><p>Argumentation refers to the exchange of opinions, to defending positions, and to convincing others of certain stances <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(van Eemeren et al., 2014)</ref>. A review is a written form of monological argumen- tation, where an author structures a selection of ar- guments in order to justify his or her conclusion on a topic of discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Besnard and Hunter, 2008)</ref>. Reviews, in particular, discuss products, services, works of art, or similar. The arguments in a review correspond to objective facts, positive and nega- tive opinions, and mixtures of these on the topic as a whole or on specific aspects of the topic.</p><p>In this paper, we are interested in the overall argumentation of reviews. Our assumption is that the conclusion of a review's overall argumentation consists in its global sentiment. Global sentiment is often explicitly reflected by an assigned overall rating, at least for web reviews.</p><p>Many web reviews are written by people in an ad-hoc fashion to quickly share opinions. As a re- sult, unlike other argumentative texts, web reviews often remain with a sequential structure (Villalba and Saint-Dizier, 2012) and miss explicit relations between the shared opinions. E.g., while the prod- uct review and the hotel review in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> cover opinions on several aspects, no deliberate structure is found in their argumentation. However, the ex- cerpt of the more professional movie review shows that this is not always the case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Domain Differences</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>, we categorize domains by source and topical theme (e.g., Amazon products). Other gra- nularities would be possible (e.g., consumer elec- tronics) or other categorization schemes (e.g., user vs. pro reviews). That being said, we speak of do- mains only to roughly distinguish web reviews that vary in how they argue for a conclusion. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We ob- serve major differences in three broad respects:</p><p>Content Especially topical web review domains differ widely regarding the terms and phrases that play a role in their argumentation. This includes the aspects being discussed (e.g., "beds" of ho- tels vs. the "subject" of movies) as well as the words used to express sentiment and their explic- itness (e.g., "yummy" vs. "an unusual movie").</p><p>Form As sketched above, further differences refer to the structure and style of web reviews. Some are rather subtle, like a careful use of paragraph breaks, whereas others are obvious, like a review's length. The movie review in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>, for instance, is actually over twice as long as the shown excerpt, starting with an objective synopsis of the plot and including "sub-reviews" of different aspects. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Subjectivity Finally, the use of subjectivity varies across web review domains: First, the density of sentiment tends to be high in some cases, like ho- tel reviews (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>), but low in others, like movie reviews, where objective plot descriptions and subjective opinions often alternate (the short- ened excerpt in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> hides this to some extent). Second, sentiment is sometimes very intense (as in the product review in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>), sometimes subtle. And third, in some domains even single sentences often contain mixed sentiment, whereas in others opinions tend to be laid out across sentences.</p><p>We will empirically underpin most observations in Section 5, where we analyze the domain inde- pendence of the model described next.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Modeling a Review by its Sentiment Flow</head><p>We propose a fairly simple argumentation model based on the observation that many web reviews are organized sequentially (cf. Section 3). As we assume that the overall argumentation of a web re- view represents global sentiment in the first place, we fully abstract from the content of the facts and opinions that serve as arguments. In particular, we model the argumentation of a web review solely by its sentiment flow, i.e., the sequence of local sen- timents comprised in the review's text. We do not presume the granularity of local sentiment, but we propose to distinguish positive, neutral, and nega- tive local sentiment, which is the common ground of related works (cf. Section 2). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> illustrates how we model web review argumentation. Our hypothesis is that similar sen- timent flows are used across domains of web re- views to express the same global sentiment. How- ever, because of the domain differences described in Section 3, we do not expect that the original sentiment flows of web reviews generalize well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Abstracting Flows for Generality</head><p>By concept, sentiment flow avoids to capture con- tent and some facets of form like paragraph usage. To abstract from the length of reviews, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mao and Lebanon (2007)</ref> and our approach in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wachsmuth et al., 2014a</ref>) length-normalize sentiment flow via interpolation. While this may preserve all infor- mation, it does not account for sub-reviews and the density of subjectivity. Here, we investigate more informed ways of abstracting flows. In particular, we consider three transformations of flows: Change Deletion of repeating local sentiments. The rationale is to reduce subjectivity differences by focusing on changes of local sentiment. NoLoops Deletion of repeating sequences of two or more local sentiments. The rationale is to reduce length differences by merging similar sub-reviews. 2Class Deletion of neutral local sentiments. The rationale is to reduce length and subjectivity dif- ferences emanating from objective descriptions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> exemplifies the three transformations. They are not commutative, as can partly be seen for the example. In Section 5, we test what combi- nations of transformations lead to an adequate sen- timent flow model. While more transformations will benefit generality, the lost specificity may de- crease the correlation with global sentiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Analyzing Flows under Uncertainty</head><p>Given an adequate sentiment flow model, we seek to find out to what extent it enables domain-robust sentiment analysis. This brings up two challenges related to uncertainty: (1) The classification of lo- cal sentiment in unknown reviews will not be free of errors, and, (2) reviews may comprise flows for which the global sentiment is unknown.</p><p>Classification errors are naturally problematic for modeling sentiment flow. At least, some errors are bypassed by the three transformations. E.g., if one negative local sentiment in the original flow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> is misclassified as positive, the Change transformation fixes this. If it is classified as neu- tral, Change and 2Class together eliminate the ef- fect. Moreover, errors can be countered by limit- ing the impact of single positions in a flow.</p><p>In (Wachsmuth et al., 2014a), we learn to infer global sentiment from the Manhattan distances be- tween a sentiment flow and a set of common flows, thereby analyzing the flow as a whole. The com- mon flows are found in a preceding clustering step. While we adopt the learning approach here, the Manhattan distances imply that flows are similar only if their changes are at similar positions.</p><p>Instead, we compare sentiment flows (modified with zero to three transformations) based on their normalized minimum edit distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cormen et al., 2009</ref>). Analog to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Persing et al. (2010)</ref>, we incre- mentally compute the edit distance using sequence alignment. To this end, we specify costs for pos-   Here, α ∈ [0, 1] specifies some fixed cost (we set α to 1/3 in Section 6). The intuition behind d is to have a higher cost the more s and s differ. Still, in- sertions and deletions are never free, as they affect differences that remain after applying transforma- tions to abstract from irrelevant differences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the alignment of two flows as a shortest-path search. We normalize the flows' minimum edit distance by their maximum length. Before we evaluate if the edit distance captures flow similarity more robustly than the Manhattan distance, we analyze what representation of senti- ment flows proves most general. This will also re- veal that the proposed abstractions reduce the need to perform clustering for finding common flows.</p><note type="other">0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1/3 1/3 1/3 1/3 1 1</note></div>

Consistently, global sentiment is represented best by change-noloops in the product domain and by 2class-noloops in the other domains (with up to 85.1 weighted precision). Also, 2class-noloops is third-best in terms of recall. While no clear "win- ner" exists, this variant seems most promising for modeling web review argumentation.</p><p>The weighted Hellinger distances show that the domain differences of many variants are small. On average, change-2class has the most stable global sentiment distribution. Most distances are only slightly higher out-of-domain than in-domain or even lower. Hence, sentiment flows hardly vary stronger across domains than within a domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">The Most Common Sentiment Flows</head><p>To investigate what sentiment flows actually occur in web reviews, we determined the flow with high- est recall for the training set of each corpus. For comparability, we balanced the flows in the train- ing set before by weighting their occurrences ac- cording to the distribution of global sentiment. 6 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the recall and the sentiment dis- tribution of each such flow in all evaluated do- mains exemplarily for three of the model variants discussed above. While high-recall flows naturally tend to be simple, we also observe more complex flows, such as (negative, negative, positive, neg- ative) in case of change-2class-noloops. Except for the change-noloops flow (positive), which does not occur at all in the movie training set, all shown flows are common across domains, achieving a re- call of over 2% in most cases. For 2class-noloops, only two flows are listed, because (negative, nega- tive) is the most common flow in both the product and the movie domain. Regarding the distribution of global sentiments, nearly all flows behave sim- ilar across domains. The only exception is (posi- tive, negative, positive) in change-2class-noloops, which never turns out negative in product reviews but never positive in movie reviews.</p><p>Altogether, we conclude that sentiment flow is not a fully precise model of web review argumen- tation, but it proves general with respect to global sentiment. What remains to be checked is the ben- efit of modeling sentiment flow under uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Analysis of the Robustness of the Model</head><p>Finally, we evaluate how effectively and domain- robustly sentiment flow predicts global sentiment, when local sentiment is not given but classified. To analyze the domain independence of our model, no knowledge about target domains is used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Sentiment Analysis Approaches</head><p>To classify sentiment flows, we build on the edit distance approach presented in Section 4: Model Variants As in Section 5, we look at all 16 possible variants of the proposed model. For each variant, we determine all sentiment flows that rep- resent at least 1% of all reviews in a given training set. We learn a mapping from the edit distance be- tween a review's sentiment flow and each of these flows to global sentiment. For robustness, we also combine different model variants.</p><p>We compare the accuracy of the model variants to previous approaches evaluated on the given cor- pora. In addition, we analyze domain robustness based on three baselines, which relate to the three abstraction levels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (cf. Section 4): Bag-of-Words (b1) The frequencies of all tokens that occur in at least 5% of all training reviews. Local Sentiment (b2) The frequencies of positive, neutral, and negative local sentiment in a review as well as the first and last local sentiment (analog to Section 4, local sentiment is mapped to <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>).</p><p>Sentiment Flow Patterns (b3) The Manhattan distances to those sentiment flows obtained by our clustering approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wachsmuth et al., 2014a</ref>).</p><p>All approaches are used as feature types in ma- chine learning (with values normalized to <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Experimental Set-up</head><p>We tackle three-class sentiment analysis, which is supposed to be particularly hard due to the fuzzy nature of neutral sentiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Täckström and McDonald, 2011</ref>). Given the three review corpora described in Section 5, we proceed as follows: <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Local Sentiment For feature computations, we split all reviews into tokens and sentences. Then, we classify local sentiment with the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Socher et al. (2013)</ref> from Stanford CoreNLP. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The algorithm was trained on subjective movie review sentences. We found that its accuracy is limited to around 50% on the given corpora, partly as it tends to misclassify objective sentences. Still, we use it to avoid any adaptation to the domains at hand.</p><p>Global Sentiment To determine global sentiment, we perform supervised learning based on the fea- ture types outlined above. In particular, we use the default configuration of the random forest classi- fier from Weka <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Breiman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hall et al., 2009</ref>) without any parameter optimization.</p><p>Experiments Having classified local sentiment in all reviews, we learn a random forest classifier on each feature type and different feature sets for all combinations of training and test domain. To pre- vent class bias, the training sets are balanced with duplicate oversampling. Since the size of the cor- pora is limited, we evaluate in-domain accuracy on the whole corpora using 10-fold cross-validation, averaged over five runs. Afterwards, we test the out-of-domain accuracy by applying the learned classifier to the other complete corpora. 48.7 50.1 43.6 v4 2class 52.0 53.8 44.9 v5 2class-noloops 48.0 50.4 42.4 All model variants v1-5 50.5 51.3 42.4 All flows (v1-5 + b3) 50.9 58.2 51.1 All sentiment (v1-5 + b2-3) 50.8 59.7 50.2 All features (v1-5 + b1-3) 54.2 60.0 48.7 Hotel b1 Bag-of-words 37.8 79.6 39.8 b2 Local sentiment 51.4 64.2 51.1 b3 Sentiment flow patterns 50.7 74.2 51.1 All baseline features b1-3 54.8 78.9 48.7 v1 change-2class</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2015</head><p>) in the hotel domain. In the product domain, our approach fails to compete with Täckström and McDonald (2011) who classify the global senti- ment of 66.6% of all reviews correctly after train- ing on large-scale product corpora. The small size of the given corpus explains the limited in-domain accuracy in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>; even some out-of-domain classifiers perform better on the product reviews. Still, the value 54.2 significantly improves over all baselines under a paired t-test (p &lt; 5%). As expected, bag-of-words (b1) proves strong in some in-domain tasks-achieving even the best overall accuracy in the hotel domain (79.6)-but it consistently fails out-of-domain. Although less clear, similar observations can be made for b2. This shows that a restriction to the distribution of local sentiment is insufficient to tackle domain de- pendence. The sentiment flow patterns are compa- rably effective out-of-domain, but still suffer from the domain change on the evaluated corpora.</p><p>For space reasons, we compare the baselines b1 to b3 only to a selection of five of the most effec- tive model variants, v1 to v5. Alone, these variants only occasionally do better than the sentiment flow patterns (b3). However, their combination (v1-5) clearly outperforms b3 in 4 out of 6 out-of-domain experiments. A strong variant is 2class-noloops, which already proved general in the results from Section 5. In contrast, 2class (v4) appears contro- versial. While it turns out being both effective and domain-robust when training in the product and hotel domain, no 2class sentiment flow represents at least 1% of the movie corpus, emphasizing that more abstraction is required for robustness.</p><p>Altogether, the bottom lines of each domain in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> provide clear evidence that our approach improves domain robustness in sentiment analy- sis: In all cases, the out-of-domain accuracy is best when using our sentiment flow features v1-5. At the same time, our results suggest that very high effectiveness might require more adaptation to the target domain. In this regard, modeling sentiment flow serves as a promising basis to align more ef- fective but domain-dependent features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>This paper puts the goal of domain independence in the sentiment analysis of web reviews into the focus. In particular, we hypothesize that an ab- stract model of the local sentiment flow in a review generally captures the review's overall argumenta- tion regarding global sentiment. In ground-truth data from three domains, we have found clear ev- idence for our hypothesis, indicating that people write reviews in similar ways across domains.</p><p>On this basis, we have presented a novel learn- ing approach, which predicts the global sentiment of a review from the edit distance between the re- view's sentiment flow and a set of common flows. While we determined common flows with cluster- ing in previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wachsmuth et al., 2014a)</ref>, instead here we rely on different flow abstractions at the same time. Systematic experiments empha- size that, in this manner, our approach achieves domain robustness without any domain adaptation even when the accuracy of the local sentiment in the flows is limited.</p><p>However, our experiments also show that sen- timent flow alone does not always suffice to pre- dict global sentiment. In future sentiment analysis approaches, sentiment flows may therefore rather serve as pivot features for domain adaptation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

anced among five categories: books (59 reviews), 
DVD (59), electronics (57), music (59), and video-
games (60). We use the first three for training and 
the others for testing. Under the authors' mapping 
from Amazon star ratings to global sentiment, all 
categories subsume 19 to 20 positive, neutral, and 
negative reviews each. In each review, every sen-
tence is classified as positive, negative, neutral, 
mixed, or irrelevant. To match the other corpora, 
we merge the three latter into one neutral class. 

Hotel Domain Our ArguAna TripAdvisor cor-
pus (Wachsmuth et al., 2014b) consists of 2 100 
TripAdvisor reviews, 300 for seven hotel locations 
each. Three locations belong to a predefined train-
ing set and two to a validation and a test set each. 
For all locations, the reviews are evenly distributed 
over the five TripAdvisor overall scores. In accor-
dance with the product corpus, we see score 4-5 as 
positive global sentiment, 3 as neutral, and 1-2 as 
negative. In each review, all main clauses together 
with their subordinate clauses have been classified 
as being positive, negative, or neutral. 

Movie Domain Finally, the third corpus (Mao and 
Lebanon, 2007) compiles 450 Rotten Tomatoes re-
views from the Cornell Movie Review Data scale 
dataset v1.0 (Pang and Lee, 2005) that refer to two 
authors. We use the 201 reviews of Scott Renshaw 
for training and the 249 of Dennis Schwartz for 
testing. The reviews lack punctuation, capitaliza-
tion, and their overall ratings. We recovered the 
overall ratings from the original dataset based on 
the rating scale 0-2, resulting in 178 positive, 139 
neutral, and 133 negative reviews. In each review,
