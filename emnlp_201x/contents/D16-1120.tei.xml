				<p>Though dialectal language is increasingly abundant on social media, few resources exist for developing NLP tools to handle such language. We conduct a case study of dialectal language in online conversational text by investigating African-American English (AAE) on Twitter. We propose a distantly supervised model to identify AAE-like language from de-mographics associated with geo-located messages , and we verify that this language follows well-known AAE linguistic phenomena. In addition, we analyze the quality of existing language identification and dependency parsing tools on AAE-like text, demonstrating that they perform poorly on such text compared to text associated with white speakers. We also provide an ensemble classifier for language identification which eliminates this disparity and release a new corpus of tweets containing AAE-like language. Data and software resources are available at:</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Owing to variation within a standard language, re- gional and social dialects exist within languages across the world. These varieties or dialects differ from the standard variety in syntax (sentence struc- ture), phonology (sound structure), and the inven- tory of words and phrases (lexicon). Dialect com- munities often align with geographic and sociolog- ical factors, as language variation emerges within distinct social networks, or is affirmed as a marker of social identity.</p><p>As many of these dialects have traditionally ex- isted primarily in oral contexts, they have histor- ically been underrepresented in written sources. Consequently, NLP tools have been developed from text which aligns with mainstream languages. With the rise of social media, however, dialectal language is playing an increasingly prominent role in online conversational text, for which traditional NLP tools may be insufficient. This impacts many applica- tions: for example, dialect speakers' opinions may be mischaracterized under social media sentiment analysis or omitted altogether <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hovy and Spruit, 2016)</ref>. Since this data is now available, we seek to analyze current NLP challenges and extract dialectal language from online data.</p><p>Specifically, we investigate dialectal language in publicly available Twitter data, focusing on African- American English (AAE), a dialect of Standard American English (SAE) spoken by millions of peo- ple across the United States. AAE is a linguistic variety with defined syntactic-semantic, phonolog- ical, and lexical features, which have been the sub- ject of a rich body of sociolinguistic literature. In addition to the linguistic characterization, reference to its speakers and their geographical location or speech communities is important, especially in light of the historical development of the dialect. Not all African-Americans speak AAE, and not all speakers of AAE are African-American; nevertheless, speak- ers of this variety have close ties with specific com- munities of African-Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Green, 2002</ref>). Due to its widespread use, established history in the soci- olinguistic literature, and demographic associations, AAE provides an ideal starting point for the devel- opment of a statistical model that uncovers dialectal language. In fact, its presence in social media is at- tracting increasing interest for natural language pro- cessing ( <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al., 2016</ref>) and sociolinguistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Stewart, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Eisenstein, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jones, 2015)</ref> re- search. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In this work we:</p><p>• Develop a method to identify demographically-aligned text and lan- guage from geo-located messages ( §2), based on distant supervision of geographic census demographics through a statistical model that assumes a soft correlation between demographics and language.</p><p>• Validate our approach by verifying that text aligned with African-American demographics follows well-known phonological and syntac- tic properties of AAE, and document the pre- viously unattested ways in which such text di- verges from SAE ( §3).</p><p>• Demonstrate racial disparity in the efficacy of NLP tools for language identification and dependency parsing-they perform poorly on this text, compared to text associated with white speakers ( §4, §5).</p><p>• Improve language identification for U.S. on- line conversational text with a simple en- semble classifier using our demographically- based distant supervision method, aiming to eliminate racial disparity in accuracy rates ( §4.2).</p><p>• Provide a corpus of 830,000 tweets aligned with African-American demographics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Identifying AAE from Demographics</head><p>The presence of AAE in social media and the generation of resources of AAE-like text for NLP tasks has attracted recent interest in sociolinguis- tic and natural language processing research; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jones (2015)</ref> shows that nonstandard AAE orthography on Twitter aligns with historical patterns of African- American migration in the U.S., while <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. (2015)</ref> investigate to what extent it supports well-known sociolinguistics hypotheses about AAE.</p><p>1 Including a recent linguistics work- shop:</p><p>http://linguistlaura.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/ using-twitter-for-linguistic-research.html Both, however, find AAE-like language on Twit- ter through keyword searches, which may not yield broad corpora reflective of general AAE use. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. (2016)</ref> generated a large unlabeled corpus of text from hip-hop lyrics, subti- tles from The Wire and The Boondocks, and tweets from a region of the southeast U.S. While this cor- pus does indeed capture a wide variety of language, we aim to discover AAE-like language by utiliz- ing finer-grained, neighborhood-level demographics from across the country.</p><p>Our approach to identifying AAE-like text is to first harvest a set of messages from Twitter, cross-referenced against U.S. Census demographics ( §2.1), then to analyze words against demograph- ics with two alternative methods, a seedlist approach ( §2.2) and a mixed-membership probabilistic model ( §2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Twitter and Census data</head><p>In order to create a corpus of demographically- associated dialectal language, we turn to Twitter, whose public messages contain large amounts of ca- sual conversation and dialectal speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Eisenstein, 2015)</ref>. It is well-established that Twitter can be used to study both geographic dialectal varieties 2 and mi- nority languages. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Some methods exist to associate messages with authors' races; one possibility is to use birth record statistics to identify African-American-associated names, which has been used in (non-social media) social science studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sweeney, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003)</ref>. However, metadata about au- thors is fairly limited on Twitter and most other so- cial media services, and many supplied names are obviously not real.</p><p>Instead, we turn to geo-location and induce a distantly supervised mapping between authors and the demographics of the neighborhoods they live in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(O'Connor et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eisenstein et al., 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stewart, 2014)</ref>. We draw on a set of geo-located Twitter messages, most of which are sent on mo- bile phones, by authors in the U.S. in 2013. (These are selected from a general archive of the "Gar- denhose/Decahose" sample stream of public Twit-ter messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Morstatter et al., 2013)</ref>). Geo- located users are a particular sample of the userbase <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pavalanathan and Eisenstein, 2015</ref>), but we expect it is reasonable to compare users of different races within this group.</p><p>We look up the U.S. Census blockgroup geo- graphic area that the message was sent in; block- groups are one of the smallest geographic areas de- fined by the Census, typically containing a popula- tion of 600-3000 people. We use race and ethnic- ity information for each blockgroup from the Cen- sus' 2013 American Community Survey, defining four covariates: percentages of the population that are non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, His- panics (of any race), and Asian. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Finally, for each user u, we average the demographic values of all their messages in our dataset into a length-four vec- tor π (census) u . Under strong assumptions, this could be interpreted as the probability of which race the user is; we prefer to think of it as a rough proxy for likely demographics of the author and the neighbor- hood they live in.</p><p>Messages were filtered in order to focus on ca- sual conversational text; we exclude tweets whose authors had 1000 or more followers, or that (a) con- tained 3 or more hashtags, (b) contained the strings "http", "follow", or "mention" (messages designed to generate followers), or (c) were retweeted (ei- ther containing the string "rt" or marked by Twitter's metadata as re-tweeted).</p><p>Our initial Gardenhose/Decahose stream archive had 16 billion messages in 2013; 90 million were geo-located with coordinates that matched a U.S. Census blockgroup. 59.2 million tweets from 2.8 million users remained after pre-processing; each user is associated with a set of messages and aver- aged demographics π (census) u .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Direct Word-Demographic Analysis</head><p>Given a set of messages and demographics associ- ated with their authors, a number of methods could be used to infer statistical associations between lan- guage and demographics.</p><p>Direct word-demographic analysis methods use the π (census) u quantities to calculate statistics at the word level in a single pass. An intuitive approach is to calculate the average demographics per word.</p><p>For a token in the corpus indexed by t (across the whole corpus), let u(t) be the author of the message containing that token, and w t be the word token. The average demographics of word type w is: 5</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">π (sof tcount) w ≡ t 1{w t = w}π (census) u(t) t 1{w t = w}</formula><p>We find that terms with the highest π w,AA values (de- noting high average African-American demograph- ics of their authors' locations) are very non-standard, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stewart (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Eisenstein (2013)</ref> find large π w,AA associated with certain AAE linguistic features.</p><p>One way to use the π w,k values to construct a cor- pus is through a seedlist approach. In early experi- ments, we constructed a corpus of 41,774 users (2.3 million messages) by first selecting the n = 100 highest-π w,AA terms occurring at least m = 3000 times across the data set, then collecting all tweets from frequent authors who have at least 10 tweets and frequently use these terms, defined as the case when at least p = 20% of their messages contain at least one of the seedlist terms. Unfortunately, the n, m, p thresholds are ad-hoc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Mixed-Membership</head><p>Demographic-Language Model</p><p>The direct word-demographics analysis gives use- ful validation that the demographic information may yield dialectal corpora, and the seedlist approach can assemble a set of users with heavy dialectal usage. However, the approach requires a number of ad-hoc thresholds, cannot capture authors who only occasionally use demographically-aligned lan- guage, and cannot differentiate language use at the message-level. To address these concerns, we de- velop a mixed-membership model for demographics and language use in social media. The model directly associates each of the four de- mographic variables with a topic; i.e. a unigram lan- guage model over the vocabulary. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The model as- sumes an author's mixture over the topics tends to 5 π w,k has the flavor of "soft counts" in multinomial EM. By changing the denominator to t π</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(census) u(t)</formula><p>, it calculates a unigram language model that sums to one across the vocabulary. This hints at a more complete modeling approach ( §2.3). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> To build the vocabulary, we select all words used by at least 20 different users, resulting in 191,873 unique words; other words are mapped to an out-of-vocabulary symbol. , whose scalar concentration parameter α controls whether authors' language is very similar to the demographic prior, or can have some deviation. A token t's latent topic z t is drawn from θ m , and the word itself is drawn from φ zt , the language model for the topic <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u θ z w ɸ π α m t β θ m ∼ Dir(απ u ), φ ∼ Dir(β/V ) z t ∼ θ m , w z ∼ φ zt</formula><p>Thus the model learns demographically-aligned language models for each demographic category. The model is much more tightly constrained than a topic model-for example, if α → ∞, θ becomes fixed and the likelihood is concave as a function of φ-but it still has more joint learning than a direct calculation approach, since the inference of a mes- sages' topic memberships θ m is affected not just by the Census priors, but also by the language used. A tweet written by an author in a highly AA neigh- borhood may be inferred to be non-AAE-aligned if it uses non-AAE-associated terms; as inference pro- ceeeds, this information is used to learn sharper lan- guage models.</p><p>We fit the model with collapsed Gibbs sampling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004</ref>) with repeated sample updates for each token t in the corpus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p(z t = k | w, z −t ) ∝ N wk + β/V N k + β N mk + απ uk N m + α</formula><p>where N wk is the number of tokens where word w occurs under topic z = k, N mk is the number of tokens in the current message with topic k, etc.; all counts exclude the current t position. We observed convergence of the log-likelihood within 100 to 200 iterations, and ran for 300 total. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We average to- gether count tables from the last 50 Gibbs samples for analysis of posterior topic memberships at the word, message, and user level; for example, the pos- terior probability a particular user u uses topic k, P (z = k | u), can be calculated as the fraction of tokens with topic k within messages authored by u.</p><p>We considered α to be a fixed control parameter; setting it higher increases the correlations between</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P (z = k | u) and π (census) u,k</formula><p>. We view the selec- tion of α as an inherently difficult problem, since the correlation between race and AAE usage is al- ready complicated and imperfect at the author-level, and census demographics allow only for rough as- sociations. We set α = 10 which yields posterior user-level correlations of P (z = AA | u) against π u,AA to be approximately 0.8.</p><p>This model has broadly similar goals as non- latent, log-linear generative models of text that con- dition on document-level covariates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Monroe et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eisenstein et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Taddy, 2013)</ref>. The formulation here has the advantage of fast inference with large vocabularies (since the partition function never has to be computed), and gives probabilistic admixture semantics at arbitrary levels of the data. This model is also related to topic models where the selection of θ conditions on covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mimno and McCallum, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ramage et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Roberts et al., 2013)</ref>, though it is much simpler without full latent topic learning.</p><p>In early experiments, we used only two classes (AA and not AA), and found Spanish terms being included in the AA topic. Thus we turned to four race categories in order to better draw out non-AAE language. This removed Spanish terms from the AA topic; interestingly, they did not go to the His- panic topic, but instead to Asian, along with other foreign languages. In fact, the correlation between users' Census-derived proportions of Asian popu- lations, versus this posterior topic's proportions, is only 0.29, while the other three topics correlate to their respective Census priors in the range 0.83 to 0.87. This indicates the "Asian" topic actually functions as a background topic (at least in part). Better modeling of demographics and non-English language interactions is interesting potential future work.</p><p>By fitting the model to data, we can directly ana- lyze unigram probabilities within the model param- eters φ, but for other analyses, such as analyzing larger syntactic constructions and testing NLP tools, we require an explicit corpus of messages.</p><p>To generate a user-based AA-aligned corpus, we collected all tweets from users whose posterior probability of using AA-associated terms under the model was at least 80%, and generated a correspond- ing white-aligned corpus as well. In order to remove the effects of non-English languages, and given un- certainty about what the model learned in the His- panic and Asian-aligned demographic topics, we fo- cused only on AA-and white-aligned language by imposing the additional constraint that each user's combined posterior proportion of Hispanic or Asian language was less than 5%. Our two resulting user corpora contain 830,000 and 7.3 million tweets, for which we are making their message IDs available for further research (in conformance with the Twit- ter API's Terms of Service). In the rest of the work, we refer to these as the AA-and white-aligned cor- pora, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Linguistic Validation</head><p>Because validation by manual inspection of our AA- aligned text is impractical, we turn to the well- studied phonological and syntactic phenomena that traditionally distinguish AAE from SAE. We val- idate our model by reproducing these phenomena, and document a variety of other ways in which our AA-aligned text diverges from SAE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Lexical-Level Variation</head><p>We begin by examining how much AA-and white- aligned lexical items diverge from a standard dictio- nary. We used SCOWL's largest wordlist with level 1 variants as our dictionary, totaling 627,685 words. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We calculated, for each word w in the model's vocabulary, the ratio</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r k (w) = p(w|z = k) p(w|z = k)</formula><p>where the p(.|.) probabilities are posterior infer- ences, derived from averaged Gibbs samples of the sufficient statistic count tables N wk . We selected heavily AA-and white-aligned words as those where r AA (w) ≥ 2 and r white (w) ≥ 2, respectively. We find that while 58.2% of heav- ily white-aligned words were not in our dictionary, fully 79.1% of heavily AA-aligned words were not. While a high number of out-of-dictionary lexical items is expected for Twitter data, this disparity suggests that the AA-aligned lexicon diverges from SAE more strongly than the white-aligned lexicon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Internet-Specific Orthographic Variation</head><p>We performed an "open vocabulary" unigram anal- ysis by ranking all words in the vocabulary by r AA (w) and browsed them and samples of their us- age. Among the words with high r AA , we observe a number of Internet-specific orthographic variations, which we separate into three types: abbreviations (e.g. llh, kmsl), shortenings (e.g. dwn, dnt), and spelling variations which do not correlate to the word's pronunciation (e.g. axx, bxtch). These varia- tions do not reflect features attested in the literature; rather, they appear to be purely orthographic vari- ations highly specific to AAE-speaking communi- ties online. They may highlight previously unknown linguistic phenomena; for example, we observe that thoe (SAE though) frequently appears in the role of a discourse marker instead of its standard SAE us- age (e.g. Girl Madison outfit THOE). This new use of though as a discourse marker, which is difficult to observe using the SAE spelling amidst many in- stances of the SAE usage, is readily identifiable in examples containing the thoe variant. Thus, non- standard spellings provide valuable windows into a variety of linguistic phenomena.</p><p>In the next section, we turn to variations which do appear to arise from known phonological processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Phonological Variation</head><p>Many phonological features are closely associated with AAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Green, 2002</ref>). While there is not a per- fect correlation between orthographic variations and people's pronunciations, <ref type="bibr">Eisenstein (2013)</ref> shows that some genuine phonological phenomena, includ- ing a number of AAE features, are accurately re- flected in orthographic variation on social media. We therefore validate our model by verifying that spellings reflecting known AAE phonological fea- tures align closely with the AA topic. We selected 31 variants of SAE words from previous studies of AAE phonology on Twitter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jørgensen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jones, 2015)</ref>. These varia- tions display a range of attested AAE phonological features, such as derhotacization (e.g. brotha), dele- tion of initial g and d (e.g. iont), and realization of voiced th as d (e.g. dey) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Rickford, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the top five of these words by their r AA (w) ratio. For 30 of the 31 words, r ≥ 1, and for 13 words, r ≥ 100, suggesting that our model strongly identifies words displaying AAE phonolog- ical features with the AA topic. The sole excep- tion is the word brotha, which appears to have been adopted into general usage as its own lexical item.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Syntactic Variation</head><p>We further validate our model by verifying that it re- produces well-known AAE syntactic constructions, investigating three well-attested AAE aspectual or preverbal markers: habitual be, future gone, and completive done <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Green, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows ex- amples of each construction.</p><p>To search for the constructions, we tagged the cor- pora using the ARK Twitter POS tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Gimpel et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Owoputi et al., 2013</ref>), <ref type="bibr">9</ref> which <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al.

We searched for each construction by search- ing for sequences of unigrams and POS tags char- acterizing the construction; e.g. for habitual be we searched for the sequences O-be-V and O-b-V. Non- standard spellings for the unigrams in the patterns were identified from the ranked analysis of §3.2.</p><p>We examined how a message's likelihood of us- ing each construction varies with the message's pos- terior probability of AA.

From each decile, we sampled 200,000 messages and calculated the proportion of messages containing the three syntactic constructions. For all three constructions, we observed the clear pattern that as messages' posterior probabilities of AA increase, so does their likelihood of contain- ing the construction. Interestingly, for all three constructions, frequency of usage peaks at approx- imately the [0.7, 0.8) decile. One possible reason for the decline in higher deciles might be tendency of high-AA messages to be shorter; while the mean number of tokens per message across all deciles in our samples is 9.4, the means for the last two deciles are 8.6 and 7.1, respectively.</p><p>Given the important linguistic differences be- tween our demographically-aligned subcorpora, we hypothesize that current NLP tools may behave dif- ferently.

Since language identifiers are typi- cally based on character n-gram features, they may get confused by the types of lexical/orthographic di- vergences seen in §3. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compare the behavior of existing language iden- tifiers on our subcorpora.</p><p>We test langid.py as well as the output of Twitter's in-house identifier, whose predictions are included in a tweet's metadata (from 2013, the time of data collection); the latter may give a language code or a missing value (unk or an empty/null value). We record the proportion of non-English predictions by these systems; Twitter-1 does not consider missing values to be a non-English prediction, and Twitter-2 does.</p><p>We noticed emojis had seemingly unintended consequences on langid.py's classifications, so re- moved all emojis by characters from the relevant Unicode ranges. We also removed @-mentions.</p><p>User-level analysis We begin by comparing the classifiers' behavior on the AA-and white-aligned corpora. Of the AA-aligned tweets, 13.2% were classified by langid.py as non-English; in contrast, 7.6% of white-aligned tweets were classified as such. We observed similar disparities for Twitter-1 and Twitter-2, illustrated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>It turns out these "non-English" tweets are, for the most part, actually English. We sampled and anno- tated 50 tweets from the tweets classified as non- English by each run. Of these 300 tweets, only 3 could be unambiguously identified as written in a language other than English.</p><p>Message-level analysis We examine how a mes- sage's likelihood of being classified as non-English varies with its posterior probability of AA. As in §3.4, we split all messages into deciles based on the messages' posterior probability of AA, and pre- dicted language identifications on 200,000 sampled messages from each decile.</p><p>For all three systems, the proportion of messages classified as non-English increases steadily as the messages' posterior probabilities of AA increase. As before, we sampled and annotated from the tweets classified as non-English, sampling 50 tweets from each decile for each of the three systems. Of the 1500 sampled tweets, only 13 (∼0.87%) could be unambiguously identified as being in a language other than English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Adapting Language Identification for AAE</head><p>Natural language processing tools can be improved to better support dialects; for example, <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. (2016)</ref> use domain adaptation methods to im- prove POS tagging on AAE corpora. In this sec- tion, we contribute a fix to language identification to correctly identify AAE and other social media mes- sages as English.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Ensemble Classifier</head><p>We observed that messages where our model in- fers a high probability of AAE, white-aligned, or "Hispanic"-aligned language almost always are written in English; therefore we construct a simple ensemble classifier by combining it with langid.py.</p><p>For a new message w, we predict its demographic-language proportionsˆθproportionsˆ proportionsˆθ via poste- rior inference with our trained model, given a symmetric α prior over demographic-topic pro- portions (see appendix for details). The ensemble classifier, given a message, is as follows:</p><p>• Calculate langid.py's predictionˆypredictionˆ predictionˆy.</p><p>• IfˆyIfˆ Ifˆy is English, accept it as English.</p><p>• IfˆyIfˆ Ifˆy is non-English, and at least one of the message's tokens are in demographic model's vocabulary: InferˆθInferˆ Inferˆθ and return English only if the combined AA, Hispanic, and white poste- rior probabilities are at least 0.9. Otherwise return the non-EnglishˆyEnglishˆ Englishˆy decision.</p><p>Another way to view this method is that we are ef- fectively training a system on an extended Twitter- specific English language corpus softly labeled by our system's posterior inference; in this respect, it is related to efforts to collect new language-specific Twitter corpora ( <ref type="bibr">Bergsma et al., 2012</ref>) or minority language data from the web ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ghani et al., 2001</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Evaluation</head><p>Our analysis from §4.1 indicates that this method would correct erroneous false negatives for AAE Message set langid.py Ensemble High AA 80.1% 99.5% High White 96.8% 99.9% General 88.0% 93.4% <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Imputed recall of English messages in 2014 messages.</p><p>For the General set these are an approximation; see text.</p><p>messages in the training set for the model. We fur- ther confirm this by testing the classifier on a sample of 2.2 million geolocated tweets sent in the U.S. in 2014, which are not in the training set. In addition to performance on the entire sample, we examine our classifier's performance on mes- sages whose posterior probability of using AA-or white-associated terms was greater than 0.8 within the sample, which in this section we will call high AA and high white messages, respectively. Our clas- sifier's precision is high across the board, at 100% across manually annotated samples of 200 messages from each sample. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Since we are concerned about the system's overall recall, we impute recall (Ta- ble 4) by assuming that all high AA and high white messages are indeed English. Recall for langid.py alone is calculated by n N , where n is the number of messages predicted to be English by langid.py, and N is the total number of messages in the set. (This is the complement of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, except evalu- ated on the test set.) We estimate the ensemble's re- call as n+m N , where m = (n f lip )P (English | f lip) is the expected number of correctly changed classifi- cations (from non-English to English) by the ensem- ble and the second term is the precision (estimated as 1.0). We observe the baseline system has consid- erable difference in recall between the groups which is solved by the ensemble.</p><p>We also apply the same calculation to the general set of all 2.2 million messages; the baseline classifies 88% as English. This is a less accurate approxima- tion of recall since we have observed a substantial presence of non-English messages. The ensemble classifies an additional 5.4% of the messages as En- glish; since these are all (or nearly all) correct, this reflects at least a 5.4% gain to recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Dependency Parser Evaluation</head><p>Given the lexical and syntactic variation of AAE compared to SAE, we hypothesize that syntac- tic analysis tools also have differential accuracy. <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. (2015)</ref> demonstrate this for part-of- speech tagging, finding that SAE-trained taggers had disparate accuracy on AAE versus non-AAE tweets.</p><p>We assess a publicly available syntactic depen- dency parser on our AAE and white-aligned corpora. Syntactic parsing for tweets has received some re- search attention; Foster et al. (2011) create a cor- pus of constituent trees for English tweets, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kong et al. (2014)</ref>'s Tweeboparser is trained on a Twitter corpus annotated with a customized unlabeled de- pendency formalism; since its data was uniformly sampled from tweets, we expect it may have low dis- parity between demographic groups.</p><p>We focus on widely used syntactic representa- tions, testing the SyntaxNet neural network-based dependency parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andor et al., 2016</ref>), 11 which re- ports state-of-the-art results, including for web cor- pora. We evaluate it against a new manual an- notation of 200 messages, 100 randomly sampled from each of the AA-and white-aligned corpora de- scribed in §2.3.</p><p>SyntaxNet outputs grammatical relations con- forming to the Stanford Dependencies (SD) system (de <ref type="bibr">Marneffe and Manning, 2008)</ref>, which we used to annotate messages using Brat, 12 comparing to pre- dicted parses for reference. Message order was ran- domized and demographic inferences were hidden from the annotator. To increase statistical power rel- ative to annotation effort, we developed a partial an- notation approach to only annotate edges for the root word of the first major sentence in a message. Gen- erally, we found that that SD worked well as a de- scriptive formalism for tweets' syntax; we describe handling of AAE and Internet-specific non-standard issues in the appendix. We evaluate labeled recall of the annotated edges for each message set:</p><p>Parser Bootstrapped standard errors (from 10,000 message resamplings) are in parentheses; differences are sta- tistically significant (p &lt; 10 −6 in both cases).</p><p>The white-aligned accuracy rate of 80.4% is broadly in line with previous work (compare to the parser's unlabeled accuracy of 89% on English Web Treebank full annotations), but parse quality is much worse on AAE tweets at 64.0%. We test the Stanford CoreNLP neural network dependency parser <ref type="bibr">(Chen and Manning, 2014</ref>) using the english SD model that outputs this formalism; 13 its disparity is worse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Soni et al. (2014)</ref> used a similar parser 14 on Twitter text; our analysis suggests this approach may suffer from errors caused by the parser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a distantly supervised probabilis- tic model that employs demographic correlations of a dialect and its speaker communities to uncover di- alectal language on Twitter. Our model can also close the gap between NLP tools' performance on dialectal and standard text.</p><p>This represents a case study in dialect identifica- tion, characterization, and ultimately language tech- nology adaptation for the dialect. In the case of AAE, dialect identification is greatly assisted since AAE speakers are strongly associated with a demo- graphic group for which highly accurate governmen- tal records (the U.S. Census) exist, which we lever- age to help identify speaker communities. The no- tion of non-standard dialectal language implies that the dialect is underrepresented or underrecognized in some way, and thus should be inherently diffi- cult to collect data on; and of course, many other language communities and groups are not necessar- ily officially recognized. An interesting direction for future research would be to combine distant su- pervision with unsupervised linguistic models to au- tomatically uncover such underrecognized dialectal language. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Mixed-membership model for users (u), messages (m) and tokens (t).
