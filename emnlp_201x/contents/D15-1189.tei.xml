				<p>Events are communicated in natural language with varying degrees of certainty. For example, if you are &quot;hoping for a raise,&quot; it may be somewhat less likely than if you are &quot;expecting&quot; one. To study these distinctions, we present scalable, high-quality annotation schemes for event detection and fine-grained factuality assessment. We find that non-experts, with very little training, can reliably provide judgments about what events are mentioned and the extent to which the author thinks they actually happened. We also show how such data enables the development of regression models for fine-grained scalar factuality predictions that outper-form strong baselines.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Interpretation of events-determining what the author claims did or did not happen-is impor- tant for many NLP applications, such as news arti- cle summarization or biomedical information ex- traction. However, detecting events and assessing their factuality is challenging. For example, while most non-copular verbs are events, words in gen- eral vary with use (e.g. "trade route" vs "trade with Iraq"). Events also have widely varying, context-dependent factuality cues, such as event interactions (e.g. "prevent easy access) and cue words (e.g. "ordered to" vs. "expected to"). As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, these are common challenges that a model of event factuality must address.</p><p>In this paper, we present new data and mod- els for these tasks, demonstrating that non-experts can provide high-quality annotations which en- able fine-grained, scalar judgments of factuality. Unlike previous work, we do not use a detailed * Work done at the University of Washington.</p><p>(1) U.S. embassies and military installations around the world were ordered <ref type="bibr">(3.0)</ref> to set (2.6) up barriers and tighten <ref type="bibr">(2.6)</ref> security to prevent <ref type="bibr">(1.8)</ref> easy access <ref type="bibr">(-2.4)</ref> by unauthorized people.</p><p>(2) Intel's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay (0.8) several computer makers' marketing efforts <ref type="bibr">(2.6)</ref> , but the "bugs" aren't expected <ref type="bibr">(-2.6)</ref> to hurt (-2.0) Intel.</p><p>(3) President Bush on Tuesday said <ref type="bibr">(3.0)</ref> the United States may extend <ref type="bibr">(1.6)</ref> its naval quarantine (2.6) to Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to shut <ref type="bibr">(1.4)</ref> off Iraq's last unhindered trade route.</p><p>(4) He also said (3.0) of trade (-0.8) with Iraq: "There are no shipments at the moment." specification of exactly what events and factual- ity classes should be. Instead, we simply ask non-experts to find words describing things that the author claims could have happened, and rate each possibility on a scale of -3 (certainly did not happen) to 3 (certainly did). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows that non-expert workers-when their judgments are aggregated-consistently find a wide range of events and recognize the subtle differences in im- plied factuality. For example, the event set gets a score of 2.6, indicating that it likely but not cer- tainly occurred, since it was ordered, whereas the ordered event, gets a score of 3.0.</p><p>We gather data for event detection and factual- ity, reusing sentences from the TempEval-3 cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Uzzaman et al., 2013)</ref>. Our approach pro- duces high-quality labels with modest costs. We also introduce simple but highly effective models for both tasks that outperform strong baselines. In particular, our factuality regression model uses a learning objective that combines the advantages of LASSO and support vector regression, enabling it to effectively consider sparse lexical cues. By pro- viding scalar factuality judgments for events, our models enable more fine-grained reasoning than previously considered. The corpus and learned models are available online. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>While event definitions have been proposed in several prior studies, existing approaches vary in how they model various linguistic forms such as nominal events, stative events, generic events, and light verbs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pustejovsky et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Palmer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Meyers et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kim et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Song et al., 2015)</ref>. Even with a formal and precise account of events, training annotators to learn all such linguistic intricacies remains a practical chal- lenge. Instead of definition-driven instructions, we propose example-driven instructions and show their effectiveness.</p><p>Previous studies have modeled event factuality assessment as a binary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Diab et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Prabhakaran et al., 2010</ref>) or multi-class (Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2009) classification task, and they re- lied on expert annotators. A softer representation was proposed and crowdsourced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">de Marneffe et al. (2012)</ref>, who advocated for representing fac- tuality from the reader's perspective as a distribu- tion of categories, but their annotation process re- quires manual normalization of the text. In con- trast, we model factuality from the author's per- spective with scalar values, and we have an end- to-end crowdsourced annotation pipeline.</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Soni et al. (2014)</ref> investigated a related problem for quoted statements on Twitter, and they also crowdsourced factuality annotations to learn regression models. While their approach is similar, we focus on predicting factuality for events that occur in every sentence. Without the restrictions of their task, we must reason about a larger variety of contextual cues.</p><p>Our method of evaluating annotator agreement (Section 3) is related to the crowdsourcing study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Snow et al. (2008)</ref>, who showed that pooled non-experts can match or outperform single ex- pert annotators. In contrast, we approximate ex- pert judgments by independently sampling and ag- gregating sets of non-expert judgments.</p><p>1 http://lil.cs.washington.edu/fact <ref type="table">Train  192  2909  73220  Dev.  64  1060  26146  Test  20  274  7004</ref> Figure 2: Corpus statistics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Annotation</head><p>We use a two-stage annotation pipeline to create the labels shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Event mentions are first detected, followed by factuality judgments.</p><p>As motivated in Section 1, we use instructions that are easily understandable by workers with no lin- guistic training and improve overall quality by ag- gregating multiple judgments to get the final label.</p><p>Event Annotation Given a sentence, we high- light one token at a time and ask workers if it refers to an event. We use the following instructions:</p><p>We consider events to be things that may or may not occur either in the past, present or fu- ture (e.g., earthquake, meeting, jumping, talk- ing, etc.). In some cases, it is not so clear whether a word is referring to an event or not. Consider these harder cases to be events.</p><p>along with 25 example annotations that covered a large variety of cases such as nominals, statives, generic events, light verbs, and non-events. These examples include both toy sentences and sentences from the corpus to annotate. For efficiency, we did not annotate a short list of stop words, copular verbs, and auxiliaries.</p><p>Factuality Annotation For factuality, we present a sentence with one highlighted event token at a time with the following prompt:</p><p>On a scale from 3 to -3, rate how likely the high- lighted event did or will happen according to the author of the sentence.</p><p>along with 17 examples to calibrate the annota- tor's judgments, including negated, conditional, hedged, generic, and nested events. The responses -3, 0, and 3 were given explicit interpretations. 3 and -3 denote respectively that the target event cer- tainly did or did not happen according to the au- thor. 0 denotes that the author is neutral and ex- presses no bias towards the event's factuality. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Event Agreement</head><p>Factuality Agreement <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Agreement statistics as a function of k, the number of judgments aggregated. We choose k = 5 in both tasks for our experiments, as de- noted by the red square.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k F1 (%) Pearson's r (%)</formula><p>Data collection We gathered data on Crowd- Flower. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For quality control, annotators are ran- domly presented test questions with known an- swers. For each example, we collect and aggregate 5 judgments, as described below. For comparison, we annotated TempEval-3 (Uzzaman et al., 2013), keeping the existing test split and randomly hold- ing out a quarter of the training examples to create a development set. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows data statistics. The annotation cost is 0.5¢ per judgment for de- tection and 2¢ per judgment for factuality.</p><p>Aggregated Agreement We introduce a simple scheme to measure agreement with aggregate data, for example when the majority class from a pool of judgments is used for the final label. Instead of comparing individuals, we want to know how often the aggregates will agree, if we were to have different groups of annotators doing the task. Formally, we assume N samples {(x i , y i ) | i = 1, . . . , N }, where each x i is a token within a sen- tence, and y i = {y j i | j = 1, . . . , M } is the set of M judgments for x i . Let Y be the set of possible labels, Y = {−1, 1} for detection and Y = [−3, 3] for factuality. Let AGG : Y k → Y be an ag- gregation function, which maps k judgments to a single aggregate one. For event detection, we set AGG(y 1 , . . . , y k ) to return the majority value from the set of judgments {y 1 , . . . , y k }. For factual- ity, we set AGG(y 1 , . . . , y k ) = 1 k k j=1 y j , which computes the mean value.</p><p>To estimate the agreement between aggregates of k judgments, we collect pairs of disjoint sub- sets of size k from the M judgments. Given y i , we define the set of aggregate judgment pairs: 2 http://crowdflower.com  <ref type="table">-3 39 0  0  0  0  0  0  0 29  -2 29 2  0  0  0  0  0  0 44  -1 16 4  1  0  0  3  0  0 58  0 15 0  5  2  0  7  0  1 95  1 7  0  1 30  4  27  2  0 337  2 4  1  0 20 42 260  0  0 564  3 2  0  0  1  10</ref>  {(AGG(y ), AGG(y )) | y , y ⊂ y i ∧ |y | = |y | = k ∧ y ∩ y = ∅}. 3 To measure how well these aggregates agree, we treat AGG(y ) as a candidate hypothesis and AGG(y ) as the gold la- bel and compute the appropriate evaluation metric to measure aggregate agreement. We use the F1 score for detection and Pearson's correlation for factuality, as described in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FactBank Labels CT-PR-PS-PS+ PR+ CT+ CTu NA Uu</head><p>We experiment with k = 1, . . . , 9 for 100 sen- tences, allowing aggregates of up to 9 judgments, as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Aggregate agreement for both tasks improve with larger k, but returns quickly diminish. Therefore, we chose k = 5 for the full data collection to reasonably trade off between quality and quantity. In absolute terms, the agree- ment at this level is strong (92.6% F1 for detection and 83.1% correlation for factuality), demonstrat- ing that aggregate non-expert judgments can pro- duce high-quality annotations.</p><p>Comparison to FactBank We compare our fac- tuality ratings, rounded to the nearest integer, to FactBank annotations (author source only) for overlapping events. The confusion matrix from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows there is strong correlation between our ratings and FactBank labels with specified cer- tainties and polarities. These labels are CT-, PR-, PS-, PS+, PR+, and CT+, corresponding to events that are seen as (certainly/probably/possibly) (not happening/happening).</p><p>We differ most significantly in events labeled Uu (underspecified) by FactBank, which consist largely of nested events, such as "Sandors said he'd double his money" or "Sandors hoped he'd double his money." While FactBank annotators would label both double events as Uu, our anno- tations can indicate nuances based on the author's wording (i.e., said vs. hoped). The large variation in the Uu column of the confusion matrix suggests that the factuality of an event is rarely perceived as completely neutral, even when the author does not commit to a belief in the event's occurrence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Approach</head><p>Learning For the detection task, we learn a lin- ear SVM classification model. For the factuality task, we assume a dataset with N examples of la- beled events {(x i , y i ) | i = 1, . . . , N }, and we learn a regression model: y i = w φ(x i ). We in- troduce a learning objective for regression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">min w w 1 + C N i=1 max(0, |y i − w φ(x i )| − )</formula><p>that combines the advantages of LASSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Tibshirani, 1996)</ref> and support vector regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Drucker et al., 1997)</ref>. It induces sparse feature weights while being insensitive to errors less than .</p><p>Features For the detection model, we include features given the input word x: (1) lemma of x, (2) part of speech of x, (3) indicator for whether x is a hyponym of the event synset in WordNet and the part of speech of x, (4) Brown clusters of x and its part of speech, and (5) all dependency paths from x up to length 1. For the factuality model, given the input event mention x, we include: (1) lemma of x, (2) part of speech of x, and (3) all dependency paths from x up to length 2.</p><p>For dependency paths, we include all edge labels, the target word is omitted, and each node may or may not be lexicalized; we include all possible configurations. For example in "John did not expect to return", the dependency path: not←[neg]-expect-[xcomp]→return, would produce the following features:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">not←[neg]-expect-[xcomp]→→ * * * * ←[neg]-expect-[xcomp]→→ * * not←[neg]- * * -[xcomp]→→ * * * * ←[neg]- * * -[xcomp]→→ * *</formula><p>These dependency features allow for context- dependent reasoning, including many of the cases in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> where the factuality of an event de- pends on the identity of a neighboring verb.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Setup</head><p>Baselines For detection, we include a baseline reimplementation of the NAVYTIME (Chambers, 2013) classification detector, one of the top per- formers in the TempEval-3 event detection task. For factuality, we include three baselines: (1) A one-vs.-rest multi-class classifier (DISCRETE) us- ing our features (Section 4) and labels that are dis- cretized by rounding to the nearest integer, (2) a regression model (SVR) trained with the standard SVR objective using our features, and (3) a re- gression model (PRABHAKARAN) trained with the standard SVR objective using features from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Prabhakaran et al. (2010)</ref>. These features are highly informative, but their lexical features are restricted to a small set of manually defined words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation Details</head><p>The SVM models (NAVYTIME, DISCRETE, SVR, PRABHAKARAN, and our detection model) were trained with SVM- Light <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Joachims, 1999</ref>). We use CPLEX 4 to solve the linear program optimizing the regression ob- jective in Section 4. All hyperparameters were tuned on the development set.</p><p>We use the Stanford dependency parser (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Marneffe et al., 2006</ref>) for extracting dependency path and part-of-speech features. We use WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Miller, 1995)</ref> to generate lemma and hyponym features. Brown clusters with 100, 320, 1000, and 3200 clusters from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Turian et al. (2010)</ref> are used in the detection features.</p><p>Evaluation Metrics We use the standard F1 score for the evaluation of detection. For event factuality, we report two metrics, the mean abso- lute error (MAE) relative to the gold standard la- bels and Pearson's correlation coefficient. While MAE is an intuitive metric that evaluates the abso- lute fit of the model, Pearson's r better captures how well a system is able to recover the varia- tion of the annotations. Pearson's r is also con- veniently normalized such that r = 0 for a system that blindly chooses the best a priori output and r = 1 for a system that makes no error.</p></div>

Our system shows an overall improvement in performance over all baselines, demonstrating that the regression model works well for this data. It is able to make more graded judgments that correlate with the aggre- gate opinions of untrained annotators. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, which compares the mean average er- ror for different buckets of factuality labels, we observe the largest gains over PRABHAKARAN in examples with low factuality, where lexical cues are especially critical.</p><p>Error Analysis We manually studied 50 devel- opment samples where our factuality model pro- duced the largest absolute errors. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> summa- rizes the error types. The biggest challenge is the wide variety of sparse lexical cues. For example, the sentences "Wong Kwan will be lucky to break even" and "That sale could still fall through if fi- nancing problems develop" require modeling the influence of "lucky to" and "fall through." Even when these types of features do appear in the train- ing data, they tend to be very rare. We also find cases that require inference over longer distances than our model permits. Con- sider the sentence "Mesa had rejected a general proposal from StatesWest to combine the two car- riers." To know that combine is not likely to hap- pen, we must infer that it is conditioned on the proposal, which was rejected. Finally, we find that world knowledge and pragmatic inference is sometimes required. For example, in the sen- tence "There was no hint of trouble in the last Error type % Missed lexical cue (unseen in training) 52 Missed lexical cue <ref type="table">(seen in training)  12  Long distance inference  16  World knowledge &amp; pragmatics  12  Annotation</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: Mean absolute error in the development set for different labels rounded to the nearest inte- ger. Our system's improvement is greater when predicting events with low factuality, which re- quires modeling sparse lexical cues. conversation between controllers and TWA pilot Steven Snyder," the pragmatic implication that trouble likely happened requires common knowl- edge about flights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We studied event detection and scalar factuality prediction, demonstrating that non-expert annota- tor can, in aggregate, provide high-quality data and introducing simple models that perform well on each task. There is significant room for fu- ture work to improve the results, including jointly modeling the factuality of multiple events and in- tegrating factuality models into information ex- traction and question answering systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example annotations with italicized event mentions and crowdsourced scalar factuality values u ∈ [−3.0, 3.0].
