				<p>This paper reports on the development of a hybrid and simple method based on a machine learning classifier (Naive Bayes), Word Sense Disambiguation and rules, for the automatic assignment of WordNet Domains to nominal entries of a lexicographic dictionary, the Senso Comune De Mauro Lexicon. The system obtained an F1 score of 0.58, with a Precision of 0.70. We further used the automatically assigned domains to filter out word sense alignments between MultiWordNet and Senso Co-mune. This has led to an improvement in the quality of the sense alignments showing the validity of the approach for domain assignment and the importance of domain information for achieving good sense alignments.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Problem Statement</head><p>Lexical knowledge, i.e. how words are used and ex- press meaning, plays a key role in Natural Language Processing. Lexical knowledge is available in many different forms, ranging from unstructured terminolo- gies (i.e. word list), to full fledged computational lexica and ontologies (e.g. WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>). The process of creation of lexical resources is costly both in terms of money and time. To overcome these lim- its, semi-automatic approaches have been developed (e.g. MultiWordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pianta et al., 2002</ref>)) with differ- ent levels of success. Furthermore, important informa- tion is scattered in different resources and difficult to use. Semantic interoperability between resources could represent a viable solution to allow reusability and de- velop more robust and powerful resources. Word sense alignment (WSA) qualifies as the preliminary require- ment for achieving this goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013)</ref>. WSA aims at creating lists of pairs of senses from two, or more, (lexical-semantic) resources which de- note the same meaning. Different approaches to WSA have been proposed and they all share some common elements, namely: i.) the extensive use of sense de- scriptions of the words (e.g. WordNet glosses); and ii.) the extension of the basic sense descriptions with addi- tional information such as hypernyms, synonyms and domain or category labels.</p><p>The purpose of this work is two folded: first, we exper- iment on the automatic assignment of domain labels to sense descriptions, and then, evaluate the impact of this information for improving an existing sense aligned dataset for nouns. Previous works has demonstrated that domain labels are a good feature for obtaining high quality alignments of entries <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Navigli, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Toral et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012</ref>). The Word- Net (WN) Domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bentivogli et al., 2004</ref>) have been selected as reference do- main labels. We will use as candidate lexico-semantic resources to be aligned two Italian lexica, namely, Mul- tiWordNet (MWN) and the Senso Comune De Mauro Lexicon (SCDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Vetere et al., 2011</ref>). The two resources differ in terms of modelization: the former, MWN, is an Italian version of WN obtained through the "expand model" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Vossen, 1996)</ref> and per- fectly aligned to Princeton WN 1.6, while the latter, SCDM, is a machine readable dictionary obtained from a paper-based reference lexicographic dictionary, De Mauro GRADIT. Major issues for WSA of the lexica concern the following aspects:</p><p>• SCMD has no structure of word senses (i.e. no taxonomy, no synonymy relations, no distinction between core senses and subsenses for polyse- mous entries) unlike MWN;</p><p>• SCDM has no domain or category labels associ- ated to senses (with the exception of specific ter- minological entries) unlike MWN;</p><p>• the Italian section of MWN has only 2,481 glosses in Italian over 28,517 synsets for nouns (i.e. 8.7%).</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 will report on the methodology and exper- iments implemented for the automatic assignment of the WN Domains to the SCDM entries. Section 3 will describe the dataset used for the evaluation of the WSA experiments and the use of the WN Domains for filter- ing the sense alignments. Finally, Section 4 illustrates conclusion and future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology and Experiments</head><p>The WN Domains consist of a set of 166 hierarchically organized labels which have been associated to each Classifiers P R F1 10-Fold F1 NaiveBayes lemma 0.77 0.58 0.66 0.66 MaxEnt lemma 0.70 0.49 0.58 0.63 NaiveBayes <ref type="bibr">wsd</ref> 0.77 0.58 0.66 0.69 MaxEnt <ref type="bibr">wsd</ref> 0.74 0.54 0.62 0.67 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Results for the Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy binary classifiers.</p><p>synset <ref type="bibr">1</ref> and express a subject field label (e.g. SPORT, MEDICINE). A special label, FACTOTUM, has been used for those synsets which can appear in almost all subject fields. The identification of a domain label to the nominal en- tries in the SCDM Lexicon is based the "One Domain per Discourse" (ODD) hypothesis applied to the sense descriptions. We have used a reduced set of domains labels (45 normalized domains) following <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Magnini et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>To assign the WN domain label to the SCDM entries, we have developed a hybrid method: first a binary clas- sifier is applied to the SCDM sense descriptions to dis- criminate between two domain values, FACTOTUM and OTHER, where the OTHER value includes all re- maining 44 normalized domains. After this, all entries classified with the OTHER value are analyzed by a rule based system and associated with a specific domain la- bel (i.e. SPORT, MEDICINE, FOOD . . . ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Classifier and feature selection</head><p>We have developed a training set by manually align- ing noun senses between the two lexica. The sense alignment allows us to associate all the information of a synset to a corresponding entry in the SCDM lexicon, including the WN Domain label. Concerning the test set, we have used an existing dataset of aligned noun pairs as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caselli et al., 2014</ref>). We report in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> the figures for the training and test sets. Multiple align- ments with the same domain label have been excluded from the training set. In order for the classifier to predict the binary do- main labels (FACTOTUM and OTHER), each sense description of the SCDM Lexicon has been repre- sented by means of a two-dimensional feature vector (e.g. for training data: BINARY DOMAIN LABEL <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The full set of labels and hierarchy is available at http://wndomains.fbk.eu/hierarchy.html GENERIC:val SPECIFIC:val). Feature values have been obtained through two strategies:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics</head><p>• lemma label: we extract all normalized domain labels associated to each sense of each lemma in the sense description from MWN. The value of the feature GENERIC corresponds to the sum of the FACTOTUM labels. The value of the fea- ture SPECIFIC corresponds to the sum of all other specific domain labels (e.g. MEDICINE, SPORT etc.) after they have been collapsed into a single value (i.e. NOT-FACTOTUM).</p><p>• Similarly to the lemma label strategy, the sum of the domain label FACTOTUM is assigned to the feature GENERIC, while the sum of all other do- main labels collapsed into the single value NOT- FACTOTUM is assigned to the feature SPECIFIC.</p><p>We experimented with two classifiers: Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy as implemented in the MAL- LET package <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(McCallum, 2002</ref>). We illustrate the re- sults in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. The classifiers have been evaluated with respect to standard Precision (P), Recall (R) and F1 against the test set. Ten-fold cross validation has been performed on the training set as well. Classifiers trained with the first strategy will be associated with the label lemma, while those trained with the second strat- egy with the label wsd. Both classifiers obtains good results with respect to the test data in terms of Precision and Recall. The Naive Bayes classifier outperforms the Maximum En- tropy one in both training approaches, suggesting better generalization capabilities even in presence of a small training set and basic features. The role of WSD has a positive impact, namely for the Maximum Entropy classifier (Precision +4 points, Recall +5 points with respect to the lemma label). Although such a positive effect of the WSD does not emerge for the Naive Bayes classifier with respect to the test set, we can still ob- serve an improvement over the ten-fold cross valida- tion (F1= 0.69 vs. F1=0.66). We finally selected the predictions of Naive Bayes wsd classifier as input to the rule-based system as it provides the highest scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Rules for WN Domain assignment</head><p>The rule based classifier for final WN Domain assign- ment works as follows:</p><p>• lemmatized and word sense disambiguated lem- mas in the sense descriptions are associated with the corresponding WN Domains from MWN;</p><p>• frequency counts on the WN Domain labels is ap- plied; the most frequent WN Domain is assigned as the correct WN Domain of the nominal entry;</p><p>• in case two or more WN Domains have same fre- quency, the following assignment strategy is ap- plied: if the frequency scores of the WN Do- mains is equal to 1, the value FACTOTUM is se- lected; on the contrary, if the frequency score is higher than 1, all WN Domain labels are retained as good.</p><p>We report the results on final domain assignment in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The final system, NaiveBayes+Rules, has been compared to two baselines. Both baselines ap- ply frequency counts over the WN Domains labels of the lemmas of the sense descriptions for the en- tire set of the 45 normalized domain values, including the FACTOTUM label, as explained in Section2. The Baseline lemma assigns the domain by taking into ac- count every WN Domain associated to each lemma. On the other hand, the Baseline wsd selects only the WN Domain of sense disambiguated lemmas. WSD for the second baseline has been performed by applying the same method described in Section 2.1. The results of both baselines have high values for Precision (0.58 for Baseline lemma , 0.70 for Baseline wsd ). We consider this as a further support to the validity of the ODD hy- pothesis which seems to hold even for text descriptions like dictionary glosses which normally use generic lex- ical items to illustrate word senses. It is also interesting to notice that WSD on its own has a positive impact in Baseline wsd system for the assignment of specific do- main labels (F1=0.53). The hybrid system performs better than both base- lines in terms of F1 scores (F1=0.58 vs. F1=0.45 for Baseline lemma vs. F1=0.53 for Baseline wsd ). How- ever, both the hybrid system and the Baseline wsd ob- tain the same Precision. To better evaluate the per- formance of our hybrid approach, we computed the paired t-test. The results of the hybrid system are sta- tistically significant with respect to the Baseline lemma (p &lt; 0.05) and for Recall only when compared to the Baseline wsd . To further analyze the difference between the hybrid system and the Baseline wsd , we performed an error analysis on their outputs. We have identified that the hybrid system is more accurate in the prediction of the System P R F1 NaiveBayes wsd +Rules 0.70 † 0.50 † * 0.58 † Baseline lemma 0.58 0.36 0.45 Baseline <ref type="bibr">wsd</ref> 0.70 0.43 0.53 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Results of WN Domain Assignment over the SDCM entries. Statistical significance of the Naive- Bayes+Rules system has been marked with a † for the Baseline lemma and with a * for the Baseline wsd FACTOTUM class with respect to the baseline. In par- ticular, the accuracy of the hybrid system on this class is 79% while that of the baseline is only 65%. In addi- tion to this, the hybrid system provides better results in terms of Recall (R=0.50 vs. R=0.43). Although compa- rable, the hybrid system provides more accurate results with respect to the baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Domain Filtering for WSA</head><p>This section reports on the experiments for improving existing WSA for nouns between SDCM and MWN. In this work we have used the same dataset and alignment methods as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caselli et al., 2014</ref>), shortly described here:</p><p>• Lexical Match: for each word w and for each sense s in the given resources R ∈ {MWN, SCDM}, we constructed a sense descriptions d R (s) as a bag of words in Italian. The alignment is based on counting the number of overlapping tokens between the two strings, normalized by the length of the strings;</p><p>• Cosine Similarity: we used the Personalized Page Rank (PPR) algorithm (Agirre et al., 2010) with WN 3.0 as knowledge base extended with the "Princeton Annotated Gloss Corpus". Once the PPR vector pairs are obtained, the alignment is obtained on the basis of the cosine score for each pair 4 .</p><p>The dataset consists of 166 pairs of aligned senses from MWN and SCDM for 46 nominal lemmas (see also column "Test set" in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Overall, SCDM covers 53.71The main difference with respect to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caselli et al., 2014</ref>) is that the proposed alignments have been additionally filtered on the basis of the output of the WN domain system (NaiveBayes wsd +Rules). In particular, for each aligned pair which was considered as good in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caselli et al., 2014)</ref>, we have applied a fur- ther filtering based on the WN domain system results as follows: if two senses are aligned but do not have the same domain, they are excluded from the WSA re- sults, otherwise they are retained. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> illustrates System P R F1 LexicalMatch 0.76 (0.69) 0.27 (0.44) 0.40 (0.55) Cosine noThreshold 0.27 (0.12) 0.47 (0.94) 0.35 (0.21) Cosine &gt; 0.1 0.77 (0.52) 0.21 (0.32) 0.33 (0.40) Cosine &gt; 0.2 0.87 (0.77) 0.14 (0.21) 0.24 (0.33) LexicalMatch+Cosine &gt; 0.1 0.73 (na) 0.40 (na) 0.51 (na) LexicalMatch+Cosine &gt; 0.2 0.77 (0.67) 0.37 (0.61) 0.50 (0.64) <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Results for WSA of nouns with domain filtering.</p><p>the results of the WSA approaches with domain fil- ters. We report in brackets the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caselli et al., 2014</ref>). The filtering based on WN Domains has a big impact on Precision and contributes to increase the quality of the aligned senses. Although, in general, we have a downgrading of the performance with respect to Recall, the increase in Precision will reduce the man- ual post-processing effort to fully aligned the two re- sources <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that, when merging together the results of the pre-filtered alignments from the two alignment approaches (Lex- icalMatch+Cosine &gt; 0.1 and LexicalMatch+Cosine &gt; 0.2), we still have a very high Precision (&gt; 0.70) and an increase in Recall (&gt; 0.40) with respect to the results of each approach. Finally, we want to point out that what was reported as the best alignment results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caselli et al., 2014</ref>), namely LexicalMatch+Cosine &gt; 0.2, can be obtained, at least for Precision, with a lower filtering cut-off threshold on the Cosine Similarity approach (i.e cut-off threshold at or higher than 0.1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This work describes a hybrid approach based on a Naive Bayes classifier, Word Sense Disambiguation and rules for assigning WN Domains to nominal sense descriptions of a lexicographic dictionary, the Senso Comune De Mauro Lexicon. The assignment of do- main labels has been used to improve WSA results on nouns between the Senso Comune Lexicon and Mul- tiWordNet. The results support some observations, namely: i.) domain filtering plays an important role in WSA, namely as a strategy to exclude wrong align- ments (false positives) and improve the quality of the aligned pairs; ii.) the method we have proposed is a vi- able approach for automatically enriching existing lex- ical resources in a reliable way; and iii.) the ODD hy- pothesis also apply to sense descriptions. An advantage of our approach is its simplicity. We have used features based on frequency counts and obtained good results, with a Precision of 0.70 for automatic WN Domain assignment. Nevertheless, an important role is played by Word Sense Disambiguation. The use of domain labels obtained from sense disambiguated lem- mas improves both the results of the classifier and those <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The F1 of 0.64 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caselli et al., 2014</ref>) is obtained with a Precision of 0.67, suggesting that some alignments are false positives of the rules. The absence of statistical significance with respect to the Baseline wsd is not to be considered as a negative result. As the error analysis has showed, the classifier mostly contributes to the identification of the FACTOTUM value, which tends to be overestimated even with sense disambiguated lemmas, and to Recall. We are planning to extend this work to include do- main clusters to improve the domain assignment re- sults, namely in terms of Recall.</p></div>
