				<p>The current approaches to Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) usually perform role classification for each predicate separately and the interaction among individual predi-cate&apos;s role labeling is ignored if there is more than one predicate in a sentence. In this paper, we prove that different predicates in a sentence could help each other during SRL. In multi-predicate role labeling , there are mainly two key points: argument identification and role labeling of the arguments shared by multiple predicates. To address these issues, in the stage of argument identification, we propose novel predicate-related features which help remove many argument identification errors; in the stage of argument classification, we adopt a discriminative reranking approach to perform role classification of the shared arguments, in which a large set of global features are proposed. We conducted experiments on two standard benchmarks: Chinese PropBank and English PropBank. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve SRL performance, especially in Chinese Prop-Bank.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a kind of shal- low semantic parsing task and its goal is to rec- ognize some related phrases and assign a joint structure (WHO did WHAT to WHOM, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW) to each predicate of a sen- tence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002</ref>). Because of the ability of encoding semantic information, SR- L has been applied in many tasks of NLP, such as question and answering <ref type="bibr">(Narayanan and Harabagir, 2004</ref>), information extraction (Surdeanu et The justices will be forced to reconsider the questions.</p><p>[ A1 ]</p><p>[ Pred ]</p><p>[ A0 ] <ref type="bibr">[ Pred ]</ref> [ A1 ]</p><p>Figure 1: A sentence from English PropBank, with an argument shared by multiple predicates al., <ref type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2005</ref>), and machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wu and Fung, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu and Gildea, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xiong et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zhai et al., 2012)</ref>. Currently, an SRL system works as follows: first identify argument candidates and then per- form classification for each argument candidate. However, this process only focuses on one inde- pendent predicate without considering the internal relations of multiple predicates in a sentence. Ac- cording to our statistics, more than 80% sentences in Propbank carry multiple predicates. One exam- ple is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, in which there are two predicates 'Force' and 'Reconsider'. Moreover, the constituent 'the justices' is shared by the two predicates and is labeled as A1 for 'Force' but as A0 for 'Reconsider'. We call this phenomenon of the shared arguments Role Transition . Intuitive- ly, all predicates in a sentence are closely related to each other and the internal relations between them would be helpful for SRL. This paper has made deep investigation on multi-predicate semantic role labeling. We think there are mainly two key points: argument identi- fication and role labeling of the arguments shared by multiple predicates. We adopt different strate- gies to address these two issues.</p><p>During argument identification, there are a large number of identification errors caused by the poor performance of auto syntax trees. However, many of these errors can be removed, if we take other predicates into consideration. To achieve this pur- pose, we propose novel predicates-related features which have been proved to be effective to recog-nize many identification errors. After these fea- tures added, the precision of argument identifica- tion improves significantly by 1.6 points and 0.9 points in experiments on Chinese PropBank and English PropBank respectively, with a slight loss in recall.</p><p>Role labeling of the shared arguments is anoth- er key point. The predicates and their shared argu- ment could be considered as a joint structure, with strong dependencies between the shared argumen- t's roles. If we consider linguistic basis for joint modeling of the shared argument's roles, there are at least two types of information to be captured. The first type of information is the compatibility of Role Transition among the shared argument's roles. A noun phrase may be labeled as A0 for a predicate and at the same time, it can be labeled as A1 for another predicate. However, there are few cases that a noun phrase is labeled as A0 for a predicate and as AM-ADV for another predicate at the same time. Secondly, joint modeling the shared arguments could explore global informa- tion. Motivated by the above observations, we at- tempt to jointly model the shared arguments' roles. Specifically, we utilize the discriminative rerank- ing approach that has been successfully employed in many NLP tasks. Typically, this method first creates a list of n-best candidates from a base sys- tem, and then reranks them with arbitrary features (both local and global), which are either not com- putable or are computationally intractable within the base model.</p><p>We conducted experiments on Chinese Prop- Bank and English PropBank. Results show that compared with a state-of-the-art base model, the accuracy of our joint model improves significant- ly by 2.4 points and 1.5 points on Chinese Prop- Bank and English PropBank respectively, which suggests that there are substantial gains to be made by jointly modeling the shared arguments of mul- tiple predicates.</p><p>Our contributions can be summarized as fol- lows:</p><p>• To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the mutual effect of mul- tiple predicates' semantic role labeling.</p><p>• We present a rich set of features for argument identification and shared arguments' classifi- cation that yield promising performance.</p><p>• We evaluate our method on two standard benchmarks: Chinese PropBank and English PropBank. Our approach performs well in both, which suggests its good universality.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 gives an overview of our approach. We discuss the mutual effect of multi-predicate' argument identification and argument classifica- tion in Section 3 and Section 4 respectively. The experiments and results are presented in Section 5. Some discussion and analysis can be found in Section 6. Section 7 discusses the related work- s. Finally, the conclusion and future work are in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach Overview</head><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, our approach follows the standard separation of the task of semantic role la- beling into two phases: Argument Identification and Argument Classification . We investigate the effect of multiple predicates in Argument Identi- fication and Argument Classification respectively. Specifically, in the stage of Argument Identifica- tion, we introduce new features related to predi- cates which are effective to recognize many argu- ment identification errors. In the stage of Argu- ment Classification, we concentrate on the classi- fication of the arguments shared by multiple pred- icates. We first use a base model to generate n- best candidates for the shared arguments and then construct a joint model to rerank the n-best list, in which a rich set of global features are proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Argument Identification</head><p>In this section, we investigate multi-predicate' mu- tual effects in Argument Identification. Argument Identification is to recognize the arguments from all candidates of each predicate. Here, we use the Maximum Entropy (ME) classifier to perform binary classification. As a discriminative model, ME can easily incorporate arbitrary features and  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(y|x) = 1 Z(x) exp( i θ i f i (x, y))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>in which x is the input sample, y(0 or 1) is the out- put label, f (x, y) are feature functions and Z(x) is a normalization term as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Z(x) = y exp( i θ i f i (x, y))</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Base Features</head><p>Xue (2008) took a critical look at the features used in SRL and achieved good performance. So, we use the same features in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Xue (2008)</ref> as the base features:</p><p>• Predicate lemma</p><p>• Path from node to predicate</p><p>• Head word</p><p>• Head word's part-of-speech</p><p>• Verb class <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Xue, 2008)</ref> • Predicate and Head word combination</p><p>• Predicate and Phrase type combination</p><p>• Verb class and Head word combination</p><p>• Verb class and Phrase type combination</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Additional Features</head><p>In the SRL community, it is widely recognized that the overall performance of a system is large- ly determined by the quality of syntactic parsers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gildea and Palmer, 2002</ref>), which is particularly notable in the identification stage. Unfortunate- ly, the state-of-the-art auto parsers fall short of the demands of applications. Moreover, when there are multiple predicates, or even multiple clauses in a sentence, the problem of syntactic ambiguity increases drastically ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kim et al., 2000</ref>). For ex- ample, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>, there is a sentence with two consecutive predicates '/' (is) and 'Ñ' (devel- op). Compared with the gold tree, the auto tree is less preferable, which makes the classifier easily mistake 'úQ' (building) as an argument of ' Ñ' (develop) with base features. But this identifi- cation error can be removed if we note that there is another predicate '/' (is) before 'Ñ' (devel-  op). Similar examples with the pattern 'NP + / + VV' can be found in PropBank, in which the sub- ject NP of the sentence is usually not an argument of the latter predicate. Thus, '/' (is) is an effec- tive clue to detect this kind of identification error. It is challenging to obtain a fully correct syntax tree for a complex sentence with multiple predi- cates. Therefore, base features that heavily rely on syntax trees often fail in discriminating argu- ments from candidates as demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  3</ref>. However, by considering the elements of neigh- boring predicates, we could capture useful clues like in the above example and remove many iden- tification errors. Below, we define novel predi- caterelated features to encode these 'clues' to re- fine candidates.</p><p>There are mainly five kinds of features as fol- lows.</p><p>• Is the given predicate the nearest one?</p><p>This is a binary feature that indicates whether the predicate is the nearest one to the candi- date.</p><p>• Local adjunct This is a binary feature designed for adjective and adverbial phrases. Some adjunct phras- es, such as 'Å' (only), have a limited sphere of influence. If the candidate is 'local' but the given predicate is not the nearest one, the candidate is often not an argument for the given predicate. To collect local adjuncts, we traverse the whole training set to get the ini- tial lexicon of adjuncts and refine it manually.</p><p>• Cut-Clause This type of feature is a binary feature de- signed to distinguish identification errors of noun phrase candidates. If a noun phrase can- didate is separated from the given predicate by a clause consisting of a NP and VP, the candidate is usually not the argument of the given predicate.</p><p>• Different Relative Positions with Conjunc- tions This is a binary feature that describes whether the candidate and the predicate are located in different positions as separated by conjunc- tions such as 'F/' (but). Conjunctions are often used to concatenate two clauses, but the first clause commonly describes one proposi- tion and the second clause describes anoth- er one. Thus, if the candidate and the given predicate have different positions relative to the conjunctions, the candidate is usually not the argument of the given predicate.</p><p>• Consecutive Predicates Sequence</p><p>When multiple predicates appear in a sen- tence consecutively, parse errors frequently occurs due to the problems of syntactic am- biguity as demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. To in- dicate such errors, sequence features of the candidates and consecutive predicates are de- fined specifically. For instance, for the candi- date 'úQ' (building) of 'Ñ' (develop), the features are 'cand-/-Ñ' and 'cand- /-VV', in which we use 'cand' to represent the position of the candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Argument Classification</head><p>In this section, we investigate multi-predicate' mu- tual effects in Argument Classification. Argument Classification is to assign a label to each argumen- t candidate recognized by the phase of Argument Identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Base Model</head><p>A conventional method in Argument Classifica- tion is to assign a label to each argument candidate by a classifier independently. We call this kind of method Base Model. In the base model, we still adopt ME (1) as our classifier; all base features of Argument Identification are contained (shown in subsection 3.1). In addition, there are some other features:</p><p>• Position: the relative position of the candi- date argument compared to the predicate</p><p>• Subcat frame: the syntactic rule that expands the parent of the verb</p><p>• The first and the last word of the candidate</p><p>• Phrase type: the syntactic tag of the candidate argument</p><p>• Subcat frame+: the frame that consists of the NPs (Xue, 2008).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Joint Model</head><p>As discussed briefly in Section 1, there are many dependencies between the shared arguments' la- beling for different predicates, but the base model completely ignores such useful information. To incorporate these dependencies, we employ the discriminative reranking method. Here, we first establish a unified framework for reranking. For an input x, the generic reranker selects the best output y * among the set of candidates GEN (x) according to the scoring function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y * = argmax y∈GEN (x) score(y)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In our task, GEN (x) is a set of the n-best can- didates generated from the base model. As usual, we calculate the score of a candidate by the dot product between a high dimensional feature and a weight W:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">score(y) = W · f (y)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>We estimate the weight W using the aver- aged perceptron algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins, 2002a</ref>) which is well known for its fast speed and good per- formance in similar large-parameter NLP tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Huang, 2008)</ref>. The training algorithm of the generic averaged perceptron is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. In line 5, the algorithm updates W with the differ- ence (if any) between the feature representations of the best scoring candidate and the gold candi- date. We also use a refinement called "averaged parameters" that the final weight vector W is the average of weight vectors over T iterations and N samples. This averaging effect has been shown to reduce overfitting and produces more stable results <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins, 2002a)</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Pseudocode: Averaged Structured Perceptron 1: Input: training data(x t , y * t ) for t = 1, ..., T ; 2: ¯ w (0) ← 0; v ← 0; i ← 0 3: for n in 1,...,N do 4: for t in 1, ..., T do 5: ¯ w (i+1) ← update ¯ w (i) according to (x t , y * t ) 6: v ← v + ¯ w i+1 7: i ← i + 1 8: ¯ w ← v//(N * T ) 9: return ¯ w</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Features for Joint Model</head><p>Here, we introduce features used in the joint mod- el. For clear illustration, we describe these fea- tures in the context of the example in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Role Transition (RT): a binary feature to in- dicate whether the transitions among roles of the candidate are reasonable. Because all roles are as- signed to the same candidate, all role transitions should be compatible. For instance, if an argu- ment is labeled as AM-TMP for one predicate, it cannot be labeled as AM-LOC for another pred- icate. This feature is constructed by traversing the training data to ascertain whether transitions between all roles are reasonable. In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we list some role transitions which are obtained from the training data of experiments on Chinese Prop- Bank.</p><p>Roles and Predicates' Sequence (RPS): a joint feature template that concatenates roles and the given predicates. For the gold candidate 'Arg1, Arg0', the feature is 'Arg1-force, Arg0- reconsider'.</p><p>Roles and Predicates' Sequence with Rela- tive Orders (RPSWR): the template is similar to the above one except that relative orders between roles and predicates are added. If the shared argu- ment is before the given predicate, the feature is described as 'Role-Predicate'; otherwise, the fea- ture is 'Predicate-Role'. And, if the predicate's voice is passive, the order is reversed. Thus, for the gold candidate 'Arg1, Arg0', this feature is 'force-Arg1, Arg0-reconsider'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Roles and Phrase Type Sequence (RPTS) Roles and Head Word Sequence (RHWS) Roles and Head Word's POS Sequence (RHWPS)</head><p>These three features are utilized to explore the shared argument's relations with roles.</p><p>Time and Location Class (TLC): We find there are much confusions between AM-TMP and AM-LOC in the base model. To fix these errors, we add two features: Time and Location Class. For these features, we just collect phrases labeled as AM-TMP and AM-LOC from the training da- ta. When the argument belongs to Time or Loca- tion Class, we add a sequence template consisting of 'Role-Time' for Time Class or 'Role-Location' for Location Class. For the gold candidate 'Arg1, Arg0', the feature is 'Arg1-none, Arg0-none' be- cause 'the justices' belongs neither to Time Class nor to Location Class. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Arg0  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  Arg1  +  +  +  +  - +  +  +  Arg2  +  +  +  +  - - - +  AM-LOC  +  +  +  +  - +  - +  AM-TMP  +  - - - +  +  - - AM-ADV  +  - +  - +  +  - - AM-MNR  +  +  - - - - +  - AM-TPC  +  +  +  +  +  +  - +   Table 2</ref>: Some role transitons from Chinese PropBank.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setting</head><p>To evaluate the performance of our approach, we have conducted on two standard benchmarks: Chi- nese PropBank and English PropBank. The exper- imental setting is as follows:</p><p>Chinese:</p><p>We use Chinese Proposition Bank 1.0. All data are divided into three parts. 648 files (from cht- b 081.fid to chtb 899.fid) are used as the training set. 40 files (from chtb 041.fid to chtb 080.fid) constitutes the development set. The test set con- sists of 72 files (chtb 001.fid to chtb 040.fid and chtb 900.fid to chtb 931.fid). This data setting is the same as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Xue, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sun et al., 2009</ref>). We adopt Berkeley Parser 1 to carry out auto parsing for SRL and the parser is retrained on the training set. We used n =10 joint assignments for training the joint model and testing.</p><p>English:</p><p>We choose English Propbank as the evaluation corpus. According to the traditional partition, the training set consists of the annotations in Sections 2 to 21, the development set is Section 24, and the test set is Section 23. This data setting is the same as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Xue and Palmer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Toutanova et al., 2005</ref>). We adopt Charniak Parser 2 to carry out auto parsing for SRL and the parser is retrained on the training set. We used n =10 joint assignments for training the joint model and testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experiment on Argument Identification</head><p>We first investigate the performance of our ap- proach in Argument Identification.</p><p>For the task of Argument Identification (AI), we 1 http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser/ 2 https://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser adopt auto parser to produce auto parsing trees for SRL. The results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We can see that in the experiment of Chinese, the F1 score reaches to 78.79% with base features. While after additional predicates-related features are added, the precision has improved by 1.6 points with s- light loss in recall, which leads to the improve- ment of 0.6 points in F1. The similar effect oc- curred in the experiment of English. After addi- tional features added in the identification module, the precision is improved by about 0.9 points with a slight loss in recall, leading to an improvement of 0.3 points in F1. However, the improvemen- t in English is slight smaller than in Chinese. We think the main reason is that there are less parse er- rors in English than in Chinese. All results demon- strate that the novel predicted-related features are effective in recognizing many identification errors which are difficult to discriminate with base fea- tures.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Comparison with Base Features in Ar- gument Identification. Scores marked by "*" are significantly better (p &lt; 0.05) than base features.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P(%) R(%) F 1 (%) Ch</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Experiment on Argument Classification</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Results</head><p>Errors produced in AI will influenced the evalu- ation of Argument Classification (AC). So, to e- valuate fairly we assume that the argument con- stituents of a predicate are already known, and the   The results of the base model are shown in Ta- ble 4. We first note that in testing set, there are a large number of shared arguments, which weigh- s about one quarter of all arguments in Chinese and 14% in English. Therefore, the fine process- ing of these arguments is essential for argumen- t classification. However, the base model cannot handle these shared arguments so well in Chinese that the accuracy of the shared arguments is lower by about 1.4 points than the average value of all arguments. Nevertheless, from <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> we can see that our joint model's accuracy on the shared argu- ments reaches 93.74%, 2.4 points higher than the base model in Chinese. Although the base mod- el obtain good performance on shared arguments of English, our joint model's performance reach- es 95.33%, 1.5 points higher than the base mod- el. This indicates that even though the base model is optimized to utilize a large set of features and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, it is still advantageous to model the joint information of the shared arguments.</p><p>Another point to note is that our joint model in resolving English SRL task is not so good as in Chinese SRL. There are mainly two reasons. The first reason is that the shared arguments occur less in English than in Chinese so that training sam- ples are insufficient for our discriminative model. The second reason is the annotation of some in- transitive verbs. In English PropBank, there is a class of intransitive verbs such as "land" (known as verbs of variable behavior), for which the ar- gument can be tagged as either ARG0 or ARG1. Here, we take examples from the guideline 3 of En- glish PropBank to explain.</p><p>"A bullet (ARG1) landed at his feet" "He (ARG0) landed" In the above examples, the two arguments and the predicate 'land' have the same relative order and voice but the arguments have different label- s for their respective predicates. In fact, accord- ing to the intention of the annotator, ARG0 and ARG1 are both correct. Unfortunately, in English PropBank, there is only one gold label for each ar- gument, which leads to much noise for our joint model. Moreover, such situations are not rare in the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Feature Performance</head><p>We investigate effects of the features of joint mod- el to the performance and results are shown in Ta- ble 6. Each row shows the improvement over the baseline when that feature is used in the joint mod- el. We can see that features proposed are beneficial to the performance of the joint model. But some features like 'RPS' and 'RPSRO' play a more im- portant role.  We use first letter of words to represent features.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">SRL Results</head><p>We also conducted the complete experiment on the auto parse trees. The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table  7</ref>. In experiments on Chinese PropBank, we can see that after novel predicate-related features are added in the stage of Argument Identification, our model outperforms the base model by 0.5 points   in F1. Furthermore, after incorporating the joint module, the performance goes up to 75.31%, 1.3 points higher than the base model. We obtain sim- ilar observations in experiments on English Prop- Bank, but due to reasons illustrated in Subsection 5.3, the performance of our method is slight better than the base model. We compare our method with others and the re- sults are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref>. In Chinese, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Xue (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sun et al. (2009)</ref> are pioneer works in Chinese SRL.

In English SRL, we compare out method with Sur- deanu and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Turmo (2005)</ref> which is best result ob- tained with single parse tree as the input in CON- LL 2005 SRL evaluation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Analysis</head><p>In this section, we discuss some case studies that illustrate the advantages of our model. Some ex- amples from our experiments are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table  9</ref>. In example (1), the argument is a preposition- al phrase '( n Ê ] t I ¡ Y ² " ö' (at the same time of compulsory education) and shared by two predicates '-0' (witness) and 'i '' (expand). In the corpus, a prepositional phrase is commonly labeled as ARGM-LOC and ARGM- TMP. Thus, the base model labeled the argument into these classes but one as ARGM-LOC, another as ARGM-TMP. Unfortunately, ARGM-LOC for '-0' (witness) is wrong while our joint model outputs both correct answers, which benefits from the role transition feature. From <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we can see that the role transition between ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC is impossible, which lowers the score of candidates containing both ARGM-LOC and ARGM-TMP in the joint model. Thus, the joint model is more likely to output the gold can- didate.</p><p>In example (2), the argument is 'wÉ Þ: :' (Hailar Airport) and shared by two predicates 'iú' (expand) and ':' (become). Because of the high similarity of the features in the base mod- el, the argument for both predicates is classified into the same class ARG0, but the label for 'iú' (expand) is wrong. Nevertheless, our joint mod- el obtains both correct labels, which benefits from the global features. After searching the training data, we find some similar examples to this one, such as '0Á ÐL Ì ò iú ó l Ì' (The railway operation mileage is expanded to 120 kilometers), in which '0Á ÐL Ì' (the railway operation mileage) is labeled as ARG1 for 'iú' (expand) but ARG0 for 'ó' (to). We think these samples provide evidence for our joint mod- el while these information has not been captured by the base model.</p><p>In example (3), the argument is 'ý… å ¦ ˆ Ø " ' AE â' (a large group with high reputation) and shared by predicates 'ÑU' (de- velop) and ':' (become). Different from the above cases in which only one label is wrong in the base model, both labels for 'ÑU' (develop) and ':' (become) are misclassified by the base model. However, our method still gets correct an- swers for both predicates, which also benefits from the global features.</p></div>

In this section, we briefly review these two types of work. On Semantic Role Labeling Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) first presented a sys- tem based on a statistical classifier which is trained on a hand-annotated corpora FrameNet. In their pioneering work, they used a gold or autoparsed syntax tree as the input and then extracted vari- ous lexical and syntactic features to identify the Examples Base Ours</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1.

They just labeled the predicate-argument struc- tures of ten specified verbs to a small collection of Chinese sentences, and utilized Support Vec- tor Machine to identify and classify the arguments. They made the first attempt on Chinese SRL and produced promising results. After the PropBank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xue and Palmer, 2003</ref>) was built, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Xue and Palmer (2004)</ref> and Xue (2008) took a critical look at fea- tures of argument detection and argument classi- fication.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Feature Work</head><p>This paper investigates the interaction effect a- mong multi-predicate's SRL. Our investigation has shown that there is much interaction effec- t of multi-predicate's SRL both in Argument Iden- tification and in Argument Classification. In the stage of argument identification, we proposed nov- el features related to predicates and successfully removed many argument identification errors. In the stage of argument classification, we concen- trate on the classification of the arguments shared by multiple predicates. Experiments have shown that the base model often fails in classifying the shared arguments. To perform the classification of the shared arguments, we propose a joint model and with the help of the global features, our join- t model yields better performance than the base model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of investigating the interaction effect of multi-predicate's SRL.</p><p>In the future, we will explore more effective fea- tures for multi-predicate's identification and clas- sification. Since we adopt reranking approach in the shared arguments' classification, the perfor- mance is limited by n-best list. Also, we would like to explore whether there is another method to resolve the problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>For example, in 'The columbia mall is ex- pected to open', there are two predicates 'expect' and 'open' and a shared argument 'the columbi- a mall'. Because this shared argument is before 'open' and the predicate 'open' is in active voice, a base classifier often incorrectly label this argu- ment A0 for 'open'. But if we observe that the ar- gument is also an argument of 'expect', it should be labeled as A1 for 'expect' and 'open'.</figDesc></figure>
