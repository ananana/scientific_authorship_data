				<p>Previous work has suggested that parameter sharing between transition-based neural dependency parsers for related languages can lead to better performance, but there is no consensus on what parameters to share. We present an evaluation of 27 different parameter sharing strategies across 10 languages, representing five pairs of related languages, each pair from a different language family. We find that sharing transition classifier parameters always helps, whereas the usefulness of sharing word and/or character LSTM parameters varies. Based on this result, we propose an architecture where the transition classifier is shared, and the sharing of word and character parameters is controlled by a parameter that can be tuned on validation data. This model is linguistically motivated and obtains significant improvements over a mono-lingually trained baseline. We also find that sharing transition classifier parameters helps when training a parser on unrelated language pairs, but we find that, in the case of unrelated languages, sharing too many parameters does not help.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The idea of sharing parameters between parsers of related languages goes back to early work in cross- lingual adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Zeman and Resnik, 2008)</ref>, and the idea has recently received a lot of interest in the context of neural dependency parsers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Duong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Susanto and Lu, 2017)</ref>. Modern neural dependency parsers, how- ever, use different sets of parameters for represen- tation and scoring, and it is not clear what param- eters it is best to share.</p><p>The Universal Dependencies (UD) project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nivre et al., 2016)</ref>, which is seeking to harmonize the annotation of dependency treebanks across * Work carried out during a stay at the University of <ref type="bibr">Copenhagen.</ref> languages, has seen a steady increase in languages that have a treebank in a common standard. Many of these languages are low resource and have small UD treebanks. It seems interesting to find out ways to leverage the wealth of information con- tained in these treebanks, especially for low re- source languages.</p><p>In this paper, we evaluate 27 different pa- rameter sharing strategies. We focus on a par- ticular transition-based neural dependency parser (de <ref type="bibr">Lhoneux et al., 2017a,b)</ref>, which performs close to the state of the art. This parser has three sets of parameters: i) the parameters of a character- based one-layer, bidirectional LSTM; ii) the pa- rameters of a word-based two-layer, bidirectional LSTM; iii) and the parameters of a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) with a single hidden layer. The two first sets are for learning to represent configu- rations; the third for selecting the next transition. We consider all combinations of sharing these sets of parameters; and in addition, we consider two ways of sharing each set of parameters, namely with and without a prefixed language embedding. The latter enables partial, soft sharing. In sum, we consider all 3 3 combinations of no sharing, hard sharing and soft sharing of the three sets of pa- rameters. We evaluate the 27 multilingual parsers on 10 languages from the UD project, represent- ing five pairs of related languages, each pair from a different language family. We repeat the exper- iment with the same set of languages, but using pairs of unrelated languages.</p><p>Contributions This paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to evaluate different parame- ter sharing strategies for exploiting synergies be- tween neural dependency parsers of related lan- guages. We evaluate the different strategies on 10 languages, representing five different language families. We find that sharing (MLP) transition <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Lang Tokens Family  Word order   ar  208,932 Semitic  VSO  he  161,685 Semitic  SVO  et  60,393 Finnic  SVO  fi  67,258 Finnic  SVO  hr  109,965 Slavic  SVO  ru  90,170 Slavic  SVO  it  113,825 Romance SVO  es  154,844 Romance SVO  nl</ref> 75,796 Germanic No dom. order no 76,622 Germanic SVO classifier parameters always helps, whereas the usefulness of sharing LSTM parameters depends on the language pair. This reflects the intuition that the transition classifier learns hierarchical struc- tures that are likely to transfer across languages, based on parser configurations that abstract away from several linguistic differences. The similarity of the input to character-and word-level LSTMs, on the other hand, will vary depending on the phonological and morphosyntactic similarity of the languages in question. Motivated by this ob- servation, we propose an architecture with hard- wired transition classifier parameter sharing, but in which sharing of LSTM parameters is tuned. The novel architecture significantly outperforms our monolingual baseline on our set of 10 languages. We additionally investigate parameter sharing of unrelated languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Uppsala dependency parser</head><p>The Uppsala parser (de <ref type="bibr">Lhoneux et al., 2017a,b)</ref> consists of three sets of parameters; the param- eters of the character-based LSTM, those of the word-based LSTM, and the parameters of the MLP that predicts transitions. The character-based LSTM produces representations for the word- based LSTM, which produces representations for the MLP. The Uppsala parser is a transition-based parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016)</ref>, adapted to the Universal Dependencies (UD) scheme, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> and using the arc-hybrid transition system from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kuhlmann et al. (2011)</ref> extended with a SWAP transition and a static-dynamic oracle, as de- scribed in de <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lhoneux et al. (2017b)</ref>. The SWAP 1 http://universaldependencies.org/ transition is used to generate non-projective de- pendency trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nivre, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>For an input sentence of length n with words w 1 , . . . , w n , the parser creates a sequence of vec- tors x 1:n , where the vector x i representing w i is the concatenation of a word embedding and the fi- nal state of the character-based LSTM after pro- cessing the characters of w i . The character vector ch(w i ) is obtained by running a (bi-directional) LSTM over the characters ch j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of w i . Each input element is represented by the word-level, bi-directional LSTM, as a vector v i = BILSTM(x 1:n , i). For each configuration, the fea- ture extractor concatenates the LSTM representa- tions of core elements from the stack and buffer. Both the embeddings and the LSTMs are trained together with the model. A configuration c is represented by a feature function φ(·) over a subset of its elements. For each configuration, transitions are scored by a classifier, in this case an MLP, and φ(·) is a con- catenation of BiLSTM vectors on top of the stack and the beginning of the buffer. The MLP scores transitions together with the arc labels for transi- tions that involve adding an arc. In practice, we use two interpolated MLPs, one which only scores the transitions, and one which scores transitions together with the arc label. For simplicity, we re- fer to that interpolated MLP as the MLP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Parameter sharing</head><p>Since our parser has three basic sets of model pa- rameters, we consider sharing all combinations of those three sets. We also introduce two ways of sharing, namely, with or without the addition of a vector representing the language. This language embedding enables the model, in theory, to learn what to share between the two languages in ques- tion. Since for all three model parameter sets, we now have three options -not sharing, sharing, or sharing in the context of a language embedding - we are left with 3 3 = 27 parameter sharing strate- gies; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>In the setting where we do not share (✗) word parameters (W), we construct a different word lookup table and a different word-level BiLSTM for each language. In the setting where we do hard parameter sharing (�) of word parameters, we only construct one lookup table and one word BiLSTM for the languages involved. In the set- ting where we do soft sharing (ID) of word pa-  rameters, we share those parameters, and in ad- dition, concatenate a language embedding l i rep- resenting the language of word w i to the vector of the word w i at the input of the word BiLSTM: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x i = e(w i ) • ch(w i ) • l i .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Language pairs We use 10 languages in our ex- periments, representing five language pairs from different language families. Our two SEMITIC lan- guages are Arabic and Hebrew. These two lan- guages differ in that Arabic tends to favour VSO word order whereas Hebrew tends to use SVO, but are similar in their rich transfixing morphology. Our two FINNO-UGRIC languages are Estonian and Finnish. These two languages differ in that Estonian no longer has vowel harmony, but share a rich agglutinative morphology. Our two SLAVIC languages are Croatian and Russian. These two languages differ in that Croatian uses gender in plural nouns, but otherwise share their rich inflec- tional morphology. Our two ROMANCE languages are Italian and Spanish. These two languages dif- fer in that Italian uses a possessive adjective with a definite article, but share a fairly strict SVO or- der. Finally, our two GERMANIC languages are Dutch and Norwegian. These two languages dif- fer in morphological complexity, but share word ordering features to some extent.</p><p>Datasets For all 10 languages, we use treebanks from the Universal Dependencies project. The dataset characteristics are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. To keep the results comparable across language pairs, we down-sample the training set to the size of the smallest of our languages, Hebrew: we randomly sample 5000 sentences for each training set. Note that while this setting makes the experiment some- what artificial and will probably overestimate the benefits that can be obtained from sharing param- eters when using larger treebanks, we find it in- teresting to see how much low resource languages can benefit from parameter sharing, as explained in the introduction.</p><p>Baselines and systems This is an evaluation pa- per, and our results are intended to explore a space of sharing strategies to find better ways of shar- ing parameters between dependency parsers of related languages. Our baseline is the Uppsala parser trained monolingually. Our systems are parsers trained bilingually by language pair where we share subsets of parameters between the lan- guages in the pair, and we report on what sharing strategies seem superior across the 10 languages that we consider.</p><p>Implementation details A flexible implementa- tion of parameter strategies for the Uppsala parser was implemented in Dynet. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We make the code publicly available. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results and discussion</head><p>Our results on development sets are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. We use labeled attachment score (LAS) as our metric for evaluating parsers. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> presents numbers for a select subset of the 27 shar- ing strategies. The other results can be found in the supplementary material. Our main observations are: (i) that, generally, and as observed in previous work, multi-task learning helps: all different shar- ing strategies are on average better than the mono- lingual baselines, with minor (0.16 LAS points) to major (0.86 LAS points) average improvements; and (ii) that sharing the MLP seems to be overall a better strategy than not sharing it: the 10 best strategies share the MLP. Whereas the usefulness of sharing the MLP seems to be quite robust across language pairs, the usefulness of sharing word and character parameters seems more dependent on the language pairs. This reflects the linguistic in- tuition that character-and word-level LSTMs are highly sensitive to phonological and morphosyn- tactic differences such as word order, whereas the MLP learns to predict less idiosyncratic, hierar- chical relations from relatively abstract represen- tations of parser configurations.</p><p>Based on this result, we propose a model (OURS) where the MLP is shared and the sharing of word and character parameters is controlled by a parameter that can be set on validation data. Results are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. We obtain a 0.6 LAS improvement on average and our proposed model is significantly better than the monolingual base- line with p &lt; 0.01. Significance testing is per- formed using a randomization test, with the script from the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Unrelated languages</head><p>We repeated the same set of experiments with un- related language pairs. We hypothesise that pa- rameter sharing between unrelated language pairs will be less useful in general than with related lan- guage pairs. However, it can still be useful, it has been shown previously that unrelated languages can benefit from being trained jointly. For exam- ple, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lynn et al. (2014)</ref> have shown that Indonesian was surprisingly particularly useful for Irish.</p><p>The results are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. The ta- ble only presents part of the results, the rest can be found in the supplementary material. As ex- pected, there is much less to be gained from shar- ing parameters between unrelated pairs. However, it is possible to improve the monolingual baseline by sharing some of the parameters. In general, sharing the MLP is still a helpful thing to do. It is most helpful to share the MLP and optionally one of the two other sets of parameters. Results are close to the monolingual baseline when everything is shared. Sharing word and character parameters but not the MLP hurts accuracy compared to the monolingual baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related work</head><p>Previous work has shown that sharing parame- ters between dependency parsers for related lan- guages can lead to improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Duong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ammar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Susanto and Lu, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Smith et al. (2018)</ref> recently found that sharing pa- rameters using the same parser as in this paper  Options we do not explore here are learning the architecture jointly with optimizing the task ob- jective ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Misra et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ruder et al., 2017)</ref>, or learning an architecture search model that predicts an architecture based on the properties of datasets, typically with reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Zoph and Le, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wong and Gesmundo, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Liang et al., 2018</ref>). We also do not explore the option of sharing selectively based on more fine-grained ty- pological information about languages, which re- lated work has indicated could be useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bjerva and Augenstein, 2018)</ref>. Rather, we stick to sharing between languages of the same language families.</p><p>The strategies explored here do not exhaust the space of possible parameter sharing strategies. For example, we completely ignore soft sharing based on mean-constrained regularisation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Duong et al., 2015</ref>). In future work, we plan to investigate what hap- pens when training on more than 2 languages. Here, we focused on a setting with rather small amounts of balanced data. It would be interest- ing to experiment with using datasets that are not balanced with respect to size. Finally, we have re- stricted our experiments to a specific architecture, using fixed hyperparameters including word and character embedding dimensions. It would be in- teresting to experiment with different parsing ar- chitectures as well as varying those hyperparame- ters.</p></div>

(soft sharing of word parameters, hard sharing of

been observed in machine translation (Dong et al., 
2015; Johnson et al., 2017), for example. Most 
studies have only explored a small number of pa-
rameter sharing strategies, however. Vilares et al. 
(2016) evaluate parsing with hard parameter shar-
ing for 100 language pairs with a statistical parser. 
Naseem et al. (2012) proposed to selectively share 
subsets of a parser across languages in the context 
of a probabilistic parser.
