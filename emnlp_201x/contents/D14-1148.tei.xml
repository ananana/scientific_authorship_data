				<p>It has been shown that news events influence the trends of stock price movements. However, previous work on news-driven stock market prediction rely on shallow features (such as bags-of-words, named entities and noun phrases), which do not capture structured entity-relation information , and hence cannot represent complete and exact events. Recent advances in Open Information Extraction (Open IE) techniques enable the extraction of struc-tured events from web-scale data. We propose to adapt Open IE technology for event-based stock price movement prediction , extracting structured events from large-scale public news without manual efforts. Both linear and nonlinear models are employed to empirically investigate the hidden and complex relationships between events and the stock market. Large-scale experiments show that the accuracy of S&amp;P 500 index prediction is 60%, and that of individual stock prediction can be over 70%. Our event-based system out-performs bags-of-words-based baselines, and previously reported systems trained on S&amp;P 500 stock historical data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Predicting stock price movements is of clear in- terest to investors, public companies and govern- ments. There has been a debate on whether the market can be predicted. The Random Walk The- ory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Malkiel, 1973)</ref> hypothesizes that prices are determined randomly and hence it is impossible to outperform the market. However, with advances of AI, it has been shown empirically that stock * This work was done while the first author was visiting Singapore University of Technology and Design price movement is predictable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bondt and Thaler, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jegadeesh, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lo and MacKinlay, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993)</ref>. Recent work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Das and Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tetlock, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tetlock et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Si et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wang and Hua, 2014</ref>) has applied Natural Language Process- ing (NLP) techniques to help analyze the effect of web texts on stock market prediction, finding that events reported in financial news are important ev- idence to stock price movement prediction.</p><p>As news events affect human decisions and the volatility of stock prices is influenced by human trading, it is reasonable to say that events can influ- ence the stock market. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows two pieces of financial news about Apple Inc. and Google Inc., respectively. Shares of Apple Inc. fell as trad- ing began in New York on Thursday morning, the day after its former CEO Steve Jobs passed away. Google's stock fell after grim earnings came out. Accurate extraction of events from financial news may play an important role in stock market pre- diction. However, previous work represents news documents mainly using simple features, such as bags-of-words, noun phrases, and named entities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lavrenko et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kogan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luss and d'Aspremont, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schumaker and Chen, 2009)</ref>. With these unstructured features, it is dif- ficult to capture key events embedded in financial news, and even more difficult to model the impact of events on stock market prediction. For exam- ple, representing the event "Apple has sued Sam- sung Electronics for copying 'the look and feel' of its iPad tablet and iPhone smartphone." using term-level features {"Apple", "sued", "Samsung", "Electronics", "copying", ...} alone, it can be dif- ficult to accurately predict the stock price move- ments of Apple Inc. and Samsung Inc., respec- tively, as the unstructured terms cannot indicate the actor and object of the event.</p><p>In this paper, we propose using structured in- formation to represent events, and develop a pre- diction model to analyze the relationship between events and the stock market. The problem is im- portant because it provides insights into under- standing the underlying mechanisms of the influ- ence of events on the stock market. There are two main challenges to this method. On the one hand, how to obtain structured event information from large-scale news streams is a challenging problem. We propose to apply Open Information Extraction techniques (Open IE; ), which do not require predefined event types or manu- ally labeled corpora. Subsequently, two ontolo- gies (i.e. VerbNet and WordNet) are used to gen- eralize structured event features in order to reduce their sparseness. On the other hand, the problem of accurately predicting stock price movement us- ing structured events is challenging, since events and the stock market can have complex relations, which can be influenced by hidden factors. In ad- dition to the commonly used linear models, we build a deep neural network model, which takes structured events as input and learn the potential relationships between events and the stock market.</p><p>Experiments on large-scale financial news datasets from Reuters 1 (106,521 documents) and Bloomberg 2 <ref type="bibr">(447,145 documents)</ref> show that events are better features for stock market predic- tion than bags-of-words. In addition, deep neu- ral networks achieve better performance than lin- ear models. The accuracy of S&amp;P 500 index pre- diction by our approach outperforms previous sys- tems, and the accuracy of individual stock predic- tion can be over 70% on the large-scale data.</p><p>Our system can be regarded as one step towards building an expert system that exploits rich knowl- edge for stock market prediction. Our results are helpful for automatically mining stock price re- lated news events, and for improving the accuracy of algorithm trading systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Event Representation</head><p>We follow the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kim (1993)</ref> and design a structured representation scheme that allows us to extract events and generalize them. Kim defines an event as a tuple <ref type="bibr">(O i , P , T )</ref>, where O i ⊆ O is a set of objects, P is a relation over the objects and T is a time interval. We propose a representa- tion that further structures the event to have roles in addition to relations. Each event is composed of an action P , an actor O 1 that conducted the action, and an object O 2 on which the action was performed. Formally, an event is represented as E = (O 1 , P, O 2 , T ), where P is the action, O 1 is the actor, O 2 is the object and T is the timestamp (T is mainly used for aligning stock data with news data). For example, the event "Sep 3, 2013 -Microsoft agrees to buy Nokia's mobile phone business for $7.2 billion." is modeled as: (Actor = Microsoft, Action = buy, Object = Nokia's mobile phone business, Time = Sep 3, 2013).</p><p>Previous work on stock market prediction rep- resents events as a set of individual terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fung et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fung et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hayo and Kutan, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Feldman et al., 2011</ref>). For example, "Microsoft agrees to buy Nokia's mobile phone business for $7.2 billion." can be represented by {"Microsoft", "agrees", "buy", "Nokia's", "mo- bile", ...} and "Oracle has filed suit against Google over its ever-more-popular mobile operating sys- tem, Android." can be represented by {"Oracle", "has", "filed", "suit", "against", "Google", ...}. However, terms alone might fail to accurately pre- dict the stock price movement of Microsoft, Nokia, Oracle and Google, because they cannot indicate the actor and object of the event. To our knowl- edge, no effort has been reported in the literature to empirically investigate structured event repre- sentations for stock market prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Event Extraction</head><p>A main contribution of our work is to extract and use structured events instead of bags-of-words in prediction models. However, structured event ex- traction can be a costly task, requiring predefined event types and manual event templates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ji and Grishman, 2008;</ref>. Partly due to this, the bags-of-words-based document representation has been the mainstream method for a long time.</p><p>To tackle this issue, we resort to Open IE, extract- ing event tuples from wide-coverage data with-out requiring any human input (e.g. templates).</p><p>Our system is based on the system of  and the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ding et al. (2013)</ref>; it does not require predefined target event types and la- beled training examples. Given a natural language sentence obtained from news texts, the following procedure is used to extract structured events:</p><p>1. Event Phrase Extraction. We extract the predicate verb P of a sentence based on the dependency parser of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang and Clark (2011)</ref>, and then find the longest sequence of words P v , such that P v starts at P and satis- fies the syntactic and lexical constraints pro- posed by . The content of these two constraints are as follows:</p><p>• Syntactic constraint: every multi-word event phrase must begin with a verb, end with a preposition, and be a contiguous sequence of words in the sentence.</p><p>• Lexical constraint: an event phrase</p><p>should appear with at least a minimal number of distinct argument pairs in a large corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Argument Extraction.</head><p>For each event phrase P v identified in the step above, we find the nearest noun phrase O 1 to the left of P v in the sentence, and O 1 should contain the subject of the sentence (if it does not contain the subject of P v , we find the second near- est noun phrase). Analogously, we find the nearest noun phrase O 2 to the right of P v in the sentence, and O 2 should contain the ob- ject of the sentence (if it does not contain the object of P v , we find the second nearest noun phrase).</p><p>An example of the extraction algorithm is as fol- lows. Consider the sentence, Instant view: Private sector adds 114,000 jobs in July: ADP.</p><p>The predicate verb is identified as "adds", and its subject and object "sector" and "jobs", respec- tively. The structured event is extracted as (Private sector, adds, 114,000 jobs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Event Generalization</head><p>Our goal is to train a model that is able to make predictions based on various expressions of the same event. For example, "Microsoft swallows Nokia's phone business for $7.2 billion" and "Mi- crosoft purchases Nokia's phone business" report the same event. To improve the accuracy of our prediction model, we should endow the event ex- traction algorithm with generalization capacity. To this end, we leverage knowledge from two well-known ontologies, WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miller, 1995)</ref> and VerbNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kipper et al., 2006</ref>). The pro- cess of event generalization consists of two steps. First, we construct a morphological analysis tool based on the WordNet stemmer to extract lemma forms of inflected words. For example, in "In- stant view: Private sector adds 114,000 jobs in July.", the words "adds" and "jobs" are trans- formed to "add" and "job", respectively. Second, we generalize each verb to its class name in Verb- Net. For example, "add" belongs to the multi- ply class. After generalization, the event (Private sector, adds, 114,000 jobs) becomes (private sec- tor, multiply class, 114,000 job). Similar methods on event generalization have been investigated in Open IE based event causal prediction (Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Prediction Models</head><p>1. Linear model. Most previous work uses linear models to predict the stock market ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fung et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luss and d'Aspremont, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schumaker and Chen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kogan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Das and Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xie et al., 2013)</ref>. To make direct com- parisons, this paper constructs a linear prediction model by using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a state-of-the-art classification model. Given a training set (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d 1 , y 1 ), (d 2 , y 2 ), ..., (d N , y N ), where n ∈ [1, N ], d</formula><p>n is a news document and y i ∈ {+1, −1} is the output class. d n can be news titles, news contents or both. The output Class +1 represents that the stock price will in- crease the next day/week/month, and the output Class -1 represents that the stock price will de- crease the next day/week/month. The features can be bag-of-words features or structured event features. By SVMs, y = arg max{Class + 1, Class − 1} is determined by the linear func- tion w · Φ(d n , y n ), where w is the feature weight vector, and Φ(d n , y n ) is a function that maps d n into a M-dimensional feature space. Feature tem- plates will be discussed in the next subsection. 2. Nonlinear model. Intuitively, the relationship between events and the stock market may be more complex than linear, due to hidden and indirect … News documents <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>

We exploit a deep neural network model, the hidden layers of which is useful for learning such hidden relationships. The structure of the model with two hidden layers is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In all layers, the sigmoid activation function σ is used.</p><p>Let the values of the neurons of the output layer be y cls (cls ∈ {+1, −1}), its input be net cls , and y 2 be the value vector of the neurons of the last hidden layer; then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y cls = f (net cls ) = σ(w cls · y 2 )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where w cls is the weight vector between the neu- ron cls of the output layer and the neurons of the last hidden layer. In addition,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y 2k = σ(w 2k · y 1 ) (k ∈ [1, |y 2 |]) y 1j = σ(w 1j · Φ(d n )) (j ∈ [1, |y 1 |])<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here y 1 is the value vector of the neu- rons of the first hidden layer,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">w 2k = (w 2k1 , w 2k2 , ..., w 2k|y 1 | ), k ∈ [1, |y 2 |] and w 1j = (w 1j1 , w 1j2 , ..., w 1jM ), j ∈ [1, |y 1 |].</formula><p>w 2kj is the weight between the kth neuron of the last hidden layer and the jth neuron of the first hidden layer; w 1jm is the weight between the jth neuron of the first hidden layer and the mth neuron of the input layer m ∈ [1, M ]; d n is a news document and Φ(d n ) maps d n into a M-dimensional features space. News documents and features used in the nonlinear model are the same as those in the linear model, which will be introduced in details in the next subsection. The standard back-propagation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rumelhart et al., 1985)</ref> is used for supervised training of the neural network.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Feature Representation</head><p>In this paper, we use the same features (i.e. docu- ment representations) in the linear and nonlinear prediction models, including bags-of-words and structured events.</p><p>(1) Bag-of-words features. We use the clas- sic "TFIDF" score for bag-of-words features. Let L be the vocabulary size derived from the train- ing data (introduced in the next section), and freq(t l ) denote the number of occurrences of the lth word in the vocabulary in document d.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">TF l = 1 |d| freq(t l ), ∀l ∈ [1 , L],</formula><p>where |d| is the number of words in the document d (stop words are removed).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">TFIDF l = 1 |d| freq(t l ) × log( N |{d:freq(t l )&gt;0 }| ),</formula><p>where N is the number of documents in the training set. The feature vector Φ can be represented as Φ = (ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ..., ϕ M ) = (TFIDF 1 , TFIDF 2 , ..., TFIDF M ). The TFIDF feature representation has been used by most pre- vious studies on stock market prediction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kogan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luss and d'Aspremont, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>(2) Event features. We represent an event tuple (O 1 , P, O 2 , T ) by the combination of elements (except for T) <ref type="bibr">(O 1</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">, P , O 2 , O 1 + P , P + O 2 , O 1 + P + O 2 )</formula><p>. For example, the event tuple (Microsoft, buy, Nokia's mobile phone business) can be represented as (#arg1=Microsoft, #action=get class, #arg2=Nokia's mobile phone business, #arg1 action=Microsoft get class, #action arg2=get class Nokia's mobile phone business, #arg1 action arg2=Microsoft get class Nokia's mobile phone business). Structured events are more sparse than words, and we reduce sparseness by two means. First, verb classes (Section 2.3) are used instead of verbs for P. For example, "get class" is used instead of the verb "buy". Second, we use back-off features, such as O 1 + P ("Microsoft get class") and P + O 2 ("get class Nokia's mobile phone business"), to address the sparseness of O 1 and O 2 . Note that the order of O 1 and O 2 is important for our task since they indicate the actor and object, respectively.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Our experiments are carried out on three differ- ent time intervals: short term (1 day), medium term (1 week) and long term (1 month). We test the influence of events on predicting the polarity of stock change for each time interval, comparing the event-based news representation with bag-of- words-based news representations, and the deep neural network model with the SVM model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Description</head><p>We use publicly available financial news from Reuters and Bloomberg over the period from Oc- tober 2006 to November 2013. This time span witnesses a severe economic downturn in 2007- 2010, followed by a modest recovery in 2011- 2013. There are 106,521 documents in total from Reuters News and 447,145 from Bloomberg News. News titles and contents are extracted from HTML. The timestamps of the news are also ex- tracted, for alignment with stock price informa- tion. The data size is larger than most previous work in the literature. We mainly focus on predicting the change of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock (S&amp;P 500) index 3 , obtaining indices and stock price data from Yahoo Finance. To justify the effectiveness of our predic- tion model, we also predict price movements of fifteen individual shares from different sectors in S&amp;P 500. We automatically align 1,782 instances of daily trading data with news titles and contents from the previous day/the day a week before the stock price data/the day a month before the stock price data, 4/5 of which are used as the training data, 1/10 for development testing and 1/10 for testing. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the training, devel- opment and test set are split temporally, with the data from 02/10/2006 to 18/16/2012 for training, the data from 19/06/2012 to 21/02/2013 for de- velopment testing, and the data from 22/02/2013 to 21/11/2013 for testing. There are about 54,776 events in the training set, 6,457 events in the de- velopment set and 6,593 events in the test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>We use two assessment metrics. First, a standard and intuitive approach to measuring the perfor- mance of classifiers is accuracy. However, this measure is very sensitive to data skew: when a class has an overwhelmingly high frequency, the accuracy can be high using a classifier that makes prediction on the majority class. Previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Xie et al., 2013</ref>) uses an additional evaluation metric, which relies on the Matthews Correlation Cofficient (MCC) to avoid bias due to data skew (our data are rather large and not severely skewed, but we also use MCC for comparison with previ- ous work). MCC is a single summary value that incorporates all 4 cells of a 2*2 confusion matrix (True Positive, False Positive, True Negative and False Negative, respectively). Given TP , TN , FP and FN :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">MCC = T P ·T N −F P ·F N √ (TP +FP )(TP +FN )(TN +FP )(TN +FN )<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Overall Development Results</head><p>We evaluate our four prediction methods (i.e. SVM with bag-of-word features (bow), deep neu- ral network with bag-of-word features (bow),    (1) Structured event is a better choice for rep- resenting news documents. Given the same pre- diction model (SVM or deep neural network), the event-based method achieves consistently better performance than the bag-of-words-based method over all three time intervals. This is likely due to the following two reasons. First, being an ex- traction of predicate-argument structures, events carry the most essential information of the docu- ment. In contrast, bag-of-words can contain more irrelevant information. Second, structured events can directly give the actor and object of the action, which is important for predicting stock market.</p><p>(2) The deep neural network model achieves better performance than the SVM model, partly by learning hidden relationships between structured events and stock prices. We give analysis to these relationships in the next section.</p><p>(3) Event information is a good indicator for short-term volatility of stock prices. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the performance of daily prediction is better than weekly and monthly prediction. Our experimental results confirm the conclusion of Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Macskassy (2008)</ref> that there is a one-day delay between the price response and the information embedded in the news. In addition, we find that some events may cause immediate changes of stock prices. For ex- ample, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer an- nounced he would step down within 12 months on 23/08/2013. Within an hour, Microsoft shares jumped as much as 9 percent. This fact indicates that it may be possible to predict stock price move- ment on a shorter time interval than one day. How-  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Individual stock prediction results ever, we cannot access fine-grained stock price historical data, and this investigation will be left as future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Experiments with Different Numbers of Hidden Layers of the Deep Neural Network Model</head><p>Cybenko <ref type="bibr">(1989)</ref> states that when every processing element utilizes the sigmoid activation function, one hidden layer is enough to solve any discrim- inant classification problem, and two hidden lay- ers are capable to parse arbitrary output functions of input pattern. Here we conduct a development experiment by different number of hidden layers for the deep neural network model. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, the performance of two hidden layers is better than one hidden layer, which is consistent with the experimental results of Sharda and De- len (2006) on the task of movie box-office predic- tion. It indicates that more hidden layers can ex- plain more complex relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bengio, 2009)</ref>. In- tuitively, three or more hidden layers may achieve better performance. However, three hidden lay- ers mean that we construct a five-layer deep neu- ral network, which is difficult to train <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bengio et al., 1994</ref>). We did not obtain improved accuracies using three hidden layers, due to diminishing gra- dients. A deep investigation of this problem is out of the scope of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Experiments with Different Amounts of Data</head><p>We conduct a development experiment by extract- ing news titles and contents from Reuters and Bloomberg, respectively. While titles can give the central information about the news, contents may provide some background knowledge or details. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Radinsky et al. (2012)</ref> argued that news titles are more helpful for prediction compared to news con-  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows that using only news titles achieves the best performance. A likely rea- son is that we may extract some irrelevant events from news contents. With the additional Bloomberg data, the results are not dramatically improved. This is intuitively because most events are reported by both Reuters news and Bloomberg news. We randomly se- lect about 9,000 pieces of news documents from Reuters and Bloomberg and check the daily over- lap manually, finding that about 60% of the news are reported by both Reuters and Bloomberg. The overlap of important news (news related to S&amp;P 500 companies) is 80% and the overlap of unim- portant news is 40%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Individual Stock Prediction</head><p>In addition to predicting the S&amp;P 500 index, we also investigate the effectiveness of our approach on the problem of individual stock prediction us- ing the development dataset. We select three well- known companies, Google Inc., Boeing Company and Wal-Mart Stores from three different sec- tors (i.e. Information Technology, Industrials and Consumer Staples, respectively) classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). We use company news, sector news and all news to predict individual stock price movement, respec- tively. The experimental results are listed in <ref type="table">Ta- ble 4</ref>.</p><p>The result of individual stock prediction by us- ing only company news dramatically outperforms the result of S&amp;P 500 index prediction. The main reason is that company-related events can directly affect the volatility of company shares. There is a strong correlation between company events and company shares. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> also shows that the result of individual stock prediction by using sector news or all news does not achieve a good performance, probably because there are many irrelevant events in all news, which would reduce the performance of our prediction model. The fact that the accuracy of these well-known stocks are higher than the index may be because there is relatively more news events dedicated to the relevant companies. To gain a better under- standing of the behavior of the model on more individual stocks, we randomly select 15 compa- nies (i.e. Google Inc., Boeing Company, Wal-Mart Stores, Nike Inc., QUALCOMM Inc., Apache Cor- poration, Starbucks Corp., Avon Products, Visa Inc., Symantec Corp., The Hershey Company, Mattel Inc., Actavis plc, Gannett Co. and SanDisk Corporation) from S&amp;P 500 companies. More specifically, according to the Fortune ranking of S&amp;P 500 companies 4 , we divide the ranked list into five parts, and randomly select three compa- nies from each part. The experimental results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. We find that:</p><p>(1) All 15 individual stocks can be predicted with accuracies above 50%, while 60% of the stocks can be predicted with accuracies above 60%. It shows that the amount of company-related events has strong relationship with the volatility of  (2) With decreasing company fortune rankings, the accuracy and MCC decrease. This is mainly because there is not as much daily news about low- ranking companies, and hence one cannot extract enough structured events to predict the volatility of these individual stocks.</p><note type="other">S&amp;P 500 Index Prediction Individual Stock Prediction Google Inc</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Final Results</head><p>The final experimental results on the test dataset are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref> (as space is limited, we show the results on the time interval of one day only). The experimental results on the development and test datasets are consistent, which indicate that our approach has good robustness. The following con- clusions obtained from development experiments also hold on the test dataset:</p><p>(1) Structured events are more useful represen- tations compared to bags-of-words for the task of stock market prediction.</p><p>(2) A deep neural network model can be more accurate on predicting the stock market compared to the linear model.</p><p>(3) Our approach can achieve stable experiment results on S&amp;P 500 index prediction and individ- ual stock prediction over a large amount of data (eight years of stock prices and more than 550,000 pieces of news).</p><p>(4) The quality of information is more impor- tant than the quantity of information on the task of stock market prediction. That is to say that the most relevant information (i.e. news title vs news content, individual company news vs all news) is better than more, but less relevant information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8">Analysis and Discussion</head><p>We use <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> to demonstrate our analysis to the development experimental result of Google Inc. stock prediction, which directly shows the relationship between structured events and the stock market. The links between each layer show the magnitudes of feature weights in the model learned using the training set.</p><p>Three events, (Google, says bought stake in, China's XunLei), (Google, reveals stake in, Chi- nese social website) and (Capgemini, partners, Google apps software), have the highest link weights to the first hidden node (from the left). These three events indicate that Google constantly makes new partners and expands its business area. The first hidden node has high-weight links to Class +1, showing that Google's positive coopera- tion can lead to the rise of its stock price. Three other events, (Oracle, sues, Google), (Google map, break, privacy law) and (Google, may pull out of, China), have high-weight links to the second hidden node. These three events show that Google was suffering questions and challenges, which could affect its reputation and further pull down its earnings. Correspondingly, the second hidden node has high-weight links to Class -1. These suggest that our method can au- tomatically and directly reveal complex relation- ships between structured events and the stock mar- ket, which is very useful for investors, and can fa- cilitate the research of stock market prediction.</p><p>Note that the event features used in our predic- tion model are generalized based on the algorithm introduced in Section 2.5. Therefore, though a specific event in the development test set might have never happened, its generalized form can be found in the training set. For example, "Google acquired social marketing company Wildfire In-teractive" is not in the training data, but "Google get class" ("get" is the class name of "acquire" and "buy" in VerbNet) can indeed be found in the training set, such as "Google bought stake in Xun- Lei" on 04/01/2007. Hence although the full spe- cific event feature does not fire, its back-offs fire for a correct prediction. For simplicity of showing the event, we did not include back-off features in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>Stock market prediction has attracted a great deal of attention across the fields of finance, computer science and other research communities in the past. The literature of stock market prediction was initiated by economists <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Keynes, 1937)</ref>. Sub- sequently, the influential theory of Efficient Mar- ket Hypothesis (EMH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fama, 1965)</ref> was estab- lished, which states that the price of a security re- flects all of the information available and that ev- eryone has a certain degree of access to the infor- mation. EMH had a significant impact on security investment, and can serve as the theoretical basis of event-based stock price movement prediction.</p><p>Various studies have found that financial news can dramatically affect the share price of a se- curity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chan, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tetlock et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Culter et al. (1998)</ref> was one of the first to investi- gate the relationship between news coverage and stock prices, since which empirical text analysis technology has been widely used across numerous disciplines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lavrenko et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kogan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luss and d'Aspremont, 2012)</ref>. These stud- ies primarily use bags-of-words to represent finan- cial news documents. However, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schumaker and Chen (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xie et al. (2013)</ref> point out, bag- of-words features are not the best choice for pre- dicting stock prices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schumaker and Chen (2009)</ref> extract noun phrases and named entities to aug- ment bags-of-words. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xie et al. (2013)</ref> explore a rich feature space that relies on frame semantic parsing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wang et al. (2014)</ref> use the same fea- tures as <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xie et al. (2013)</ref>, but they perform non- parametric kernel density estimation to smooth out the distribution of features. These can be regarded as extensions to the bag-of-word method. The drawback of these approaches, as discussed in the introduction, is that they do not directly model events, which have structured information.</p><p>There has been efforts to model events more di- rectly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fung et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hayo and Kutan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Feldman et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fung, Yu, and Lam (2002)</ref> use a normalized word vector-space to model event. Feldman et al. (2011) extract 9 prede- fined categories of events based on heuristic rules. There are two main problems with these efforts. First, they cannot extract structured event (e.g. the actor of the event and the object of the event). <ref type="bibr">Second, Feldman et al. (2011)</ref> can obtain only lim- ited categories of events, and hence the scalabil- ity of their work is not strong. In contrast, we extract structured events by leveraging Open In- formation Extraction technology (Open IE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yates et al. (2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Faber et al. (2011)</ref>) without predefined event types, which can effectively solve the two problems above.</p><p>Apart from events, sentiment analysis is another perspective to the problem of stock prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Das and Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tetlock, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tetlock et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Si et al., 2013)</ref>. Tet- lock (2007) examines how qualitative information (i.e. the fraction of negative words in a particular news column) is incorporated in aggregate market valuations. Tetlock, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy (2008)</ref> extend that analysis to address the impact of negative words in all Wall Street Joural (WSJ) and Dow Jones News Services (DJNS) sto- ries about individual S&amp;P500 firms from 1980 to 2004. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollen and Zeng (2011)</ref> study whether the large-scale collective emotion on Twitter is cor- related with the volatility of Dow Jones Indus- trial Average (DJIA). From the experimental re- sults, they find that changes of the public mood match shifts in the DJIA values that occur 3 to 4 days later. Sentiment-analysis-based stock mar- ket prediction focuses on investigating the influ- ence of subjective emotion. However, this paper puts emphasis on the relationship between objec- tive events and the stock price movement, and is orthogonal to the study of subjectivity. As a result, our model can be combined with the sentiment- analysis-based method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a framework for event-based stock price movement prediction. We extracted structured events from large-scale news based on Open IE technology and employed both linear and nonlinear models to empirically investi- gate the complex relationships between events and the stock market. Experimental results showed that events-based document representations are better than bags-of-words-based methods, and deep neural networks can model the hidden and in- directed relationship between events and the stock market. For further comparisons, we freely release our data at http://ir.hit.edu.cn/∼xding/data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example news for Apple Inc. and Google Inc.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="1,314.16,204.38,203.97,63.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>
