				<p>Social media websites provide a platform for anyone to describe significant events taking place in their lives in realtime. Currently, the majority of personal news and life events are published in a tex-tual format, motivating information extraction systems that can provide a struc-tured representations of major life events (weddings, graduation, etc.. .). This paper demonstrates the feasibility of accurately extracting major life events. Our system extracts a fine-grained description of users&apos; life events based on their published tweets. We are optimistic that our system can help Twitter users more easily grasp information from users they take interest in following and also facilitate many downstream applications, for example re-altime friend recommendation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter have recently challenged mainstream me- dia as the freshest source of information on im- portant news events. In addition to an important source for breaking news, social media presents a unique source of information on private events, for example a friend's engagement or college gradua- tion (examples are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). While a significant amount of previous work has inves- tigated event extraction from Twitter (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ritter et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Diao et al., 2012)</ref>), existing ap- proaches mostly focus on public bursty event ex- traction, and little progress has been made towards the problem of automatically extracting the major life events of ordinary users.</p><p>A system which can automatically extract ma- jor life events and generate fine-grained descrip- tions as in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> will not only help Twitter users with the problem of information overload by summarizing important events taking place in their friends lives, but could also facilitate downstream applications such as friend recommendation (e.g., friend recommendation in realtime to people who were just admitted into the same university, get the same jobs or internships), targeted online ad- vertising (e.g., recommend baby care products to newly expecting mothers, or wedding services to new couples), information extraction, etc.</p><p>Before getting started, we first identify a num- ber of key challenges in extracting significant life events from user-generated text, which account the reason for the lack of previous work in this area:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenge 1: Ambiguous Definition for Ma- jor Life Events Major life event identification</head><p>is an open-domain problem. While many types of events (e.g., marriage, engagement, finding a new job, giving birth) are universally agreed to be im- portant, it is difficult to robustly predefine a list of characteristics for important life events on which algorithms can rely for extraction or classification.</p><p>Challenge 2: Noisiness of Twitter Data: The user-generated text found in social media websites such as Twitter is extremely noisy. The language used to describe life events is highly varied and ambiguous and social media users frequently dis- cuss public news and mundane events from their daily lives, for instance what they ate for lunch.</p><p>Even for a predefined life event category, such as marriage, it is still difficult to accurately iden- tify mentions. For instance, a search for the keyphrase "get married" using Twitter Search 1 re- sults in a large number of returned results that do not correspond to a personal event:</p><p>• I want to get married once. No divorce &amp; no cheating, just us two till the end.</p><p>(error: wishes) <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Examples of users mentioning personal life events on Twitter.</p><p>• Can Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore just drop the pretense and get married already? (error: somebody else) • I got married and had kids on purpose (error: past)</p><p>Challenge 3: the Lack of Training Data Col- lecting sufficient training data in this task for ma- chine learning models is difficult for a number of reasons: (1) A traditional, supervised learning ap- proach, requires explicit annotation guidelines for labeling, though it is difficult to know which cat- egories are most representative in the data apriori.</p><p>(2) Unlike public events which are easily identi- fied based on message volume, significant private events are only mentioned by one or several users directly involved in the event. Many important cat- egories are relatively infrequent, so even a large annotated dataset may contain just a few or no ex- amples of these categories, making classification difficult.</p><p>In this paper, we present a pipelined system that addresses these challenges and extracts a struc- tured representation of individual life events based on users' Twitter feeds. We exploit the insight to automatically gather large volumes of major life events which can be used as training examples for machine learning models. Although personal life events are difficult to identify using traditional approaches due to their highly diverse nature, we noticed that users' followers often directly reply to such messages with CONGRATULATIONS or CONDOLENCES speech acts, for example:</p><p>User1: I got accepted into Harvard ! User2: Congratulations ! These speech acts are easy to identify with high precision because the possible ways to express them are relatively constrained. Instead of directly inspecting tweets to determine whether they corre- spond to major life events, we start by identifying replies corresponding to CONGRATULATIONS or CONDOLENCES, and then retrieve the message they are in response to, which we assume refer to important life events.</p><p>The proposed system automatically identifies major life events and then extracts correspondent event properties. Through the proposed system, we demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically reconstruct a detailed list of individual life events based on users' Twitter streams. We hope that work presented in this paper will facilitate down- stream applications and encourage follow-up work on this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Overview</head><p>An overview of the components of the system is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Pipeline1 first identifies the major life event category the input tweet talks about and filters out the irrelevant tweets and will be described in Section 4. Next, Pipeline2, as, demonstrated in Section 5, identifies whether the speaker is directly involved in the life event. Fi- nally, Pipeline3 extracts the property of event and will be illustrated in Section 6.</p><p>Section 3 serves as the preparing step for the pipelined system, describing how we collect train- ing data in large-scale. The experimental evalua- tion regarding each pipeline of the system is pre- sented in the corresponding section (i.e., Section 4,5,6) and the end-to-end evaluation will be pre- <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: System Overview. Blue: original input tweets. Red: filtered out tweets. Magenta: life event category. Green: life event property. Pipeline 1 identifies the life category the input tweet talks about (e.g., marriage, graduation) and filter out irrelevant tweets (e.g., I had beef stick for lunch). Pipeline 2 identifies whether the speaker is directly involved in the event. It will preserve self-reported information (i.e. "I got married") and filtered out unrelated tweets (e.g., "my friend Chris got married"). Pipeline 3 extracts the property of event (e.g. to whom the speaker married or the speaker admitted by which university).</p><p>sented in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Personal Life Event Clustering</head><p>In this section, we describe how we identify com- mon categories of major life events by leverag- ing large quantities of unlabeled data and obtain a collection of tweets corresponding to each type of identified event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Response based Life Event Detection</head><p>While not all major life events will elicit CON- GRATULATIONS or CONDOLENCES from a user's followers, this technique allows us to collect large volumes of high-precision personal life events which can be used to train models to recognize the diverse categories of major life events discussed by social media users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Life Event Clustering</head><p>Based on the above intuition, we develop an ap- proach to obtain a list of individual life event clus- ters. We first define a small set of seed responses which capture common CONGRATULATIONS and CONDOLENCES, including the phrases: "Congrat- ulations", "Congrats", "Sorry to hear that", "Awe- some", and gather tweets that were observed with seed responses. Next, an LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blei et al., 2003</ref>) 2 based topic model is used to cluster the gathered 2 Topic Number is set to 120. tweets to automatically identify important cate- gories of major life events in an unsupervised way. In our approach, we model the whole conversation dialogue as a document 3 with the response seeds (e.g., congratulation) masked out. We furthermore associate each sentence with a single topic, fol- lowing strategies adopted by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ritter et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gruber et al., 2007)</ref>. We limit the words in our document collection to verbs and nouns which we found to lead to clearer topic representations, and used collapsed Gibbs Sampling for inference ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Next one of the authors manually inspected the resulting major life event types inferred by the model, and manually assigned them labels such as "getting a job", "graduation" or "marriage" and discarded incoherent topics 4 . Our methodol- ogy is inspired by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ritter et al., 2012</ref>) that uses a LDA-CLUSTERING+HUMAN-IDENTIFICATION strategy to identify public events from Twitter. Similar strategies have been widely used in un- supervised information extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bejan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yao et al., 2011</ref>) and selectional preference  Conversation data was extracted from the CMU Twitter Warehouse of 2011 which contains a total number of 10% of all published tweets in that year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Expanding dataset using Bootstrapping</head><p>While our seed patterns for identifying mes- sages expressing CONGRATULATIONS and CON- DOLENCES are very high precision, they don't cover all the possible ways these speech acts can be expressed. We therefore adopt a semi- supervised bootstrapping approach to expand our reply seeds and event-related tweets. Our boot- strapping approach is related to previous work on semi-supervised information harvesting (e.g., <ref type="bibr">(Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Davidov et al., 2007)</ref>). To preserve the labeled topics from the first iteration, we apply a streaming approach to inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yao et al., 2009</ref>) over unlabeled tweets (those which did not match one of the response congratulations (cong, congrats); (that's) fantastic; (so) cool; (I'm) (very) sorry to hear that; (that's) great (good) new; awesome; what a pity; have fun; great; that sucks; too bad; (that's) unfortunate; how sad; fabulous; (that's) terrific; (that's) (so) wonderful; my deepest condolences; <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Responses retrieved from Bootstrapping. seeds). We collect responses to the newly added tweets, then select the top 20 frequent replies 5 . Next we manually inspect and filter the top ranked replies, and use them to harvest more tweets. This process is then repeated with another round of inference in LDA including manual labeling of newly inferred topics, etc... An illustration of our approach is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref> and the details are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>. The algorithm outputs a collection of personal life topics L, and a collec- tion of retrieved tweets D. Each tweet d ∈ D is associated with a life event topic l, l ∈ L.</p><p>We repeat the bootstrapping process for 4 iter- ations and end up with 30 different CONGRATU- LATIONS and CONDOLENCES patterns (shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) and 42 coherent event types which refer to significant life events (statistics for harvested data from each step is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>). We show examples of the mined topics with correspondent human labels in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, grouped according to a specific kind of resemblance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Summary and Discussion</head><p>The objective of this section is (1) identifying a category of life events (2) identifying tweets asso- ciated with each event type which can be used as candidates for latter self reported personal infor- mation and life event category identification.</p><p>We understand that the event list retrieved from our approach based on replies in the conversation is far from covering all types of personal events (especially the less frequent life events). But our  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: List of automatically discovered life event types with percentage (%) of data covered.</p><note type="other">Life Event Proportion Vacation 2.24 Relationship 2.16 Exams 2.02 Election 1.85 New Car 1.65 Running 1.42 Surgery 1.20 Lawsuit 0.64 Acting 0.50 Research 0.48 Essay 0.35 Lost Weight 0.35 Publishing 0.28 Song 0.22 OTHER 15.31</note><p>list is still able to cover a large proportion of IM- PORTANT and COMMON life events. Our latter work is focused on given a random tweet, identi- fying whether it corresponds to one of the 42 types of life events in our list.</p><p>Another thing worth noting here is that, while current section is not focused on self-reported in- formation identification, we have already obtained a relatively clean set of data with a large pro- portion of non self-reported information related tweets being screened: people do not usually re- spond to non self-reported information with com- monly used replies, or in other words, with replies that will pass our next step human test <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . These non self-reported tweets would therefore be excluded from training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Life Event Identification</head><p>In this section, we focused on deciding whether a given tweet corresponds to one of the 42 prede- fined life events.</p><p>Our training dataset consists of approximately 72,000 tweets from 42 different categories of life events inferred by our topic model as described in Section 3. We used the top 25% of tweets for which our model assigned highest probability to each topic. For sparsely populated topics we used the top 50% of tweets to ensure sufficient cover- age.</p><p>We further collected a random sample of about 10 million tweets from Twitter API 7 as non-life event examples and trained a 43-class maximum entropy classifier based on the following features:</p><p>• Word: The sequence of words in the tweet.</p><p>• NER: Named entity Tag.</p><p>• Dictionary: Word matching a dictionaries of the top 40 words for each life event category (automatically inferred by the topic model).</p><p>The feature value is the term's probability generated by correspondent event.</p><p>•</p><note type="other">Window: If a dictionary term exists, left and right context words within a window of 3 words and their part-of-speech tags. Name entity tag is assigned from Ritter et al's Twitter NER system (Ritter et al., 2011). Part-of- Speech tags are assigned based on Twitter POS package (Owoputi et al., 2013) developed by CMU ARK Lab. Dictionary and Window are constructed based on the topic-term distribution obtained from the previous section.</note><p>The average precision and recall are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref>. And as we can observe, the dictionary (with probability) contributes a lot to the perfor- mance and by taking into account a more compre- hensive set of information around the key word, classifier on All feature setting generate signifi- cantly better performance, with 0.382 prevision and 0.48 recall, which is acceptable considering (1) This is is a 43-way classification with much more negative data than positive (2) Some types of events are very close to each other (e.g., Leaving and Vocation). Note that recall is valued more than precision here as false-positive examples will be further screened in self-reported information iden- tification process in the following section.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Self-Reported Information Identification</head><p>Although a message might refer to a topic cor- responding to a life event such as marriage, the event still might be one in which the speaker is not directly involved. In this section we describe the self reported event identification portion of our pipeline, which takes output from Section 4 and further identifies whether each tweet refers to an event directly involving the user who publishes it. Direct labeling of randomly sampled Twitter messages is infeasible for the following reasons: (1) Class imbalance: self-reported events are rela- tively rare in randomly sampled Twitter messages. (2) A large proportion of self-reported information refers to mundane, everyday topics (e.g., "I just finished dinner!"). Fortunately, many of the tweets retrieved from Section 3 consist of self-reported information and describe major life events. The candidates for annotation are therefore largely nar- rowed down.</p><p>We manually annotated 800 positive examples of self-reported events distributed across the event categories identified in Section 3. We ensured good coverage by first randomly sampling 10 ex- amples from each category, the remainder were sampled from the class distribution in the data. Negative examples of self-reported information consisted of a combination of examples from the original dataset 8 and randomly sampled messages gathered by searching for the top terms in each of the pre-identified topics using the Twitter Search interface <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . Due to great varieties of negative sce- narios, the negative dataset constitutes about 2500 tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Features</head><p>Identifying self-reported tweet requires sophisti- cated feature engineering. Let u denote the term within the tweet that gets the highest possibility generated by the correspondent topic. We experi- mented with combinations of the following types of features (results are presented in <ref type="table">Table ?</ref>?):</p><p>• Bigram: Bigrams within each tweet (punctu- ation included).</p><p>• Window: A window of k ∈ {0, 1, 2} words adjacent to u and their part-of-speech tags.</p><p>• Tense: A binary feature indicating past tense identified in by the presence of past tense verb (VBD).</p><p>• Factuality: Factuality denotes whether one expression is presented as corresponding to real situations in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2007</ref>). We use Stanford PragBank 10 , an extension of <ref type="bibr">FactBank (Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009</ref>) which contains a list of modal words such as "might", "will", "want to" etc 11 .</p><p>• I: Whether the subject of the tweet is first per- son singular.</p><p>• Dependency: If the subject is first person singular and the u is a verb, the dependency path between the subject and u (or non- dependency). Tweet dependency paths were obtained from ( <ref type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014)</ref>. As the tweet parser we use only supports one-to-one dependency path iden- tification but no dependency properties, Depen- dency is a binary feature. The subject of each tweet is determined by the dependency link to the root of the tweet from the parser.</p><p>Among the features we explore, Word encodes the general information within the tweet. Win- dow addresses the information around topic key word. The rest of the features specifically address each of the negative situations described in Chal- lenge 2, Section 1: Tense captures past event de- scription, Factuality filters out wishes or imagi- nation, I and Dependency correspond to whether the described event involves the speaker. We built a linear SVM classifier using SVM light package (Joachims, 1999).  We report performance on the task of identi- fying self-reported information in this subsection. We employ 5-fold cross validation and report Ac- curacy (Accu), Prevision (Prec) and Recall (Rec) regarding different feature settings. The Tense, Factuality, I and Dependency features positively contribute to performance respectively and the best performance is obtained when all types of fea- tures are included. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Due to the colloquial property of tweets, we also intro- duced terms such as "gonna", "wanna", "bona". precision recall F1 0.82 0.86 0.84 <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Performance for identifying properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Event Property Extraction</head><p>Thus far we have described how to automatically identify tweets referring to major life events. In addition, it is desirable to extract important prop- erties of the event, for example the name of the university the speaker was admitted to (See <ref type="figure">Figure  1)</ref>. In this section we take a supervised approach to event property extraction, based on manually an- notated data for a handfull of the major life event categories automatically identified by our system. While this approach is unlikely to scale to the di- versity of important personal events Twitter users are discussing, our experiments demonstrate that event property extraction is indeed feasible.</p><p>We cast the problem of event property extrac- tion as a sequence labeling task, using Conditional Random Fields ( <ref type="bibr">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) for learning and inference. To make best use of the labeled data, we trained a unified CRF model for closely related event categories which often share proper- ties; the full list is presented in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> and we labeled 300 tweets in total. Features we used in- clude:</p><p>• word token, capitalization, POS • left and right context words within a window of 3 and the correspondent part-of-speech tags • word shape, NER • a gazetteer of universities and employers bor- rowed from NELL 12 . We use 5-fold cross-validation and report results in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">End-to-End Experiment</head><p>The evaluation for each part of our system has been demonstrated in the corresponding section. We now present a real-world evaluation: to what degree can our trained system automatically iden- tify life events in real world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Dataset</head><p>We constructed a gold-standard life event dataset using annotators from Amazon's Mechanical Turk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Snow et al., 2008</ref>) using 2 approaches:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life Event</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Property (a) Acceptance, Graduation Name of University/College (b) Wedding, Engagement, Falling love Name of Spouse/ partner/ bf/ gf (c) Getting a job, interview, internship Name of Enterprise (d) Moving to New Places, Trip, Vocation, Leaving</head><p>Place, Origin, Destination (e) Winning Award Name of Award, Prize <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Labeling Event Property.</p><p>• Ask Twitter users to label their own tweets (Participants include friends, colleagues of the authors and Turkers from Amazon Me- chanical Turk 13 ).</p><p>• Ask Turkers to label other people's tweets.</p><p>For option 1, we asked participants to directly la- bel their own published tweets. For option 2, for each tweet, we employed 2 Turkers. Due to the ambiguity in defining life events, the value co- hen's kappa 14 as a measure of inter-rater agree- ment is 0.54; this does not show significant inter- annotator agreement. The authors examined dis- agreements and also verified all positively labeled tweets. The resulting dataset contains around 900 positive tweets and about 60,000 negative tweets.</p><p>To demonstrate the advantage of leveraging large quantities of unlabeled data, the first base- line we investigate is a Supervised model which is trained on the manually annotated labeled dataset, and evaluated using 5 fold cross validation. Our Supervised baseline consists of a linear SVM classifier using bag of words, NER and POS fea- tures. We also tested a second baseline that combines Supervised algorithm with an our self- reported information classifier, denoted as Super- vised+Self.</p><p>Results are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 8</ref>; as we can ob- serve, the fully supervised approach is not suitable for this task with only one digit F1 score. The explanations are as follows: (1) the labeled data can only cover a small proportion of life events (2) supervised learning does not separate impor- tant event categories and will therefore classify any tweet with highly weighted features (e.g., the mention of "I" or "marriage") as positive. By us- ing an additional self-reported information classi- fier in Supervised+Self, we get a significant boost in precision with a minor recall loss.   <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>: Performance for different steps of boot- strapping for identifying life events in real world.</p><p>Another interesting question is to what degree the bootstrapping contributes to the final results. We keep the self-reported information classifier fixed (though it's based the ultimate identified data source), and train the personal event classifier based on topic distributions identified from each of the three steps of bootstrapping <ref type="bibr">15</ref> . Precision and recall at various stages of bootstrapping are presented in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>. As bootstrapping continues, the precision remains roughly constant, but recall increases as more life events and CONGRATULA- TIONS and CONDOLENCES are discovered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Related Work</head><p>Our work is related to three lines of NLP re- searches. (1) user-level information extraction on social media (2) public event extraction on social media. (3) Data harvesting in Information Extrac- tion, each of which contains large amount of re- lated work, to which we can not do fully justice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>User Information Extraction from Twitter</head><p>Some early approaches towards understanding user level information on social media is focused on user profile/attribute prediction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ciot et al., 2013)</ref>) user-specific content extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Diao et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Diao and Jiang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2014)</ref> or user personalization <ref type="bibr">(Low et al., 2011</ref>) identifi- cation.</p><p>The problem of user life event extraction was first studied by <ref type="bibr">Li and Cardie's (2014)</ref>. They at- tempted to construct a chronological timeline for Twitter users from their published tweets based on two criterion: a personal event should be personal and time-specific. Their system does not explic- itly identify a global category of life events (and tweets discussing correspondent event) but identi- fies the topics/events that are personal and time- specific to a given user using an unsupervised ap- proach, which helps them avoids the nuisance of explicit definition for life event characteristics and acquisition of labeled data. However, their sys- tem has the short-coming that each personal topic needs to be adequately discussed by the user and their followers in order to be detected 16 .</p><p>Public Event Extraction from Twitter Twitter serves as a good source for event detection owing to its real time nature and large number of users. These approaches include identifying bursty pub- lic topics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Diao et al., 2012)</ref>), topic evolution (Becker et al., 2011) or disaster outbreak ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sakaki et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li and Cardie, 2013)</ref> by spotting the increase/decrease of word frequency. Some other approaches are focused on generating a structured representation of events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ritter et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benson et al., 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Acquisition in Information Extraction</head><p>Our work is also related with semi-supervised data harvesting approaches, the key idea of which is that some patterns are learned based on seeds. They are then used to find additional terms, which are subsequently used as new seeds in the patterns to search for additional new patterns ( <ref type="bibr">Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Davidov et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Riloff et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Igo and Riloff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kozareva et al., 2008)</ref>. Also related approaches are distant or weakly supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Craven et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hoffmann et al., 2011</ref>) that rely on avail- able structured data sources as a weak source of supervision for pattern extraction from related text corpora.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion and Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a pipelined system for major life event extraction from Twitter. Experi- mental results show that our model is able to ex- tract a wide variety of major life events.</p><p>The key strategy adopted in this work is to ob- tain a relatively clean training dataset from large quantity of Twitter data by relying on minimum efforts of human supervision, and sometimes is at the sacrifice of recall. To achieve this goal, we rely on a couple of restrictions and manual screenings, such as relying on replies, LDA topic identifica- tion and seed screening. Each part of system de- pends on the early steps. For example, topic clus- tering in Section 3 not only offers training data for event identification in Section 4, but prepares the training data for self-information identification in Section 5. .</p><p>We acknowledge that our approach is not perfect due to the following ways: (1) The system is only capable of discovering a few categories of life events with many others left unidentified. (2) Each step of the system will induce errors and negatively affected the following parts. (3) Some parts of evaluations are not comprehensive due to the lack of gold-standard data. (4) Among all pipelines, event property identification in Section 6 still requires full supervision in CRF model, making it hard to scale to every event type <ref type="bibr">17</ref> . How to address these aspects and generate a more accurate, comprehensive and fine-grained life event list for Twitter users constitute our further work.</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Each whole conversation usually contains multiple tweets and users. 4 While we applied manual labeling and coherence evaluation in this work, an interesting direction for future work is automatically labeling major life event categories following previous work on labeling topics in traditional documentbased topic models (Mimno et al., 2011; Newman et al., 2010).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> We only treat the first sentence that responds to the beginning of the conversation as replies.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> For example, people don&apos;t normally respond to &quot;I want to get married once&quot; (example in Challenge 2, Section 1)</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> Most tweets in the bootstrapping output are positive. 9 The majority of results returned by Twitter Search are negative examples. 10 http://compprag.christopherpotts.net/ factbank.html</note>
