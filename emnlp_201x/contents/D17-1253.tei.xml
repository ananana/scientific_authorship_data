			<abstract>
				<p>Several approaches have been proposed to model either the explicit sequential structure of an argumentative text or its implicit hierarchical structure. So far, the adequacy of these models of overall argumentation remains unclear. This paper asks what type of structure is actually important to tackle downstream tasks in computational argu-mentation. We analyze patterns in the overall argumentation of texts from three corpora. Then, we adapt the idea of positional tree kernels in order to capture sequential and hierarchical argumentative structure together for the first time. In systematic experiments for three text classification tasks, we find strong evidence for the impact of both types of structure. Our results suggest that either of them is necessary while their combination may be beneficial.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Argumentation theory has established a number of major argument models focusing on different aspects, such as the roles of an argument's units <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Toulmin, 1958)</ref>, the inference scheme of an argu- ment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Walton et al., 2008)</ref>, or the support and attack relations between arguments (Freeman, 2011). The common ground of these models is that they con- ceptualize an argument as a conclusion (in terms of a claim) inferred from a set of pro and con premises (reasons), which in turn may be the conclusions of other arguments. For the overall argumentation of a monological argumentative text such as the one in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>(a), this results in an implicit hierarchical structure with the text's main claim at the lowest depth. In addition, the text has an explicit linguistic structure that can be seen as a regulated sequence of speech acts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004</ref>). pro argument unit (support of parent node) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> For one thing, inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution, <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> and furthermore no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person, <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same.  Natural language processing research has largely adopted the outlined hierarchical models for min- ing arguments from text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stab and Gurevych, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Habernal and Gurevych, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peldszus and Stede, 2016)</ref>. However, the adequacy of the resulting over- all structure for downstream analysis tasks of com- putational argumentation has rarely been evaluated (see Section 2 for details). In fact, a computational approach that can capture patterns in hierarchical overall argumentation is missing so far. Even more, our previous work indicates that a sequential model of overall structure is preferable for analysis tasks such as stance classification or quality assessment ( .</p><p>In this paper, we ask and investigate what model of (monological) overall argumentation is impor- tant to tackle argumentation-related analysis tasks. To this end, we consider three corpora with fully annotated argument structure (Section 3). Each corpus allows studying one text classification task, two of which we hypothesize to benefit from mod- eling argumentation (myside bias, stance), the third not (genre). An empirical analysis of the corpora reveals class-specific patterns of how people argue <ref type="bibr">(Section 4)</ref>. In order to combine the explicit se- quential and the implicit hierarchical structure of an argumentative text for the first time, we then adapt the approach of route kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aiolli et al., 2009)</ref>, modeling overall argumentation in form of a positional tree (Section 5).</p><p>On this basis, we design an experiment to eval- uate the impact of the different types of argumen- tative structure (Section 6). In particular, we de- compose our approach into four complementary modeling steps, both for a general model of overall argumentation and for the specific models of the given corpora. Using the structure annotated in the corpora, we systematically compare the effective- ness of all eight resulting models and two standard baselines in the three classification tasks.</p><p>Our results provide strong evidence that both sequential and hierarchical structure are important. As indicated by related work, sequential structure nearly competes with hierarchical structure, at least based on the specific argument models. Even more impressively, modeling hierarchical structure prac- tically solves the task of identifying argumentation with myside bias, achieving an outstanding accu- racy of 97.1%. For stance classification, the combi- nation captured by positional trees works best. In contrast, all types of structure fail in distinguishing genres, suggesting that they indeed capture proper- ties of argumentation. We conclude that the impact of modeling overall structure on downstream analy- sis tasks is high, while the required type may vary.</p><p>Contributions To summarize, the main contribu- tions of this paper are the following:</p><p>1. Empirical insights into how people structure argumentative texts in overall terms.</p><p>2. The first approach to model and analyze the sequential and hierarchical overall structure of argumentative texts in combination.</p><p>3. Evidence that modeling overall structure im- pacts argumentation-related analysis tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The study of overall argumentation traces back to Aristotle (2007) who outlined the impact of the sequential arrangement of the different parts of a speech. Conceptually, theory agrees that a mono- logical argumentative text has an implicit tree-like hierarchical structure: <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Toulmin (1958)</ref> defines an argument as a claim supported by data that is rea- soned by a warrant, which in turn may have a back- ing. In addition, a rebuttal may be given showing exceptions to the claim. The role of support and attack relations is investigated by Freeman (2011) who models dialectical arguments that discuss both a proponent's and an opponent's view on the main claim argued for. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Walton et al. (2008)</ref> put the focus on the inference scheme that describes how an argu- ment's conclusion follows from its premises, which may themselves be conclusions of arguments.</p><p>In natural language processing, argumentation research deals with the mining of argument units and their relations from text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mochales and Moens, 2011</ref>). Several corpora with annotated argument structure have been published in the last years. Many of the corpora adapt the hierarchical mod- els from theory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Reed and Rowe, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Habernal and Gurevych, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peldszus and Stede, 2016)</ref> or propose comparable models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stab and Gurevych, 2014</ref>). Since we target monological overall argu- mentation, we use those that capture the complete structure of texts, as detailed in Section 3. Corpora focusing on dialogical argumentation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Walker et al., 2012)</ref>, topic-related arguments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rinott et al., 2015)</ref>, or sequential structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wachsmuth et al., 2014b;</ref>) are out of scope.</p><p>We do not mine the structure of argumentative texts, but we exploit the previously mined structure to tackle downstream tasks of computational argu- mentation, namely, to classify the myside bias and stance of texts. For myside bias,  use features derived from discourse struc- ture, whereas Faulkner (2014) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sobhani et al. (2015)</ref> model arguments to classify stance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ong et al. (2014)</ref> and we ourselves ( ) do similar to assess the quality of persua- sive essays, and Beigman <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Klebanov et al. (2016)</ref> examine how an essay's content and structure influ- ence quality. Other works predict the outcome of legal cases based on the applied types of reasoning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brüninghaus and Ashley, 2003)</ref> or analyze infer- ence schemes for given arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feng and Hirst, 2011)</ref>. In contrast to the local structure of single arguments employed by all these approaches, we study the impact of the global overall structure of complete monological argumentative texts.</p><p>In ( ), we point out that the argumentation quality of a text is affected by interactions of its content at different levels of gran- ularity, from single argument units over arguments to overall argumentation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stede (2016)</ref> explores how different depths of overall argumentation can be identified, observing differences across genres. Unlike in our experiments, however, the genres considered there reflect diverging types of argu- mentation. Related to argumentation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Feng et al. (2014)</ref> build upon rhetorical structure theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref> to assess the coherence of texts, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Persing et al. (2010)</ref> score the organi- zation of persuasive essays based on sequences of sentence and paragraph functions.</p><p>We introduced the first explicit computational model of overall argumentation in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wachsmuth et al., 2014a</ref>). There, we compared the flow of local sentiment in a review to a set of learned flow pat- terns in order to classify global sentiment. Recently, we generalized the model in order to make flows applicable to any type of information relevant for argumentation-related analysis tasks . However, flows capture only se- quential structure, whereas here we also model the hierarchical structure of overall argumentation. To this end, we make use of kernel methods.</p><p>Kernel methods are a popular approach for learn- ing on structured data, with several applications in natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moschitti, 2006b</ref>) including argument mining ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rooney et al., 2012</ref>). They employ a similarity function defined between any two input objects that are represented in a task- specific implicit feature space. The evaluation of such a kernel function relies on the common fea- tures of the input objects <ref type="bibr">(Cristianini and ShaweTaylor, 2000</ref>). The kernel function encodes knowl- edge of the task in the form of these features.</p><p>Several kernel functions have been defined for structured data. To assess the impact of sequential argumentation, we refer to the function of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mooney and Bunescu (2006)</ref>, which computes common sub- sequences of two input sequences. For trees, most existing approaches count common subtrees of a certain type <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Collins and Duffy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Moschitti, 2006a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kimura and Kashima, 2012</ref>), but they do not take the ordering of the nodes in the subtrees into account. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiolli et al. (2009)</ref> developed a kernel that combines the content of substructures with the relative positions inside trees, called the route kernel. Similarly, the tree kernel of Daumé III and Marcu (2004) includes positional information for document compression. For overall argumenta- tion, we decided to use the route kernel in Section 5, as it makes the modeling of the sequential positions of an argument unit in a text straightforward. This allows us to capture both the sequential and the hierarchical structure at the same time. To our knowledge, no work has done this before. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Neural networks denote an alternative for learn- ing on structured data. They become particularly effective when few prior knowledge about what is important to address a task at hand is available, be- cause they can learn any feature representation in principle ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goodfellow et al., 2016</ref>). Due to this flex- ibility, however, large amounts of data are required for training an effective model, making neural net- works inadequate for the small datasets that allow studying overall argumentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tasks and Datasets</head><p>We seek to study the impact of modeling overall argumentation on downstream tasks without the noise from argument mining errors. To this end, we rely on three ground-truth argument corpora. Each corpus is suitable for evaluating one text classifica- tion task and comes with a specific model of overall argumentation, as detailed in the following.</p><p>Myside Bias on AAE-v2 The Argument Anno- tated Essays corpus was originally been presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stab and Gurevych (2014)</ref>. We use version 2 of the corpus (available on the website of the authors), which consists of 402 persuasive student essays. In each essay, all main claims, claims, and premises are annotated as such. Each claim has a pro or con stance towards each instance of the main claim, whereas each premise supports or attacks a claim or another premise. Thereby, argumentation is mod- eled as one tree structure for each major claim.</p><p>Stab and Gurevych (2016) added a myside bias class to each essay, reflecting whether its argumen- tation is one-sided considering only arguments for the own stance (251 cases) or not (151 cases).</p><p>Stance on Arg-Microtexts The Arg-Microtexts corpus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peldszus and Stede (2016)</ref> contains 112 short argumentative texts. They cover 18 different controversial topics and are annotated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Freeman (2011)</ref>: Each argument unit takes the role of the proponent or opponent of a main claim. What  the main claim is follows from a tree-like overall structure emerging from four types of relations: normal or example support from one unit to another, a rebuttal of units by other units, and undercutters where a relation is attacked by another unit. For 88 texts, the stance towards a specified topic is labeled as pro <ref type="formula">(46)</ref> or con (42). We use these labels for classification, but we do not access the topic. This way, stance needs to be identified only based on a text itself -a very challenging task. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Genre on Web Discourse Finally, we consider the Argument Annotated User-Generated Web Dis- course corpus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Habernal and Gurevych (2015)</ref>. There, 340 texts are annotated according to a modi- fied version of the specific model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Toulmin (1958)</ref> where claims are supported by premises or attacked by rebuttals. Rebuttals in turn may be attacked by refutations. Besides, emotional units not participat- ing in the actual arguments are marked as pathos.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AAE-v2 Arg-Microtexts Web Discourse</head><p>The support and attack relations build up the overall argumentation of a text.</p><p>The corpus composes argumentative texts of four genres, namely, 5 articles, 216 comments to arti- cles, 46 blog posts, and 73 forum posts. The genre is specified in form of a label for each text. Due to the low number, we ignore the articles below.</p><p>To give an idea of the sequential and hierarchical overall structure in each corpus, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents statistics of the argument units, the arguments (in terms of relations between two or more units), and the depth of the resulting argumentation.</p><p>While the size of the given corpora and the va- riety of tasks are limited, the only other available corpus with fully annotated argument structure that we are aware of is AraucariaDB (Reed and Rowe,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Insights into Overall Argumentation</head><p>Before we approach overall argumentation com- putationally, this section analyzes the three given corpora empirically to provide insights into how people argue in overall terms. For this, we unify the specific corpus models of overall argumentation outlined above in one general model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">A Unified View of Overall Argumentation</head><p>The texts in all corpora are segmented into argu- ment units, partly with non-argumentative spans in between that we ignore here for lack of relevance. To capture the sequential ordering of the segmenta- tion, we assign a global index to each unit.</p><p>As described in Section 3, the specific models of all three corpora in the end consider an argu- ment as a composition of one unit serving as the conclusion with one or more units that support or attack the conclusion (the premises). This compo- sition is defined through multiple relations from one premise to one conclusion each. There is one exception, namely, the undercutter relations in the Arg-Microtexts corpus have a relation as their tar- get. To obtain a unified form in the general model, we modify the undercutters such that they target the premise of the undercutted relation.</p><p>In all corpora, a premise may be the conclusion of another argument, while no argument unit serves as a premise in multiple arguments. This leads to a tree structure for each main claim of the associated text. A main claim corresponds to a unit that is not a premise. In AAE-v2 and in Web Discourse, more than one such unit may exist per text.</p><p>Depending on the corpus, the distinction of sup- port and attack is encoded through a specified rela- tion type, a unit's stance, or both. We unify these alternatives by modeling the stance of each unit to- wards its parent in the associated tree. This stance can be derived in all corpora. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> All other unit and relation types from the specific models are ignored, since there is no clear mapping between them.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>All texts</head><p>Texts with pro stance Texts with con stance   General Model As a result, we model the overall argumentation of an argumentative text as a forest of trees. Each node in a tree corresponds to an argu- ment unit. It has an assigned stance (pro or con) as well as a global index that defines its position in the text. Each edge defines a relation from a premise (the child node) to a conclusion (the parent node). Each main claim defines the root of a tree. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>(b) has already illustrated an instance of the general model. The general model is slightly less expressive than the specific models. We evalu- ate in Section 6 to what extent this reduces its use for tackling argumentation-related analysis tasks. The advantage of the general model is that it allows a comparison of patterns of overall argumentation across corpora, as we do in the following. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Visualization of Argumentation Patterns</head><p>Based on the general model, we empirically ana- lyze class-specific patterns of overall argumenta- tion on the three corpora. To this end, we compute one "average graph" for all texts in each complete corpus and one such graph for all texts with a par- ticular class (e.g., for all "no myside bias" texts in case of AAE-v2). In an average graph, each node is labeled with the relative frequency of the associated combination of position and depth in all texts (edges accordingly). We align positions <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Besides, although not in the focus here, we also assume stance to be easier to detect in practice than fine-grained roles.</p><p>of different texts based on their start node, due to our observation that the first argument unit over- proportionally often represents the main claim. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In addition the relative frequency, we determine the proportion of con to pro stance for each node.</p><p>As we aim to provide intuitive insights into how people argue in overall terms, we discuss the graphs in an informal visual way instead of listing exact numbers. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In the visualizations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 2</ref>, bright- ness captures (inverse) frequency, so darker nodes represent more frequent argument units. The di- ameter of the inner light-red part of each node re- flects its proportion of con stance. Nodes with a relative frequency below 0.3% and/or an absolute frequency below 3 are pruned, along with all their associated edges. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 2</ref>(a) stresses that most students state the main claim (depth 0, position 1) in a per- suasive essay first. When the first argument unit is a premise of the main claim instead, it often attacks the main claim, as the large light-red proportion of the node at depth 1 and position 1 conveys. While, on average, texts with myside bias do not differ in length from those without, the latter show more con stance, especially at depth 1. Also, argumenta-tion without myside bias shows more variance, as indicated, for instance, by the nodes at depth 0 and position 12 and 13 respectively. In contrast, clear patterns in the sequential ordering of pro and con stance are not recognizable in AAE-v2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AAE-v2</head><p>Arg-Microtexts According to the graphs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig- ure 2(b)</ref>, the position of the main claim varies in the microtexts. While the proportion of con stance seems rather similar between pro and con texts, our visualization reveals that their overall structure is "mirror-inverted" to a limited extent: Most pro texts start with the main claim (depth 0, position 1), dis- cuss con stance later (red proportions increase to the right), and deepen the argumentation in a top- down fashion (most edges from top left to bottom right). Vice versa, con texts more often present the main claim later, attack it earlier, and seem to argue more bottom-up. This suggests that both sequential and hierarchical structure play a role here.</p><p>Web Discourse The web discourse texts, finally, comprise rather shallow argumentation across all genres. Slight structural differences can be seen, especially, the comments appear a little shorter and richer of pro stance on average. Besides, the blog posts have more con stance later. Still, the darker and thus more frequent nodes are at similar posi- tions in all graphs. So, if at all, differences may be reflected in a sequential model of argumentation, which implicitly covers length. In terms of the hier- archical structure of the frequent nodes, the graphs of all genres are rather indistinguishable.</p><p>Altogether, the visualizations give first support for the impact of modeling overall argumentation. In particular, we hypothesize that hierarchical over- all structure is decisive for myside bias, whereas a combination of sequential and hierarchical struc- ture helps to distinguish pro-stance from con-stance texts. In contrast, we expect that the impact on clas- sifying genres in the Web Discourse corpus is low.</p></div>

Technically, we there- for map the forest of trees representing a text (see Section 4) to a single tree by adding a "virtual" root node v 0 to V that is the parent of all tree roots.</p><p>In analysis tasks, we seek to compare sequential and hierarchical structures irrespective of the actual texts and the size of the associated trees. To this end, we represent labels and positions as follows:</p><p>Labels The tree kernel approaches in natural lan- guage processing discussed in Section 2 include text (usually words) in the leaf nodes. In contrast, we label each node v ∈ V with the type of the asso- ciated argument unit only. Thereby, we almost fully abstract from the content of texts, which benefits the identification of common structures. In case of the general model, the only two labels are pro and con. In case of the specific models, we combine the role of a unit with the type of the relation the unit is the source of (if any). On Arg-Microtexts, for in- stance, this creates labels such as opponent-support or opponent-undercutter.</p><p>Positions As we adapt the route kernels of Aiolli et al. <ref type="formula">(2009)</ref> below, we follow their representation of sequential structure with one exception. In par- ticular, the authors assigned an index to each edge that numbers the child nodes of each node ascend- ing from 1. Thereby, they encoded the relative positions of sibling nodes to each other. To capture the ordering of argument units in a text from left to right, we also model positions as indices of the edges in E. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiolli et al. (2009)</ref>, however, we use indices decreasing from -1 in the left direc- tion of the parent node and ascending from 1 to the right (derived from the nodes' global indices). While such a simple relabeling allows us to reuse their algorithm for computing kernels, it makes a decisive difference, namely, it encodes the relative positions of child nodes to their parent. This in turn implies the sequential structure of the whole tree. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>(a) exemplifies the tree representation for the argument unit types of the general model, omitting the virtual root v 0 for simplicity. Analo- gously, the types of the specific models of the three considered corpora could be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Kernel-based Modeling Approaches</head><p>Based on the tree representation, we now introduce four approaches for modeling overall argumenta- tion. <ref type="figure">Figure 3(b)</ref> illustrates the kernel representa- tions of each approach. As discussed in Section 2, the associated kernel function compares the repre- sentations of the trees T, T of any two texts.</p><p>Label Frequencies (a 1 ) Our simplest model of overall argumentation does not encode structure at all. Instead, it compares only the frequencies of each node label in T and T . We represent the model with a linear kernel, which in the end corre- sponds to a standard feature representation.</p><p>Label Sequences (a 2 ) To encode sequential over- all structure, we refer to the kernel of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mooney and Bunescu (2006)</ref>, representing the sequential order- ing of node labels in a tree by all contiguous subse- quences. The similarity of two trees T and T fol- lows from the proportion of common subsequences, but longer subsequences are penalized by a decay factor. This approach can be seen as an imitation of our flow model ( ). 7</p><p>Label Tree Paths (a 3 ) We capture hierarchical overall structure adapting the non-positional part of the route kernel of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiolli et al. (2009)</ref>, label paths. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We use a sequence kernel instead of flows in order to obtain a uniform setting. In , we also analyze flow abstractions (e.g., collapsing sequences of the same label). Here, we resort only to the original sequence.</p><p>A label path ξ(v i , v j ) denotes the sequence of la- bels of the nodes in the shortest path between v i , v j in a tree (including v i , v j ). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiolli et al. (2009)</ref>, we consider only label paths starting at the root v i = v 0 , abbreviated here as ξ(v j ). Implicitly, other paths may still be considered through the use of polynomial kernels with degree d &gt; 1. As the authors, we compare any two paths with a function δ whose values is 1 when the paths are identical and 0 otherwise. Given two trees T = (V, E) and T = (V , E ), we then define a normalized poly- nomial kernel K ξ (T, T ) over all label paths as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v∈V v ∈V δ(ξ(v), ξ(v )) |V | · |V | d Positional Tree Paths (a 4 ) In addition to label paths, Aiolli et al. (2009) define a route π(v i , v j )</formula><p>as the sequence of edge indices on the shortest path between any two nodes v i , v j in a tree, i.e., the se- quence of local positions. As above, they restrict their view to routes starting at the root, which we denote as π(v j ), and compare them using δ. To combine positional information with label informa- tion, the authors build the product of a kernel based on the label paths and a kernel based on routes. As a result, sequential and hierarchical overall struc- ture are compared at the same time. For overall argumentation, we define the resulting normalized polynomial product kernel K ξπ (T, T ) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v∈V v ∈V δ(ξ(v), ξ(v )) · δ(π(v), π(v )) (|V | · |V |) 2 d</formula><p>Each approach, a 1 -a 4 , can be seen as represent- ing one particular step of modeling overall argu- mentation; a 4 combines the complementary steps of a 2 and a 3 , both of which implicitly include a 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Evaluation</head><p>Finally, we evaluate all four approaches to model overall argumentation from Section 5 on the three tasks associated to the corpora from Section 3. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Experimental Set-up</head><p>Our goal is to assess the theoretical impact of each introduced step of modeling overall argumentation as far as possible. To this end, we conduct a sys- tematic experiment where we use the ground-truth argument structure in each corpus for the associated downstream task based on the following set-up:</p><p>Myside Bias on AAE-v2</p><p>Stance on Arg-Microtexts Genre on Web Discourse</p></div>

For each task, we measure the accuracy of all four approaches. We do this once for our general model of overall argumentation from Section 4 and once for the specific model annotated in the respective corpus, in order to assess the loss of resorting to our always applicable general model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baselines</head><p>As a basic task-intrinsic measure, we compare a 1 -a 4 to the majority baseline that always predicts the majority class in the given corpus. In addition, we employ two standard feature types and combine them with a 1 -a 4 , in order to roughly as- sess the need for modeling argumentation: b 1 POS n-grams. The frequency of each part- of-speech 1-to 3-gram found in ≥ 5% of all texts. This style feature has been effective in argumentation-related analysis tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Persing and Ng, 2015;</ref>. b 2 Token n-grams. The frequency of each token 1-to 3-gram found in ≥ 5% of all texts. This content feature is strong in many text analysis tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Joachims, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pang et al., 2002</ref>).</p><p>From the tackled tasks, only myside bias has been approached on the given datasets in previous work. While we mention the respective results for com- pleteness below, a comparison is in fact unfair due to our resort to ground-truth argument structure.</p><p>Experiments The evaluation of all approaches and baselines was done using the kernel-based ma- chine learning platform <ref type="bibr">KeLP (Filice et al., 2015)</ref>, performing classification with the available imple- mentation of LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011). As we target the theoretically possible impact of mod- eling overall argumentation, we tested a number of hyperparameter configurations. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We performed 10-fold cross-validation on the complete corpora and repeated each experiment 10 times, with in- stance shuffling in between. Then, we averaged the accuracy of each configuration over all folds and repetitions. To prevent the classifiers from using knowledge about the class distributions, we used fairness during training, i.e., each class was given an equal weight ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Filice et al., 2014</ref>). Thus, the majority baseline is not a trivial competitor. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> presents the best obtained results of each evaluated approach for each task/corpus combina- tion. To clarify the reliability of the differences be- tween the results, the table includes the confidence level (starting at 95%) at which each approach is significantly better than all weaker approaches ac- cording to a two-tailed paired student's t-test. 10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Results</head><p>Myside Bias on AAE-v2 The highest accuracy reported for classifying myside bias is 77.0 ( . While the comparability is limited (see above), we see that label frequencies (a 1 ) already achieve 83.4 and 85.7 for the general and specific model respectively, outperforming all baselines with 99.9% confidence. Matching the in- sights from Section 4, the sole proportion of attacks thus seems a good predictor of myside bias.</p><p>Label sequences (a 2 ) further improve over a 1 , which underlines that also the sequential position of con stance and attack relations has an impact. a 2 is particular strong under the specific model <ref type="bibr">(94.7)</ref>. Unlike the general model, this model reflects some hierarchical information via the roles of argument units, such as premise. a 2 performs only slightly worse than the label tree paths (a 3 ), indicating that an adequate sequential model can compete with a hierarchical model, as we hypothesized in previous work ).</p><p>Nevertheless, a 3 turns out best on AAE-v2, most likely due to its capability to capture the depth at which con stance occurs. Considering that no cor- pus annotation is perfect, the outstanding accuracy of 97.1 conveys an important finding: Modeling the tree structure of an argumentation basically solves the myside bias task without requiring other fea- tures. Neither the positional tree paths (a 4 ) nor the combination with token n-grams (ba) can add to that. Also, there is no difference between the gen- eral and the specific model, underlining that the unit roles in AAE-v2 are implicitly covered by the hierarchical structure in the general model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stance on Arg-Microtexts</head><p>The accuracy results for the given challenging variant of stance classi- fication (see Section 3) are much lower. Under the general model, the label frequencies (49.7) do not even compete with the majority baseline (52.3). Notable gains are achieved by the label sequences under the specific model (62.3), slightly beating the label tree paths (61.9). Putting them together in the positional tree paths (a 4 ) yields an accuracy of 66.7 and 67.8 respectively; more than the token n-grams (b 2 , 65.2). Combining a 4 and b 2 in ba in turn results in the best observed accuracy value (71.0 on the specific model).</p><p>We conclude that both sequential and hierarchi- cal overall structure are important for the distinc- tion of pro from con argumentation, supporting our hypothesis from Section 4. They complement content-oriented approaches, such as b 2 . More- over, the fine-grained unit and relation types of the specific model annotated in Arg-Microtexts seem useful, consistently obtaining higher accuracy than the general model. Notice, though, that due to the small size of the corpus, only few reported gains are statistically significant, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Genre on Web Discourse Although Section 4 has made minor structural differences in Web Dis- course visible, <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows that a 1 -a 4 all fail in genre classification: None of them beats the ma- jority baseline (64.5), suggesting that no decisive discriminative patterns are learned. Both POS and token n-grams (b 1 -b 2 ) significantly outperform a 1 - a 4 at 99.9% confidence. While combining b 2 with a 2 (ba) minimally increases accuracy from 75.6 to 75.9, the results reveal that overall argumentation hardly impacts genre -as hypothesized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>This paper provides answers to the question of how the overall structure of a monological argumen- tative text should be modeled in order to tackle downstream tasks of computational argumentation. We have adopted the idea of including positional in- formation in tree kernels in order to capture the ex- plicit sequential and the implicit hierarchical over- all structure of the text at the same time. In system- atic experiments, we have demonstrated the strong impact of modeling overall argumentation. Most impressively, we have found that hierarchical struc- ture decides about myside bias alone, while the combination of sequential and hierarchical struc- ture has turned out beneficial for classifying stance. The missing impact on genre supports that the pre- sented approaches actually capture argumentation- related properties of a text.</p><p>So far, however, we have restricted our view to ground-truth argument structure, leaving the in- tegration of computational argument mining ap- proaches to future work. While the noise from mining errors might qualify some of our findings, we also expect that larger corpora will allow us to discover more reliable and discriminative pat- terns. After all, our results underline the general importance of modeling overall argumentation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Example text with five argument units, taken from the Arg-Microtexts corpus introduced in Section 3.

Natural language processing research has largely adopted the outlined hierarchical models for mining arguments from text (Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Habernal and Gurevych, 2015; Peldszus and Stede, 2016). However, the adequacy of the resulting overall structure for downstream analysis tasks of computational argumentation has rarely been evaluated (see Section 2 for details). In fact, a computational approach that can capture patterns in hierarchical overall argumentation is missing so far. Even more, our previous work indicates that a sequential model of overall structure is preferable for analysis tasks such as stance classification or quality assessment (Wachsmuth and Stein, 2017). In this paper, we ask and investigate what model of (monological) overall argumentation is important to tackle argumentation-related analysis tasks.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> While extensions of the route kernel idea have been published later on (Aiolli et al., 2011, 2015), we resort to the original version in this paper for simplicity.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> We do not include the topic, in order not to conflate the impact of modeling argumentation with the influence of the topic. The corpus is too small to analyze topic differences. 2004). No downstream task can be tackled on AraucariaDB besides inference scheme classification (Feng and Hirst, 2011). As all schemes compose a conclusion and a set of premises (without more specific roles), analyzing overall structure hardly makes sense, which is why we omit the corpus.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Alternatively, the stance towards the main claim could be modeled. We decided against this alternative to avoid possibly wrong reinterpretations, e.g., it is unclear whether a unit that attacks its parent always supports a unit attacked by the parent.</note>
