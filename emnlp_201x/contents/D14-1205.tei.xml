				<p>Populating Knowledge Base (KB) with new knowledge facts from reliable text resources usually consists of linking name mentions to KB entities and identifying relationship between entity pairs. However , the task often suffers from errors propagating from upstream entity linkers to downstream relation extractors. In this paper, we propose a novel joint inference framework to allow interactions between the two subtasks and find an optimal assignment by addressing the coherence among preliminary local predictions: whether the types of entities meet the expectations of relations explicitly or implicitly , and whether the local predictions are globally compatible. We further measure the confidence of the extracted triples by looking at the details of the complete extraction process. Experiments show that the proposed framework can significantly reduce the error propagations thus obtain more reliable facts, and outperforms competitive baselines with state-of-the-art relation extraction models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Recent advances in natural language processing have made it possible to construct structured KBs from online encyclopedia resources, at an un- precedented scale and much more efficiently than traditional manual edit. However, in those KBs, entities which are popular to the community usu- ally contain more knowledge facts, e.g., the bas- ketball player LeBron James, the actor Nicholas Cage, etc., while most other entities often have fewer facts. On the other hand, knowledge facts should be updated as the development of entities, such as changes in the cabinet, a marriage event, or an acquisition between two companies, etc.</p><p>In order to address the above issues, we could consult populating existing KBs from reliable text resources, e.g., newswire, which usually involves enriching KBs with new entities and populating KBs with new knowledge facts, in the form of &lt;Entity, Relation, Entity&gt; triple. In this paper, we will focus on the latter, identifying relationship be- tween two existing KB entities. This task can be intuitively considered in a pipeline paradigm, that is, name mentions in the texts are first linked to entities in the KB (entity linking, EL), and then the relationship between them are identified (re- lation extraction, RE). It is worth mentioning that the first task EL is different from the task of named entity recognition (NER) in traditional informa- tion extraction (IE) tasks, where NER recognizes and classifies the entity mentions (to several pre- defined types) in the texts, but EL focuses on link- ing the mentions to their corresponding entities in the KB. Such pipeline systems often suffer from errors propagating from upstream to downstream, since only the local best results are selected to the next step. One idea to solve the problem is to allow interactions among the local predictions of both subtasks and jointly select an optimal assignment to eliminate possible errors in the pipeline.</p><p>Let us first look at an example. Suppose we are extracting knowledge facts from two sentences in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>: in sentence <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, if we are more confi- dent to extract the relation fb:org.headquarters 1 , we will be then prompted to select Bryant Univer- sity, which indeed favors the RE prediction that requires an organization to be its subject. On the other side, if we are sure to link to Kobe Bryant in sentence <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, we will probably select fb:pro athlete.teams, whose subject position ex- pects an athlete, e.g., an NBA player. It is not dif- ficult to see that the argument type expectations of relations can encourage the two subtasks interact with each other and select coherent predictions for  both of them. In KBs with well-defined schemas, such as Freebase, type requirements can be col- lected and utilized explicitly ( . However, in other KBs with less reliable or even no schemas, it is more appropriate to implicitly capture the type expectations for a given relation ( .</p><p>Furthermore, previous RE approaches usually process each triple individually, which ignores whether those local predictions are compatible with each other. For example, suppose the local predictions of the two sentences above are &lt;Kobe Bryant, fb:org.headquarters, Smithfield, Rhode Is- land&gt; and &lt;Kobe Bryant, fb:pro athlete.teams, Los Angeles Lakers&gt;, respectively, which, in fact, disagree with each other with respect to the KB, since, in most cases, these two relations cannot share subjects. Now we can see that either the re- lation predictions or the EL results for "Bryant" are incorrect. Those disagreements provide us an effective way to remove the possible incorrect pre- dictions that cause the incompatibilities.</p><p>On the other hand, the automatically extracted knowledge facts inevitably contain errors, espe- cially for those triples collected from open do- main. Extractions with confidence scores will be more than useful for users to make proper deci- sions according to their requirements, such as trad- ing recall for precision, or supporting approximate queries.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a joint framework to populate an existing KB with new knowledge facts extracted from reliable text resources. The joint framework is designed to address the error propa- gation issue in a pipeline system, where subtasks are optimized in isolation and locally. We find an optimal configuration from top k results of both subtasks, which maximizes the scores of each step, fulfills the argument type expectations of relations, which can be captured explicitly or implicitly, in the KB, and avoids globally incoherent predic- tions. We formulate this optimization problem in an Integer Linear Program (ILP) framework, and further adopt a logistic regression model to mea- sure the reliability of the whole process, and assign confidences to all extracted triples to facilitate fur- ther applications. The experiments on a real-world case study show that our framework can elimi- nate error propagations in the pipeline systems by taking relations' argument type expectations and global compatibilities into account, thus outper- forms the pipeline approaches based on state-of- the-art relation extractors by a large margin. Fur- thermore, we investigate both explicit and implicit type clues for relations, and provide suggestions about which to choose according to the character- istics of existing KBs. Additionally, our proposed confidence estimations can help to achieve a pre- cision of over 85% for a considerable amount of high quality extractions.</p><p>In the rest of the paper, we first review related work and then define the knowledge base popula- tion task that we will address in this paper. Next we detail the proposed framework and present our experiments and results. Finally, we conclude this paper with future directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Knowledge base population (KBP), the task of ex- tending existing KBs with entities and relations, has been studied in the TAC-KBP evaluations ), containing three tasks. The entity link- ing task links entity mentions to existing KB nodes and creates new nodes for the entities absent in the current KBs, which can be considered as a kind of entity population ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dredze et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tamang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cassidy et al., 2011</ref>). The slot-filling task populates new relations to the KB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tamang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roth et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Liu and Zhao, 2012)</ref>, but the relations are limited to a predefined sets of attributes according to the types of enti- ties. In contrast, our RE models only require min- imal supervision and do not need well-annotated training data. Our framework is therefore easy to adapt to new scenarios and suits real-world appli- cations. The cold-start task aims at constructing a KB from scratch in a slot-filling style ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sun et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Monahan and Carpenter, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Entity linking is a crucial part in many KB re-lated tasks. Many EL models explore local con- texts of entity mentions to measure the similarity between mentions and candidate entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Roth, 2013)</ref>. Some methods further ex- ploit global coherence among candidate entities in the same document by assuming that these enti- ties should be closely related <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Roth, 2013)</ref>. There are also some approaches regarding entity linking as a ranking task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhou et al., 2010;</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lin et al. (2012)</ref> propose an approach to detect and type entities that are cur- rently not in the KB.</p><p>Note that the EL task in KBP is different from the name entity mention extraction task, mainly in the ACE task style, which mainly identifies the boundaries and types of entity mentions and does not explicitly link entity mentions into a KB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(ACE, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Florian et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Florian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li and Ji, 2014)</ref>, thus are different from our work.</p><p>Meanwhile, relation extraction has also been studied extensively in recent years, ranging from supervised learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(ACE, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhao and Grishman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li and Ji, 2014</ref>) to unsuper- vised open extractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fader et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Carlson et al., 2010)</ref>. There are also models, with dis- tant supervision (DS), utilizing reliable texts re- sources and existing KBs to predict relations for a large amount of texts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Surdeanu et al., 2012</ref>). These distantly supervised models can ex- tract relations from texts in open domain, and do not need much human involvement. Hence, DS is more suitable for our task compared to other tradi- tional RE approaches.</p><p>Joint inference over multiple local models has been applied to many NLP tasks. Our task is dif- ferent from the traditional joint IE works based in the ACE framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li and Ji, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kate and Mooney, 2010)</ref>, which jointly extract and/or classify named entity mentions to several predefined types in a sentence and iden- tify in a sentence level which relation this specific sentence describes (between a pair of entity men- tions in this sentence). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li and Ji (2014)</ref> follow the ACE task definitions and present a neat incre- mental joint framework to simultaneously extract entity mentions and relations by structure percep- tron. In contrast, we link entity mentions from a text corpus to their corresponding entities in an ex- isting KB and identify the relations between pairs of entities based on that text corpus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Choi et al. (2006)</ref> jointly extracts the expressions and sources of opinion as well as the linking relations (i.e., a source entity expresses an opinion expression) be- tween them, while we focus on jointly modeling EL and RE in open domain, which is a different and challenging task.</p><p>Since the automatically extracted knowledge facts inevitably contain errors, many approaches manage to assign confidences for those extracted facts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fader et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wick et al., 2013</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wick et al. (2013)</ref> also point out that confidence estima- tion should be a crucial part in the automated KB constructions and will play a key role for the wide applications of automatically built KBs. We thus propose to model the reliability of the complete extraction process and take the argument type ex- pectations of the relation, coherence with other predictions and the triples in the existing KB into account for each populated triple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Task definition</head><p>We formalize our task as follows. Given a set of entities sampled from an existing KB, E = {e 1 , e 2 , ..., e |E| }, a set of canonicalized relations from the same KB, R = {r 1 , r 2 , ..., r |R| }, a set of sentences extracted from news corpus, SN = {sn 1 , sn 2 , ..., sn |SN | }, each contains two men- tions m 1 and m 2 whose candidate entities belong to E, a set of text fragments T = {t 1 , t 2 , ..., t |T | }, where t i contains its corresponding target sentence sn i and acts as its context. Our task is to link those mentions to entities in the given KB, identify the relationship between entity pairs and populate new knowledge facts into the KB.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Sentence 1: … [Bryant]</formula><p>is a private university located in <ref type="bibr">[Smithfield]</ref>. …  rect relations for an entity pair. Thus, after finding an optimal sentence-level assignment, we aggre- gate those local predictions by ORing them into the entity pair level. Finally, we employ a regres- sion model to capture the reliability of the com- plete extraction process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Preliminary Models</head><p>Entity Linking The preliminary EL model can be any approach which outputs a score for each entity candidate. Note that a recall-oriented model will be more than welcome, since we expect to in- troduce more potentially correct local predictions into the inference step. In this paper, we adopt an unsupervised approach in ) to avoid preparing training data. Note the chal- lenging NIL problem, i.e., identifying which en- tity mentions do not have corresponding entities in the KB (labeled as NIL) and clustering those mentions, will be our future work. For each men- tion we retain the entities with top p scores for the succeeding inference step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation Extraction</head><p>The choice of RE model is also broad. Any sentence level extractor whose results are easy to be aggregated to entity pair level can be utilized here (again, a recall-oriented version will be welcome), such as Mintz++ men- tioned in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Surdeanu et al., 2012</ref>), which we adapt into a Maximum Entropy version. We also include a special label, NA, to represent the case where there is no predefined relationship between an en- tity pair. For each sentence, we retain the relations with top q scores for the inference step, and we also call that this sentence supports those candi- date relations. As for the features of RE models, we use the same features (lexical features and syn- tactic features) with the previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al., 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Relations' Expectations for Argument Types</head><p>In most KBs' schemas, canonicalized relations are designed to expect specific types of entities to be their arguments. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, it is more likely that an entity Kobe Bryant takes the subject position of a relation fb:pro athlete.teams, but it is unlikely for this entity to take the subject position of a relation fb:org.headquarters. Making use of these type requirements can encourage the framework to select relation and entity candidates which are coherent with each other, and discard incoherent choices. In order to obtain the preference scores between the entities in E and the relations in R, we gener- ate two matrices with |E| rows and |R| columns, whose elements sp ij indicates the preference score of entity i and relation j. The matrix S subj is for relations and their subjects, and the matrix S obj is for relations and their objects. We initialize the two matrices using the KB as follows: for entity i and relation j, if relation j takes entity i as its sub- ject/object in the KB, the element at the position (i, j) of the corresponding matrix will be 1, oth- erwise it will be 0. Note that in our experiments, we do not count the triples that are evaluated in the testing data, to build the matrices. Now the prob- lem is how we can obtain the unknown elements in the matrices.</p><p>Explicit Type Information Intuitively, we should examine whether the explicit types of the entities fulfill the expectations of relations in the KB. For each unknown element S subj (i, j), we first obtain the type of entity i, which is collected from the lowest level of the KB's type hierarchy, and examine whether there is another entity with the same type taking the subject position of relation j in the initial matrix. If such an entity exists, S subj (i, j) = 1, otherwise 0. For example, for the subject Jay Fletcher Vincent and the relation fb:pro athlete.teams, we first obtain the subject's type basketball player, and then we go through the initial matrix and find another entity Kobe Bryant with the same type taking the subject position of fb:pro athlete.teams, indicating that Jay Fletcher Vincent may take the relation fb:pro athlete.teams. The matrix S obj is processed in the same way.</p><p>Implicit Type Expectations In practice, few KBs have well-defined schemas. In order to make our framework more flexible, we need to come up with an approach to implicitly capture the rela- tions' type expectations, which will also be rep- resented as preference scores. Inspired by  who use a ma- trix factorization approach to capture the associa- tion between textual patterns, relations and entities based on large text corpora, we adopt a collabora- tive filtering (CF) method to compute the prefer- ence scores between entities and relations based on the statistics obtained from an existing KB.</p><p>In CF, the preferences between customers and items are calculated via matrix factorization over the initial customer-item matrix. In our frame- work, we compute the preference scores between entities and relations via the same approach over the two initialized matrices S subj and S obj , re- sulting in two entity-relation matrices with esti- mated preference values. We use ALS-WR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhou et al., 2008</ref>) to process the matrices and compute the preference of a relation taking an entity as its subject and object, respectively. We normalize the preference scores of each entity using their means µ and standard deviations σ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Compatibilities among Predicted Triples</head><p>The second aspect we investigate is whether the extracted triples are compatible with respect to all other knowledge facts. For example, according to the KB, the two relations fb:org.headquarters and fb:pro athlete.teams in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> cannot share the same entity as their subjects. So if such sharing happens, that will indicate either the predictions of the relations or the entities are incorrect. The clues can be roughly grouped into three categories, namely whether two relations can share the same subjects, whether two relations can share the same objects, and whether one relation's subject can be the other relation's object.</p><p>Global compatibilities among local predictions have been investigated by several joint models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li and Ji, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2014</ref>) to eliminate the errors propagating in a pipeline sys- tem. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al. (2014)</ref> utilized the clues with respect to the compatibilities of rela- tions in the task of relation extraction. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2014</ref>), we extend the idea of global compatibilities to the entity and re- lation predictions during knowledge base popula- tion. We examine the pointwise mutual informa- tion (PMI) between the argument sets of two re- lations to collect such clues. For example, if we want to learn whether two relations can share the same subject, we first collect the subject sets of both relations from the KB, and then compute the PMI value between them. If the value is lower than a certain threshold (set to -3 in this paper), the clue that the two relations cannot share the same subject is added. These clues can be easily inte- grated into an optimization framework in the form of constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Integer Linear Program Formulation</head><p>Now we describe how we aggregate the above components, and formulate the joint inference problem into an ILP framework. For each candi-date entity e of mention m in text fragment t, we define a boolean decision variable d m,e t , which de- notes whether this entity is selected into the final configuration or not. Similarly, for each candidate relation r of fragment t, we define a boolean de- cision variable d r t . In order to introduce the pref- erence scores into the model, we also need a deci- sion variable d r,m,e t , which denotes whether both relation r and candidate entity e of mention m are selected in t.</p><p>We use s t,m,e el to represent the score of mention m in t disambiguated to entity e, which is output by the EL model, s t,r re representing the score of re- lation r assigned to t, which is output by the RE model, s r,e p the explicit/implicit preference score between relation r and entity e.</p><p>Our goal is to find the best assignment to the variables d r t and d m,e t , such that it maximizes the overall scores of the two subtasks and the co- herence among the preliminary predictions, while satisfying the constraints between the predicted triples as well. Our objective function can be writ- ten as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">max el × conf ent + re × conf rel + sp × coh e−r</formula><p>(1) where el, re and sp are three weighting parameters tuned on development set. conf ent is the overall score of entity linking:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">conf ent = t m∈M (t) e∈Ce(m) s t,m,e el d m,e t (2)</formula><p>where M (t) is the set of mentions in t, C e (m) is the candidate entity set of the mention m. conf rel represents the overall score of relation extraction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">conf rel = t r∈Cr(t) s t,r re d r t<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where C r (t) is the set of candidate relations in t. coh e−r is the coherence between the candidate re- lations and entities in the framework: </p><p>Now we describe the constraints used in our ILP problem. The first kind of constraints is intro- duced to ensure that each mention should be dis- ambiguated to only one entity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∀t, ∀m ∈ M (t), e∈Ce(m) d m,e t ≤ 1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The second type of constraints ensure that each en- tity mention pair in one sentence can only take one relation label:</p><p>∀t,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r∈Cr(t) d t r ≤ 1<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The third is introduced to ensure the decision vari- able d r,m,e t equals 1 if and only if both the corre- sponding variables d r t and d m,e t equal 1.</p><p>∀t, ∀r ∈ C r (t), ∀m ∈ M (t), ∀e ∈ C e (m)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d r,m,e t ≤ d r t (7) d r,m,e t ≤ d m,e t<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">d r t + d m,e t ≤ d r,m,e t + 1 (9)</formula><p>As for the compatibility constraints, we need to introduce another type of boolean decision vari- ables. If a mention m 1 in t 1 and another mention m 2 in t 2 share an entity candidate e, we add a vari- able y for this mention pair, which equals 1 if and only if both d m 1 ,e t 1 and d m 2 ,e t 2 equal 1. So we add the following constraints for each mention pair m 1 and m 2 satisfies the previous condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">y ≤ d m 1 ,e t 1 (10) y ≤ d m 2 ,e t 2 (11) d m 1 ,e t 1 + d m 2 ,e t 2 ≤ y + 1<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Then we further add the following constraints for each mention pair to avoid incompatible predic- tions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∀r 1 ∈ C r (t 1 ), r 2 ∈ C r (t 2 )</formula><p>If (r 1 , r 2 ) ∈ C sr , p(m 1 ) = subj, p(m 2 ) = subj</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">d r 1 t 1 + d r 2 t 2 + y ≤ 2 (13) If (r 1 , r 2 ) ∈ C ro , p(m 1 ) = obj, p(m 2 ) = obj d r 1 t 1 + d r 2 t 2 + y ≤ 2 (14) If (r 1 , r 2 ) ∈ C sro , p(m 1 ) = obj, p(m 2 ) = subj d r 1 t 1 + d r 2 t 2 + y ≤ 2 (15)</formula><p>where p(m) returns the position of mention m, ei- ther subj (subject) or obj (object). C sr is the pairs of relations which cannot share the same subject, C ro is the pairs of relations which cannot share the same object, C sro is the pairs of relations in which one relation's subject cannot be the other one's ob- ject. We use IBM ILOG Cplex 2 to solve the above ILP problem. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: The features used to calculate the confi- dence scores.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Confidence Estimation for Extracted Triples</head><p>The automatically extracted triples inevitably con- tain errors and are often considered as with high recall but low precision. Since our aim is to pop- ulate the extracted triples into an existing KB, which requires highly reliable knowledge facts, we need a measure of confidence for those ex- tracted triples, so that others can properly utilize them.</p><p>Here, we use a logistic regression model to mea- sure the reliability of the process, how the entities are disambiguated, how the relationships are iden- tified, and whether those predictions are compat- ible. The features we used are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, which are all efficiently computable and indepen- dent from specific relations or entities. We manu- ally annotate 1000 triples as correct or incorrect to prepare the training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the proposed framework in a real- world scenario: given a set of news texts with en- tity mentions and a KB, a model should find more and accurate new knowledge facts between pairs of those entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Dataset</head><p>We use New York Times dataset from 2005 to 2007 as the text corpus, and Freebase as the KB. We divide the corpus into two equal parts, one for creating training data for the RE models using the distant supervision strategy (we do not need train- ing data for EL), and the other as the testing data.</p><p>For the convenience of experimentation, we ran- domly sample a subset of entities for testing. We first collect all sentences containing two mentions which may refer to the sampled entities, and prune them according to: (1)there should be no more than 10 words between the two mentions; (2)the prior probability of the mention referring to the target entity is higher than a threshold (set to 0.1 in this paper), which is set to filter the impossi- ble mappings; (3)the mention pairs should not be- long to different clauses. The resulting test set is split into 10 parts and a development set, each with 3500 entity pairs roughly, which leads to averagely 200,000 variables and 900,000 constraints per split and may take 1 hour for Cplex to solve. Note that we do not count the triples that will be evaluated in the testing data when we learn the preferences and the clues from the KB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experimental Setup</head><p>We compare our framework with three baselines. The first one, ME-pl, is the pipeline system con- structed by the entity linker in ) and the MaxEnt version of Mintz++ extractor mentioned in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Surdeanu et al., 2012</ref>). The sec- ond and third baselines are the pipeline systems constructed by the same linker and two state-of- the-art DS approaches, <ref type="bibr">MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011</ref>) and MIML-RE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Surdeanu et al., 2012</ref>), re- spectively. They are referred to as MultiR-pl and MIML-pl in the rest of this paper.</p><p>We also implement several variants of our framework to investigate the following two com- ponents in our framework: whether to use ex- plicit (E) or implicit (I) argument type expecta- tions, whether to take global (G) compatibilities into account, resulting in four variants: ME-JE, ME-JI, ME-JEG, ME-JIG.</p><p>We tune the parameters in the objective func- tion on the development set to be re = 1, el = 4, sp = 1. The numbers of preliminary results re- tained to the inference step are set to p = 2, q = 3. Three metrics used in our experiments include: (1)the precision of extracted triples, which is the ratio of the number of correct triples and the num- ber of total extracted triples; (2)the number of cor- rect triples (NoC); (3)the number of correct triples in the results ranked in top n. The third metric is crucial for KBP, since most users are only in- terested in the knowledge facts with high confi- dences. We compare the extracted triples against <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: The results of our joint frameworks and the three baselines.</p></div>

We evalu- ate our framework on the 10 subsets of the testing dataset and compute their means and standard de- viations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Overall Performance</head><p>We are interested to find out: (a)whether the task benefits from the joint inference i.e., can we col- lect more and correct facts? Or with a higher pre- cision? (b) whether the argument type expecta- tions (explicit and implicit) and global compati- bility do their jobs as we expected? And, how do we choose from these components ? (c)whether the framework can work with other RE models? (d)whether we can find a suitable approach to measure the confidence or uncertainty during the extraction so that users or other applications can better utilize the extracted KB facts?</p><p>Let us first look at the performance of the baselines and our framework in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for an overview. Comparing the three pipeline sys- tems, we can discover that using the same en- tity linker, MIML-pl performs the best in precision with slightly fewer correct triples, while ME-pl performs the worst. It is not surprising, ME-pl, as a strong and high-recall baseline, outputs the most correct triples. As for the results with high confi- dences, MultiR-pl outputs more correct triples in the top 50 results than ME-pl, and MIML-pl per- forms better or comparable than ME-pl in top n results.</p><p>After performing the joint inference, ME-JE improves ME-pl with 4.1% in precision and 43 more correct triples averagely, and results in bet- ter performance in top n results. By taking global compatibilities into consideration, ME-JEG fur- ther improve the precision to 34.2% in average with slightly fewer correct triples, indicating that both argument type expectations and global com- patibilities are useful in improving the perfor- mance: argument type information can help to select the correct and coherent predictions from the candidates EL and RE outputs, while global compatibilities can further prune incorrect triples that cause disagreements, although a few correct ones may be incorrectly eliminated. We can also observe that ME-JIG performs even higher than ME-JEG in overall precision, but ME-JEG col- lects more correct triples than ME-JIG in the top n predictions, showing that explicit type expec- tations with more accurate type information may perform better in high confidence results.</p><p>Furthermore, even though MultiR-pl and MIML-pl are based on state-of-the-art RE ap- proaches, our model (for example, ME-JIG) can still outperform them in terms of all metrics, with 4.7% higher in precision than MultiR-pl, 2.5% higher than MIML-pl. Our model can extract 125 more correct triples than MultiR-pl, 164 more than MIML-pl, and perform better in top n results as well.</p><p>In previous RE tasks, Precision-Recall curves are mostly used to evaluate the systems' perfor- mances. In our task, since it is difficult to calculate the recall exactly, we use the number of correct triples instead, and plot curves of Precision-NoC to show the performance of the competitors and our approaches in more detail. For each value of NoC, the precision is the average of the ten splits of the testing dataset.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>, our approaches (ME-JEG and ME-JIG) obtain higher precisions on each NoC value, and the curves are much smoother than <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The results of our joint frameworks with MultiR sentence extractor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approach Precision</head><p>NoC Top 50 Top 100 MultiR-pl 31.0 ± 0.8 647 ± 15 39 ± 2 71 ± 3 MultiR-JEG 36.9 ± 0.8 687 ± 15 46 ± 2 88 ± 3 MultiR-JIG 38.5 ± 0.9 700 ± 15 45 ± 2 88 ± 3 the pipeline systems, indicating that our frame- work is more suitable for harvesting high quality knowledge facts. Comparing the two kinds of type clues, we can see that explicit ones perform better when the confidence control is high and the num- ber of correct triples is small, and then the two are comparable. Since the precision of the triples with high confidences is crucial for the task of KBP, we still suggest choosing the explicit ones when there is a well-defined schema available in the KB, although implicit type expectations can result in higher overall precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Adapting MultiR Sentence Extractor into the Framework</head><p>The preliminary relation extractor of our frame- work is not limited to the MaxEnt 3 extractor. It can be any sentence level recall-oriented relation extractors. To further investigate the generaliza- tion of our joint inference framework, we also try to fit other sentence level relation extractors into the framework. Considering that MIML-RE does not output sentence-level results, we only adapt MultiR, with both global compatibilities and explicit/implicit type expectations, named as MultiR-JEG and MultiR-JIG, respectively. Since the scores output by the original MultiR are un- normalized, which are difficult to directly apply to our framework, we normalize their scores and re- tune the framework's parameters accordingly. The parameters are set to re = 1, el = 32, sp = 16. As seen in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, MultiR-JEG helps MultiR obtain about 40 more correct triples in average, and achieves 5.9% higher in precision, as well as significant improvements in top n correct pre- dictions. As for MultiR-JIG, the improvements are 7.5% in precision and 53 in number of cor- rect triples. In terms of top n results, the explicit and implicit type expectations perform compara- ble. We also observe that our framework improves MultiR as much as it does to MaxEnt, indicating our joint framework can generalize well in differ- ent RE models. We further plot Precision-NoC curves for MultiR-JEG and MultiR-JIG in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, show- ing that our framework can result in better perfor- mance and smoother curves with MultiR extractor. It is interesting to see that with MultiR extractor, the two kinds of expectations perform comparably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Results with Confidence Estimations</head><p>Now, we will investigate the results from another perspective with the help of confidence estima- tions. We calculate the precisions of the competi- tors and our approaches on different confidence thresholds from 0.5 to 1. The results are summa- rized in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Note that the results across dif- ferent approaches are not directly comparable, we put them in the same figure only to save space.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, intuitively, as the confidence thresh- old goes up, the extraction precisions should increase, indicating triples with higher confi- dences are more likely to be correct. However, lower thresholds tend to result in estimations with smaller standard derivations due to those preci- sions are estimated over much more triples than those with higher thresholds, which means the ran- domness will be smaller.</p><p>On the other hand, our joint frameworks pro- vide more evidences that can be used to well cap- ture the reliability of an extraction. For example, the precisions of Multir-JIG and ME-JIG both stay around 85% when the confidence is higher than 0.85, with about 120 correct triples, indicating that by setting a proper threshold, we can obtain con- siderable amount of high quality knowledge facts at an acceptable precision, which is crucial for KBP. However, we cannot harvest such amount of high quality knowledge facts from the other three pipeline systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we propose a joint framework for the task of populating KBs with new knowledge facts, which performs joint inference on two subtasks, maximizes their preliminary scores, fulfills the type expectations of relations and avoids global incompatibilities with respect to all local predic- tions to find an optimal assignment. Experimen- tal results show that our framework can signifi- cantly eliminate the error propagations in pipeline systems and outperforms competitive pipeline sys- tems with state-of-the-art RE models. Regard- ing the explicit argument type expectations and the implicit ones, the latter can result in a higher overall precision, while the former performs bet- ter in acquiring high quality knowledge facts with higher confidence control, indicating that if the KB has a well-defined schema we can use explicit type requirements for the KBP task, and if not, our model can still perform well by mining the implicit ones. Our framework can also generalize well with other preliminary RE models. Further- more, we assign extraction confidences to all ex- tracted facts to facilitate further applications. By setting a suitable threshold, our framework can populate high quality reliable knowledge facts to existing KBs.</p><p>For future work, we will address the NIL is- sue of EL where we currently assume all entities should be linked to a KB. It would be also inter- esting to jointly model the two subtasks through structured learning, instead of joint inference only. Currently we only use the coherence of extracted triples and the KB to estimate confidences, which would be nice to directly model the issue in a joint model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Two example sentences from which we can harvest knowledge facts.</figDesc></figure>
