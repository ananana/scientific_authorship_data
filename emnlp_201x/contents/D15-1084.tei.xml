				<p>We present KB-UNIFY, a novel approach for integrating the output of different Open Information Extraction systems into a single unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository. KB-UNIFY consists of three main steps: (1) disambigua-tion of relation argument pairs via a sense-based vector representation and a large unified sense inventory; (2) ranking of semantic relations according to their degree of specificity; (3) cross-resource relation alignment and merging based on the semantic similarity of domains and ranges. We tested KB-UNIFY on a set of four heterogeneous knowledge bases, obtaining high-quality results. We discuss and provide evaluations at each stage, and release output and evaluation data for the use and scrutiny of the community 1 .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The breakthrough of the Open Information Ex- traction (OIE) paradigm opened up a research area where Web-scale unconstrained Information Extraction systems are developed to acquire and formalize large quantities of knowledge. How- ever, while successful, to date most state-of-the- art OIE systems have been developed with their own type inventories, and no portable ontologi- cal structure. In fact, OIE systems can be very different in nature. Early approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Etzioni et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wu and Weld, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fader et al., 2011</ref>) focused on extracting a large number of relations from massive unstructured corpora, mostly rely- ing on dependencies at the level of surface text. Systems like NELL ( <ref type="bibr">Carlson et al., 2010</ref>) com- bine a hand-crafted taxonomy of entities and re- lations with self-supervised large-scale extraction <ref type="bibr">1</ref> http://lcl.uniroma1.it/kb-unify from the Web, but they require additional process- ing for linking and integration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dutta et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>More recent work has focused, instead, on deeper language understanding, especially at the level of syntax and semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nakashole et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moro and Navigli, 2013)</ref>. By leveraging semantic analysis, knowledge gathered from un- structured text can be adequately integrated and used to enrich existing knowledge bases, such as YAGO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mahdisoltani et al., 2015</ref>), FREEBASE <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bollacker et al., 2008</ref>) and DBPEDIA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lehmann et al., 2014)</ref>. A large amount of reliable struc- tured knowledge is crucial for OIE approaches based on distant supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Riedel et al., 2010)</ref>, even when multi-instance multi-learning algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Surdeanu et al., 2012)</ref> or matrix factorization techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Riedel et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fan et al., 2014</ref>) come into play to deal with noisy extractions. For this reason a recent trend of research has focused on Knowledge Base (KB) completion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nickel et al., 2012;</ref>, exploiting the fact that distantly super- vised OIE and structured knowledge can comple- ment each other. However, the majority of integra- tion approaches nowadays are not designed to deal with many different resources at the same time.</p><p>We propose an approach where the key idea is to bring together knowledge drawn from an arbitrary number of OIE systems, regardless of whether these systems provide links to some general- purpose inventory, come with their own ad-hoc structure, or have no structure at all. Knowledge from each source, in the form of subject, predi- cate, object triples, is disambiguated and linked to a single large sense inventory. This enables us to discover alignments at a semantic level between relations from different KBs, and to generate a unified, fully disambiguated KB of entities and semantic relations. KB-UNIFY achieves state- of-the-art disambiguation and provides a general, resource-independent representation of semantic relations, suitable for any kind of KB.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as fol- lows: Section 2 reviews relevant related work; Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 describe in detail each stage of the approach; Sections 7 and 8 describe the ex- periments carried out and the results obtained; and finally Section 9 summarizes our findings and dis- cusses potential directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The integration of knowledge drawn from dif- ferent sources has received much attention over the last decade. Among the most notable examples are resources like BabelNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012</ref>), UBY (Gurevych et al., 2012) and YAGO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mahdisoltani et al., 2015)</ref>. While great effort has been put into aligning knowledge at the con- cept level, most approaches do not tackle the prob- lem of integrating heterogeneous knowledge at the relation level, nor do they exploit effectively the huge amount of information harvested with OIE systems, even when this information is unambigu- ously linked to a structured resource, as in (Nakas- hole et al., 2012), or <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Moro and Navigli, 2013)</ref>. In fact, as the number of resources increases, KB alignment is already becoming an emergent re- search field: Dutta et al. (2014) describe a method for linking arguments in NELL triples to DBPE- DIA by combining First Order Logic and Markov Networks; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grycner and Weikum (2014)</ref> seman- tify PATTY's pattern synsets and connect them to WordNet verbs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lin et al. (2012)</ref> propose a method to propagate FREEBASE types across RE- VERB and deal with the problem of unlinkable entities. All these approaches achieve very com- petitive results in their respective settings, but un- like the approach being proposed here, they limit the task to 1-to-1 alignments. A few contributions have tried to broaden the scope and include dif- ferent resources at the same time, but with rather different goals from ours. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Riedel et al. (2013)</ref> propose a universal schema that inte- grates structured data with OIE data by learning latent feature vectors for entities and relations; the KNOWLEDGE VAULT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dong et al., 2014</ref>) uses a graph-based probabilistic framework where prior knowledge from existing resources (e.g. FREE- BASE) improves Web extractions by predicting their reliability. However, in both cases the main objective is distantly supervised extraction from unstructured text, rather than KB unification. A re- cent trend of research focuses on learning embed- ding models for structured knowledge and their application to tasks like relation extraction and KB completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Socher et al., 2013;</ref>). These approaches, however, leverage embeddings at surface level, which are suboptimal for our task, as will be dis- cussed in Section 3. Since we require a com- mon semantic framework for KB unification, we use vector representations based on word senses, which are mapped to a very large sense inventory. This shared sense inventory, then, constitutes the common ground in which disambiguation, align- ment and final unification occurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Knowledge Base Unification: Overview</head><p>KB-UNIFY takes as input a set of KBs K = {KB 1 , ..., KB n } and outputs a single, unified and fully disambiguated KB, denoted as KB * . For our purposes we can define a KB KB i as a triple E i , R i , T i , where E i is a set of entities, R i is a set of semantic relations, and T i is a set of triples (facts) e d , r, e g with subject and object e d , e g ∈ E i and predicate r ∈ R i . Depending on the nature of each KB i , entities in E i might be disambiguated and linked to an external in- ventory (e.g. the entity Washington linked to the Wikipedia page GEORGE WASHINGTON), or un- linked and only available as ambiguous mentions (e.g. the bare word washington might refer to the president, the city or the state). We can thus par- tition K into a subset of linked resources K D , and one of unlinked resources K U . In order to align very different and heterogeneous KBs at the se- mantic level, KB-UNIFY exploits:</p><p>• A unified sense inventory S, which acts as a superset for the inventories of individual KBs. We choose BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) for this purpose: by merg- ing complementary knowledge from different resources (e.g. Wikipedia, WordNet, Wiki- data and Wiktionary, among others), Babel- Net provides a wide coverage of entities and concepts whilst at the same time enabling convenient inter-resource mappings for KB i in K D . For instance, each Wikipedia page (or Wikidata item) has a corresponding synset in BabelNet, which enables a one-to-one map- ping between BabelNet's synsets and entries in, e.g., DBPEDIA or FREEBASE;</p><p>• A vector space model V S that enables a se- mantic representation for every item in S. Current distributional models, like word em- ), are not suit- able to our setting: they are constrained to surface word forms, and hence they inher- ently retain ambiguity of polysemous words and entity mentions. We thus leverage SENSEMBED ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iacobacci et al., 2015</ref>), a novel semantically-enhanced approach to embed- dings. SENSEMBED is trained on a large annotated corpus and produces continuous representations for individual word senses (sense embeddings), according to an under- lying sense inventory. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the workflow of our KB uni- fication approach. Entities coming from any KB i ∈ K D can be directly (and unambiguously) mapped to the corresponding entries in S via Ba- belNet inter-resource linking <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1(a)</ref>): in the above example, the entity Washington linked to the Wikipedia page GEORGE WASHINGTON is in- cluded in the BabelNet synset Washington 4 bn . In contrast, unlinked (and potentially ambiguous) entities need an explicit disambiguation step <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig- ure 1(b)</ref>) connecting them to appropriate entries, i.e. synsets, in S: this is the case, in the above example, for the ambiguous mention washington that has to be linked to either the president, the city or the state. Therefore, our approach com- prises two successive stages:</p><p>• A disambiguation stage (Section 5) where all KB i ∈ K are linked to S, either by inter-resource mapping <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1(a)</ref>) or dis- ambiguation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1(b)</ref>), and all E i are merged into a unified set of entities E * . As a result of this process we obtain a set K S comprising all the KBs in K redefined using the common sense inventory S;</p><p>• An alignment stage (Section 6, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(c)) where, for each pair of KBs KB S i , KB S j ∈ K S , we compare any relation pair r i , r j , r i ∈ R S i and r j ∈ R S j , in order to identify cross-resource alignments and merge rela- tions sharing equivalent semantics into rela- tion clusters (relation synsets). This process yields a unified set of relation synsets R * . The overall result is KB * = E * , R * , T * , where T * is the set of all disambiguated triples redefined over E * and R * .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Background</head><p>The disambiguation stage of our approach is based on the interplay between two core compo- nents: a vector space model V S , as introduced in Section 3, which provides an unambiguous se- mantic representation for each item in S; and a Word Sense Disambiguation/Entity Linking sys- tem, working on the same sense inventory S, which discovers and disambiguates concepts and entity mentions within a given input text. In this section we briefly describe our choice for these two components: SENSEMBED (Iacobacci et al., 2015) and BABELFY ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Moro et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>SENSEMBED is a knowledge-based approach for obtaining latent continuous representations of individual word senses. Unlike other sense-based embeddings approaches, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Huang et al., 2012)</ref>, which address the inherent polysemy of word- level representations relying solely on text cor- pora, SENSEMBED exploits the structured knowl- edge of a large sense inventory along with the dis- tributional information gathered from text corpora. In order to do this, SENSEMBED requires a sense- annotated corpus; for each target word sense, then, a representation is computed by maximizing the log likelihood of the word sense with respect to its context within the annotated text, similarly to the word-based embeddings model. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iacobacci et al. (2015)</ref>, we trained SENSEMBED us- ing the English Wikipedia and, as sense inventory, BabelNet.</p><p>BABELFY 2 is a joint state-of-the-art approach to multilingual Entity Linking and Word Sense Disambiguation. Given the BabelNet lexical- ized semantic network as underlying structure, BABELFY first models each concept in the net- work through its corresponding semantic signa- ture by leveraging a graph random walk algorithm. Then, given an input text, the generated seman- tic signatures are used to construct a subgraph of the semantic network representing the mean- ing of the content words in that text. BABELFY then searches this subgraph for the intended sense of each content word, by means of a densest- subgraph heuristic that identifies high-coherence interpretations. Given its unified approach that covers concepts and named entities alike, and its flexibility in disambiguating both bag-of-words and proper text, BABELFY constitutes the most convenient choice for linking relation triples to a high-coverage sense inventory like BabelNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Disambiguation</head><p>In the disambiguation phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1(b)</ref>), all KB i ∈ K U are linked to the unified sense in- ventory S and added to the set of redefined KBs K S . As explained in Section 3, while each KB in K D can be unambiguously redefined via Babel- Net inter-resource links and added to K S , KBs in K U require an explicit disambiguation step. Given KB i ∈ K U , our disambiguation module ( <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>) takes as input its set of unlinked triples T i and outputs a set T S i ⊆ T i of disambiguated triples with subject-object pairs linked to S. The triples in T S i , together with their corresponding entity sets and relation sets, constitute the redefined KB S i which is then added to K S . However, applying a straightforward approach that disambiguates all triples in isolation might lead to very imprecise re- sults, due to the lack of available context for each individual triple. We thus devised a disambigua- tion strategy that comprises three successive steps:</p><p>1. We identify a set of high-confidence seeds from T i (Section 5.1), i.e. triples e d , r, e g where subject e d and object e g are highly semantically related, and disambiguate them using the senses that maximize their similar- ity in our vector space V S ;</p><p>2. We use the seeds to generate a ranking of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Disambiguation algorithm workflow the relations in R i according to their degree of specificity (Section 5.2). We represent each r ∈ R i in our vector space V S and as- sign higher specificity to relations whose ar- guments are closer in V S ;</p><p>3. We finally disambiguate the remaining non- seed triples in T i (Section 5.3) starting from the most specific relations, and jointly using all participating argument pairs as context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Identifying Seed Argument Pairs</head><p>The first stage of our disambiguation approach aims at extracting reliable seeds from T i , i.e. triples e d , r, e g where subject e d and object e g can be confidently disambiguated without addi- tional context. In order to do this we leverage the sense embeddings associated with each can- didate disambiguation for e d and e g . We consider all the available senses for both e d and e g in S,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">namely s d = {s 1 d , ..., s m d } and s g = {s 1 g , ..</formula><p>., s m g }, and the corresponding sets of sense embeddings</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v d = {v 1 d , ..., v m d } and v g = {v 1 g , ..., v m g }.</formula><p>We then select, among all possible pairs of senses, the pair s * d , s * g that maximizes the cosine similarity between the corresponding embeddings</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">v * d , v * g : v * d , v * g = argmax v d ∈v d , vg∈vg v d · v g v d v g<label>(1)</label></formula><p>For each disambiguated triple s * d , r, s * g , the co- sine similarity value associated with v * d , v * g rep- resents the disambiguation confidence ζ dis . We rank all such triples according to their confidence, and select those above a given threshold δ dis . The underlying assumption is that, for high-confidence subject-object pairs, the embeddings associated with the correct senses s * d and s * g will be closest in V S compared to any other candidate pair. In- tuitively, the more the relation r between e d and e g is semantically well defined, the more this as- sumption is justified. As an example, consider the triple Armstrong, worked for, NASA: among all the possible senses for Armstrong (the astronaut, the jazz musician the cyclist, etc.) and NASA (the space agency, the racing organization, a Swedish band, etc.) we expect the vectors corresponding to the astronaut and the space agency to be closest in the vector space model V S .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Relation Specificity Ranking</head><p>The assumption that, given an ambiguous subject-object pair, correct argument senses are the closest pair in the vector space (Section 5.1) is easily verifiable for general relations (e.g. is a, is part of ). However, as a semantic relation becomes specific, its arguments are less guaranteed to be semantically related (e.g. is a professor in the uni- versity of ) and a disambiguation approach based exclusively on similarity is prone to errors. On the other hand, specific relations tend to narrow down the scope of possible entity types occurring as subject and object. In the above example, is a professor in the university of requires entity pairs with professors as subjects and cities as objects.</p><p>Our disambiguation strategy should thus vary ac- cording to the specificity of the relations taken into account. In order to consider this observation in our disambiguation pipeline, we first need to es- timate the degree of specificity for each relation in the relation set R i of the target KB to be dis- ambiguated. Given R i and a set of seeds from the previous stage (Section 5.1), we apply a specificity ranking policy and sort relations in R i from the most general to the most specific. We compute the generality Gen(r) of a given relation r by looking at the spatial dispersion of the sense embeddings associated with its seed subjects and objects. Let v D (v G ) be the set of sense embeddings associated with the domain (range) seed arguments of r. For both v D and v G , we compute the corresponding centroid vectors µ D and µ G as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">µ k = 1 |v k | v∈v k v v , k ∈ {D, G}<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Then, the variances σ 2 D and σ 2 G are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">σ 2 k = 1 |v k | v∈v k (1 − cos (v, µ k )) 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with k ∈ {D, G} as before. We finally compute Gen(r) as the average of σ 2 D and σ 2 G . The result of this procedure is a relation specificity ranking that associates each relation r with its general- ity Gen(r). Intuitively, we expect more general relations to show higher variance (hence higher Gen(r)), as their subjects and objects are likely to be rather disperse throughout the vector space; instead, arguments of very specific relations are more likely to be clustered together in compact re- gions, yielding lower values of Gen(r).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Disambiguation with Relation Context</head><p>In the third step, both the specificity ranking and the seeds are exploited to disambiguate the remaining triples in T i . To do this we leverage BABELFY ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Moro et al., 2014</ref>) (introduced in Sec- tion 4). As we observed in Section 5.2, spe- cific relations impose constraints on their subject- object types and tend to show compact domains and ranges in the vector space. Therefore, given a triple e d , r, e g , knowing that r is specific en- ables us to put together all the triples in T i where r occurs, and use them to provide meaningful con- text for disambiguation. If r is general, instead, its subject-object types are less constrained and addi- tional triples do not guarantee to provide semanti- cally related context.</p><p>At this stage, our algorithm takes as input the set of triples T i , along with the associated disam- biguation seeds (Section 5.1), the specificity rank- ing (Section 5.2) and a specificity threshold δ spec . T i is first partitioned into two subsets: T spec i , com- prising all the triples for which Gen(r) &lt; δ spec , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T gen i = T i \ T spec i</formula><p>. We then employ two dif- ferent disambiguation strategies:</p><p>• For each distinct relation r occurring in as a whole with BABELFY. For each triple in T spec i,r , context is provided by all the remaining triples along with the disambiguated seeds extracted for r.</p><p>• We disambiguate the remaining triples in T gen i one by one in isolation with BABELFY, providing for each triple only the predicate string r as additional context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Cross-Resource Relation Alignment</head><p>After disambiguation (Section 5) each KB in K is linked to the unified sense inventory S and added to K S . However, each KB S i ∈ K S still pro- vides its own relation set R S i ⊆ R i . Instead, in the unified KB * , relations with equivalent semantics should be considered as part of a single relation synset even when they come from different KBs. Therefore, at this stage, we apply an alignment al- gorithm to identify pairs of relations from different KBs having equivalent semantics. We exploit the fact that each relation r is now defined over entity pairs linked to S, and we generate a semantic rep- resentation of r in the vector space V S based on the centroid vectors of its domain and range. Due to representing the semantics of relations on this common ground, we can compare them by com- puting their domain and range similarity in V S . We first consider each KB S i ∈ K S and, for each rela- tion r i in R S i , we compute the corresponding cen- troid vectors µ r i d and µ r i g using formula (2). Then, for each pair of KBs KB S i , KB S j ∈ K S × K S , we compare all relation pairs r i , r j ∈ R S i × R S j by computing the cosine similarity between do- main centroids s D and between range centroids s G :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">s k = µ r i k · µ r j k µ r i k µ r j k<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where µ r k denotes the centroid associated with re- lation r and k ∈ {D, G}. The average of s D and s G gives us an alignment confidence ζ align for the pair r i , r j . If confidence is above a given thresh- old δ align then r i and r j are merged into the same relation synset. Relations for which no alignment is found are turned into singleton relation synsets. As a result of this alignment procedure we obtain the unified set of relations R * .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Experimental Setup</head><p>The setting for our experimental evaluation was the following:</p><p>• We used BabelNet 3.0 3 as our unified sense inventory for the unification procedure as well as the underlying inventory for both BA- BELFY and SENSEMBED. Currently, Babel- Net contains around 14M synsets and repre- sents the largest single multilingual reposi- tory of entities and concepts;</p><p>• We selected PATTY ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nakashole et al., 2012)</ref> and WISENET <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Moro and Navigli, 2013)</ref> as linked resources.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Disambiguation</head><p>We tested our disambiguation approach exper- imentally in terms of both disambiguated seed quality (Section 8.1.1) and overall disambiguation performance (Section 8.1.2). We created a de- velopment set by extracting a subset of 6 million triples from the largest linked KB in our experi- mental setup, i.e. PATTY. Triples in PATTY are automatically linked to YAGO, which is in turn linked to WordNet and DBPEDIA. Since both re- sources are also linked by BabelNet, we mapped the original triples to the BabelNet sense inventory and used them to tune our disambiguation module. We also provide two baseline approaches: (1) di-SENSEMBED Baseline ζ dis 0.5-0.7 0.7-0.9 0.9-1.0 0.5-0.7 0.7-0.9 0.9-1.0   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.1">Results: Disambiguated Seeds</head><p>We tuned our disambiguation algorithm by studying the quality of the disambiguated seeds (Section 5.1) extracted from the surface text triples of PATTY. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows precision and cover- age for increasing values of the confidence thresh- old δ dis . We computed precision by checking each disambiguated seed against the correspond- ing linked triple in the development set, and cov- erage as the ratio of covered triples. We analyzed results for both the whole set of triples in PATTY <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3a)</ref> and the subset of ambiguous triples <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.  3b)</ref>, i.e. those triples whose subjects and objects have at least two candidate senses each in the Ba- belNet inventory. In both cases, precision of dis- ambiguated seeds increases rapidly with δ dis , sta- bilizing above 90% with δ dis &gt; 0.25. Coverage displays the opposite behavior, decreasing expo- nentially with more confident outcomes, from 6 million triples to less than a thousand (for seeds with confidence δ dis &gt; 0.95). As a result, we chose δ dis = 0.25 as optimal threshold value throughout the rest of the evaluations.</p><p>In addition, we manually evaluated the disam- biguated seeds extracted from both linked KBs (PATTY and WISENET) and unlinked KBs (NELL and REVERB). For each KB, we extracted up to three random samples of 150 triples according to different levels of confidence ζ dis : the first sam- ple included extraction with 0.5 ≤ ζ dis &lt; 0.7, the second with 0.7 ≤ ζ dis &lt; 0.9, and the third with ζ dis ≥ 0.9. Each sample was evaluated by two human judges: for each disambiguated triple  , and we asked whether the association of each subject and object with the proposed BabelNet synset was cor- rect. We then estimated precision as the average proportion of correctly disambiguated triples. For each sample we compared disambiguation preci- sion using SENSEMBED, as in Section 5.1, against the first baseline with BABELFY alone. Results, reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, show that our approach consis- tently outperforms the baseline and provides high precision over all samples and KBs.</p><note type="other">KB-UNIFY Dutta et al. Baseline all only seeds (α = 0.5) Precision .</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.2">Results: Disambiguation with Relation Context</head><p>We then evaluated the overall disambiguation output after specificity ranking (Section 5.2) and disambiguation with relation context using BA- BELFY (Section 5.3). We analyzed three config- urations of the disambiguation pipeline, namely δ spec ∈ {0.8, 0.5, 0.3}. We ran the algorithm over both linked and unlinked KBs of our experimen- tal setup, and computed the coverage for each KB as the overall ratio of disambiguated triples. Re- sults are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> and compared to the coverage obtained from the disambiguated seeds only: context-aware disambiguation substantially increases coverage over all KBs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3 also</ref> shows that a restrictive δ spec results in lower cover- age values, due to the increased number of triples disambiguated without context.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the quality of disam- biguation on a publicly available dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dutta et al., 2014</ref>) comprising manual annotations for NELL. This dataset provides a gold standard of 1200 triples whose subjects and objects are manually assigned a proper DBpedia URI. We again used BabelNet's inter-resource links to ex- press DBpedia annotations with our sense inven- tory and then sought, for each annotated triple in the dataset, the corresponding triple in our disam- biguated version of NELL with δ dis = 0.25 and δ spec = 0.8. We then repeated this process con-   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> and compared against those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dutta et al. (2014)</ref> and against our first baseline with BA- BELFY alone. KB-UNIFY achieves the best result, showing that a baseline based on state-of-the-art disambiguation is negatively affected by the lack of context for each individual triple. In contrast, an approach that relies only on the disambiguated seeds affords very high precision, but suffers from dramatically lower coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Specificity Ranking</head><p>We evaluated the specificity ranking (Section 5.2) generated by KB-UNIFY for all KBs of our experimental setup. First of all, we empirically validated our scoring function Gen(r) over each resource: for each relation we computed the aver- age cosine similarity among all its domain argu- ments ¯ s D and among all its range arguments ¯ s G . We then plotted the average ¯ s of ¯ s D and ¯ s G against Gen(r) for each relation r <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4)</ref>. As observed in Section 5.2, the average similarity among do- main and range arguments decreases for increas- ing values of Gen(r), indicating that more gen- eral relations allow less semantically constrained subject-object types. We then used human judge- ment to assess the quality of our specificity rank- ings. First, each ranking was split into four quar-   tiles, and two human evaluators were presented with a sample from the top quartile (i.e. a relation falling into the most general category) and a sam- ple from the bottom quartile (i.e. a relation falling into the most specific category). We shuffled each relation pair, showed it to our human judges, and then asked which of the two relations they consid- ered to be the more specific. Ranking precision was computed by considering those pairs where human choice agreed with the ranking. Finally, we computed inter-annotator agreement on each specificity ranking (except for NELL, due to the small sample size) with Cohen's kappa coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cohen, 1968)</ref>. Results for each ranking are re- ported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, while some examples of general and specific relations for each KB are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>. Disagreement between human choice and ranking is higher in NELL (where the set of rela- tions is quite small compared to other KBs) and in PATTY (due to a sparser set of relations, biased towards very specific patterns). Inter-annotator agreement is instead lower for REVERB, where unconstrained Web harvesting often results in am- biguous relation strings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Alignment</head><p>Due to the novelty of our approach, and hence the lack of widely accepted gold standards and testbeds, we evaluated our cross-resource relation alignment algorithm (Section 6) by exploiting hu- man judgement once again. Given the results of PATTY-WISENET PATTY-REVERB NELL-REVERB δ align 0.7 0.9 0.7 0.9 0.7 0.9</p><p>Prec.   Section 8.1, we considered the top 10k frequent relations for each KB and ran the algorithm over each possible pair of KBs with two different con- figurations: δ align = 0.7 and δ align = 0.9. From each pair of KBs KB i , KB j we obtained a list of candidate alignments, i.e. pairs of relations r i , r j where r i ∈ KB i and r j ∈ KB j . From each list we then extracted a random sample of 150 candidate alignments. We showed each align- ment 4 r i , r j to two human judges, and asked whether r i and r j represented the same relation. The problem was presented in terms of paraphras- ing: for each pair, we asked whether exchanging r i and r j within a sentence would have changed that sentence's meaning. In line with Section 8.2 we computed precision based on the agreement between human choice and automatic alignments. Results are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 7</ref>. Our alignment al- gorithm shows high precision in all pairings where δ align = 0.9. Alignment reliability decreases for lower δ align , as relation pairs where r i is a gener- alization of r j (or vice versa) tend to have similar centroids in V S . The same holds for pairs where r i is the negation of r j (or vice versa). Even though we could have utilized measures based on rela-tion string similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dutta et al., 2015)</ref> to reduce wrong alignments in these cases, by relying on a purely semantic criterion we removed any prior as- sumption on the format of input KBs. Some exam- ples of alignments are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 8</ref>. To conclude, we report statistics regarding the unified KB * produced from the initial set of re- sources in our experimental setup (cf. Section 7). We validated our thresholds for high-precision, and selected δ dis = 0.25, δ spec = 0.8 and δ align = 0.8. Our alignment algorithm produced 56,673 confident alignments, out of which 2,207 relation synsets were derived, with an average size of 16.82 individual relations per synset. As a result, we ob- tained a unified KB * comprising 24,221,856 dis- ambiguated triples defined over 1,952,716 distinct entities and 2,675,296 distinct relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have presented KB-UNIFY, a novel, gen- eral approach for disambiguating and seamlessly unifying KBs produced by different OIE sys- tems. KB-UNIFY represents entities and relations using a shared semantic representation, leverag- ing a unified sense inventory together with a semantically-enhanced vector space model and a disambiguation algorithm. This enables us to dis- ambiguate unlinked resources (like NELL and RE- VERB) with high precision and coverage, and to discover relation-level cross-resource alignments effectively. One of the key features of our strat- egy is its generality: by representing each KB on a common ground, we need no prior assumption on the nature and format of the knowledge it en- codes. We tested our approach experimentally on a set of four very different KBs, both linked and unlinked, and we evaluated disambiguation and alignment results extensively at every stage, ex- ploiting both human evaluations and public gold standard datasets (when available). This work opens compelling avenues for future work. We plan to further exploit sense-enhanced unified rep- resentations of relations in various ways: provid- ing an ontological structure for the unified KB, exploring complementary approaches for captur- ing semantic relation alignments, and incorporat- ing multilinguality.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Unification algorithm workflow</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,72.29,62.81,217.70,99.42" type="bitmap" /></figure>
