				<p>We challenge a common assumption in active learning, that a list-based interface populated by informative samples provides for efficient and effective data annotation. We show how a 2D scatterplot populated with diverse and representative samples can yield improved models given the same time budget. We consider this for bootstrapping-based information extraction , in particular named entity classification , where human and machine jointly label data. To enable effective data annotation in a scatterplot, we have developed an embedding-based bootstrapping model that learns the dis-tributional similarity of entities through the patterns that match them in a large data corpus , while being discriminative with respect to human-labeled and machine-promoted entities. We conducted a user study to assess the effectiveness of these different interfaces, and analyze bootstrapping performance in terms of human labeling accuracy, label quantity, and labeling consensus across multiple users. Our results suggest that supervision acquired from the scatterplot interface, despite being noisier, yields improvements in classification performance compared with the list interface, due to a larger quantity of supervision acquired.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One strategy for mitigating the cost of supervised learning in information extraction (IE) is to boot- strap extractors with light supervision from a few provided examples (or seeds). Most typical boot- strapping methods <ref type="bibr">(Yarowsky, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Collins and Singer, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abney, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carlson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Manning, 2014, 2015</ref>, inter alia) are it- erative in nature, and suffer from semantic drift: as the learning advances, the task often drifts se- mantically into a related but different space, e.g., from learning women names into learning flower names ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Komachi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yangarber, 2003</ref>).</p><p>In such cases, a human-in-the-loop to help guide bootstrapping through active learning (AL) (Set- tles, 2012) can be highly beneficial.</p><p>In this work, we challenge the common assump- tion made for AL methods in the context of IE: a visual interface that shows a list of samples ranked by their informativeness to the classifier is effec- tive for building classifiers that minimize human annotator time <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dalvi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">He and Grishman, 2015</ref>). We argue that this is an inefficient form of acquiring supervision from humans. In- stead, we propose a two-dimensional (2D) scat- terplot interface (rather than the one-dimensional (1D) list), where the examples to be annotated are selected by their capacity to cluster together (rather than by their informativeness to the classi- fier). We demonstrate that our approach leads to more data being annotated, and better overall per- formance for the model being learned.</p><p>In particular, we focus on the task of boot- strapped named entity classification (NEC), where a classifier is trained to label named entities with their corresponding category. For example, such an algorithm starts with a few examples of labeled names, e.g., "Barack Obama" as PERSON, from which it learns representative patterns, e.g., the pattern "@ENTITY , former president", which are then used to label other names in fu- ture iterations. Unlike traditional bootstrapping, our approach receives supervision in two ways: from the seed examples (as shown above), but also from human labels through an active learning step that is inserted after each bootstrapping iteration. To facilitate the clustering of examples in the an- notation interface, we propose a semi-supervised NEC approach that learns custom embeddings for the entities being classified ( §4). We select entities that are diverse and representative of the embed- ding's data distribution, and project them into a 2D visual encoding of the data via a scatterplot using dimensionality reduction ( §5).</p><p>The resulting scatterplot interface enables the user to label a larger quantity of entities, at the ex- pense of label noise from mixed-category clusters and a potentially less-informative sampling crite- rion. To better understand this space, we con- ducted a user study to compare the effectiveness of the scatterplot interface compared to the tradi- tional list that contains examples selected by infor- mativeness ( §7). Through our study, we arrive at the following takeaways:</p><p>• We observe that in configurations that used the scatterplot interface, annotators indeed la- beled considerably more examples, but at an accuracy slightly lower than in the list inter- face. Despite the lower accuracy, the scat- terplot interface generally yields better clas- sifiers. In other words, the volume of anno- tations matters just as much as quality for the classifier performance.</p><p>• We find that a consensus model of users can mitigate noise, but must preserve a cer- tain quantity of annotated data. A consen- sus model for the list interface that con- servatively estimates labels reduces perfor- mance despite highly accurate labels due to the small amount of annotations. In con- trast, the same model for the scatterplot inter- face yields higher label noise, but more an- notations within the same budget of time and gives the best performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Information extraction (IE) techniques commonly assume that the human supervision comes in the form of knowledge bases of facts disconnected from supporting text, as in the case of distant supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mintz et al., 2009)</ref>, or provides a light amount of supervision up front, as in the case of bootstrapping ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angeli et al., 2015)</ref>. Com- mon techniques for bootstrapping are to use rules for incrementally classifying entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins and Singer, 1999</ref>) or to use syntactic (He and Grish- man, 2015) and semantic <ref type="bibr">Manning, 2014, 2015</ref>) contextual features. However, such approaches suffer from semantic drift, as previ- ously discussed.</p><p>Considering a human-in-the-loop for IE has the potential to mitigate drift and greatly benefit per- formance, yet the challenge lies in minimizing hu- man effort. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angeli et al. (2014)</ref> show how to use active learning to improve distantly su- pervised relation extraction techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Surdeanu et al., 2012</ref>) through humans labeling informative relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Werling et al. (2015)</ref> use Bayesian deci- sion theory to minimize human cost and maximize accuracy for named entity recognition. For certain IE tasks, however, human supervision can be very noisy and thus counterproductive, especially from crowds, thus previous work has shown the impor- tance of how to pose tasks for humans in provid- ing labels ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 2016)</ref>, as well as automati- cally distinguishing simple labeling tasks from ex- pert tasks in crowd-based task assignments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. Our work shares a similar view of hu- man supervision for IE, yet we instead study the impact of the annotation interface on the overall performance.</p><p>The role of the human-in-the-loop for topic modeling has also been extensively explored. For instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Smith et al. (2018)</ref> consider the types of modifications that one can provide to a built topic model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hu et al., 2014</ref>) to make the topics more meaningful, while also studying the downstream human factor implications. Furthermore, prior work has also considered how different visual rep- resentations of topics impact a human's under- standing of topic semantics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Smith et al., 2017)</ref>. Closely related is the technique of Poursabzi- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sangdeh et al. (2016)</ref>, where they highlight how different visual representations can have an impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of human label- ing for document classification, comparing stan- dard list interfaces with topic-grouped lists. Our method instead considers how 2D scatterplot in- terfaces, via embedding-based techniques, capture semantics for the purposes of providing labels in an IE task.</p><p>The visual analytics community has also inves- tigated the role of visual interfaces and interaction tools for annotating data in supervised learning. For instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Heimerl et al. (2012)</ref> enable interac- tive labeling for document classification by visual- izing unlabeled documents based on classifier un- certainty and document diversity. The technique of <ref type="bibr">Höferlin et al. (2012)</ref> jointly visualizes unla- beled data and the classifier model, and allows the user to both label data points and directly modify model parameters. Closely related to our method is the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bernard et al. (2018)</ref>   We show the workflow of our study (left): (S1) the Information Extraction model first auto- matically labels entities and updates its parameters, (S2) the human then labels entities through a given visual interface, and (S3) the model is updated based on the provided set of human labels. We study the effectiveness of two different interfaces (right): a list, and a 2D scatterplot of entities.</p><p>teractive visual labeling. However, their method is focused on acquiring labels solely from humans, whereas our method studies the interplay between self-labeling and human labels in a visualization context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Human-Machine Workflow for Bootstrapping</head><p>We first describe the general workflow on which our study is based. We consider bootstrapping where both the human and the machine label enti- ties in tandem, following the setup described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fu and Grishman (2013)</ref> . More specifically, we con- sider the following iterative process (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>):</p><p>• (S1) The model automatically classifies enti- ties, adds them as labeled data, and updates its parameters, as detailed in §4.</p><p>• (S2) The human interacts with a visual inter- face, driven by the model and the current set of labeled and unlabeled entities. The result of this step is a set of entities labeled by the human. We define this step a round of label- ing, or just round.</p><p>• (S3) The model then updates its parameters given the human-labeled entities.</p><p>In contrast with typical bootstrapping, which inter- leaves entity promotion with model updates, here the human has the opportunity to label data. The intent is to guide bootstrapping: human annota- tions should steer bootstrapping towards learning the proper concepts, and away from semantic drift.</p><p>Yet, in this process we would like to minimize human effort while maximizing bootstrapping per- formance, where we define effort as the total time spent annotating data. In particular, the primary focus of our study is on step (S2), and how the user's interactions with the interface impacts these considerations. We consider two different types of interfaces for this purpose, shown on the right side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>: list interfaces, and scatterplot inter- faces. In particular, both interfaces utilize the state of the model to decide on what to show to the user. In the case of the list-based interface, we perform uncertainty sampling with respect to the model, as a way to maximize the information obtained from the user. For the scatterplot interface, the user in- teracts with a subset of diverse and representative entities through a 2D projection. Here we wish to see if more efficient groupwise labeling of per- ceived clusters in the scatterplot results in a more efficient and effective labeling process.</p><p>Of course, a critical piece to our study is the bootstrapping model itself. There exists a large body of work in bootstrapping, as previously dis- cussed, and one possibility is to use an existing technique for our work. For our learning scenario, a bootstrapping technique should satisfy several criteria:</p><p>• Be efficient to update, in order to minimize user latency with the interface;</p><p>• Incorporate user supervision to ensure a dis- criminative representation;</p><p>• Be suitable for visual exploration.</p><p>Please note that traditional bootstrapping tech- niques such as rule-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins and Singer, 1999</ref>) fail to meet all criteria. In partic- ular, they are not suitable for visual exploration because there is no clear way to represent the se- mantic proximity of rules or of the concepts be- ing learned. We next describe how to address these challenges through embedding-based boot- strapping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Embedding-Based Bootstrapping</head><p>Our bootstrapping technique is based on neural language models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, in par- ticular, semi-supervised embedding-based boot- strapping techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Valenzuela-Escárcega et al., 2018)</ref>. Unlike other word embedding algorithms, our approach measures distributional similarity of entities (rather than words) with respect to pat- terns (rather than context words). We define a pattern as a small sequence of words that sur- round an entity, up to ±4 words to the left/right of the entity under consideration. For instance, in the phrases "John said on Saturday" and "John told reporters" the patterns "said on Saturday" and "told reporters" are suggestive of the category Person for entity John. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We observe that enti- ties of a given category, e.g. Person, are likely to have common pattern distributions. This observa- tion drives our method for learning entity and pat- tern embeddings. Furthermore, as we will see, this method permits efficient updates, and it is suitable for visualization due to the geometric representa- tion of entities and patterns. More specifically, assume that we have ex- tracted a set of entities E and patterns P in a given text corpus C. We associate each entity e ∈ E and pattern p ∈ P with embeddings x e and x p , respectively, with x e , x p ∈ R d . To satisfy the above form of distributional similarity, we utilize the Skip Gram model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> and seek entity embeddings to be close to their embed- dings of observed patterns through maximizing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SG = (e,p)∈Cp [log(σ(x e x p ))+ n∈N log(σ(−x e x n ))],</formula><p>(1) where (e, p) corresponds to an entity-pattern oc- currence from the corpus set C p , n represents a negative pattern, sampled from the unigram dis- tribution of all patterns N ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Levy and Goldberg, 2014</ref>) 2 , and σ is the sigmoid function. Intuitively, this forces an entity's embedding to be similar to embeddings of its matched patterns from the cor- pus, and dissimilar to random pattern embeddings.</p><p>A disadvantage with the Skip Gram model is that it might fail to be discriminative, since it does not utilize category labels. Thus, we introduce an objective term that seeks to bring entities that belong to the same category to have similar em- beddings, and entities that belong to different cat- egories to be far apart in their embeddings. We re- alize this using large-margin metric learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cui et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sohn, 2016)</ref>, minimizing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">LM = (a,b,c)∈E l s(x a , x c ) − s(x a , x b ) + M + , (2)</formula><p>where (a, b, c) represents a triplet of entities, such that a and b belong to the same category, while c belongs to a different category, and the function s is the cosine similarity between entity embed- dings. The set E l is a subset of entities from E that have been assigned categories so far, as provided by the bootstrapper (S1) or the human (S2). Intu- itively, entities from dissimilar categories should be positioned in the embedding space such that their cosine similarity is at least a margin M from any pair of entities of the same category.</p><p>We combine the Skip Gram objective with the metric learning objective to obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">B = LM − SG.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The objective B can be viewed as a form of semi- supervised representation learning, where from a sparse set of labeled entities, we wish to learn entity representations that are similar should they have patterns in common (SG), while simultane- ously ensuring that embeddings are discriminative with respect to categories (LM ).</p><p>Step (S3) min- imizes this objective at every round of bootstrap- ping via stochastic gradient descent, given the cur- rent set of labeled entities E l .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Promoting Entities</head><p>We use the learned embedding to automatically promote unlabeled entities to categories, as dis- cussed in step (S1). We use the normalized entity embeddings as features, and build a multinomial In both, the user selects entities in the main view (I), based on an assigned category (II), wherein we also show the total amount of labels the user, and the machine, has thus far labeled. In (III) we show the current status of training/labeling, and the option to initiate/stop training.</p><p>logistic regression model over the given set of la- beled entities, trained to predict entity categories. For each category, we then promote the most con- fident entities to the category. To compute confi- dence, we treat the model's predictions as category probabilities, take the entropy over this distribu- tion as a measure of unconfidence, and promote entities with the lowest entropy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Supervision Interfaces</head><p>We now turn to the visual interface through which humans provide supervision (step S2). We distin- guish the interfaces by how entities are sampled, presented to the user, and each interface's set of interactions for labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">List Interface</head><p>Sampling. We sample entities through sorting them by confidence, as defined in §4.1, and sam- ple the most unconfident entities. This form of uncertainty sampling is common in list-based in- terfaces ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angeli et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Poursabzi-Sangdeh et al., 2016)</ref>, as a measure of informativeness for updating the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Settles, 2012)</ref>. Presentation. We next show the 15 most un- certain entities in a 1D list-based visual interface ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a (I)</ref>).</p><p>Interactions. The user labels entities by first selecting their desired category <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2a (II)</ref>), fol- lowed by clicking on the entity in the main display.</p><p>We also allow the user to select multiple entities at once, for a given category. As the user labels enti- ties, we repopulate the display with the next set of most unconfident entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Scatterplot Interface</head><p>Sampling. For the scatterplot interface, we aim to sample entities that are beneficial for the model, while also ensuring the user can efficiently label entities through groupwise selection. Uncertainty sampling, though potentially informative, can lead to projections that are challenging for the user in performing groupwise labeling, as we experimen- tally verified that entities with high classification uncertainty are unlikely to group together. To ad- dress this, we sample entities based on how they are distributed in the embedding space, to pro- vide us a diverse and representative sampling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xu et al., 2007</ref>). More specifically, we first perform k-means on the entities' normalized embeddings, with k = 40, and sample across clusters to give di- versity. To ensure a representative sampling, ker- nel density estimation is performed within each cluster's entities, and the entity with highest den- sity, along with its nearest neighbors in the embed- ding space, are selected. The number of neighbors sampled in each cluster is proportional to the clus- ter size, to ensure balance across clusters.</p><p>Presentation. We next perform a 2D projec- tion of 500 sampled entities using t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Maaten and Hinton, 2008)</ref>, visually encoding each entity by a filled circle <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b (I)</ref>). To provide context with respect to entities labeled by the human or machine, we jointly project the unlabeled sampled entities, and a subset of the entities previously la- beled (drawn as triangles), either by the human an- notator or promoted with high-confidence by the machine.</p><p>Interactions. The user labels entities by first selecting a category <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b (II)</ref>), followed by using a circular brush to label groups of entities. The user can adjust the brush's radius, as well as change the view through panning and zooming. We dynamically filter the text labels for entities based on the zoom level to reduce clutter, thus the user can observe a high-level overview of the space of entities when zoomed out, and observe more details upon zooming in. This gives the an- notator the chance to perform groupwise annota- tions by jointly considering cluster structure and a sparse set of text labels from the cluster, and label- ing all entities at once should the annotator decide the group of entities belongs to a single category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Training</head><p>Common to both interfaces, user interactions are interleaved with model updates. During training, the list interface is refreshed with the top 15 most informative samples every 3 training epochs, or passes over the data, while for the scatterplot the samples and their 2D positions are updated. To ensure temporal coherence for those entities that persist between updates, we employ dynamic t- SNE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rauber et al., 2016</ref>). The user can opt to stop training if they observe little change occur- ring between snapshots <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2 (III)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">User Study</head><p>We conducted a user study to investigate the effec- tiveness of the different interfaces. We recruited 10 participants for our study: the median age was 22, the minimum and maximum respectively 19 and 41, 5 participants self-reported as being "somewhat knowledgeable" of machine learning, 4 with "no knowledge", and 1 identifying as an "expert". We used a within-subject design, where the first interface presented to the participant was selected at random to mitigate potential priming effects. For each interface, a set of instructions was first presented, followed by a brief tutorial where the user must label a small set of seed enti- ties -10 per category. These seed entities, labeled with ground truth rather than user labels, initialize the bootstrapping model, so that participants start off with identical embeddings. After the instruc- tions, the participant then performs 10 rounds of labeling, where they may label entities for up to 1 minute per round. After each round of labeling, the bootstrapper promotes 10 entities to each cate- gory, and then performs 30 epochs of training.</p><p>Dataset.</p><p>We use the Ontonotes dataset ( <ref type="bibr">Weischedel et al., 2013)</ref>, limited to the 4 categories that have the most frequently mentioned entities, in order to make the labeling task manageable, yet still nontrivial, for par- ticipants. These categories are people (PER), organizations (ORG), geopolitical entities (GPE), and nationalities as well as religious/political affiliations (AFF), resulting in 6, <ref type="bibr">567,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">199,</ref><ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">617</ref>, and 422 entities per category, respectively.</p><p>Bootstrapping Details. It is critical to ensure that bootstrapping training minimizes user latency, while not sacrificing performance (c.f. Eq. 3). To strike this balance, we set the number of nega- tive patterns sampled for each entity to <ref type="bibr">10 (Levy and Goldberg, 2014)</ref>, the embedding dimension d to 100, perform hard negative triplet mining ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cui et al., 2016)</ref> to form the loss on triplets likely to violate the margin, and set the margin M to 0.4. Experimentally, we found these settings al- lowed training to converge to a good solution after 30 training epochs, and that each epoch took no longer than 1 second on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>We analyze the results in terms of three forms of evaluation: bootstrapping performance, as deter- mined by the entities promoted during the course of the user study, extrapolation, wherein we let bootstrapping proceed to promote entities after the joint human-machine labeling has completed, and consensus, where we combine the set of entities annotated by participants within the different in- terfaces. We also analyze a typical user's labeling, and corresponding machine performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Bootstrapping Performance</head><p>We first look at the effectiveness of promoted en- tities during the course of each participant's inter- actions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(a)</ref> shows bootstrapping accuracy averaged over all users for the list and scatter- plot. We also compare to a baseline of traditional bootstrapping, where no human labels are consid- ered, averaged over 10 trials. Note this is simi-  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: We show performance in terms of recall, computed per-category and averaged across cate- gories, for the baseline, list and scatterplot inter- faces. This is shown for the last round of boot- strapping (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3a)</ref> and extrapolation (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3b</ref>).</p><p>lar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Valenzuela-Escárcega et al. (2018)</ref>, which demonstrates improved performance across a set of bootstrapping techniques, and thus represents a competitive baseline. We find that the perfor- mance of both interfaces outperform this baseline, and that the scatterplot outperforms the list: a two- sample Welch's t-test concludes statistical signifi- cance (p=0.05), as well as for a paired t-test mea- sured within participants (p=0.03). In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> we also show recall, computed per-category and av- eraged over categories, at the last round of boot- strapping and similarly find the scatterplot outper- forms the list. Better insight between the interfaces can be gained by looking at individual user performance. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(a)</ref> shows a plot of each participant's perfor- mance (y-axis) for both interfaces, as a function of their labeling accuracy (x-axis) and the total num- ber of labels provided (size of each circle). Note that the 3 best-performing models come from the scatterplot interface, even at the expense of a lower labeling accuracy. This suggests that the number of labels can counter the noise in labeling, com-   <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Bootstrapping performance for user study (a), and extrapolation (b) for individual par- ticipants, evaluated at throughputs (number of en- tities promoted) of 400 and 800, respectively. Each circle is a participant whose color indicates the interface (green, orange, and purple are scat- terplot, list, and baseline, respectively); x-axis is participant labeling accuracy; y-axis is machine accuracy; and circle size encodes the number of annotated labels (large circle indicates large num- ber of annotated labels).</p><p>pared to a list where we may have potentially more informative entities labeled more accurately, but much fewer entities annotated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Extrapolation</head><p>We next look at how bootstrapping continues to learn, when starting from all of the annotations provided by the corresponding human annotator as well as the entities promoted by the machine. We term this configuration extrapolation. This analy- sis indirectly measures how much noise crept into the available annotations, by measuring the perfor- mance of the classifier trained on this data. We repeated this experiment over 10 different trials, promoting 10 entities per category in each round, and take the average accuracy, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(b)</ref> for the performance averaged over all users for  the interfaces, as well as the aforementioned base- line. Observe that the baseline performs progres- sively worse as a function of throughput, indicat- ing that labels provided by the human annotators help to prevent drift. We also find the results to be stronger compared with §7.1; namely, a two- sample Welch's t-test concludes statistical signif- icance (p=0.002) and similarly for a paired t-test within participants (p=0.007). The recall perfor- mance in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> also confirms the performance gains of the scatterplot. Supporting these results, <ref type="figure">Fig. 4(b)</ref> shows that the scatterplot interface for users that labeled a large amount of entities gener- ally outperform those where fewer entities were labeled. This experiment suggests that the best strategy to control for semantic drift is to aim for an interface that yields many annotations at rea- sonable accuracy, rather than few, higher-quality ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Individual User Labeling</head><p>We show labeling accuracy and bootstrapping ac- curacy for a participant that has similar perfor- mance to the average (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(a)</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5(a)</ref> we show the number of entities labeled across cat- egories, where bars of higher color lightness en- code the number of incorrect labels, and in (b) we plot the difference in bootstrapping performance between the scatterplot and the list. We observe that the class imbalance of the Ontonotes dataset tends to manifest in labeling as well, where ORG and PER are typically labeled the most. We also see a correlation between accurate human labeling and bootstrapping performance (e.g. the arrows pointing at GPE and ORG for rounds 7 and 8, re- spectively). This highlights an advantage of ex- ploratory visual interfaces for labeling, such as a scatterplot, where the user can search for clusters of a particular category, e.g., in the case of GPE there may not exist many entities of this type in the list interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Consensus</head><p>Given the noise inherent in a single user's annota- tions, we last analyze whether techniques to com- bine labels across a set of users can help reduce label noise and improve performance. To this end, for the scatterplot and list interface we combine all annotations, and consider two different types of consensus methods: 1) Union: we take the union of all annotated entities, choosing an entity's la- bel at random during conflicts; and 2) Majority Vote (MV): for conflicting entities we select the most voted category across users, discarding enti- ties that have only been annotated once or have ties across users. We then seed bootstrapping with the resulting set of labels, run 20 rounds of promotion, and take the average performance of 10 trials. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>(a-b) compares each method across the different interfaces, while <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> shows accuracy and total number of labels for the consensus meth- ods. We also include performance, labeling ac- curacy, and label totals averaged across individual users, where for each user we seed bootstrapping  with their full set of annotations. For Union, we observe that despite the large number of labels, the scatterplot performance is comparable to av- erage individual performance, suggesting that in this case, the volume of labels does not counter the noise in the data. For the list, we can see a gain in performance, which is likely attributed to the cleaner annotations from participants. For MV, however, we find that the scatterplot per- forms the best, whereas the list performs worse compared with its Union counterpart, now hav- ing approximately 3x less labels. This emphasizes the interplay between accuracy and label quantity, even despite the more informative labels provided through the list interface, and supports our previ- ous observation that balancing the volume of an- notations with their quality yields the best annota- tion strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Discussion</head><p>We acknowledge some limitations in our tech- nique and user study. A drawback to our sam- pling scheme for the scatterplot is that it does not utilize classifier informativeness. In initial exper- iments, we found that uncertainty sampling led to 2D projections that were challenging to groupwise label. This result is intuitive: data points classified with lowest confidence will naturally have low- quality embeddings, yielding poor clusters. Thus we can not perform a consistent comparison of the same sampling criterion used between the inter- faces. For future work we will investigate active learning techniques that are relevant to the learn- ing task, while still permitting efficient labeling.</p><p>In this work we restricted our study to entity classification, one of many types of IE tasks. Our approach should generalize to other IE tasks, how- ever, provided these tasks exhibit certain struc-  ture. Specifically, user annotations in a task should amount to labeling of data instances, and the data instances defined by the task should be able to be perceived in a 2D scatterplot. For instance, coreference resolution and relationship extraction fit both criteria. Assessing the effectiveness of vi- sual supervision for these tasks is outside of the scope of this paper, however, and we will consider these studies in future work.</p><p>Overall, our user study clearly highlights the importance of visual interfaces in acquiring su- pervision for semi-supervised information extrac- tion. We demonstrated that, when compared to the traditional list interface, the scatterplot allows a larger volume of annotations to be created at rea- sonable accuracy, yielding better classifiers. We believe this finding will influence active learning, in terms of sampling criteria and the interplay be- tween AL and visual interfaces.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: We show the workflow of our study (left): (S1) the Information Extraction model first automatically labels entities and updates its parameters, (S2) the human then labels entities through a given visual interface, and (S3) the model is updated based on the provided set of human labels.
