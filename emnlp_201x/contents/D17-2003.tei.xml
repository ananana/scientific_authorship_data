			<abstract>
				<p>We present an educational tool that integrates computational linguistics resources for use in non-technical undergraduate language science courses. By using the tool in conjunction with evidence-driven pedagogical case studies, we strive to provide opportunities for students to gain an understanding of linguistic concepts and analysis through the lens of realistic problems in feasible ways. Case studies tend to be used in legal, business, and health education contexts, but less in the teaching and learning of linguistics. The approach introduced also has potential to encourage students across training backgrounds to continue on to computational language analysis coursework.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The computational linguistics community makes available software resources for performing struc- tural and meaning-related linguistic analysis on language input. While these tools and models are commonly used in research contexts and have long been used in computational linguistics instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Meurers et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldridge and Erk, 2008)</ref>, they also have a role to play for enhancing non- computational pedagogy in linguistics.</p><p>We present an educational innovation that aims to provide students in undergraduate language sci- ence classes with case-based active learning op- portunities by enabling them to actively confront linguistic concepts and methods encountered in textbooks and class discussions (or as supplemen- tary materials to stimulate learning) in hands-on tasks that emphasize the applied nature of the study and practice of language science. Compu- tational linguistics software resources tend to be designed for tech-savvy users and expect knowl- edge acquired in computational, or computational linguistics, curriculum or similar contexts. They often require some understanding of technical de- tails about computer programming and computa- tional linguistics principles and methods. While there are web-based linguistic corpus resources, the interaction potential for users tends to be limited to functionalities such as key-words-in- context searches or look-up of relatively simple structural patterns, as opposed to providing stu- dents across majors with the ability to conduct, as- sess, and critique analyses built on models devel- oped in the computational linguistics community.</p><p>Linguine 1 is a web-based tool with a user- friendly interface <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) tailored to educa- tional use in language science coursework. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> It draws on natural language processing resources in the open domain in order to provide users with the capabilities to study a range of linguistic structural and semantic patterns in written language input. The motivation for Linguine includes (1) making computationally driven language analysis accessi- ble to non-computing majors in undergraduate lin- guistics courses; (2) enabling practical, formative opportunities for linguistically informed analysis; and (3) guiding students to perform user-friendly analyses and presenting intuitive visualizations of automatically processed results to make them more readily interpretable. Thus, Linguine con- trasts with resources such as the CLARINO Lan- guage Analysis Portal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lapponi et al., 2013</ref>) in its pedagogical purpose and its pairing of analy- ses with visualizations. Linguine also enables a broader set of language analysis functionalities. This work's main innovation is the applied pair- ing of this tool with case studies as active learning vehicles in language science. The case studies task students with seeking evidence-based solutions to and recommendations for linguistically grounded real-world problems. They also aim to train stu- dents in oral and written communication about their analysis, recommendations, and critical ob- servations. While the case study method is a rec- ognized learning tool in domains such as business and law, it is rather unusual to see it used exten- sively in the linguistics curriculum. This approach thus differentiates itself from standard ways of teaching linguistics concepts and analysis. Lin- guine's functionalities and visualizations support and facilitate the situational problem solving and hands-on critical thinking that case studies enable. Adopting the case study method further seeks to nurture student experiences in utilizing linguistics to address and reason over relatable problems in society. Students can also increase their under- standing of the limitations and potential utility of language technologies.</p><p>In this paper, we describe Linguine and how it contributes to using case study pedagogy in lan- guage science. We also report on instructor ob- servations in conjunction with student surveys to provide insights into the utility of the case study model with the Linguine system. tive learning and its ability to transform machine- processed results into intuitive visualizations. Vi- sualizations depend on the analysis performed and include sentence-by-sentence display of syntactic trees, data summary tables, tool-tips displaying se- quential annotations, and colorful markup in text. Users can inspect results in a structured represen- tation within the tool. Results can also be down- loaded in JSON format for off-line analysis by users with the necessary background. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the data flow between Lin- guine's components. The architecture is com- posed of a Python server that interacts with a NodeJS server and a MongoDB 6 database. These components run as system services on a RHEL7 virtual machine. The Python server receives anal- ysis requests from the NodeJS server. It obtains the relevant text from the database and performs preprocessing operations. Preprocessed text is passed to a queue for analysis. Analyses are car- ried out in parallel using the expected resources. Analysis time depends on the size of the text and the type of analysis. At present, Linguine is an English-focused environment, aimed at language science coursework offered by computational lin- guists faculty in an English department. How- ever, its framework enables incorporating addi- tional resources for text-based analyses. For ex- ample, models trained on other languages, or po- tentially other forms of unstructured data, could be integrated with adapted visualizations.</p><p>The SPLAT library computes statistics on n- grams, part-of-speech tags, syllables, and disflu- encies. SPLAT also calculates linguistic complex- ity measures, including content and idea densities, Flesch readability, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, and type-token ratio. Examples of visualizations pro- duced by Linguine using SPLAT functionality are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3, 4 (left)</ref>, and 6 (right). Using output from Stanford CoreNLP, Linguine incorpo- rates analysis options requiring sophisticated mod- eling, including syntactic trees with sentiment la- bels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>) and named entity recognition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig- ure 6, left)</ref>. Analyses are saved to the database, allowing users to return to visualizations without having to reprocess their analysis.</p><p>The integration of technologies required man- aging asynchronous communications between Python and Linguine's other subsystems. Data transfer within Linguine is handled by Tornado 7 , <ref type="bibr">6</ref> https://www.mongodb.com/ 7 http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ Q This case study activity... 1 was engaging. 2 had clear instructions. 3 was related to the course material. 4 involved a reasonable time commitment. 5 was a valuable learning experience. 6 enhanced my understanding of linguistic concepts. 7 reinforced theoretical concepts from class with an application. 8 let me use linguistic approaches to problem solving. 9 had me engaged in critical thinking. 10 involved a useful reporting experience. Q Using the provided web tools and input... 11 was straightforward. 12 went hand-in-hand with the case instructions. 13 enhanced my thinking about the case resolution plan. 14 was interesting. 15 was a good learning experience. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Case Studies</head><p>We have so far developed three case studies for two course contexts: an overview course of lan- guage science fundamentals and an English lan- guage history course. Combining case studies with the functionality of Linguine provides stu- dents with fictional yet realistic scenarios to solve using active inquiry with linguistic data. Each case study comprises a set of design elements, follow- ing a template that enables task clarity and effec- tive design and prototyping:</p><p>• The case description includes a narrative that sets up a problem and provides background about the data needed to perform language- based analysis in Linguine for gathering ev- idence. This includes step-by-step analysis instructions with questions to answer, as well as guidelines for presenting work, preparing written reporting, and completing a quiz, in addition to an evaluation rubric.   • Data that has been selected and prepared for out-of-class and in-class analysis.</p><p>• Two readings that students can consult for reasoning about a case: an applied, broad- audience reading vs. an academic reading.</p><p>The case studies are expanded with a develop- ment and teaching guide that outlines the motiva- tion for text selection, details preprocessing on the texts, and includes expected answers to their ques- tions. The initially developed case studies are:</p><p>• The Language of Dementia: Students ana- lyze a selection of picture descriptions from the DementiaBank corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Becker et al., 1994)</ref> with the goal of assisting a medical re- searcher in identifying linguistic markers of Alzheimer's disease. Readings include Szat- loczki et al. (2015); <ref type="bibr">Goldstein et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>• Historical Varieties of English: Students ex- amine excerpts of literature across time pe- riods to assist school teachers in choosing grade-appropriate readings for their classes. Readings include, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Perera (1980)</ref>.</p><p>• Formality in Business Communications: In roles as analysts for a training agency, stu- dents use email data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Klimt and Yang, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pavlick and Tetreault, 2016</ref>, added later) to critically envision guidelines for workplace communications. Readings include <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pavlick and Tetreault (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lebowitz (2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results of Case Study Exploration</head><p>Students in an introductory linguistics course worked with Linguine in assigned teams first on The Language of Dementia and a few weeks later on Formality in Business Communications. For both cases, students used Linguine and engaged with provided data in and out of the classroom. Student teams reported results orally to classmates in short presentations and in write-ups. The third case study in the English language history class was completed individually by fewer students. 8 Students were instructed to complete the case components and then answer an anonymous case satisfaction survey <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Tables 1-2</ref>). This provided a chance to self-report on the learning experience.</p><p>Instructor observations of class interactions suggest that several pedagogical benefits emerged. First, students engaged in increased critical thinking about analysis, data, and methods in class. Second, the reporting exercise nurtured co- learning, as students could observe how others ap- proach a problem and choose to visualize, summa- rize, and present results. Third, the case approach offered a structured framework for teamwork. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> (p. 6) shows that a majority of students evaluated the activity positively on all measures, agreeing that the experience was engaging, edu- cational, interesting, and that it stimulated critical thinking and learning (Q1, Q5, Q9, Q14, Q15). Students reported that the activity and tool were clear and straightforward (Q2, Q11, Q12). Cru- cially, most students felt the experience was rele- vant to and practiced class material, enhanced their understanding of linguistics, and engaged them in such problem solving (Q3, Q6, Q7, Q8).</p><p>Students were also given the opportunity to pro- vide qualitative feedback about their experience; examples are in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> (p. 6). Nearly half the stu- dents reported that they particularly enjoyed learn- ing about practical, real-world applications of lin- guistics. They recognized the links between the concepts seen in class and the case studies. Stu- dents found the texts in the second case study (from email data) to be particularly entertaining, and they appreciated the open-ended nature of that case study compared with the first case study.</p><p>8 A co-author served as course instructor.</p><p>The negative comments centered on three is- sues: (1) the modest amount of data provided for analysis; (2) the constraints of Linguine (e.g., al- lows downloading results as JSON, not csv); and (3) the reporting experience, which a few students found repetitive in the first case study. This feed- back has been valuable for continuing to enhance Linguine and case-based instructional materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We presented the integration of the pedagogical web application Linguine and case studies using this tool in courses. We will continue to explore the system and its educational use and effective- ness in parallel. Developing a systematic pro- cess for preparing new case studies is left for fu- ture work. Planned expansions of the system and materials include increased focus on processing meaning, and expanding the analysis potential for transcribed speech to enable further pedagogical bridging of analyzing spoken and written language data in language science case studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Linguine's tab-based interface showing the Analyses tab with three completed analyses.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="1,322.71,225.93,181.41,186.79" type="bitmap" /></figure>
