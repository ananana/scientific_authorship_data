<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Search personalization that considers the social dimension of the web has attracted a significant volume of research in recent years. A user pro- file is usually needed to represent a user's inter- ests in order to tailor future searches. Previous research has typically constructed a profile sole- ly from a user's usage information. When the user has only limited activities in the system, the effect of the user profile on search is also constrained. This research addresses the setting where a user has only a limited amount of usage information. We build enhanced user profiles from a set of annotations and resources that us- ers have marked, together with an external knowledge base constructed according to usage histories. We present two probabilistic latent topic models to simultaneously incorporate so- cial annotations, documents and the external knowledge base. Our web search strategy is achieved using personalized social query ex- pansion. We introduce a topical query expan- sion model to enhance the search by utilizing individual user profiles. The proposed ap- proaches have been intensively evaluated on a large public social annotation dataset. Results show that our models significantly outper- formed existing personalized query expansion methods which use user profiles solely built from past usage information in personalized search.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>On today's social web, users can enrich the social context of web pages. The most notable fact is that users can often freely tag web pages with an- notations ( <ref type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2011</ref>). These tags could be high quality descriptors of the web pages' topics and a good indicator of web users' interests. However, the uncontrolled manner of social tag- ging results in the use of an unrestricted vocabu- lary. This makes searching through the collection difficult and generally less accurate. Thus the so- cial annotation or bookmarking system demon- strates an extreme example of the vocabulary mismatch problem encountered in personalized web search. To tackle the problem, various per- sonalized query expansion (QE) and results re- ranking techniques have been proposed and eval- uated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bouadjenek et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>There have been some attempts to achieve per- sonalized QE using social data. For example, Re- searchers have considered selecting the most re- lated tags from a user's profile to expand queries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bender et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bertier et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bouadjenek et al., 2011)</ref>. Local analysis and co- occurrence based user profile representation have also been adopted to expand the query ( <ref type="bibr">Chirita et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Biancalana et al., 2013)</ref>. Recently, Zhou et al. proposed a query expansion framework based on individual user profiles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhou et al., 2012a</ref>). In their work, terms in the user profile are modeled according to their associations, which can be defined by co-occurrence statistics or de- fined by a tag-topic model.</p><p>All of the previously mentioned systems are dependent upon historical usage information be- ing available in an individual user profile ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sugiyama et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Teevan et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bennett et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhou et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Guha et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhou et al., 2016)</ref>. This information is piv- otal when tailoring search results to the prefer- ences of specific individuals. However, in some cases a user may have very limited previous inter- actions with the system. With little usage infor- mation to hand, the personalized search experi- ence is poor. Furthermore, using only historical usage information to personalize search may not be enough.</p><p>In this paper, we extend personalized search us- ing social data in two directions. First, we exploit external knowledge bases to enhance the user pro- file built from a user's historical usage infor- mation. We build queries from the user tags and annotated web pages. Subsequently, we fetch the relevant documents from an external corpus to be included in the user profile. We then propose to incorporate the user's annotations, web page con- tent information and external documents through two statistical models, which we have named Mixture Enhanced User Profiling (MEUP) Model and Separated Enhanced User Profiling (SEUP) Model. Both models infer latent topics, their probabilities of being relevant and a multinomial distribution of topics of the documents being con- sidered. MEUP mixed the tags, annotated docu- ments and external documents together to infer unified latent topics, while SEUP is an extension of MEUP which learns topics that are shared be- tween the two groups of document-aligned pairs.</p><p>Second, we propose a topical query expansion model to personalize web search by utilizing the user profiles. In the topical QE model, profile terms are calculated based on their topical rele- vance to the query terms to expand the query.</p><p>Experimental results show that the Enhanced User Profiling models together with the topic QE can significantly improve retrieval performance over user profiles solely built from a user's histor- ical information. Improvements were observed for users with both a rich amount of usage informa- tion and a small amount of information. We also demonstrate that the approach proposed in the paper outperforms existing QE methods proposed for personalized search using social data.</p><p>The contribution of this paper can be summa- rized as follows:</p><p>i.</p><p>We tackle the challenge of personalized web search using social data in a novel way by enhancing user profiles that are built solely from users' historical usage information.</p><p>ii. We propose and systematically evaluate two novel generative models to construct enriched user profiles with the help of external corpora in the context of personalized search using social data.</p><p>iii. We suggest and evaluate a novel query expansion method. Instead of relying on lexical relevance information between query terms and profile terms, we also consider the topical rele- vance between them to expand the query.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Personalized Search Using Social Media</head><p>In personalized search using social media <ref type="bibr">(Jamali and Ester, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lin et al., 2013)</ref>, the search pro- cess is either performed over "social" data gath- ered from Web 2.0 applications such as social bookmarking systems, wikis, blogs etc., or it re- adapts the web search results produced by search engines by using social data <ref type="bibr">(Carman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bouadjenek et al., 2016)</ref>. For example, the authors in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Vallet et al., 2010</ref>) investigated how the rank- ing of search engine results can be improved with respect to users if the users' social information is taken into consideration. A similar approach was also explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Noll and Meinel, 2007)</ref> where the system performed re-ranking of Google search results based on social bookmarks and tags har- vested from del.icio.us 1 . However, the data sparsi- ty problem poses a challenge to this approach as not all Web pages returned by search engines are tagged in the del.icio.us dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Personalized Results Re-Ranking</head><p>Because of this problem, researchers started to use social data as a test collection to develop personal- ized techniques. In this way, personalization usu- ally involves two general approaches. The first approach submits a query into the collection but re-ranks the returned results based on an individu- al user profile. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Xu et al., 2008</ref>) the authors re- rank the results according to the topical relevance of documents and users' interests. <ref type="bibr">Carmel et al. (Carmel et al., 2009</ref>) investigated personalized results re-ranking based on the user's social rela- tions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wang and Jin (Wang and Jin, 2010</ref>) ex- plored gathering data from multiple online social systems for adaptive search personalization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bouadjenek et al. (Bouadjenek et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bouadjenek et al., 2013b)</ref> propose to use social data and user relationships to enhance document representation for re-ranking purposes. Though this group of work is attractive, if relevant items cannot be fetched in the first place, regardless of the complex re-ranking process, the results still tend to be unsatisfactory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Personalized Query Expansion</head><p>Another group of work modifies or augments a user's original query. This approach is termed query expansion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zhou et al., 2015)</ref>. Researchers have considered tag-tag relationships for personal- ized query expansion, by selecting the most relat- ed tags from a user's profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bender et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bertier et al., 2009)</ref>. However, tags cannot be re- lied upon to consistently provide precise descrip- tions of resources for use when searching. Local analysis and co-occurrence based user profile rep- resentation have also been adopted to expand the query ( <ref type="bibr">Chirita et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Biancalana and Micarelli, 2009)</ref>. However, the expansion terms are solely based on lexical matching between the query and the terms which exist in the user profile. Zhou et al. proposed a query expansion frame- work based on individual user profiles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhou et al., 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhou et al., 2012b</ref>). In their work, terms in the user profile are modeled according to their associations, which can be defined by co- occurrence statistics or defined by a tag-topic model. The method simultaneously incorporates annotations and web documents in a latent graph, regularized by terms extracted from the top- ranked documents.</p><p>However, all of the previously mentioned sys- tems consider constructing user profiles solely from past usage information. In contrast, in this paper we extend personalized web search using social data by exploiting an external knowledge base to enhance the user profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Problem Definition and Solution Over- view</head><p>In social annotation and bookmarking systems such as del.icio.us or CiteUlike 2 , users can label interesting web resources with primarily short and unstructured annotations in natural language called tags. These web resources are denoted as a URL in the del.icio.us website. Textual content can be crawled by following a URL that refers to a document or web page. Please refer to <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for the basic notations used in this paper. Formally, social tagging data can be represent- ed by a tuple Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â« â (Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â°, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â). Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â°ÃÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â²ÂÃÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ is a ternary relation, whose elements are called tag assignments or annotations (or bookmarks). The set of annotations of a user is defined as: Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! â {(Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â)|Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¢, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡ â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â}. The tag vocabulary of a user, is given as Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ ! â {Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡|(Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â) â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! }. A us- er's set of documents is Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! â {Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â|(Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â) â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! }. We define terms extracted from a user's set of documents as Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â ! â {Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤|Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤ â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! }, where Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤ denotes a word/term in the annotated docu- ments. Similarly, we define terms extracted from a user's set of external documents as Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¥Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â ! â {Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤|Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤ â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! } , where Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! denotes a user's set of external documents from an external corpus Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ . In a typical personalized search scenario, given a source query Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â and a set of words in the user profile {Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤ ! , Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤ ! â¦ Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¤ ! } the goal is to return a ranked list of profile terms to be added to the que- ry, for a second round retrieval of results.</p><p>Our personalization approach consists of three main steps (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>): Fetching external docu- ments; User profile modelling; and Personalized query expansion. We enhance a user's historical usage information in step one. We firstly concate- nate all tags Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡ in Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ ! into a query Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ ! (line 1). Then for each document Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â in Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! , we extract terms with the highest inverted document fre- quency (idf) scores as queries Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! (lines 2-3, with the EXTRACTTOP function returns top Î» terms). Next we send queries in Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â !"#!$ (Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ ! âª Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! ) to an external corpus Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ to fetch Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! together with their retrieval scores Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â± !,! (lines 5-7, the num- ber of documents retrieved by each query is con- trolled by the parameter Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â¾).</p><p>Step two integrates Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ ! (here all tags are concatenated and viewed as a single document), Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! , Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! and their retrieval scores Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â± !,! into a topic model such that a multi- nomial distribution of topics specific to each doc- ument can be inferred (lines 8-14, we eliminate the procedure for the SEUP model because its similarity to the simpler model, see the next sec- tion). In the last step, the algorithm uses the out- put of step two to build a topical query expansion model in order to expand the original query (lines 15-18). Note that step one and step two could be executed off-line so as to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Separated Enhanced User Profiling</head><p>In the MEUP model, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ ! , Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! and Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! are mixed together to infer unified latent topics. How- ever, the MEUP model may miss important in- formation when the topics are learned. Our SEUP model extends the MEUP model by learning top- ics which are shared between document-aligned pairs. In order to do this, we create pseudo-aligned documents between Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â¯ ! , Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â ! and Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! . This pro- cedure works as follows. For each external docu- ment in Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! retrieved by a query from Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â !"#!$ , which is formed through step one of our approach, we treat the document (from Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â²Â !"#!$ ! ) and the que- ry (from Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â !"#!$ ) as pseudo-aligned documents in two groups. The first group we named source group Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â° Â¶, the other group we named target group Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â°Â¸. By using the aligned documents, we propose a model to learn the latent topics between the two groups.</p><p>Note that in this case, there is a comparable document set aligned at the document-level. Therefore, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â can be viewed as a group inde- pendent factor, and shared among comparable aligned documents. Henceforth, the generation process for the SEUP model is slightly different from the MEUP model. The generative process is summarized below:</p><p>Generative process of the SEUP model Similar to the MEUP model, the updated for- mulas for Gibbs sampling for the SEUP model are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â± Â§ !,! ! = Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â !,!,Â¬! ! + Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â !,! ! + Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â¼ Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â !,â¢,Â¬! ! + Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â !,â¢ ! + Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â°Â¾ â¢ Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â¼ Ã Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â£ !,! !,! ! ,Â¬ ! + Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â½ Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â£ !,â¢,Â¬ ! + Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â ! â¢ Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â½ Ã 1 Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â± !,! !

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Evaluation</head><p>In the following section we describe experiments which have been designed to evaluate the pro- posed method. We start the section by discussing the experimental settings, and then we present and analyze the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>In order to evaluate the above proposed methods on real-world data, we selected two delicious da- tasets: socialbm0311 and deliciousT140, which are public, described and analyzed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zubiaga et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zubiaga et al., 2013)</ref>. The deliciousT140 dataset is made up by 144,574 unique URLs, all of them with their corresponding social tags re- trieved from del.icio.us. However, this dataset does not contain the actual web pages (i.e. docu- ments). So we used another socialbm0311 dataset. It contains the complete bookmarking activity for almost 2 million users. After matching the docu- ments in deliciousT140 with the bookmark activi- ties in socialbm0311, we obtained a total of 5,153,720 bookmark activities, 259,511 users, 131,283 web pages and 137,870 tags. We used a public parser 3 to parse the web pages in order to get their textual content.</p><p>We constructed two corpora from different ex- ternal knowledge bases. The first corpus was ob- tained from the largest encyclopedia -Wikipedia 4 . A Wikipedia snapshot was obtained on the 14/08/2014, which contained a collection of 4,634,369 articles. The second corpus consists of English news documents from the Glasgow Her- ald 1995, Los Angeles Times 1994 and Los Ange- les Times 2002, a collection made available by the CLEF AdHoc-News Test <ref type="bibr">Suites (2004</ref><ref type="bibr">Suites ( -2008</ref>  <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , which we refer to as CLEF. This collection con- tains 304,630 documents.</p><p>To investigate the effects of enhanced user pro- files, we selected two groups of users as test users. One group contains 1,000 randomly selected users with no more than 50 bookmarks (refer to as Us- er-SMALL) and another group contains 1,000 randomly selected users with more than 200 bookmarks (refer to as User-LARGE). These two groups of users represent users with small amount of and rich amount of past usage information re- spectively. The English terms were processed by down-casing the alphabetic characters, removing the stop words and stemming words using the Por ter stemmer. For each user, 75% of his/her tags with annotated web pages were used to create the user profile and the other 25% were used as a test collection.</p><p>The evaluation method used by previous re- searchers in personalized social search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Xu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wang and Jin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhou et al., 2012a</ref>) is employed. The main assumption is as follows: Any documents tagged by Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¢ with Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡ are considered relevant for the personalized query (Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¢, t) (Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¢ sub- mits the query Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â¡).</p><p>The following evaluation metrics were chosen to measure the effectiveness of the various ap- proaches: the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and mean average precision (MAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Voorhees, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">JÃ¤rvelin and KekÃ¤lÃ¤inen, 2000</ref>). The average per- formance over all users is calculated. Statistically significant differences were determined using a paired t-test at a confidence level of 95%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Experimental Runs</head><p>The proposed approach is applied to social search personalization through the means of query ex- pansion. We evaluate our proposed models and compare with several state-of-the-art methods as follows. LM A popular and quite robust language model retrieval method which has previously demon- strated good results <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zhai and Lafferty, 2001</ref>). We compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the query and document language mod- el as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zhai and Lafferty, 2001)</ref>. LMRM A relevance model involves pseudo- relevance feedback in the language model as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Lavrenko and Croft, 2001)</ref>. We include this model as a competitive non-personalized query expansion baseline. LMRM-external This is a modified version of the relevance model as described in <ref type="bibr">(Diaz and Metzler, 2006</ref>). Instead of using the top-ranked documents as pseudo-relevance documents, this model uses external corpora to obtain the rele- vance documents. We include this model as a strong non-personalized baseline as we also used external corpora in our models. In the ex- periments, this method will acquire external documents from the Wikipedia corpus and CLEF. Co-occur This method has been used by several researchers. In this method the selection of ex- pansion terms is based on their co-occurrence statistics with the query terms and other terms inside the user model. We used this approach as previously it demonstrated satisfactory perfor- mance as in ( <ref type="bibr">Chirita et al., 2007</ref>). Co-tag Pure tag-tag relationships are also fa- vored by many researchers. This method is based on the co-tagging activities a user per- formed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bender et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bertier et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bouadjenek et al., 2011</ref>). In this case, the user profiles contain training tags with their co- tagging statistics computed using the Jaccard coefficient. Tag-topic-regu <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhou et al. (Zhou et al., 2012a)</ref> proposed a query expansion framework based on regularizing the smoothness of word associa- tions over a connected graph using terms ex- tracted from top-ranked documents. The user profiles are built according to a Tag-Topic mod- el in a latent graph. We include the highest per- forming method from their work for comparison. MEUP From our proposed methods, the MEUP method using the MEUP model and the topical query expansion method for social web search. SEUP This is our alternative proposed method, by using the SEUP model and the topical query expansion method to personalize search. The number of documents retrieved by each query in step one is set to Î³ = 5 empirically. Pa- rameter Î» used in the EXTRACTTOP function is set to 10. For the EUP modeling, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â¼ and Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â½ were set to 50/Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â°Â¾ and 0.01. In the expansion method, the number of expansion terms Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â¿ are set to 5. All the parameters in the other baseline models are set according to their tuning procedures in the origi- nal papers</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Results</head><p>Firstly we examine the experimental results that describe the performance of the proposed methods in this paper together with three non-personalized baselines on the overall test users, which are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The statistically significant dif- ferences are marked as l and w with respect to the LMRM and LMRM-external baselines as the- se two methods work better than the simpler LM method. As illustrated by the results, the LM model was the lowest performer for all evaluation metrics for two groups of users. This result shows that merely borrowing common lexical-matching techniques from traditional information retrieval will not solve the personalized search problem. With the help of pseudo-relevance feedback, the LMRM and LMRM-external methods work consistently better than the LM baseline. This demonstrates the power of query expansion. Spe- cifically, the technique that explores external cor- pora to obtain the relevant documents works bet- ter than the method which simply uses top-ranked documents. The results are consistent with previ- ous research <ref type="bibr">(Diaz and Metzler, 2006</ref>). The im- provements are more noticeable when using Wik- ipedia as the external corpus. However, all the non-personalized baselines are outperformed by the personalized approaches including our pro- posed methods MEUP and SEUP, all with statis- tically significant results. This illustrates that non- personalized query expansion methods can only bring limited improvements while methods with additional terms from the user profiles can greatly improve retrieval effectiveness.</p><p>Next we evaluate the performance of the pro- posed methods compared to several personalized baselines that use only the users' past information for query expansion, i.e. Co-occur, Co-tag and Tag-topic-regu methods.</p><p>As seen from <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, three conclusions emerge. First, MEUP and SEUP both outper- form all personalization methods previously pro- posed, in all metrics measured with two external corpora for both groups of users. Moreover, the difference between our proposed methods and the baseline runs is always significant. We believe that the strong performance of our methods is due to the fact that our methods do not only consider a user's past usage information, but also uses an external knowledge base to enhance the user pro- filing process. Secondly, the SEUP method works consistently better than the MEUP method. This result confirms that merely mixing the doc- uments from the historical evidence and external knowledge bases will miss some important infor- mation. By treating the documents as a pseudo- aligned corpus, we obtain much better perfor- mance. The highest improvement over the best performing run reaches 54.95% (in terms of the SEUP method with the MRR metric when com- pared to Tag-topic-regu by using Wikipedia as the external corpus in the User-SMALL group). Third, further improvements are achieved by us-  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Overall results, statistically significant differences between our methods and LMRM, LMRM- External, Co-occur, Co-tag, Tag-topic-regu are indicated by l, w, o, t, r respectively. ing Wikipedia as the external corpus rather than using the CLEF collection. The possible reason, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Diaz and Metzler (Diaz and Metzler, 2006</ref>), is that an external corpus is likely to be a better source of expansion terms if it has better topic coverage over the target corpus. The results also show that the improvements over baseline models in the User-SMALL group are more noticeable than in the User-LARGE group. However, the differences are small. This result confirms that our methods work well both for us- ers with small amounts, and those with rich amounts of past usage information. We now examine the effect of the performance of the number of latent topics used in MEUP and SEUP. We vary the number of topics in both methods from 5 to 30, the results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, using Wikipedia as the external corpus in the user-SMALL group (we eliminated other results as they gave similar results). As can be seen from the figure, the highest performance is reached when the number of latent topics is 20 in MEUP and 25 in SEUP. When the number of topics continues to grow, the performance starts to degrade. However, even the lowest scored run still outperformed the strongest baseline. By varying the topic numbers, SEUP still outperforms MEUP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we tackle the challenge of personal- ized web search using social data in a novel way by building enhanced user profiles from the anno- tations and resources the user has marked, togeth- er with an external knowledge base. We present two probabilistic latent models to simultaneously incorporate social annotations, documents and the external knowledge base. In addition, we intro- duce a topical query expansion model to enhance the search by utilizing individual user profiles. The proposed methods performed well on the so- cial data crawled from the web, delivering statisti- cally significant improvements over non- personalized and personalized representative base- line systems by constructing user profiles from a user's historical usage information only. It is also confirmed that our proposed methods work well for both active and less active users. In future re- search, we aim to automatically estimate the num- ber of topics to be used in the EUP models. We also plan to explore the use of more external re- sources and novel latent semantic models to en- hance performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>!"#!$ Output: An expanded query Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±Ââ² /* step one: External documents fetch */ 1.
