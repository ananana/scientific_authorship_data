				<p>Target entity disambiguation (TED), the task of identifying target entities of the same domain, has been recognized as a critical step in various important applications. In this paper, we propose a graph-based model called TremenRank to collectively identify target entities in short texts given a name list only. TremenRank propagates trust within the graph, allowing for an arbitrary number of target entities and texts using inverted index technology. Furthermore , we design a multi-layer directed graph to assign different trust levels to short texts for better performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average gain of 24.8% in accuracy and 15.2% in the F1-measure on three datasets in different domains.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Currently, a growing number of people prefer to express their views and comments online. These messages, which are updated at the rate of mil- lions per day, become a potentially rich source of information. From such a large number of texts, entity disambiguation is a critical step when ex- tracting text information from these messages, and for various applications, such as natural language processing and knowledge acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dredze et al., 2010)</ref>. Take the application of customer feed- back analysis (CFA) as an example. An enterprise is typically interested in public reviews of its own products as well as those of its competitors'; the identification of these entities is thus critical for further analysis.</p><p>The product names comprise a list of entities to be identified. We refer to these entities of the same domain as target entities, and the identifica- tion process is called target entity disambigua- tion ( ). All of target entities (e.g., car brands) share a common domain, which we re- fer to as the target domain. The target domain is the only constraint to target entities, which implies that the entities are in a specific domain, rather than being general things. In the case of entity recognition from short texts, the disambiguation can be performed on the document level. Given a collection of short documents, our goal is to deter- mine which documents contain the target entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenge and Related Work</head><p>In contrast to traditional entity disambiguation tasks, TED in short texts can require as little in- formation as a name list. There are three types of information that are utilized in Named Entity Dis- ambiguation related tasks: knowledge resources, the context in which a target word occurs and sta- tistical information <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Navigli, 2009)</ref>. However, the lack of the first two types of information makes this problem more challenging.</p><p>Knowledge Sparsity A large number of meth- ods focus on using knowledge bases (KBs) like Wikipedia or YAGO to enrich the named enti- ties (e.g., in-links and out-links) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hoffart et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bunescu and Pasca, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Milne and Witten, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kulkarni et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shen et al., 2012</ref>). These methods compared the context of the enti- ties and their reference pages in the KBs through a similarity measurement. However, we tested 32 d- ifferent names of General Motors (GM) car brand- s, and only four of the brands exist in Wikipedi- a. This circumstance is not unusual. For another larger dataset that included 2468 stock names, we found only 340 of them had their reference pages in Wikipedia. Thus, the methods that rely heavily on KBs might not be appropriate here.</p><p>Shortness of the Texts The context in which a target entity occurs plays an important role in dis- ambiguation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cassidy et al., 2012;</ref> applied the underlying topical coherence informa- tion to a set of mentions for entity linking. In ( , mentionRank leverages some additional features, such as co-mention; however, people prefer to share their comments in brief or even informal words on social media platforms, such as Twitter, which becomes increasingly im- portant as an information source. We have count- ed 350,498 microblogs, 37,379 tweets and 34,018 text snippets in various domains in Chinese and English from Twitter, Sina Weibo and Google. Af- ter preprocessing, their average length are 16, 5 and 11 words, respectively. To alleviate the short- ness issue, additional information has been used to expand the context, such as the user's interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shen et al., 2013</ref>) and related documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guo et al., 2013</ref>). Such information is still sparse or un- available in this case, and thus, the existing meth- ods might not be suitable.</p><p>Large Scale Hundreds of millions of tweets are posted daily on Twitter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Liu et al., 2013)</ref>. When scaling to a large document collection, the disam- biguation task becomes increasingly important as the ambiguity increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cucerzan, 2007)</ref>. Men- tionRank, the only state-of-the-art method for T- ED, is a graph-based model that focuses on a s- mall set of entities (e.g., 50 or 100 entities) and conducts experiments on thousands of documents ( ). However, the graph has a quadratic growth as the number of documents in- creases. In our experiments, a dataset that includ- ed 2,468 target entities and 350,498 microblogs generated a directed graph with billions of edges, which required more computer memory than was available even when using a sparse matrix. There- fore, the scalability remains a challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions</head><p>To address these challenges, we propose a collective method called TremenRank to disam- biguate the target entities simultaneously. The main idea is to propagate trust within a graph based on our observations that true mentions are more similar in context than false mentions in a specific domain. Specifically, inverted indexes is used to construct the graph locally that allows for an arbitrary number of target entities and docu- ments. Furthermore, a multi-layer directed graph is designed to assign different trust levels to doc- uments, which significantly improves the perfor- mance. The contributions of our work can be sum- marized as follows:</p><p>• We propose a novel graph-based method, TremenRank, to collectively identify target entities in short texts. This method construct- s the graph locally to avoid storing the entire graph in memory, which provides a linear s- cale up with respect to the number of target entities and documents.</p><p>• We design a multi-layer directed (MLD) graph for modeling short texts that pos- sess different trust levels during propaga- tion, which significantly improves the perfor- mance.</p><p>• We conduct a series of experiments on three practical datasets from different domains.</p><p>The experimental results demonstrate that TremenRank has a similar performance to the state-of-the-art when addressing the TED problem at a large scale, and the use of MLD graph significantly improves our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Problem Definition</head><p>Example Suppose that GM wants to collect tweets that talk about its cars. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we take (i) a list of car brands (target entities), and (i- i) a collection of tweets (i.e., short texts) as inputs. "Car" is the target domain, and "Sonic" appears in documents d 1 and d 2 , which can be character- ized as two mentions and the latter is a true men- tion. The goal is to find as many true mentions as possible.</p><p>Our method models the collection of documents as a directed graph and outputs a trust score for each document via propagation. The trust score indicates the likelihood of a document containing a true mention. For flexibility, the trust scores lie within the range of 0 to 1 and are globally comparable; thus, we can obtain the top-k doc- uments or choose an appropriate cut-off value to balance the precision and recall for different ap- plication requirements. For example, in the appli- cation of CFA, a company expects a higher recall to achieve a comprehensive understanding of its product, whereas a recommendation system must provide as many precise microblogs as possible.</p><p>Formally, the problem of TED in short texts is defined as follows:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target Entity Disambiguation in Short Texts</head><p>Given a list of target entities E = {e i |i = 1, . . . , m}, and a collection of text documents</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D = {d j |j = 1, . . . , n}, E d j = {e j 1 , . . . , e j k } is the set of target entities contained in d j . The goal is to output the trust score r j ∈ [0, 1] for each doc- ument d j ∈ D.</formula><p>All the target entities in E d j share the same trust score r j .</p><p>All of the mentions in one document have the same score because they share a common context. In the graph, the context similarity between doc- uments is computed and used as the edges nor- mally, where the width of the context window that surround the target entity in the document is typ- ically chosen to be 10, 20 or 50 words. Howev- er, the documents considered here are limited in length, and a user seldom changes the topic in so few words; thus, we regard the entire document as the context of its target entities. When multiple target entities occur in one document, all of them are more likely to refer to the entities in the target domain. Thus, the trust score for the document is higher, as indicated by d 4 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>The only constraint for the target entities is that they are in the same target domain. This constraint is reasonable in practice. The majority of applica- tions identify a set of entities in one domain at a time. For example, a computer company focuses its attentions on the brands in the computer area, whereas an investment company is mainly inter- ested in stocks. Additionally, even if the target domain is general and contains several small do- mains, an intuitive solution is to split it into sev- eral subproblems, where each subproblem focuses on the target entities in one small domain. Then, the task can be achieved by solving the subprob- lems individually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our Approach</head><p>TremenRank is a graph-based method that identi- fies target entities collectively. It propagates trust scores on the graph where each vertex denotes one document and an edge indicates the similarity be- tween them. Considering the large scale of the problem, we obtain the neighbors of one vertex when propagating by searching two indexes in- stead of storing the entire graph in memory. This approach allows an arbitrary number of target en- tities and documents to be processed. To further improve the performance, a multi-layer directed graph is designed to treat the documents at differ- ent trust levels based on prior estimations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Hypotheses</head><p>The documents within a domain share the char- acteristic of unitary similarity. This characteristic implies that all of the true mentions have a sim- ilar context due to the target domain constraint and that false mentions are distinct because their meanings belong to diversified domains. We in- vestigated the ambiguity of 2468 stock names (tar- get entities in experiments), and manually labeled 301 of those names. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, there are many different meanings for these names out- side of the target domain, such as plant, bank, me- dia and animal. The distribution of meanings are long-tailed; thus, we gathered a group of meanings together (the class "others").</p><p>Based on the statistical results, we can make the following hypotheses:</p><p>• The context of true mentions are similar to one another.</p><p>• The context of a false mention is different from any of the true mention.</p><p>• False mentions have distinct contexts across different entities.</p><p>For example, the true mentions in d 2 , d 4 and d 6 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) describe car brands of GM and share common pieces of text: "drive" or "Chevrolet". However, "sonic", "express" and "spark" in d 1 , d 3 and d 5 are all false mentions; in their contexts, they refer to sound, giving opinions, and a small amount of fire, respectively. These false mentions are different in context from one another and from any true mention.</p><p>The assumptions resemble the main insight of MentionRank except the co-mention (multiple en- tities occur in one document). Co-mention sel- dom happens in short texts, and can be treated as the same because they share a common con- text. In conclusion, the assumptions suggest that a collective method could perform better than a method that disambiguates entities separately, be- cause more comprehensive information on the en- tities from multiple "collaborators" (i.e., the men- tions have similar contexts) has been used ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen and Ji, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kulkarni et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fernandez et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cucerzan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ratinov et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kozareva et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dalton and Dietz, 2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Graph-based Method</head><p>Based on these assumptions, we build a graph to represent the documents and their relations, and we perform a TrustRank-like algorithm on the graph. We are given a graph G = (V, E) that con- sists of a set V of N documents (vertices) and a set E of directed edges, where each edge</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(d i , d j ) ∈ E denotes that d i points to d j , and o(d i ) is the out- neighbors of d i .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Similarity Measurement</head><p>We constructed the edges of the graph accord- ing to the similarity relations between docu- ments. Most similarity measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Artiles et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Miller, 1995)</ref> could be used in the pro- posed method. After some exploration, we found that Jaccard similarity performs better. It can be efficiently calculated through simple set opera- tions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ω J ij = J(d i , d j ) = W d i W d j W d i W d j<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ω J ij denotes the weight of edge (d i , d j ) us- ing Jaccard similarity, and W d i is the set of words contained in d i . ω ij varies from 0 to 1, where a val- ue closer to 1 indicates that its two nodes are more similar. We link only similar nodes by choosing an appropriate threshold η. In other words, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(d i , d j ) ∈ E, only if ω J ij &gt; η.</formula><p>This is the founda- tion to construct the graph locally using inverted indexes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Inverted Index</head><p>When the scale becomes excessively large, such as the 350,000 pieces in our dataset, the number of edges will increase into the billions, produc- ing computational and storage-based difficulties. Considering that the propagation begins with doc- ument d i and that we are required to find all of its out-neighbors o(d i ) through a traversal of the entire dataset, then the complexity is O(n 2 ). Al- ternatively, we can represent the entire graph with a matrix; however, its billions of elements would be difficult to store and calculate.</p><p>To address the large scale problem, we con- struct the graph locally via inverted index tech- nology. During propagation, the neighbors of the documents are obtained by searching the in- dexes in real time. Two types of indexes are used: the document-to-word index and the word- to-document index. The former index records W d i of each document d i ∈ D; the latter index record- s the occurrence of each word D w k = {d j |w k ∈ W }, where W = {w 1 , . . . , w N } is the word dic- tionary. Combining these two indexes, the total out-neighbors of a document can be obtained in constant time as follows:</p><p>1. Obtain all of the words W d i of d i via search- ing the document-to-word index. 2. Find the occurrences of each word w k ∈ W d i in the word-to-document index: </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D d i = {d j | ∪ wt∈W d i D wt }. Each document d j ∈ D d i</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">ω J ij = f ij |W d i | + |W d j | − f ij<label>(2)</label></formula><p>4. Calculate the similarity weight. We obtain the out-neighbors o(d i ) = {d j |ω J ij ≥ η}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Trust Propagation</head><p>Similar to TrustRank, an individual documen- t propagates the trust score to its neighbors and those who have more neighbors will receive more trust. Intuitively, trust attenuates along the edge. There are several ways for attenuation to take place, such as trust dampening, trust splitting, and a combination of them ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gyöngyi et al., 2004</ref>). For example, each document d i ∈ D has a trust score r i , and its out-neighbors obtain α · r i (or r i |o(d i )| ) through trust dampening (or splitting). We adopt the third method, in which a document dampens its split trust with the attenuation coefficient α.</p><p>The final trust score is determined by two parts: the trust from a document's neighbors and its pri- or estimation. Then, TremenRank can iteratively propagate via the following function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r i = α · o(d i ) r j |o(d j )| + (1 − α) · T (d i )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where T (d i ) is the prior estimation of the docu- ment d i and is a constant during iterative propaga- tion. Here we simply assign a uniform distribution to all of the documents T (d i ) = 1 |D| . A more pre- cise estimation will be discussed later.</p><p>At the beginning of the propagation, we initial- ize the trust scores of the documents with the pri- or estimation. Then, the trust scores of the docu- ments are updated iteratively until convergence 1 . True mentions receive high scores because they are likely to connect with more trustworthy doc- uments and thus receive more trust through the first term in Equation 3. In contrast, false men- tions are dissimilar to most other documents; thus, their scores gradually attenuate (the second term in Equation 3). These scores are globally compa- rable. One can normalize the final scores by di- viding them by the largest score, but the relative ordering of the documents will not change. Thus, one document that is more likely to contain any <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We select the attenuation coefficient α = 0.85 and the number of iterations to be 20, which have been regarded as the standards in the PageRank literature( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Page et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Krishnan and Raj, 2006</ref>). Our experiments also show that 20 iterations are sufficient to achieve convergence. true mention will receive a higher trust score and be ranked higher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Multi-layer Directed Graph</head><p>During propagation, all of the documents are ini- tialized with the same trust score and attenuate their trust at the same level. However, different documents should be treated differently. For ex- ample, the tweet "I drive a big car suburban" is more trustworthy than "doctors use GMC report system to process harmful patients", because the former tweet contains the credible context feature "car", which is the name of the target domain. The latter clearly irrelevant text should not be trusted or even be regarded as noise. In this subsection, we first discuss how to make more precise prior esti- mation of documents based on some of the charac- teristics of the target domain. Additionally, based on the prior estimation, an MLD graph is built to assign different trust levels to the documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Prior Estimation</head><p>Ideally, a true mention is similar to true mentions only. To take advantage of the approximate isola- tion of true mentions, we first extract a set of true mentions to start the propagation. The documents that contain these true mentions are called seeds.</p><p>Formally, the entire set of documents D is divided into two groups: (i) the seed set D s = {d 1 , . . . , d s }, and (ii) a subset D * = {d s+1 , . . . , d n }. We estimate a prior trust score for each document via the function T :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">T (d i ) = 1− |D * | d i ∈ D * , |D s | d i ∈ D s .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where |D s | and |D * | represent the size of the two sets for normalization. ∈ (0, 1] is used for s- moothing and indicates the likelihood that we can trust the seeds that actually contain true mentions.</p><p>In the experiments, we set = 0.9 based on the accuracy of the seeds extraction method. There are several methods for extracting seed- s, such as manual annotation and pattern-based method. Patterns could be easily derived from the characteristics of the target domain, such as the domain name, product type or unique ID 2 . These methods can typically identify entities with a high accuracy, but their low recall limits the portion of true mentions that can be found. We use the result- s of the pattern-based method as our seeds, which have an accuracy higher than 90%. We do not present the experimental results here due to space limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Graph Construction</head><p>The similarity measurement does not consider di- rections, and thus, the documents are mutually connected. In this section, we construct a layered structure in the graph, where each layer denotes a document trust level that contains any true men- tion. Thus, we define that the propagation direc- tion from the high trust level to the low trust level. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows an example of an MLD graph. The blue nodes of the seeds in the top layer are the most trustworthy, and the other white nodes in the higher layer are less similar to the seeds which implies that they are at lower trust levels. Thus, as we move farther away from the seeds, trust atten- uates at a constant speed α along with the layers. The nodes in the same layer are also connected. </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D = { ¯ d j | ¯ d j / ∈ D l , l ≥ 0}</formula><p>are not connected. To simplify our no- tation, the seeds are set to be in layer 0. Note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(∩ l≥0 D l ) ∩ ¯ D = D.</formula><p>TremenRank is different from the standard TrustRank and MentionRank in several respect- s. First, TremenRank is designed to process short texts at a large scale. Second, through a well- designed MLD graph, we consider documents to consist of different trust levels rather than be repre- sented by a unified distribution. Third, TrustRank Algorithm 1: Construction of an MLD graph.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Input: D s , D * , η, indexes W D , D W Output: G Initialize seeds in layer l = 0, ¯ D = D * ; foreach layer l ≥ 0 do Find the out-neighbors of D l from ¯ D; foreach document d l i ∈ D l do put o(d l i ) in the next layer D l+1 ; update ¯ D = ¯ D − D l+1 ; end if | ¯ D| = 0 or |D l+1 | = 0 then break; else l = l + 1; end end</formula><p>randomly samples a set of seeds and checks them manually, which limits the number of seeds avail- able; however, the proposed method extracts the seeds automatically and uses large amounts of seeds to produce better prior estimations. Final- ly, disambiguation occurs at the document level in the proposed method; we assign the same scores to the entities that occur in one document, because they typically share common context features in short texts.</p></div>

Car -We collected 32 car brands of General Motors and a group of tweets that contain at least one mention of these brands via the Twitter API. In the seeds extraction step, we use the domain name "car" as the patterns.</p><p>3. Herb -We randomly selected 1,119 Chinese herb names and collected 40 pieces of text descrip- tions in the search results per entity from Google. To extract the seeds, we simply added the domain name to the key words (e.g., "UÁ(Worms) ¥ú †(Chinese Medical Herb)").  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> shows some of the statistics of the datasets created. We chose these datasets because (i) the identification of entities in these domains meets the practical requirements of many applica- tions, (ii) the target entities are ambiguous and (iii) there is little information in the existing KBs. Be- fore applying TremenRank, we preprocessed the plain texts through word segmentation, low fre- quency words filtering and stop words filtering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experiment</head><p>Baseline Methods TED in short texts is a relative- ly new problem, and there are few specific meth- ods for solving it. To validate the performance of TremenRank and the improvement produced by the MLD graph, we selected the baseline from three different perspectives: (i) a context-based method that identifies target entities separately; (i- i) a classic supervised method SVM to classify a document by whether it contains any true mention- s; and (iii) the only state-of-the-art MentionRank for TED, which is a collective ranking method.</p><p>• The Context-based method mines a fre- quent item set of true mentions and identi- fies the documents that contain more frequent items.</p><p>• SVM classifies the documents into two class- es: documents that are in the target domain and those that are not. Using context word- s as features, we train and test SVM on the labeled set with a 10-fold cross validation.</p><p>• MentionRank is a graph-based method that disambiguates at the entity level. Difficult to apply to the entire large datasets directly, it has been applied to the labeled set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation Metrics</head><p>The performance of the dis- ambiguation task is typically evaluated by accura- cy, but in TEDs we are also interested in precision, recall and the F1-measure because different appli- cations focus on different aspects. For example, in the application of CFA, a company expects a high- er recall to collect as many reviews as possible, while in financial news recommendations, users prefer to read more accurate microblogs. Because the entire dataset is too large to evaluate direct- ly, we randomly sampled 800 mentions for each dataset and labelled them manually to calculate the performance metrics <ref type="bibr">5</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Analysis</head><p>The overall performances of TremenRank and those of the baseline methods on all of the datasets are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. The following is indicated in the results:</p><p>• TremenRank+MLD outperforms all of the baselines with all of the datasets, because it collectively identifies target entities and treats the documents differently based on a precise prior estimation.</p><p>• The collective methods tend to perform bet- ter. Although, on the Car dataset, SVM achieves the second best performance, the use of MLD graph in TremenRank outper- forms all of the methods tested. This is because false mentions that occupy a large proportion of the dataset produce too much noise, whose negative impacts can be reduced through the train set in the supervised method or a precise prior estimations.</p><p>• Compared with MentionRank, TremenRank processes a larger number of entities and documents while achieving a similar per- formance. Combined with a MLD graph, TremenRank shows significant improve- ments including an average gain of 24.8% in accuracy and 15.2% in the F1-measure on the three datasets.</p><p>We also investigate the influence of the main el- ements in TremenRank below.</p><p>Similarity Threshold Different similarity thresh- olds result in various structures of the MLD graph, and have a great impact on the performance of our  The performance of TremenRank is showed on the top, and the bottom is the corresponding graph structure represented by two factors: the graph coverage and the number of layers. We can see that precision increases until it becomes steady with the growth of η, and other measure- ments reach their peaks when η = 0.1. This is in accordance with the change of the graph structure. On one hand, the number of lay- ers l declines sharply when η is less than 0.1, this indicates little difference in the trust level of doc- uments in the propagation. On the other hand, our method has no effect on the vertices outside of the graph, so the performance is directly proportional to the graph coverage rate. Therefore, a proper η should ensure a high coverage as well as adequate layers. In experiments, we choose η as 0.1, 0.15, 0.1 for the datasets of Stock, Car and Herb respec- tively.</p><p>Influence of the Seed Scale As the basis of the prior estimation, the seeds have significant influ- ence on the performance of the proposed method via the MLD graph. Intuitively, a larger set of seeds should lead to a more precise estimation and thus better performance. In the experiments on the Car and Herb datasets, we split their seed set into ten parts, and add one part each time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">As Fig- ure 5</ref> shows, when increasing the percentage of the seeds gradually, the performance has an over- all upward trend (e.g., a 14.6% and 4.4% gain in the F1-measure for the Car and Herb datasets, re- spectively). This trend occurs because the poten- tial context features of the seeds utilized for prop- agation increase as the absolute number of seed documents rises. For example, the tweet "Cadil- lac Uber airport is classy" obtains a low score of 0.013 with 50% of the seeds, whereas it is identi- fied successfully with the score of 0.588 when all of the seeds are used for propagation because more context features are introduced, such as "airport" and "Uber". Thus, the proposed method achieves better performance as the seed set grows. This ar- rangement is helpful for a company that seldom changes its business area and then accumulates seeds continuously to improve performance. robustness of our method with respect to the qual- ity of the seeds. We randomly sample documents outside of the seed set (considered as noise) to re- place 20% of the seeds on all the datasets; these re- sults are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The introduced noise only leads to a limited decrease in performance (average 1.3%, 1% and 1% in the F1), which is much better than when only using TremenRank <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 2</ref>). More specifically, the experiments that use artificial noise occasionally achieve a high- er recall (e.g., on the Stock dataset); this result could occur because the unknown true mentions add some useful edges to the graph, which is help- ful when finding more true mentions of the target entities.</p><p>Cut-off Value According to the globally compa- rable trust scores, we can (i) rank all of the doc- uments, and trade off the performance metrics by choosing an appropriate cut-off value γ for various applications, or (ii) rank the documents of an indi- vidual entity separately and obtain its top-k men- tions.</p><p>In the experiments, we set γ as different per- centage of the ranked documents. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref> shows, the recommendation system could use γ = 30% to achieve a 93.2% precision and a 64.2% re- call, or a company could use γ = 60% for more reviews that have a relatively high precision.</p><p>Efficiency We implemented TremenRank in Java and ran it on a single PC with the Windows 8.1 64- bit operation system. With an Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3240 (3.40GHz) CPU and 4GB memory, our program converges within 5 iterations, and on- ly consumes approximately 700MB of memory when running steadily. The overall identification times of the Stock, Car and Herb datasets are 12h, 5min and 18min, respectively. The computation time increases exponentially with the increase of the amount of data due to the excessive computa- tions required to search the indexes, which can be optimized in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we addressed a new and increasing- ly important problem in social content analysis in a challenging scenario: disambiguation of a list of homogenous entities in short texts using names only. We proposed a graph-based method called TremenRank to identify target entities collective- ly; this method can also hold an arbitrary number of target entities and documents. The performance of this method can be further improved via a well- designed MLD graph. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a significant improvement compared to other approaches.</p><p>In the future, we are interested in refining the prior estimation by using the ontology and extend- ing this work to detect the target entities that are not in a list while performing the disambiguation task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Illustration of TED.
