				<p>Previous work on automatic summarization does not thoroughly consider coherence while generating the summary. We introduce a graph-based approach to summarize scientific articles. We employ coherence patterns to ensure that the generated summaries are coherent. The novelty of our model is twofold: we mine coherence patterns in a corpus of abstracts , and we propose a method to combine coherence, importance and non-redundancy to generate the summary. We optimize these factors simultaneously using Mixed Integer Programming. Our approach significantly outper-forms baseline and state-of-the-art systems in terms of coherence (summary coherence assessment) and relevance (ROUGE scores).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The growth in the scientific output of many differ- ent fields makes the task of automatic summariza- tion imperative. Automatic summarizers assist re- searchers to have an informative and coherent gist of long scientific articles. An automatic summarizer produces summaries considering three properties: Importance: The summary should contain the im- portant information of the input document. Non-redundancy: The summary should contain non-redundant information. The information should be diverse in the summary.</p><p>Coherence: Though the summary should comprise diverse and important information of the input doc- ument, its sentences should be connected to one an- other such that it becomes coherent and easy to read.</p><p>If we do not ensure that a summary is coher- ent, its sentences may not be properly connected. This results in an obscure summary. In previous work coherence has not been thoroughly considered.  use single sentence con- nectivity in the input document as a coherence mea- sure. They measure coherence by calculating the outdegree of a sentence in a graph representation of an input document. This has two disadvantages: first, since it is computed only based on one sen- tence, it is not sufficient to generate coherent sum- maries; second, it is obtained based on sentence con- nectivity in the input document rather than in the summary.</p><p>In this work, we focus on the coherence aspect of summarization. We use discourse entities as the unit of information that relate sentences. Here, discourse entities are referred to as head nouns of noun phrases (see Section 2). The main goal is to extract sentences which refer to those entities which are important and unique, and also to entities which connect the ex- tracted sentences in a coherent manner. Entities in connected sentences can be used to create linguis- tically motivated coherence patterns <ref type="bibr">(Daneš, 1974)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mesgar and Strube (2015)</ref> modeled these coherence patterns by subgraphs of the graph repre- sentation (nodes represent sentences and edges rep- resent entity connections among sentences) of doc- uments. They show that the frequency of coherence patterns can be used as features for coherence.</p><p>The key idea of this paper is to apply coherence patterns to long scientific articles to extract (possi- bly) non-adjacent sentences which, however, are al- ready coherent. Based on the assumption that ab- </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S3 Urban environments and associated lifestyles, including diets high in salt, sugar, and fat, and physical inactivity, have been widely implicated as leading causes of the rise in cardiometabolic diseases.</head><p>S4 If and how these changes affect the health of rural residents, however, remains poorly understood. stracts of scientific articles are similar in style to co- herent summaries, we obtain coherence patterns by analyzing a corpus of abstracts of articles from bio- medicine (PubMed corpus). Then we apply the most frequent coherence patterns to input documents, i.e. long scientific articles from bio-medicine (PLOS Medicine dataset), extract corresponding sentences to generate coherent summaries, and evaluate them by comparing with summaries written by a PLOS Medicine editor. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the extraction of sentences from an input document <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1, (ii)</ref>) which constitute a coherence pattern <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1, (i)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5 Existing research on lifestyle risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases has almost exclusively focused on exposures</head><p>If we overlay the input document with coherence patterns and extract the sentences which constitute those patterns, then the extracted sentences are al- ready coherent. We also take into account impor- tance and non-redundancy. We capture all three fac- tors in an objective function maximized by Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) (Section 2).</p><p>We evaluate our method on two different datasets: PLOS Medicine (  and DUC 2002. We extract frequent coherence patterns from all abstracts in the PubMed corpus, and gen- erate summaries of unseen scientific articles of the PLOS Medicine dataset (Section 3.1). For DUC 2002 we extract coherence patterns from the human summaries <ref type="bibr">of DUC 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dang, 2005</ref>. We evaluate our model on DUC 2002 to compare with state-of- the-art systems.</p><p>Our experimental results show that using coher- ence patterns for summarization produces more in- formative (but not redundant) and coherent sum- maries as compared to several baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods based on ROUGE scores and human judgements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head><p>We solve the task of creating coherent summaries by employing coherence patterns. We tightly integrate determining importance, non-redundancy and co- herence by applying global optimization, i.e., MIP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Document Representation</head><p>We use the entity graph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guinaudeau and Strube, 2013)</ref> to represent scientific articles. The entity graph is a bipartite graph which consists of entities and sentences as two disjoint sets of nodes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>, ii). Entity nodes are connected only with sentence nodes and not among each other. An entity node is connected with a sentence node if and only if the en- tity is present in the sentence. Entities are the head nouns of noun phrases.</p><p>We perform a one-mode projection on sentence nodes to create a directed one-mode projection graph <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2, iii)</ref>. Two sentence nodes in the one- mode projection graph are connected if they share at least one entity in the entity graph. Edge directions encode the sentence order in the input document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Mining Coherence Patterns</head><p>We use one-mode projection graphs of abstracts in the PubMed corpus (see Section 3.1) to mine coher- ence patterns. The weight of a coherence pattern, weight(pat u ), is its frequency in the PubMed cor- pus normalized by the maximum number of its oc- currence in abstracts in the PubMed corpus (Equa- tion 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">weight(pat u ) = q k=1 f req(pat u , g k ) max q k=1 f req(pat u , g k ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where q is the number of graphs associated with ab- stracts in the corpus, and g k represents the graph of the k th abstract in the PubMed corpus.  The weights of the coherence patterns are not on the same scale. We normalize the weights using the standard score</p><p>x−µ σ , where µ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation. A sigmoid function scales weights to the interval [0, 1].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Summary Generation</head><p>We maximize importance, non-redundancy and pattern-based coherence with their respective weights λ to generate coherent summaries. The objective function is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">max(λ I f I (S) + λ R f R (E) + λ C f C (P )), (2)</formula><p>where S is a set of binary variables for sentences in an article, E is a set of binary variables for entities and P is a set of binary variables for coherence pat- terns. Importance (f I (S)): The importance function quantifies the overall importance of information in the summary, which is calculated by considering the ranks of selected sentences for the summary:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f I (S) = n i=1 Rank(sent i ) · s i .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In Equation 3, Rank (sent i ) represents the rank of sentence sent i and s i is the binary variable of sen- tence sent i . n is the number of sentences. Kleinberg (1999) develops the Hubs and Author- ities algorithm (HITS) to rank web pages. He di- vides web pages into two sets: Hubs, pages which contain links to informative web pages, and Author- ities, informative web pages. Here, Hubs are entities and Authorities are sentences. We calculate the rank of sentences using the HITS algorithm . Initial ranks for sentences and enti- ties are computed by Equations 4 and 5 in an entity graph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Rank init (sent i ) = 1 + sim(sent i , title), (4) Rank init (ent j ) = 1.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In Equation 4, sim(sent i , title) is the cosine sim- ilarity between the scientific article's title and sen- tence sent i . In Equation 5, ent j refers to the j th entity in the entity graph. After applying the HITS algorithm on the entity graph using the above initial- ization, the final rank of a sentence is its importance. Non-redundancy (f R (E)): In the objective func- tion, f R (E) represents the non-redundancy of in- formation in the summary. Intuitively, if the sum- mary has unique information in every sentence then the summary is non-redundant. We measure non- redundancy as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f R (E) = m j=1 e j ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where m is the number of entities and e j is a binary variable for each entity. The summary becomes non- redundant if we include only unique entities. On the basis of f I (S) and f R (E) we define the following optimization constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">n i=1 |Sent i | · s i ≤ l max ,<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">j∈E i e j ≥ |E i | · s i for i = 1, . . . , n,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">s i ∈S j s i ≥ e j for j = 1, . . . , m.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The constraint in Equation 7 limits the length of the summary. l max is the maximal length of the sum- mary and |Sent i | is the length of sentence sent i .</p><p>In Equation 8, the constraint ensures that if sen- tence sent i is selected (s i = 1), then all entities E i present in sentence sent i must also be selected. In Equation 9, S j represents the set of binary vari- ables of sentences which contain entity ent j . This constraint prescribes that if entity ent j is selected (e j = 1), then at least one of the sentences in S j must be selected, too.</p><p>Coherence (f C (P)): We use the mined patterns to extract sentences from the input document of PLOS Medicine to create a coherent summary. We extract sentences, if the connectivity among nodes in their projection graph matches the connectivity among nodes in a coherence pattern. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> we overlay the projection graph from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, ii with the coherence pattern from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, i. This results in three instances of this coherence pattern. How- ever, we select only one since we simultaneously op- timize for importance and non-redundancy. In the objective function, f C (P ) measures the co- herence of the summary based on the weights of the coherence patterns occurring in it (Section 2.2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f C (P ) = U u=1 weight(pat u ) · p u ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where p u is a boolean variable associated with co- herence pattern pat u . The optimization considers pattern pat u for sum- marizing the input article, if pat u is a subgraph of the projection graph of the article. To find the coher- ence pattern in a projection graph we apply a graph matching algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lerouge et al., 2015)</ref>. To model the graph matching problem between projection graph g = (V g , E g ) and patterns pat u = (V patu , E patu ), two kinds of mapping binary vari- ables are used: x i,k for the node map, and y ij,kl for the edge map. x i,k, = 1, if vertices i ∈ V patu and k ∈ V g match. y ij,kl = 1, if for each pair of edges ij ∈ E patu and kl ∈ E g match ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>). Con- straints for graph matching are as follows:</p><p>• Every node of the pattern matches at most one unique node of the graph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">k∈Vg x i,k ≤ 1 ∀i ∈ V patu .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>• Every edge of the pattern matches at most one unique edge of the graph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">kl∈Eg y ij,kl ≤ 1 ∀ij ∈ E patu .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>• Every node of the graph matches at most one node of the pattern:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">i∈Vpat u x i,k ≤ 1 ∀k ∈ V g .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>• A node of pattern pat u matches a node of graph g if an edge originating from the node of pat u matches an edge originating from the node of g:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">kl∈Eg y ij,kl = x i,k ∀k ∈ V g , ∀ij ∈ E patu .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>• A node of pattern pat u matches a node of graph g if an edge targeting the node of pat u matches an edge targeting the node of g:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">kl∈Eg y ij,kl = x j,l ∀l ∈ V g , ∀ij ∈ E patu .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>• We need a constraint to extract induced pat- terns 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">i∈Vpat u x i,k + j∈Vpat u x j,l − ij∈Epat u y ij,kl ≤ 1 ∀kl ∈ E g .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>The constraints in Equations 11 − 16 are defined to find pattern pat u in projection graph g of the input article. However these constraints do not ensure that the pattern is in the summary. For this, we define constraints in Equations 17 − 19 to assure that an existing pattern in an article is selected if there are some sentences in the summary which constitute the pattern.</p><p>• The constraint in Equation 17 ensures that if sentences s k and s l are selected for the sum- mary then the edge between them is selected (z kl = 1), too:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">s k · s l = z kl ∀k, l ∈ V g .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>• Pattern pat u is present in the summary (p u = 1) if and only if one of its instances in the projec- tion graph is included in the summary, i.e., some of the selected sentence nodes must be present in an instance of pattern pat u . |V patu | is the num- ber of nodes in pattern pat u , and |E patu | is the number of edges in pattern pat u . This constraint is shown below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">i∈vpat u k∈vg s k · x i,k + ij∈epat u kl∈eg z kl · y ij,kl = p u (|V patu | + |E patu |).<label>(18)</label></formula><p>• If a sentence is selected then it has to match a node of at least one of the patterns:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">patu∈P i∈Vpat u x i,k ≥ s k ∀k ∈ V g .<label>(19)</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Experimental Setup</head><p>First, we extract the text of an article. We remove figures, tables, references and non-alphabetical char- acters. Then we use the Stanford parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Klein and Manning, 2003)</ref> to determine sentence boundaries. We apply the Brown coherence toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Elsner and Charniak, 2011</ref>) to convert the articles into entity grids ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barzilay and Lapata, 2008</ref>) which then are transformed into entity graphs. We use gSpan <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yan and Han, 2002</ref>) to extract all subgraphs from the pro- jection graphs of the abstracts of the PubMed cor- pus. It is possible that patterns with a large number of nodes are not at all present in the projection graph. Hence, we use coherence patterns with 3 and 4 nodes, referred to as CP 3 and CP 4 , respectively. We use Gurobi (Gurobi Optimization, Inc., 2014) to solve the MIP problem. We use a pronoun resolution system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Martschat, 2013)</ref> to replace all pronouns in the summary with their antecedents.</p><p>We determine the best values for λ I , λ R , and λ c on the development sets. λ I = 0.4, λ R = 0.3, and λ c = 0.3 are the best weights for the PLOS Medicine development set.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results</head><p>We evaluate our model in two ways. First, we use ROUGE scores to compare our model with other models. Second, we explicitly evaluate the coher- ence of the summaries by human judgements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">ROUGE Assessment</head><p>The ROUGE score <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lin, 2004</ref>) is a standard evalua- tion score in automatic text summarization. It calcu- lates the overlap between gold summary and system summary. In automatic text summarization ROUGE 1, ROUGE 2 and ROUGE SU4 are usually reported (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Graham (2015)</ref> for an assessment of evaluation metrics for summarization). We compare our system (CP 3 and CP 4 ) with four baselines: Lead, Random, Maximal Marginal Rel- evance (MMR) and TextRank. Lead selects adja- cent sentences from the beginning of an input ar- ticle. Random selects sentences randomly. MMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998</ref>) uses a trade-off between relevance and redundancy. TextRank is a graph-based system using sentences as nodes and edges weighted by cosine similarity between sen- tences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004)</ref>. We compare our system with three state-of-the-art systems: E Coh (  ( <ref type="bibr">Mead (Radev et al., 2004</ref>). E Coh uses entity graphs which consists of entities and sentences, and T Coh uses topical graphs where entities are replaced by the topics. They both use the outdegree of sentence nodes in the un- weighted and the weighted projection graph, respec- tively, as the coherence measure of each sentence.</p><p>Mead employs a linear combination of three fea- tures: centroid score, position score and overlap score. The linear combination is used to add sen- tences to the summary up to the required length. The centroid score gives the highest score to the most central sentence in the cluster of sentences, the po- sition score gives a higher score to the sentences which are in the beginning of the document, and the overlap score computes the similarity between the sentences of a document. All three features do not take care of the coherence of a summary as they do not have any notion of the order and the structure of a summary.</p><p>To compare with the state-of-the-art systems on PLOS Medicine, E Coh (  and T Coh (Parveen et al., 2015), we limit the length of summaries to 5 sentences. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reports ROUGE scores of different systems. Our system outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art systems.</p><p>Since the word length limit of a summary is more meaningful than the sentence length limit of a sum- mary, we limit the length of a summary to the av- erage length of editor's summaries in the dataset (750 words). <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> shows the performance of different systems with 750 words limit for a sum- mary. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, we use different versions of ROUGE-SU4 and ROUGE-2 where W/WO stands PLOS Medicine   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 2)</ref>. We compute statistical significance between E Coh and CP 3 on both scores, ROUGE SU4 is significantly different by 95%. ROUGE 2 is significantly different by 99%.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">W O Stop W O Stop W Stop W Stop W O Stop W O Stop W Stop W Stop Editor's summaries W Stem W O Stem W Stem W O Stem W Stem W O Stem W Stem W O Stem ROUGE SU4 (*p value &lt; 0.</formula><note type="other">0.104 0.161 0.159 0.115 0.084 0.126 0.118 State-of-the-art E Coh 0.204* 0.167 0.254 0.228 0.160* 0.145 0.187 0.173 T Coh 0.195 0.161 0.231 0.206 0.157 0.140 0.169 0.165 Mead 0.197 0.165 0.246 0.222 0.156 0.139 0.186 0.172 Our Model CP 3 0.215* 0.178 0.268 0.241 0.172* 0.153 0.200 0.184 CP 4 0.218 0.179 0.270 0.245 0.175 0.156 0.201 0.187</note><p>Upper Bound in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> represents maximum ROUGE scores that can be achieved in extractive summarization on the PLOS Medicine dataset. It is calculated by considering the whole scientific article as a summary and the corresponding editor's sum- mary as the gold standard. The Upper Bound scores are not very high showing that a significant im- provement in ROUGE scores on the PLOS Medicine dataset is difficult. Thus, the performance achieved by our systems, CP 3 and CP 4 , is a considerable im- provement on the PLOS Medicine dataset.</p><p>Furthermore, we apply CP 3 on the dataset intro- duced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liakata et al. (2013)</ref>. The dataset con- sists of 28 scientific articles from the chemistry do- main. The state-of-the-art system on this dataset is CoreSC, which is developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liakata et al. (2013)</ref>. CoreSC considers discourse information while sum- marizing a scientific article. The ROUGE-1 score of CP 3 (0.96) is significantly better than CoreSC (0.75) and Microsoft Office Word 2007 AutoSuma- rize (0.73) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">García-Hernández et al., 2009)</ref>, in re- spect of abstracts. This shows that our system per- forms well in other domains.</p><p>We further calculate the average number of sen- tences per summary obtained by Mead and CP 3 . On average Mead produces 17.5 sentences per summary whereas CP 3 produces 27.2 sentences per summary. The possibility of longer sentences containing more topic irrelevant entities is higher than shorter sen- tences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jin et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We calculate the average percentage of sentences selected from the sections Introduction, Method, Re- sults and Discussion by different systems. CP 3 ex- tracts sentences mainly from Introduction (32.5%) and Method (38.5%), but also a considerable num- ber of sentences from Results (17.67%) and Discus- sion (11.33%). The distribution is quite similar to TextRank and MMR. Lead, obviously, extracts only from Introduction (80.59%) and Method (19.41%). Mead extracts maximum sentences from the begin- ning of the document using its positional feature. The sentences in a summary extracted by CP 3 are evenly distributed indicating that they are not biased to any sections. This clearly represents that coher- ence patterns not only seeks for nearby sentences but also for any distant sentences of a scientific article. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> shows the results on DUC 2002 to com- pare the results with state-of-the-art systems. There is no significant difference between the ROUGE scores of using CP 3 and CP 4 on DUC 2002. Thus, we only report the results of using CP 3 on DUC 2002.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, LREG is a baseline system us-  ing logistic regression and hand-made features <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cheng and Lapata, 2016)</ref>.

The more recent system, NN-SE, uti- lizes a neural network hierarchical document en- coder and an attention-based extractor to extract sen- tences from a document for a summary <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cheng and Lapata, 2016)</ref>. ROUGE scores of our approach on this dataset are better than baselines and state-of-the- art systems. This shows that our system performs well even in a different genre (robust) and with con- siderably shorter input documents (scalable).</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Systems R-1 R-2 R-SU4</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Coherence Assessment</head><p>ROUGE scores do not evaluate summary coher- ence, since ROUGE only calculates overlapping re- call scores and does not consider the structure of the summary. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009)</ref>, Ce- likyilmaz and Hakkani-Tür (2010) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Christensen et al. (2013)</ref> evaluate the overall summary quality by asking human subjects to rank system generated summaries.  assess the coherence by asking human assessors to rank system generated summaries and compare their system with baseline systems.</p><p>We perform summary coherence assessment by asking one Postdoc, two PhD students and one Mas- ters student from the field of natural language pro- cessing. We provide them with the output sum- maries of four different systems for ten articles. We ask them to rank the summaries, i.e., the best sum- mary gets rank 1, the second best gets rank 2, the third best gets rank 3, and the worst gets rank 4.</p><p>The four systems assessed are CP 3 , E Coh , Text- Rank, and Lead. We apply the Kendall concordance coefficient (W) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Siegel and Castellan, 1988)</ref> to mea- sure whether the human assessors agree in ranking the four systems. With W = 0.6725 the correla- tion between the human assessors is high. Applying the χ 2 test shows that W is significant at least at the 99% level indicating that the ranks provided by the human assessors are reliable and informative. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table  4</ref> shows the overall average rank of a system given by the four human assessors. The lower the value of average human scores the more coherent the sum- mary. Unsurprisingly Lead gets the best overall av-  erage rank. Lead extracts adjacent sentences from the beginning of the document. Hence, these sum- maries are as coherent as the author intends them to be, but they are not informative. However, CP 3 is very close in coherence to Lead indicating that our strategy is successful. It also performs substan- tially better than TextRank and E Coh . This confirms that using coherence patterns for sentence extraction yields more coherent summaries. mation is spread all over the article unlike informa- tion in news articles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Teufel and Moens, 2002</ref>). There are various approaches for summarizing scientific articles. Citations have been used by many researchers for summarization in this domain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Elkiss et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mohammad et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Qazvinian and Radev, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011</ref>). Nanba and Okumura (2000) develop rules for categoriz- ing citations by analyzing citation sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Newman (2001)</ref> analyzes the structure using a citation network. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Siddharthan and Teufel (2007)</ref> discover scientific attributions using citations. Dis- course structure (but not necessarily coherence) has been used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Teufel and Moens (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liakata et al. (2013)</ref> and others for summarizing scientific arti- cles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLOS Medicine</head><p>Several state-of-the-art extractive summarization systems implement summarization as maximizing an objective function using constraints. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">McDonald (2007)</ref> interprets text summarization as a global in- ference problem, where he is maximizing the im- portance score of a summary by considering the length constraint. Similarly, various approaches for summarization are based on optimization using ILP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gillick et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nishikawa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Galanis et al., 2012;</ref>.</p><p>Until now, only few works have considered co- herence while summarizing scientific articles. Abu- Jbara and Radev (2011) work on citation based summarization. They preprocess the citation sen- tences to filter out irrelevant sentences or sentence fragments, then extract sentences for the summary. Eventually, they refine the summary sentences to im- prove readability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jha et al. (2015)</ref> consider Min- imum Independent Discourse Contexts (MIDC) to solve the problem of non-coherence in extractive summarization. However, none of them deals with the problem of coherence within the task of sentence selection. Sentence selection and ensuring the co- herence of summaries are not tightly integrated in their techniques. They model coherence in summa- rization by only considering adjacent sentences.</p><p>There are few methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hirao et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gorinski and Lapata, 2015</ref>) which integrate coherence in optimization. These methods do not take into account the overall structure of the summary. Unlike earlier methods, we incorporate coherence patterns in optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We introduce a novel graph-based approach to gen- erate coherent summaries of scientific articles. Our approach takes care of coherence distinctively by co- herence patterns. We have experimented with PLOS Medicine and DUC 2002. The results show that the approach is robust, works on both scientific and news documents and with input documents of dif- ferent length. It considerably outperforms state-of- the-art systems on both datasets. We collected hu- man assessments to evaluate the coherence of sum- maries. Our system substantially outperforms base- lines and state-of-the-art systems, i.e., incorporat- ing coherence patterns produces more coherent sum- maries. The results show that our approach performs well in human summary coherence assessment and relevance evaluation (ROUGE scores).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (i) A sample of mined coherence patterns from abstracts; nodes are sentences and edges are entity connections; (ii) Sentences S1, S3 and S5 constitute the pattern in an input document.</figDesc></figure>
