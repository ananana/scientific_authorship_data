				<p>Community question answering, a recent evolution of question answering in the Web context, allows a user to quickly consult the opinion of a number of people on a particular topic, thus taking advantage of the wisdom of the crowd. Here we try to help the user by deciding automatically which answers are good and which are bad for a given question. In particular, we focus on exploiting the output structure at the thread level in order to make more consistent global decisions. More specifically, we exploit the relations between pairs of comments at any distance in the thread, which we incorporate in a graph-cut and in an ILP frameworks. We evaluated our approach on the benchmark dataset of SemEval-2015 Task 3. Results improved over the state of the art, confirming the importance of using thread level information .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Community question answering (CQA) is a recent evolution of question answering, in the Web con- text, where users pose questions and then receive answers from other users. This setup is very at- tractive, as the anonymity on the Web allows users to ask just about anything and then hope to get some honest answers from a number of people. On the negative side, there is no guarantee about the quality of the answers as people of very different background, knowledge, and with different moti- vation contribute answers to a given question.</p><p>Unlike traditional question answering (QA), in CQA answering takes the form of commenting in a forum. Thus, many comments are only loosely connected to the original question, and some are not answers at all, but are rather interactions be- tween users.</p><p>As question-comment threads can get quite long, finding good answers in a thread can be time- consuming. This has triggered research in trying to automatically determine which answers might be good and which ones are likely to be bad or ir- relevant. One early work going in this direction is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Qu and Liu (2011)</ref>, who tried to determine whether a question is "solved" or not, given its as- sociated thread of comments. As a first step in the process, they performed a comment-level classi- fication, considering four classes: problem, solu- tion, good feedback, and bad feedback.</p><p>More recently, the shared task at SemEval 2015 on Answer Selection in CQA ( , whose benchmark datasets we will use below, tackled the task of identifying good, potentially useful, and bad comments within a thread. In that task, the top participating systems used thread- level features, in addition to the usual local fea- tures that only look at the question-answer pair. For example, the second-best team, HITSZ-ICRC, used as a feature the position of the comment in the thread ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hou et al., 2015)</ref>. Similarly, our par- ticipation, which achieved the third-best postition, used features that try to describe a comment in the context of the entire comment thread, focusing on user interaction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nicosia et al., 2015)</ref>. Finally, the fifth-best team, ICRC-HIT, treated the answer se- lection task as a sequence labeling problem and proposed recurrent convolution neural networks to recognize good comments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhou et al., 2015b)</ref>.</p><p>In a follow-up work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zhou et al. (2015a)</ref> in- cluded a long-short term memory in their convo- lution neural network to learn the classification se- quence for the thread. In parallel, in our recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barrón-Cedeño et al., 2015)</ref>, we tried to ex- ploit the dependencies between the thread com- ments to tackle the same task. We did it by design- ing features that look globally at the thread and by applying structured prediction models, such as Conditional Random Fields ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Our goal in this paper goes in the same direction: we are interested in exploiting the output structure at the thread level to make more consistent global assignments.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no work in QA that identifies good answers based on the selection of the other answers retrieved for a ques- tion. This is mainly due to the loose dependencies between the different answer passages in standard QA. In contrast, we postulate that in a CQA set- ting, the answers from different users in a com- mon thread are strongly interconnected and, thus, a joint answer selection model should be adopted to achieve higher accuracy. In particular, we focus on the relations between two comments at any dis- tance in the thread. This is more general than pre- vious approaches, which were either limited to se- quential interactions or considered conversational interactions only at the level of features.</p><p>We propose a model based on the idea that sim- ilar comments should have similar labels. Below, we apply graph-cut and we compare it to an inte- ger linear programming (ILP) formulation for de- coding under global constraints; we also provide results with a linear-chain CRF. We show that the CRF is ineffective due to long-distance relations, e.g., a conversation in a thread can branch and then come back later. On the contrary, the global infer- ence models (either graph-cut or ILP) using the similarity between pairs of comments manage to significantly improve a strong baseline performing local comment-based classifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Task</head><p>We use the CQA-QL corpus from Subtask A of SemEval-2015 Task 3 on Answer Selection in CQA. The corpus contains data from the Qatar Living forum, 1 and is publicly available on the task's website. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The dataset consists of ques- tions and a list of answers for each question, i.e., question-answer threads. Each question, and each answer, consist of a short title and a more de- tailed description. There is also meta informa- tion associated with both, e.g., ID of the user ask- ing/answering the question, timestamp, category. The task asks participants to determine for each answer in the thread whether it is Good, Bad, or Potentially useful for the given question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q: Can I obtain Driving License my QID is written Em- ployee</head><p>A1 the word employee is a general term that refers to all the staff in your company either the manager, secretary up to the lowest position or whatever positions they have. you are all considered employees of your company.</p><p>A2 your qid should specify what is the actual profession you have. i think for me, your chances to have a drivers license is low.</p><p>A3 dear richard, his asking if he can obtain. means he have the driver license A4 Slim chance . . . A simplified example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, 3 where answers 2 and 4 are good, answer 1 is po- tentially useful, and answer 3 is bad. In this paper, we focus on a 2-class variant of the above Sub- task A, which is closer to a real CQA application. We merge Potential and Bad labels into Bad and we focus on the 2-class problem: Good-vs-Bad. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows some statistics about the resulting dataset used for development, training and testing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Category</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our Proposed Solution</head><p>We model the pairwise relations between the com- ments in the answer thread ({c i } n i=1 ) to produce a better global assignment: we combine the predic- tions of a Good-vs-Bad classifier at the comment level with the output of a pairwise classifier, Same- vs-Different, which takes two comments and pre- dicts whether they should have the same label.</p><p>Each comment c i has an individual score s iK , provided by the Good-vs-Bad classifier, for being in class K ∈ {G, B} (i.e., G for Good and B for Bad). Moreover, for each pair of comments (c i , c j ), we have an association score s ij , an esti- mate by the pairwise classifier about how likely it is that the comments c i and c j will have the same label. Next, we define two ways of doing global inference using these two sources of information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Graph Partition Approach</head><p>Here our goal is to find a partition P = (G, B) that minimizes the following cost:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C(P ) = λ c i ∈G s iB + c i ∈B s iG + (1 − λ) c i ∈G,c j ∈B s ij</formula><p>The first part of the cost function discourages mis- classification of individual comments, while the second part encourages similar comments to be in the same class. The mixing parameter λ ∈ [0, 1] determines the relative strength of the two compo- nents. Our approach is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pang and Lee (2004)</ref>, where they model the proximity relation between sentences for finding subjective sentences in product reviews, whereas we are interested in global inference based on local classifiers. The optimization problem can be efficiently solved by finding a minimum cut of a weighted undirected graph G = (V, E). The set of nodes V = {v 1 , v 2 , · · · , v n , s, t} represent the n com- ments in a thread, the source and the sink. We connect each comment node v i to the source node s by adding an edge w(v i , s) with capacity s iG , and to the sink node t by adding an edge w(v i , t) with capacity s iB . Finally, we add edges w(v i , v j ) with capacity s ij to connect all pairs of comments.</p><p>Minimizing C(P ) amounts to finding a parti- tion (S, T ), where S = {s} ∪ S and T = {t} ∪ T for s / ∈ S , t / ∈ T , that minimizes the cut capac- ity, i.e., the net flow crossing from S to T . One crucial advantage of this approach is that we can use max-flow algorithms to find the exact solution in polynomial time -near-linear in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cormen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boykov and Kolmogorov, 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Integer Linear Programming Approach</head><p>Here we follow the inference with classifiers ap- proach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Roth and Yih (2004)</ref>, solved with Inte- ger Linear Programming (ILP). We have one ILP problem per question-answer thread. We define a set of binary variables, whose assignment will uni- vocally define the classification of all comments in the thread. In particular, we define a pair of vari- ables for each answer: x iG and x iB , 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Assigning 1 to x iG means that comment c i in the thread is classified as Good; assigning it 0 means that c i is not classified as Good. The same applies to the other classes (here, only Bad). Also, we have a pair of variables for each pair of comments (to capture the pairwise relations): x ijS and x ijD , 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n. Assigning 1 to x ijS means that c i and c j have the same label; assigning 0 to x ijS means that c i and c j do not have the same label. The same interpretation holds for the other possi- ble classes (in this case only Different). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Let c iG be the cost of classifying c i as Good, c ijS be the cost of assigning the same labels to c i and c j , etc. Following ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Roth and Yih, 2004</ref>), these costs are obtained from local classifiers by taking log probabilities, i.e., c iG = − log s iG , c ijS = − log s ij , etc. The goal of the ILP prob- lem is to find an assignment A to all variables x iG , x iB , x ijS , x ijD that minimizes the cost function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C(A) = λ · N i=1 (c iG · x iG + c iB · x iB ) + (1 − λ) · N −1 i=1 N j=i+1 (c ijS · x ijS + c ijD · x ijD )</formula><p>subject to the following constraints: (i) All vari- ables are binary; (ii) One and only one label is assigned to each comment or pair of comments; (iii) The assignments to the comment variables and to the comment-pair variables are consistent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x ijD = x iG ⊕ x jG , ∀i, j 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n. λ ∈ [0, 1]</formula><p>is a parameter used to balance the con- tribution of the two sources of information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Local Classifiers</head><p>For classification, we use Maximum Entropy, or MaxEnt, (Murphy, 2012), as it yields a probability distribution over the class labels, which we then use directly for the graph arcs and the ILP costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Good-vs-Bad Classifier</head><p>Our most important features measure the similar- ity between the question (q) and the comment (c). We compare lemmata and POS <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>-grams using Jaccard (1901), containment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lyon et al., 2001</ref>), and cosine, as well as using some similarities from <ref type="bibr">DKPro (Bär et al., 2012</ref>) such as longest com- mon substring <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allison and Dix, 1986)</ref> and greedy string tiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Wise, 1996)</ref>. We also compute sim- ilarity using partial tree kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Moschitti, 2006</ref>) on shallow syntactic trees.</p><p>Forty-three Boolean features express whether (i) c includes URLs or emails, the words "yes", "sure", "no", "neither", "okay", etc., as well as '?' and '@' or starts with "yes" (12 features); (ii) c includes a word longer than fifteen characters (1); (iii) q belongs to each of the forum categories (26); and (iv) c and q were posted by the same user (4). An extra feature captures the length of c.</p><p>Four features explore whether c is close to a comment by the user who asked the question, u q : (i-ii) there is a comment by u q following c and (not) containing an acknowledgment or (iii) con- taining a question, or (iv) among the comments preceding c there is one by u q asking a ques- tion. We model dialogues by identifying conver- sation chains between two users with three fea- tures: whether c is at the beginning/middle/end of a chain. There are copies of these features for chains in which u q participates. Another feature for c u i checks whether the user u i wrote more than one comment in the current thread. Three more features fire for the first/middle/last comment by u i . One extra feature counts the total number of comments written by u i . Finally, there is a feature modeling the position of c in the thread.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Same-vs-Different Classifier</head><p>We use the following types of features for a pair of comments (c i , c j ): (i) all the features from the Good-vs-Bad classifier (i.e., we subtracted the feature vectors representing the two comments, |v i − v j |) 5 ; (ii) the similarity features between the two comments, sim(c i , c j ); and (iii) the predic- tion from the Good-vs-Bad classifiers on c i and c j (i.e., the scores for c i and c j , the product of the two scores, and five boolean features specifying whether any of c i and c j are predicted as Good, Bad, and whether their predictions are identical).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Evaluation</head><p>We performed standard pre-processing, and we further filtered user's signatures. All parameters (e.g., Gaussian prior for MaxEnt and the mixing λ for the graph-cut and ILP) were tuned on the development set. We also trained a second-order linear-chain CRF to check the contribution of the sequential relations between comments. We re- port results on the official SemEval test set for all methods. For the Same-vs-Different problem, we explored a variant of training with three classes, by splitting the Same class into Same-Good and Same-Bad. At test time, the probabilities of these two subclasses are added to get the probability of Same and all the algorithms are run unchanged. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Subtracting vectors is standard in preference learn- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Shen and Joshi, 2003)</ref>. The absolute value is necessary to emphasize comment differences instead of preferences.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Same-vs-Different classification. P, R, and F 1 are calculated with respect to Same. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the results for the Same-vs- Different classification. We can see that the two- class MaxEnt-2C classifier works better than the three-class MaxEnt-3C. MaxEnt-3C has more bal- anced P and R, but loses in both F 1 and accu- racy. MaxEnt-2C is very skewed towards the ma- jority class, but performs better due to the class imbalance. Overall, it seems very difficult to learn with the current features, and both methods only outperform the majority-class baseline by a small margin. Yet, while the overall accuracy is low, note that the graph-cut/ILP inference allows us to recover from some errors, because if nearby utter- ances are clustered correctly, the wrong decisions should be outvoted by correct ones.</p><p>The results for Good-vs-Bad are shown in Ta- ble 3. On the top are the best systems at SemEval- 2015 Task 3. We can see that our MaxEnt classifier is competitive: it shows higher accuracy than two of them, and the highest F 1 overall.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Good-vs-Bad classification. ‡ and † mark statistically significant differences in accu- racy compared to the baseline MaxEnt classifier with confidence levels of 99% and 95%, respec- tively (randomized test).</p><p>The CRF model is worse than MaxEnt on all measures, which suggests that the sequential infor- mation does not help. This can be because many interactions between comments are long-distance and there are gaps in the threads due to the anno- tation procedure at SemEval ( .</p><p>However, global inference with graph-cut and ILP improves both F 1 and accuracy, mostly due to better recall. Graph-cut works better than ILP as it has higher precision, which helps F 1 and accuracy.</p><p>Both yield statistically significant improve- ments over the MaxEnt classifier; they also im- prove over the state-of-the-art JAIST system. Note that the devtest-tuned values of λ for graph-cut and ILP put much lower weight to the Same-vs- Different component (values are 0.95 and 0.91, re- spectively). Finally, as expected, using the predic- tions of MaxEnt-2C in the global classifiers is bet- ter than using those from MaxEnt-3C.</p><p>Q: I have a female friend who is leaving for a teaching job in Qatar in January.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>We manually examined a number of examples where our global classfier could successfully re- cover from the errors made by the local classifier, and where it failed to do so. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, we show the classification decisions of our local and global (graph-cut) classifiers along with the human anno- tations for an excerpt of a thread.</p><p>For example, consider answers A 6 , A 9 , and A 12 , which were initially misclassified as Bad by the local classifier, but later recovered by the global classifier exploiting the pairwise informa- tion. In this case, the votes received by these an- swers from other Good answers in the thread for being in the same class won against the votes re- ceived from other Bad answers. Now consider A 11 , which our method failed to classify correctly as Good. Our investigation re- vealed that in this case the votes from the Bad an- swers won against the votes from the Good ones. The accuracy of the pairwise classifier has proven to be crucial for the performance of our over- all framework. We probably need more informa- tive features (e.g., textual entailment and semantic similarity to capture the relation between books and novels, movies and DVDs, etc.) in order to improve the pairwise classification performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have investigated the use of thread-level in- formation for answer selection in CQA. We have shown that using a pairwise classifier that predicts whether two comments should get the same label, followed by a graph-cut (or ILP) global inference improves significantly over a very strong baseline as well as over the state of the art. We have fur- ther shown that using a linear-chain CRF model does not help, probably because many interactions between comments are long distance.</p><p>In future work, we would like to improve the pairwise classifiers with richer features, as this is currently the bottleneck for improving the perfor- mance in the global model. We further plan to test our framework on other CQA datasets, including on other languages. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Last but not least, we are in- terested in extending this research with even more global information, e.g., by modeling global deci- sion consistency across multiple threads.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example from SemEval-2015 Task 3.</figDesc></figure>
