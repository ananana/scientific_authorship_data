			<abstract>
				<p>Most text-classification approaches represent the input based on textual features, either feature-based or continuous. However, this ignores strong non-linguistic similarities like ho-mophily: people within a demographic group use language more similar to each other than to non-group members. We use homophily cues to retrofit text-based author representations with non-linguistic information, and introduce a trade-off parameter. This approach increases in-class similarity between authors, and improves classification performance by making classes more linearly separable. We evaluate the effect of our method on two author-attribute prediction tasks with various training-set sizes and parameter settings. We find that our method can significantly improve classification performance, especially when the number of labels is large and limited labeled data is available. It is potentially applicable as pre-processing step to any text-classification task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Predicting socio-demographic author characteris- tics is becoming ever more relevant with the per- vasive use of user-generated content. Classifying user attributes such as age and gender is useful for a number of applications both in the public sector, where it can support the investigation of crime (in forensic linguistics) or the determination of social policies, and in the private sector, where compa- nies want to profile a potential consumer market, targeting communication strategies and advertis- ing to specific communities. Furthermore, recent work in NLP has shown that incorporating au- thor attributes in various NLP tasks can also im- prove performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Volkova et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hovy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lynn et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In these tasks, authors are typically represented via their linguistic profiles, i.e., information avail- able in the text. This includes both word-based features as well as continuous representations (embeddings). Generally, linguistic features are divided into content-related and strictly stylistic features. While the first can be effectively repre- sented by (n-grams of) words which capture the topic and meaning of a text, the second ones fo- cus on the use of function words, expressions, pro- nouns, syntactic structures, etc. There is evidence in the literature that content-related text charac- teristics are more effective than stylistic features for gender and age prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fatima et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011</ref>). This effect is the consequence of a non-linguistic auto-selection process known as homophily: people within in a demographic group tend to be more similar to each other than to other groups, and subjects belong- ing to different groups are therefore naturally more prone to discuss different topics.</p><p>Despite the large amount of available social me- dia data (in April 2018, Facebook had more than two billion active users, YouTube and WhatsApp each one-and-a-half billion, and Twitter 330 mil- lion, see statista.com), we often encounter scenar- ios with limited availability of ground-truth user attributes, leading to remarkable performance dif- ferences to, say, blogs. This difference is due to the shortness of social media texts and the wider range of topics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rangel et al., 2016)</ref>, which weaken linguistic profile features. In such cases, improving author representations beyond the lin- guistic profiles can be especially useful.</p><p>We implement this intuition of leveraging demographic homophily by using retrofitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Faruqui et al., 2015)</ref>, a method introduced to re- fine word vectors to reflect semantic similarity information from lexicons. In our case, we in- crease the similarity between the (linguistically- based) continuous authors representations within each class (here: age or gender). Authors who share the same gender or age therefore get more similar vector representations (see section 3.2). This effectively increases class-separability and can thereby improve classification performance.</p><p>We also experiment with a trade-off param- eter α, which controls the relative influence of the retrofitting process vs. the original embedding vector on the retrofit representation, allowing us to explore the effect of both factors on the final pre- diction outcome.</p><p>In order to extend the in-class homophily infor- mation to unlabeled data, we induce a transforma- tion matrix to translate between the original and retrofitted embedding space. This matrix can be applied to unlabeled data to transform the author representations in the test set.</p><p>We use a set of almost 100K authors to pre- dict age and gender. In order to explore limited- resource scenarios, we experiment with a range of training set sizes. Our results indicate that de- mographic retrofitting of linguistic representations substantially increases classification performance for age and gender prediction, especially in low- resource scenarios.</p><p>It is an easy, fast, and efficient preprocessing step that can substantially improve classification performance. We show our method for author- attribute prediction, but believe it can potentially be applied to any text-classification task.</p><p>Contributions In this paper, we introduce de- mographic retrofitting based on in-class ho- mophily, and make the following contributions:</p><p>1. we present a substantial expansion of the original retrofitting algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Faruqui et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast to prior work, which re- lies on external ontologies, our method relies solely on the information contained within the training data.</p><p>2. We show how to generalize the transforma- tion from training data to unlabeled data, us- ing a translation matrix.</p><p>3. We publicly release all our data and models on our GitHub page, https://github.com/Bocconi- NLPLab/retrofit attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>We use data from , a collec- tion of reviews of online companies from various countries, including author information. We se- lect all reviews written in English from American and British sources, if they include both age and gender of the author, and if the review is at least 10 tokens long (shorter reviews tend to be mis- tokenized URLs or replies). We aggregate the re- views by users, so that each instance is a collec- tion of texts' from a unique user. This leaves us with 98,608 individual users, and about 8M words (roughly 80 words per instance). For each user, we use the age (discretized by decade) and gen- der (self-stated as binary, and augmented by  based on the users' first name) as tar- get variables. We minimally preprocess the text data, collapsing all numbers into 0s, and tokeniz- ing via spacy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Honnibal and Johnson, 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>In our experiments, we are interested in the ef- fect of homophily-inducing retrofitting on author- attribute prediction. In order to evaluate the effect, we compare the performance of author representa- tions based on linguistic input to the performance of the same representation retrofitted to the author attribute class in question. In this section, we out- line the details for the different steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linguistic author representations</head><p>We train Doc2Vec, a paragraph2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Le and Mikolov, 2014</ref>) implementation, on the corpus, in- ducing a 98K-by-300 matrix D, where each row represents an author. We follow the parametriza- tion suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lau and Baldwin (2016)</ref>, setting the window size to 15, minimum word-frequency to 10, negative samples to 5, downsampling rate to 0.00001, and run for 1000 iterations. We use the resulting author embeddings as input to the author- attribute classifier (see 3.4). We induce the author embeddings over the entire corpus of 98K authors, without recurrence to age or gender information.</p><p>As comparison, we also create a bag-of-words (BOW) representation with the same dimensional- ity. We use χ 2 as selection criterion to find the top 300 words in the training data, separately for both age and gender classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Retrofitting</head><p>Our goal is to enhance the author representations, which are based on linguistic similarity, with de- mographic information about the target variable (say, age). In order to introduce this information into the vector space, we rely on retrofitting, by in-    <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Miller, 1995)</ref> or PPDB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013</ref>). Instead of these resources, we map each labeled author to the list of all other authors with the same label in the training data. Formally, we create a set Ω containing tuples of authors (d i , d j |y i = y j ). We do this separately for each demographic dimension -age and gender.</p><p>During retrofitting, we iteratively update the au- thor representation in the training data (initially linguistically-based) to increase the cosine simi- larity between authors within the same class (as defined in Ω). This creates a retrofitted ma- trixˆDtrixˆ trixˆD train of the original author matrix D train . The update for an author representation d i is a weighted combination of the original embedding and the average over all its current neighbors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ d i = αd i + β j:(i,j)∈Ωˆd ∈Ωˆ ∈Ωˆd j N</formula><p>where d i is the original linguistic representation vector, N = |{∀j : (i, j) ∈ Ω}| is the set of all embeddings in the same label group, and α and β are hyper-parameters that control the trade- off between the original representation and the updates from the neighboring embeddings during retrofitting. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Faruqui et al. (2015)</ref>, α = β. In contrast, we define β = 1 − α By varying α from 0 to 1, we can control the strength of the retrofitting process. α = 1 sim- ply reproduces the original matrix, i.e., ˆ D = D, whereas α = 0 only relies on the neighborhood updates after the initialization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows a sample of 500 users in a non-retrofitted (1a) and retrofitted (1b) 3D embedding space, colored by class. The color distribution shows how people be- longing to the same group get drawn closer to each other in embeddings space when using retrofitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Translation</head><p>We can only retrofit the embeddings of authors in the training set D train , since we need information about the class label in order to construct Ω. How- ever, the retrofitting process changes the configu- ration of the embedding space (intô D train ), so a separating hyperplane learned onˆDonˆ onˆD train will not be applicable to a test set D test in the original em- bedding space.</p><p>In order to extend the homophily information to authors in the test set, we use a translation matrix T (a 300 × 300 matrix), which approximates the transformation from the original training data ma- trix D train into the retrofitted matrixˆDmatrixˆ matrixˆD train . We obtain T by minimizing the least-square difference in D train · T = ˆ D train . T captures the retrofitting operation, and allows us to modify the test subjects' representations as if age and gender were known, despite the absence of class information. In particular, by applying T to the matrix of the author embeddings in the unla- beled test set D test , we obtain a retrofitted versionˆD versionˆ versionˆD test that preserves the transformation learned on the training data. Since the least-square approxi- mation is not perfect, we find that in practice fit- ting a classifier on the approximation D train · T works better than usingˆDusingˆ usingˆD train , acting as a regu- larizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Classification</head><p>We retrofit the author embeddings in the training set (see 3.2) and learn a translation matrix to trans- form the representations of the remaining authors in the test set. We train three separate Logistic Regression classifiers: one on author embeddings, one on the retrofit embeddings, and one on BOW features. It is technically possible to retrofit BOW representations as well, but in practice, the classi- fier does not converge, as word count-based vec- tors do not represent a continuous space that cap- tures latent similarities.</p><p>We then use the three classifiers to predict the author attributes of the remaining authors in the test data set. We evaluate the results via micro-F1 score (averaged over 100 runs), since our tasks in- clude imbalanced multi-class scenarios: micro-F1 weights the contribution of each class according to their relative size and is therefore more infor- mative than accuracy.</p><p>Since we are interested in the effect of the train- ing set size on performance, we vary the number of available training examples from 1000 to 10,000, using the remaining authors as test set. For each training set size, we collect 100 random subsam- ples and average over them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The learning curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> show that retrofitting outperforms both the original author embeddings and BOW representations for age (top) and gender (bottom) prediction in terms of F1. The effect is stronger when little training data is available. We evaluate the statistical sig- nificance of the difference between results with retrofitting and original embeddings via a boot- strap sampling test. We do not test against BOW, since this is consistently lower than embeddings. The resulting p-value are given in the respective figures. For gender classification, there are small, but not significant improvements with retrofitting. By contrast, for age classification, small values of α (0.01, 0.1, and 0.25) result in significantly better classification than when using any other method.</p><p>The performance differences between the meth- ods are generally more pronounced for age- prediction, which has 10 possible labels, than for gender prediction (two labels). The difference in optimal α value suggests a relation between α and label space.</p><p>In both tasks, the best result is achieved by choosing a low α, i.e., by giving more weight to the demographic association of the users than to their linguistic feature representations. In prac- tice, this value should be determined via cross- validation: here we show different levels of α in order to give some intuition of its on performance. Note that the curves for the original embeddings and BOW are unaffected by α and do not change. We repeat them at each figure for comparison. In- creasing α eventually converges with the original embeddings, but we see that even intermediate val- ues can be close to the original embeddings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We explore retrofitting text-based author embed- dings with non-linguistic demographic informa- tion to increase in-class similarity. This method increases class-separability to improve classifica- tion performance. We use a corpus of almost 100K users, and evaluate the effect of our method on age and gender prediction for various levels of available training data. We find that aggressive retrofitting (prioritizing homophily over linguis- tic embeddings) is beneficial for prediction per- formance, especially when the available amount of training data is limited. While the effect di- minishes with increased training data size, our ap- proach provides a simple method to incorporate non-linguistic knowledge into author representa- tions. For another application (introducing geo- graphic information into city representations), see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hovy and Purschke (2018)</ref>. Our method is fast, simple, and applicable to any problem represented in embedding space. It is therefore a viable pre- processing step to any text-classification task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Schematic representation of 500 authors colored by age group, without (top) and with (bottom) retrofitting</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="3,72.00,221.02,215.43,141.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
