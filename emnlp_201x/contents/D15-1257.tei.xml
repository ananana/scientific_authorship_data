				<p>We present novel experiments in model-ing the rise and fall of story characteristics within narrative, leading up to the Most Reportable Event (MRE), the compelling event that is the nucleus of the story. We construct a corpus of personal narratives from the bulletin board website Reddit, using the organization of Reddit content into topic-specific communities to automatically identify narratives. Leveraging the structure of Reddit comment threads, we automatically label a large dataset of narratives. We present a change-based model of narrative that tracks changes in formality, affect, and other characteristics over the course of a story, and we use this model in distant supervision and self-training experiments that achieve significant improvements over the baselines at the task of identifying MREs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>What is a narrative? In one of the early linguis- tic analyses of storytelling, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prince (1973)</ref> defines a story as describing an event that causes a change of state. Prince's minimal story has three parts: the starting state, the ending state, and the event that transforms the stating state into the ending state. An example of a minimal story is as follows:</p><p>A man was unhappy, then he fell in love, then as a result, he was happy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Polanyi (1976)</ref> notes that minimal stories are toy examples that would never hold an audience's interest. So what makes a story interesting? <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Labov (1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">1997</ref>) defines a well-formed nar- rative as a series of actions leading to a Most Re- portable Event (MRE). The MRE is the point of the story -the most unusual event that has the greatest emotional impact on the narrator and the audience. For a story to be interesting, Prince's change-of-state event should be an MRE.</p><p>The following is an example of a narrative from the corpus we create in this work, with the sen- tence containing the MRE emphasized:</p><p>This isn't exactly creepy, but it's one of the scariest things that's ever happened to me. I was driving down the motor- way with my boyfriend in the passenger seat, and my dad in the seat behind my own. My dad is an epileptic and his fits are extremely sporadic. Sometimes he goes extremely stiff and other times he will try to get out of places or grab and punch people. Mid-conversation I felt his hands wrap around my throat as I was driving, pulling my head back and making it increasingly difficult to drive. My boyfriend managed to help steer the car into the hard shoulder but it was one of the scariest experiences in my life.</p><p>The MRE is the shortest possible summary of a story; it is what we would say about the story if we could only say one thing. If we could identify the MRE of a narrative, we could automatically generate summaries or headline-style titles for on- line stories. Detecting MREs could also allow us to explore how storytellers build emotional impact as they lead up to the climaxes of their stories.</p><p>In this work, we present a novel approach to modeling narrative in order to automatically iden- tify the MRE. The MRE is a real world event un- derlying the story and thus is difficult to infer; in- stead, we identify sentences that describe or re- fer to it. We incorporate Prince's change-of-state formalization as well as Labov's definition of the MRE by modeling changes in story characteristics suggested by Prince, Polanyi, and Labov, such as measures of syntactic complexity and emotional content. If Prince and Labov are both correct, we should find the MRE at a point of change in the story and in our story characteristics.</p><p>We create a corpus of thousands of personal narratives collected from Reddit, a social bul- letin board website organized into topic-specific 'subreddit' communities. We automatically label most of this data using heuristics based on the comment-thread structure of Reddit content. Us- ing this corpus, we conduct two experiments in classifying sentences of a story as containing the MRE or not: the first using distant supervision, and the second using self-training.</p><p>In Section 2, we discuss prior work on automati- cally identifying personal narratives, as well as re- lated experiments using Labov's theory of narra- tive analysis. Section 3 discusses data collection and labeling. Sections 4-5 present our change- based model of narrative and our experiments. Fi- nally, Section 6 discusses our experimental results and proposes directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Prior work using Labov's theory of narrative has focused on classifying clauses by their function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rahimtoroghi et al. (2013)</ref>worked on 20 of Aesop's fables. The 315 clauses were manu- ally annotated with the three labels of <ref type="bibr">Labov and Waltezky (1967)</ref>, Orientation (background in- formation), Action (events), and Evaluation (au- thor's perspective), which we discuss in Section 4. Rahimtoroghi et al. used two annotators with high agreement and achieved accuracy and precision around 0.9 on all three labels, as well as recall above 0.9 on all but Orientation. They noted that their data set was very clean: interannotator agree- ment was nearly perfect, the language was simple, and each clause served a clear narrative purpose.</p><p>Ouyang and McKeown (2014) explored iden- tifying the Action chain of the oral narratives in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Labov (2013)</ref>. They used a dataset of 49 narra- tives (1,277 clauses), transcribed from recordings of speech and annotated by Labov and achieved 0.72 f-score on classifying clauses as Action or not. This task is easier than our proposed task of identifying sentences containing MREs. Ac- tions account for nearly half the clauses in the Labov (2013) dataset, while there are only and average of 2.5 MRE sentences per story. Addi- tionally, identifying Labov's Actions is a problem of detecting causal and temporal relations among events; identifying the MRE is a problem of mea- suring how impactful and shocking an event is. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Swanson et al. (2014)</ref> used 50 stories, which were annotated with an extended label set by three annotators, and each of the 1,602 clauses was as- signed the label given by the majority of annota- tors. The extended label set was then mapped to Labov and Waletzky's three labels. Nearly half of the clauses in this dataset are Evaluations, and Orientations and Actions each make up nearly one quarter of the dataset. Swanson et al. achieved 0.69 overall f-score on three-way classification of clauses. Again, this task is less difficult than our proposed task. The three labels, Orientation, Ac- tion, and Evaluation have distinct functions that are reflected in tense, mood, and a clause's posi- tion in the narrative. The MRE is not a sentence or clause but an event that may be described or re- ferred to by any sentence in a narrative; it is distin- guished from the other events only by its surpris- ingness and emotional impact, dimensions that are difficult to model computationally without a deep semantic understanding of the story.</p><p>The stories that Swanson et al. used were drawn from a corpus drawn from weblog posts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gordon and Swanson, 2009</ref>). Gordon and Swanson used unigram features to classify posts as either stories or not, achieving 75% precision. They note that only about 17% of weblog text consists of stories.</p><p>In contrast to the relatively small datasets used by <ref type="bibr">Rahimtoroghi et al., Ouyang and McKeown, and Swanson et al.,</ref> we use a larger dataset au- tomatically collected from Reddit. Our collection method achieved 94% precision in identifying nar- ratives. A number of researchers have character- ized the structure and use of Reddit, currently the 26 th most popular website in the world <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Weninger et al. (2013)</ref> described the structure of Reddit com- ment threads. Gilbert (2013) measured user par- ticipation in the voting process that ranks Reddit content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Singer et al. (2014)</ref> conducted a longitu- dinal study of the Reddit user community, finding a trend favoring original, user-generated content.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Collection</head><p>We collected data from the AskReddit subreddit, where users post questions for other members of the community, who reply with comments answer- ing the questions. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows some examples of these posts, and we can see some of the wide variety of story topics found on AskReddit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post Title</head><p>Whats your creepiest (REAL LIFE) story?</p><p>Your best "Accidentally Racist" story? What are your stories of petty revenge? <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Examples of AskReddit posts.</p><p>Using PRAW 2 , we scraped the top 50 AskRed- dit posts containing the keyword 'story.' Of these posts, 10 were tagged as NSFW ('not safe for work'), indicating they contained adult content; we did not use these posts in this work, as we felt the language would be too different from that used in posts without the tag. Another 3 posts did not contain personal narratives, and instead were about fictional stories in movies or music.</p><p>With the 37 remaining posts, we treated each top-level comment (those that replied directly to the posted question) as a story. The example given in Section 1 is one such story. We collected 6,000 top-level comments and discarded those without comment threads replying to them. As we discuss in Section 3.2, we use comment threads to auto- matically label our training data. We tokenized the top-level comments by sentence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bird et al., 2009)</ref> and removed all sentences following any varia- tion of the word 'EDIT', as these were usually re- sponses to readers' comments. We discarded texts with fewer than three sentences, based on Prince's definition of a minimal story as consisting of a starting state, an event, and an ending state. We are left with 4,896 stories, with an average length of 16 sentences and a maxiumum of 198.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Labeling</head><p>We partitioned our data into development, seed, and tuning sets of 100 stories each; a testing set of 200 stories; and a training set of 4,178 stories. The development, seed, tuning, and testing sets were manually annotated by a native English speaker (not one of the authors), who was instructed to label all sentences that contained or referred to the MRE. For convenience, from here on, we will use the term 'MRE' to refer to both the Most Re- portable Event itself (of which there can only be 2 https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/v2.1.20/, Python Reddit API Wrapper one per narrative) and to sentences that contain or refer to it (of which there can be more than one).</p><p>To measure interannotator agreement, we also had a second annotator (also a native English speaker and not one of the authors) label MREs in the 100 narratives in our development set. We found substantial agreement (Cohen's κ = 0.729); the two classes, MRE and not-MRE, are highly unbalanced, so percent agreement between the two annotators was extremely high (95%).</p><p>In addition to labeling the MREs, our first an- notator identified and discarded 31 texts that were not true stories, but rather Reddit-specific inside jokes or comments on how cool the stories in the thread were. From this, we can see that the pre- cision of our story collection method is very high. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gordon et al. (2007)</ref> found that stories were 17% of the weblog text that they collected; of the 500 texts given to our annotators, 94% were stories.</p><p>Using the development set, we experimented with seven heuristics, defined below, for automat- ically labeling the training set. Each predicts a sentence index s h to be the index of an MRE. We measured the performance of each heuristic using root-mean-square error (RMSE), which measures the standard deviation of how far the heuristic's predictions fall from a true MRE.</p><p>Let N = number of narratives</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s M RE = index of a true MRE RM SE = 1 N N i=1 (s M RE i − s h i ) 2</formula><p>We used a linear combination of three heuristics with the lowest RMSE to label our training set.</p><p>Similarity to comment. The bag-of-words co- sine similarity between a sentence and comments replying to the story. We expect comments to re- fer to the MRE because of its shocking nature and importance to the story. This heuristic achieved RMSE of 5.5 sentences on the development set.</p><p>Similarity to tl;dr. The latent semantic simi- larity between a sentence and the tl;dr. The tl;dr (too long; didn't read) is a very short paraphrase of a post given by its author. They are relatively rare -663 stories, or 14% of our data, had tl;drs. Since the MRE is the central event of the story, we expect it to be included in the tl;dr. We calculated the similarity using the weighted matrix factoriza- tion algorithm described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guo and Diab (2012)</ref>. This heuristic achieved RMSE of 5.8 sentences.</p><p>In contrast, bag-of-words cosine similarity to the tl;dr performed poorly (RMSE of 13.2). This is due to the tl;dr being both short and a paraphrase of its story. There are few words in the tl;dr, and those words are often synonyms of, but not the same as, words in the story. Guo and Diab's la- tent semantic similarity score addresses this word sparsity problem by modeling words that are not present in the input text. We also experimented with latent semantic similarity for the similarity- to-comment and similarity-to-prompt heuristics, but in these two cases, it did not perform as well as the bag-of-words cosine similarity.</p><p>Similarity to prompt. The bag-of-words cosine similarity between a sentence and the AskReddit post that prompted the story. The story should be relevant to the prompt, so we expect the MRE to be similar to the prompt text. This heuris- tic achieved RMSE of 6.3 sentences.</p><p>We used the heuristic with the fourth lowest RMSE as one of the baselines in our experiments:</p><p>Last sentence. The last sentence in the story. Since the events of a story build up to the MRE, the MRE should occur near the end of the story. This heuristic achieved RMSE of 6.9 sentences.</p><p>Other heuristics. We also tried the following:</p><p>• Single-sentence paragraph (RMSE of 8.7). This heuristic was meant to capture empha- sis, as an MRE might be placed in its own, separate paragraph to draw attention to it.</p><p>• First sentence (RMSE of 13.7). Narra- tives occasionally open with a brief introduc- tory paragraph that summarizes the events to come. This heuristic was meant to capture a reference to the MRE in this introduction. The training set was automatically labeled using a linear combination of the three best-performing heuristics: similarity to comment, similarity to tl;dr, and similarity to prompt.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h label = 0.2 * h comment + 0.5 * h tldr + 0.3 * h prompt</formula><p>This outperformed each of the three alone, achiev- ing an RMSE of 5.1 sentences. The weights for each heuristic were tuned on the development set. For stories without a tl;dr, that heuristic was set to 0. The sentence in the story with the highest heuristic score was selected as the MRE.</p><p>In 52 of the 99 stories in the development set, we found that multiple, consecutive sentences were labeled by our annotator as MREs. The av- erage number of consecutive MREs was 2.5 sen- tences. To reflect this, we labeled our training set  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Distribution of labels (*manual).</p><p>in three-sentence blocks. The sentence selected by our labeling heuristic, along with the imme- diately preceding and following sentences, were all labeled as MREs. The result was the weakly- labeled training set in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Modeling Narrative</head><p>Our approach to modeling narrative is based on both <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Labov (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prince (1973)</ref>. We claim that Labov's MRE is Prince's change of state with the added requirement of reportability or interest- ingness -in fact, all three components of Prince's minimal story have equivalences in Labov. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Labov and Waletzky (1967)</ref> proposed three components of narrative: the Orientation, which we equate with Prince's starting state; the Ac- tion, the chain of events culminating in the MRE; and the Evaluation, the author's perspective on the story. Labov (2013) adds three more components: the Resolution, equivalent to Prince's ending state, and the Abstract and Coda, where the author intro- duces and concludes the story.</p><p>We focus on Prince's claim that stories are about change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Polanyi (1985)</ref> observes that the turning point of a story is marked by a change in style, formality of language, or emphasis in the telling of the story. Labov (2013) likewise observes that a change in verb tense often accompanies MREs. We hypothesize that the MRE should be found at a point of change in the story.</p><p>We score each sentence according to three views of narrative: syntax, semantics, and affect.</p><p>Syntax. We model Polanyi's claim that a change in formality marks the changing point by including metrics of sentential syntax; we use the syntactic complexity of a sentence as an ap- proximation for formality. The complexity of a sentence also reflects emphasis -short, staccato sentences bear more emphasis than long, com- plicated ones. We use the length of the sen-tence, the length of its verb phrase, and the ra- tio of these two lengths; the depth of the sen- tence's parse tree ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Klein and Manning, 2003)</ref>, the depth of its verb phrase's subtree, and the ra- tio of these two depths. We also use the aver- age word length for the sentence and the syntactic complexity formula proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Botel and Granowsky (1972)</ref>, which scores sentences on spe- cific structures, such as passives, appositives, and clausal subjects. Finally, we use the formality and complexity dictionaries described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pavlick and Nenkova (2015)</ref>, which provide human formal- ity judgments for 7,794 words and short phrases and complexity judgments for 5,699 words and phrases. We score each sentence by averaging across all words and phrases in the sentence.</p><p>Semantics. As the MRE is surprising and shocking, we expect it to be dissimilar from the surrounding sentences; we use semantic similarity to surrounding sentences as a measure of shock. Our semantic scores are the bag-of-words cosine and the latent semantic similarity scores for adja- cent sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Guo and Diab, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Affect. A change in affect reflects a change in style, and we expect the MRE to occur at an emotional peak. We use the Dictionary of Af- fect in Language (DAL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Whissell, 1989)</ref>, aug- mented with WordNet for coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Miller, 1995)</ref>. The DAL represents lexical affect with three scores: evaluation (ee, hereafter 'pleasantness' to avoid confusion with Labov's Evaluation), activa- tion (aa, activeness), and imagery (ii, concrete- ness). We also use a fourth score, the activation- evaluation (AE) norm, a measure of subjectivity defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al. (2009)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">norm = √ ee 2 + aa 2</formula><p>ii For each of these four word-level scores, we cal- culate a sentence-level score by averaging across the words in the sentence using the finite state ma- chine described by Agarwal et al. We expect the sentences surrounding an MRE to be more sub- jective and emotional as the impact of the MRE becomes clear. We also expect a build-up in ac- tiveness and intensity, peaking at the MRE.</p><p>To model change over the course of a narrative, we look for changes in the syntactic, semantic, and affectual scores. To illustrate this, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the activeness and pleasantness DAL scores for the example narrative given in Section 1. We can see how the MRE is the most exciting sentence in the story -global maximum in activation -as well as the most horrifying -global minimum in pleasant- ness. The overall shape of the activeness scores reflects Prince's three components of a minimal story: low initial activation (starting state) and low final activation (ending state) with a build up to a peak at the MRE (change in state) between them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>Using our Reddit dataset and change-based model of narrative, we conducted two experiments on au- tomatically identifying MREs. We compare our results with three baselines: random, our labeling heuristic, and the last sentence of the story ( best- performing heuristic not used in labeling). As described in Section 3.2, we labeled our training set in blocks of three consecutive MREs, centered on the sentence from each narrative that was selected by our heuristics. To account for this, in our experiments and baselines, we predicted the presence of an MRE in a three-sentence block. In testing, we considered a predicted block to be cor- rect if it contained at least one gold-label MRE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Features</head><p>Change-based Features. For each of the fif- teen metrics in Section 4, shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we first smooth the scores by applying a Gaussian fil- ter. We also tried weighted and exponential mov- ing averages, as well as a Hamming window, but the Gaussian performed best in experiments on our tuning set. We then generate 11 features for each sentence: the metric score at the sentence; whether or not the sentence is a local maximum or minimum; the sentence's distance from the global Type Metric Names Syntactic sentlength, vplength, lengthratio, sentdepth, vpdepth, depthratio wordlength, structcomplexity, wordformality, wordcomplexity Semantic cossimilarity, lssimilarity Affectual pleasantness, activation, imagery, subjectivity <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The fifteen metrics for change.</p><p>maximum and minimum; the difference in score between the sentence and the preceding sentence, the difference between the sentence and the fol- lowing sentence, and the average of these differ- ences (approximating the incoming, outgoing, and self-slopes for the metric); and the incoming, outgoing, and self-differences of differences (ap- proximating the second derivative).</p><p>Other Features.</p><p>• The tense of the main verb and whether or not there is a shift from the previous sentence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Labov (2013)</ref> suggests a shift between the past and the historical present near the MRE.</p><p>• The position of the sentence in the narrative.</p><p>• The bag-of-words cosine similarity and latent semantic similarity between the sentence and the first and second sentences in the narra- tive. The MRE usually appears near the end of a story, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Labov (2013)</ref> notes that the Abstract, a short introduction that occurs in some narratives, often refers to the MRE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Distant Supervision</head><p>Our first experiment used a distant supervision ap- proach with our automatically-labeled training set. Distant supervision has previously been applied to NLP problems such as sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Go et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Purver and Battersby, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Suttles and Ide, 2013</ref>) and relation extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yao et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hoffmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krause et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Min et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu et al., 2013</ref>). We classify blocks of three sentences as con- taining the MRE or not. The two classes, MRE and not-MRE, were weighted inversely to their fre- quencies in the weakly-labeled set, and all features were normalized to the range <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>. We trained an SVM with margin C = 1 and an RBF kernel with γ = 0.001, chosen using grid search on our tuning set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Distant supervision results (*p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>The results of the distant supervision experi- ment are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Our best results use all features, but, notably, using the change-based features alone achieves significant improvement over the three baselines (p &lt; 0.00005). The 'no change' trial used the metric scores themselves and the 'other' features but none of the change- based features, such as slopes and proximity to global extremes. This feature set was outper- formed by the random baseline (p &lt; 0.0024), sup- porting our hypothesis that it is change in a metric, rather than the score itself, that predicts MREs.</p><p>Because we used an non-linear kernel, we were not able to examine feature weights directly. In- stead, <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref> shows the results of a logistic re- gression model trained on our features. The 10 best features are shown, along with their weights and 95% confidence intervals. From feature 8, we see that the MRE is found in sentences near the narrative's global minimum in imagery (the Eval- uation), but feature 1 indicates that sentences con- taining the MRE show a sharp increase in imagery compared to the previous sentences. The MRE is described in a burst of vivid language, followed by more abstract author opinions .</p><p>Features 2 and 9 indicate that the MRE tends to be described using informal language -a textual echo to Labov's observation that the subjects of his sociolinguistic interviews spoke less formally and more colloquially as they relived the climaxes of their stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Labov, 2013)</ref>. Feature 3 suggests that sentences containing the MRE are similar to the surrounding sentences. While we expected MRE sentences to be different from their neighbors due to the unusual and shocking nature of the MRE, this feature seems instead to reinforce the idea that MREs tend to described over the course of multi- ple, consecutive sentences, rather than in a single  sentence. From feature 4, we see, as expected, that the MRE is far from the narrative's global mini- mum in activeness, as it is the end of a chain of events, far away from the stative Orientation. Finally, features 5 and 10 suggest that MRE sen- tences are not only long, but much longer than the preceding sentences, and feature 6 indicates that MRE sentences are close to the global minimum in average word length. Shorter average word length is expected, as an indicator of both informal word choice and emphasis. Long sentences, however, suggest a domain difference between our work on text and Labov's work on transcribed speech. Looking over our development set, we find that many authors combine the description of the MRE with evaluative material in a single sentence, re- sulting in a longer and more syntactically complex MRE sentence than is found in Labov's data.</p><note type="other">6. distancefrommin wordlength neg 3.321 (3.018, 3.624) 7. distancefrommin vpdepth 3.034 (2.823, 3.247) 8. distancefrommin imagery neg 2.790 (2.524, 3.056) 9. wordformality neg 2.329 (2.226, 2.432) 10. incomingd2 vplen 2.128 (1.938, 2.318)</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Self-Training</head><p>Our second experiment used a self-training ap- proach, where a classifier uses a small, labeled seed set to label a larger training set. Self-training has been applied to parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McClosky et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Reichart and Rappoport, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McClosky and Charniak, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Huang and Harper, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sagae, 2010)</ref> and word sense disambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mihalcea, 2004</ref>). With the same parameters as in the distant supervision experiment, we trained an SVM on our hand-labeled seed set of 958 sen- tences. We used this initial model to relabel the training set. All sentences where this labeling agreed with our automatically-generated heuristic labels were added to the seed set and used to train a new model, which was in turn used to label the re- maining sentences, and so on until none of the cur- rent model's labels agreed with any of the remain- ing heuristic labels. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the learning curve for the self-training experiment, along with the growth of the self-training set. The results of the self-training experiment are shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. We achieve the best perfor- mance, f1 = 0.635, after 9 rounds of self-training. Self-training terminated after 10 rounds, but the 10 th round had no effect on performance.  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Best self-training results (*p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>The initial model, trained only on the seed set, performed nearly as well as our distant supervi-sion experiment. This illustrates that quantity of data does not overcome the use of accurate man- ual labels on a small dataset. As described in Sec- tion 3.2, the distant supervision labels were based on a linear combination of three heuristics that achieved at best an RMSE of 5.1 sentences. How- ever, with self-training, we can exploit the noisy heuristic labels by using only those labels that agree with the seed-trained model, thus reducing the amount of noise. 52,147 of the 67,954 weakly- labeled sentences were used in self-training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Future Work</head><p>Identifying MREs is a hard problem. A human annotator can rely on world knowledge to find the most shocking and impactful event in a story, but we do not have access to that knowledge. Addi- tionally, MREs are rare, comprising 15% of the sentences in our hand-annotated datasets. MREs comprise just over 16% of our weakly-labeled training set, but as we discuss below, there is too much noise in the automatically-generated labels.</p><p>Despite the difficulty of the task, our ex- periments show that our change-based model of narrative is effective for identifying MREs, and this model provides evidence supporting the change-in-state view of narrative suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prince (1973)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Polanyi (1985)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Labov (1997)</ref>. We achieve high recall with self-training (95%), but precision is low across the board. This sug- gests that, while MREs do occur at extremes in syntactic complexity, semantic similarity, and emotional activation, there may be many non- MRE local extremes throughout a narrative.</p><p>Examining our results, we find a few common sources of error. False positive sentences tend to have high imagery and activeness. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref>, we saw that imagery and activeness alone do not indi- cate the presence of the MRE. An MRE sentence is not just active; it is separated from the stative in- troduction by the other events of the story. Nor is it enough for a sentence to have high imagery; the MRE is more vividly described than the preceding events -we see again the importance of change in our model of narrative. False negatives tend to have high scores in syntactic complexity and for- mality. As low formality was one of our stronger predictors of MRE sentences, we may need to ad- just these features in future work.</p><p>We also hope to refine our automatically- generated labels in future work. Our self-training experiment showed that 27% of our automatically- generated labels were too noisy to use. We also hope to improve our filters for automatically dis- carding non-story text. We currently reject texts shorter than three sentences, based on Prince's three-part definition of a story. In spite of this fil- tering, 7% of our 500 manually-labeled texts were identified as non-stories by our annotator. Extrap- olating to our training set, we suspect that over 300 of our training 'narratives' are not narratives at all.</p><p>Finally, we hope to explore other theories of narrative analysis that could suggest new ways to quantify change in narrative. Prince, Polanyi, and Labov propose a high-level view of personal narrative: stories are centered around reportable events that cause a change in state for the author. This work tested fifteen surface-level features that reflect this change in state. Are there others? Or is a deeper semantic understanding of the starting and ending states of stories required?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have described a new model of narrative based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prince (1973)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Polanyi (1985)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Labov (1997)</ref>. Our model tracks story charac- terstics over the course of a narrative, capturing change in complexity, meaning, and emotion.</p><p>We have created a corpus of 4,896 personal nar- ratives, taking advantage of AskReddit, a com- munity where members often prompt each other for stories. Our experiments on this corpus show that our change-based model is able to identify MREs. They also demonstrate that large quanti- ties of hand-labeled data are not required for this task. Our distant supervision and self-training approaches successfully use data weakly labeled using heuristic rules that leverage the comment thread structure of Reddit content. We believe these Reddit stories are representative of the short, personal narratives found online in blogs or dis- cussion forums, and so this work should be use- ful for finding MREs in a variety of online per- sonal narratives. The one difference between this data and stories from other online sources is the prompt. A personal narrative posted to someone's personal blog is unlikely to have a prompt. We use the prompt for our heuristic labeling, so our automatic labels on non-Reddit data may be nois- ier, but many blog posts also have titles or tags that may be just as useful.</p><p>Identifying MREs is a hard problem that has not previously been addressed in work on computa- tional narrative. We have shown that the high-level view proposed by linguistic theories of narrative - that stories are about change -holds true. Mea- suring change over the course of a narrative yields better results than other features and baselines. Why do we care about MREs? <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Polanyi (1976)</ref> asserts that "one does not produce a narrative text for no reason at all." The Most Reportable Event is that reason. It is the point of the story; the shortest possible summary; the answer to the question, "So what?". It could be used to generate titles or sum- maries to be used in organizing stories for readers to browse, or it could be used in recommendation systems to help readers find related stories. In fu- ture work we hope to be able to generate a text description the full MRE, which would be better suited to summarization or generating headlines, rather than identifying sentences that refer to it. We hope this work will encourage others to fur- ther investigate the Most Reportable Event.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Activeness and pleasantness scores.</figDesc></figure>
