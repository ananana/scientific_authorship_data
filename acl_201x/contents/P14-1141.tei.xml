				<p>Instructor intervention in student discussion forums is a vital component in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where personalized interaction is limited. This paper introduces the problem of predicting instructor interventions in MOOC forums. We propose several prediction models designed to capture unique aspects of MOOCs, combining course information , forum structure and posts content. Our models abstract contents of individual posts of threads using latent categories, learned jointly with the binary intervention prediction problem. Experiments over data from two Coursera MOOCs demonstrate that incorporating the structure of threads into the learning problem leads to better predictive performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Ubiquitous computing and easy access to high bandwidth internet have reshaped the modus operandi in distance education towards Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Courses offered by ventures such as Coursera and Udacity now im- part inexpensive and high-quality education from field-experts to thousands of learners across geo- graphic and cultural barriers.</p><p>Even as the MOOC model shows exciting pos- sibilities, it presents a multitude of challenges that must first be negotiated to completely realize its potential. MOOCs platforms have been especially criticized on grounds of lacking a personalized educational experience <ref type="bibr">(Edmundson, 2012)</ref>. Un- like traditional classrooms, the predominant mode of interaction between students and instructors in MOOCs is via online discussion forums. Ideally, forum discussions can help make up for the lack of direct interaction, by enabling students to ask questions and clarify doubts. However, due to huge class sizes, even during the short duration of a course, MOOCs witness a very large number of threads on these forums. Owing to extremely skewed ratios of students to instructional staff, it can be prohibitively time-consuming for the in- structional staff to manually follow all threads of a forum. Hence there is a pressing need for automat- ically curating the discussions for the instructors.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on identifying situa- tions in which instructor (used interchangeably with "instructional staff" in this paper) interven- tion is warranted. Using existing forum posts and interactions, we frame this as a binary prediction problem of identifying instructor's intervention in forum threads. Our initial analysis revealed that instructors usually intervene on threads discussing students' issues close to a quiz or exam. They also take interest in grading issues and logistics problems. There are multiple cues specific to the MOOC setting, which when combined with the rich lexical information present in the forums, can yield useful predictive models.</p><p>Analyzing forum-postings contents and bring- ing the most pertinent content to the instructor's attention would help instructors receive timely feedback and design interventions as needed. From the students' perspective, the problem is ev- ident from an examination of existing forum con- tent, indicating that if students want instructor's input on some issues, the only way for them to get his/her attention is by 'up-voting' their votes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 1</ref> provides some examples of this behavior. This is clearly an inefficient solution.</p><p>Our main technical contribution is introducing three different models addressing the task of pre- dicting instructor interventions. The first uses a lo- gistic regression model that primarily incorporates high level information about threads and posts. However, forum threads have structure which is not leveraged our initial model. We present two "The problem summary: Anyone else having problems viewing the video lecture...very choppy. If you are also experi- encing this issue; please upvote this post." "I read that by up-voting threads and posts you can get the instructors' attention faster." "Its is very bad to me that I achieved 10 marks in my 1st assignment and now 9 marks in my 2nd assignment, now I won't get certificate, please Course staff it is my appeal to change the passing scheme or please be lenient. Please upvote my post so that staff take this problem under consideration." <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref>: Sample posts that showing students desiring instructor's attention have to resolve to the ineffi- cient method of getting their posts upvoted.</p><p>additional structured models. Both models assume that posts of a thread structure it in form of a story or a "chain of events." For example, an opening post of a thread might pose a question and the fol- lowing posts can then answer or comment on the question. Our second and third models tap this linear 'chain of events' behavior by assuming that individual posts belong to latent categories which represent their textual content at an abstract level and that an instructor's decision to reply to a post is based on this chain of events (represented by the latent categories). We present two different ways of utilizing this 'chain of events' behavior for pre- dicting instructor's intervention which can be ei- ther simply modeled as the 'next step' is this chain of events (Linear Chain Markov Model) or as a decision globally depending on the entire chain (Global Chain Model). Our experiments on two different datasets reveal that using the latent post categories helps in better prediction.</p><p>Our contributions can be summarized as:</p><p>• We motivate and introduce the important problem of predicting instructor intervention in MOOC forums • We present two chain based models that in- corporate thread structure.</p><p>• We show the utility of modeling thread struc- ture, and the value of lexical and domain spe- cific knowledge for the prediction task</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, the problem of pre- dicting instructor's intervention in MOOC forums has not been addressed yet. Prior work deals with analyzing general online discussion forums of so- cial media sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kleinberg, 2013)</ref>: such as pre- dicting comment volume ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Backstrom et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">De Choudhury et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Tsagkias et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yano and Smith, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artzi et al., 2012</ref>) and rate of content diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kwak et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lerman and Ghosh, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakshy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Romero et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artzi et al., 2012</ref>) and also question answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaturvedi et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang et al. (2007)</ref> incorporate thread structure of conversations using features in email threads while <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Goldwasser and Daumé III (2014)</ref> use la- tent structure, aimed to identify relevant dialog segments, for predicting objections during court- room deliberations. Other related work include speech act recognition in emails and forums but at a sentence level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jeong et al., 2009)</ref>, and us- ing social network analysis to improve message classification into pre-determined types ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fortuna et al., 2007)</ref>. Discussion forums data has also been used to address other interesting challenges such as extracting chatbox knowledge for use in gen- eral online forums ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huang et al., 2007)</ref> and auto- matically extracting answers from discussion fo- rums ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Catherine et al., 2013)</ref>, subjectivity analy- sis of online forums ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Biyani et al., 2013</ref>). Most of these methods use ideas similar to ours: identi- fying that threads (or discussions) have an under- lying structure and that messages belong to cate- gories. However, they operate in a different do- main, which makes their goals and methods dif- ferent from ours.</p><p>Our work is most closely related to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Backstrom et al. (2013)</ref> which introduced the re-entry prediction task -predicting whether a user who has participated in a thread will later contribute another comment to it. While seemingly related, their prediction task, focusing on users who have already commented on a thread, and their algorith- mic approach are different than ours. Our work is also very closely related to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wang et al. (2013)</ref> who predict solvedness -which predicts if there is a solution to the original problem posted in the thread. Like us, they believe that category of posts can assist in the prediction task, however, possibly owing to the complexity of general dis- cussion forums, they had to manually create and annotate data with a sophisticated taxonomy. We do not make such assumptions.</p><p>The work presented in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gómez et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kumar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Golub and Jackson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aumayr et al., 2011</ref>) discuss characteriz- ing threads using reply-graphs (often trees) and learning this structure. However, this representa- tion is not natural for the MOOC domain where discussions are relatively more focused on the thread topic and are better organized using sec- tions within the forums.</p><p>Although most prior work focuses on discus- sion forums of social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook, where the dynamics of interaction is very different from MOOCs, a small number of recent work address the unique MOOC setting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stump et al. (2013)</ref> propose a framework for categorizing forum posts by designing a taxonomy and annotating posts manually to assist general fo- rum analysis. Our model learns categories in a data-driven manner guided by the binary super- vision (intervention decision) and serves a differ- ent purpose. Nevertheless, in Sec. 4.3 we compare the categories learnt by our models with those pro- posed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stump et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Apart from this, recent works have looked into interesting challenges in this domain such as bet- ter peer grading models ( ), code review ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nguyen et al., 2014</ref>), improving student engagement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson et al., 2014</ref>) and understanding how students learn and code <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Piech et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kizilcec et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ramesh et al., 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Intervention Prediction Models</head><p>In this section, we explain our models in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Setting</head><p>In our description it is assumed that a discus- sion board is organized into multiple forums (rep- resenting topics such as "Assignment", "Study Group" etc.). A forum consists of multiple threads. Each thread (t) has a title and consists of multiple posts (p i ). Individual posts do not have a title and the number of posts varies dramatically from one thread to another. We address the prob- lem of predicting if the course instructor would in- tervene on a thread, t. The instructor's decision to intervene, r, equals 0 when the instructor doesn't reply to the thread and 1 otherwise. The individual posts are not assumed to be labeled with any cat- egory and the only supervision given to the model during training is in form of intervention decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Logistic Regression (LR)</head><p>Our first attempt at solving this problem involved training a logistic regression for the binary predic- tion task which models P (r|t).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Feature Engineering</head><p>Our logistic regression model uses the follow- ing two types of features: Thread only features and Aggregated post features. 'Thread only fea- tures' capture information about the thread such as when, where, by who was the thread posted and lexical features based on the title of the thread. While these features provide a high-level infor- mation about the thread, it is also important to analyze the contents of the posts of the thread. In order to maintain a manageable feature space, we compress the features from posts and represent them using our 'Aggregated post features'. Thread only features:</p><p>1. a binary feature indicating if the thread was started by an anonymous user 2. three binary features indicating whether the thread was marked as approved, unresolved or deleted (respectively) 3. forum id in which the thread was posted 4. time when the thread was started related words e.g. grade, exam, assignment, quiz, reading, project etc. in the posts 13. sum of count of occurrences of words indicat- ing technical problems e.g. problem, error 14. sum of count of occurrences of thread con- clusive words like thank you and thank 15. sum of count of occurrences of request, sub- mit, suggest We had also considered and dropped (because of no performance gain) other features about iden- tity of the user who started the thread, number of distinct participants in the thread (an impor- tant feature used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Backstrom et al. (2013)</ref>), bi- nary feature indicating if the first and the last posts were by the same user, average number of words in the thread's posts, lexical features capturing ref- erences to the instructors in the posts etc.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h 1 h 2 h n r φ(t) p 1 p 2 p n T (a) Linear Chain Markov Model (LCMM) h 1 h 2 h n r φ(t) p 1 p 2 p n T (b) Global Chain Model (GCM)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Linear Chain Markov Model (LCMM)</head><p>The logistic regression model is good at exploit- ing the thread level features but not the content of individual posts. The 'Aggregated post features' attempt to capture this information but since the number of posts in a thread is variable, these fea- tures relied on aggregated values. We believe that considering aggregate values is not sufficient for the task in hand. As noted before, posts of a thread are not independent of each other. Instead, they are arranged chronologically such that a post is published in reply to the preceding posts and this For every thread, t, in the dataset:</p><p>1. Choose a start state, h 1 , and emit the first post, p 1 . 2. For every subsequent post, p i ∀ i ∈ {2 . . . n} : (a) Transition from h i−1 to h i . (b) Emit post p i . 3. Generate the instructor's intervention decision, r, using the last state h n and non-structural features, φ(t). might effect an instructor's decision to reply. For example, consider a thread that starts with a ques- tion. The following posts will be students' attempt to answer the question or raise further concerns or comment on previous posts. The instructor's post, though a future event, will be a part of this process.</p><p>We, therefore, propose to model this complete process using a linear chain markov model shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a</ref>. The model abstractly represents the in- formation from individual posts (p i ) using latent categories (h i ). The intervention decision, r, is the last step in the chain and thus incorporates in- formation from the individual posts. It also de- pends on the thread level features: 'Thread only features' and the 'Aggregated post features' jointly represented by φ(t) (also referred to as the non- structural features). This process is explained in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>.</p><p>We use hand-crafted features to model the dy- namics of the generative process. Whenever a la- tent state emits a post or transits to another latent state (or to the final intervention decision state), emission and transition features get fired which are then multiplied by respective weights to compute a thread's 'score':</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f w (t, p) = max h [w · φ(p, r, h, t)]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Note that the non-structural features, φ(t), also contribute to the final score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Learning and Inference</head><p>During training we maximize the combined scores of all threads in the dataset using a generic EM style algorithm. The supervision in this model is provided only in form of the observed interven- tion decision, r and the post categories, h i are hid-den. The model uses the pseudocode shown in Al- gorithm 1 to iteratively refine the weight vectors.</p><p>In each iteration, the model first uses viterbi algo- rithm to decode thread sequences with the current weights w t to find optimal highest scoring latent state sequences that agree with the observed in- tervention state (r = r ). In the next step, given the latent state assignments from the previous step, a structured perceptron algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collins, 2002</ref>) is used to update the weights w t+1 using weights from the previous step, w t , initialization. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ˆ h i = arg max h [w t · φ(p,</formula><note type="other">r, h, t)] such that r = r i ∀i 6: w t+1 = StructuredPerceptron(t, p, ˆ h, r) 7: end for 8: return w</note><p>While testing, we use the learned weights and viterbi decoding to compute the intervention state and the best scoring latent category sequence. ) in p i if the state is h i ; 0 otherwise. 5. φ(p i , h i ) = count of occurrences of request, submit or suggest in p i if the state is h i ; 0 otherwise. 6. φ(p i , h i ) = log(course duration/t(p i )) if the state is h i ; 0 otherwise.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Global Chain Model (GCM)</head><p>In this model we propose another way of incorpo- rating the chain structure of a thread. Like the pre- vious model, this model also assumes that posts belong to latent categories. It, however, doesn't model the instructor's intervention decision as a step in the thread generation process. Instead, it assumes that instructor's decision to intervene is dependent on all the posts in the threads, mod- eled using the latent post categories. This model is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2b</ref>. Assuming that p represents posts of thread t, h represents the latent category assignments, r represents the intervention deci- sion; feature vector, φ(p, r, h, t), is extracted for each thread and using the weight vector, w, this model defines a decision function, similar to what is shown in Equation 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Learning and Inference</head><p>Similar to the traditional maximum margin based Support Vector Machine (SVM) formulation, our model's objective function is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min w λ 2 ||w|| 2 + T j l(−r j f w (t j , p j ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where λ is the regularization coefficient, t j is the j th thread with intervention decision r j and p j are the posts of this thread. w is the weight vector, l(·) is the squared hinge loss function and f w (t j , p j ) is defined in Equation 1. Replacing the term f w (t j , p j ) with the con- tents of Equation 1 in the minimization objective above, reveals the key difference from the tradi- tional SVM formulation -the objective function has a maximum term inside the global minimiza- tion problem making it non-convex.</p><p>We, therefore, employ the optimization algo- rithm presented in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chang et al., 2010)</ref> to solve this problem. Exploiting the semi-convexity prop- erty <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Felzenszwalb et al., 2010)</ref>, the algorithm works in two steps, each executed iteratively. In the first step, it determines the latent variable as- signments for positive examples. The algorithm then performs two step iteratively -first it deter- mines the structural assignments for the negative examples, and then optimizes the fixed objective function using a cutting plane algorithm. Once this process converges for negative examples, the algorithm reassigns values to the latent variables for positive examples, and proceeds to the second step. The algorithm stops once a local minimum is reached. A somewhat similar approach, which uses the Convex-Concave Procedure (CCCP) is presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yu and Joachims, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>At test time, given a thread, t, and it posts, p, we use the learned weights to compute f w (t, p) and classify it as belonging to the positive class (instructor intervenes) if f w (t, p) ≥ 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Feature Engineering</head><p>The feature set used by this model is very sim- ilar to the features used by the previous model. In addition to the non-structural features used by the logistic regression model (Sec. 3.2.1), it uses all the Post Emission features and the three transition features represented by φ(h i−1 , h i ) and φ(h i−1 , h i , p i , p i−1 ) as described in Sec. 3.3.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Datasets and Evaluation Measure</head><p>For our experiments, we have used the forum content of two MOOCs from different domains (science and humanities), offered by Coursera 1 , a leading education technology company. Both courses were taught by professors from the Uni- versity of Maryland, College Park.</p><p>Genes and the Human Condition (From Behav- ior to Biotechnology) (GHC) dataset. 2 This course was attended by 30,000 students and the instructional staff comprised of 2 instructors, 3 Teaching Assistants and 56 technical support staff. The discussion forum of this course consisted of 980 threads composed of about 3,800 posts.</p><p>Women and the Civil Rights Movement (WCR) dataset. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The course consisted of a classroom of about 14,600 students, 1 instructor, 6 Teaching Assistants and 49 support staff. Its discussion fo- rum consisted of 800 threads and 3,900 posts.</p><p>We evaluate our models on held-out test sets. For the GHC dataset, the test set consisted of 186 threads out of which the instructor intervened on 24 while, for the WCR dataset, the instructor in- tervened on 21 out of 155 threads.</p><p>Also, it was commonly observed that after an instructor intervenes on a thread, its posting and/or viewing behavior increases. We, therefore, only consider the student posts until the instructor's first intervention. Care was also taken to not use fea- tures that increased/decreased disproportionately because of the instructor's intervention such as number of views or votes of a thread.</p><p>In our evaluation we approximate instructor's 'should reply' instances with those where the in- structor indeed replied. Unlike general forum users, we believe that the correlation between the two scenarios is quite high for instructors. It is their responsibility to reply, and by choosing to a MOOC, they have 'bought in' to the idea of forum participation. The relatively smaller class sizes of these two MOOCs also ensured that most threads were manually reviewed, thus reducing instances of 'missed' threads while retaining the posting be- havior and content of a typical MOOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experimental Results</head><p>Since the purpose of solving this problem is to identify the threads which should be brought to the notice of the instructors, we measure the per- formance of our models using F-measure of the positive class.

This validates our hypothesis that us- ing the post structure results in better modeling of instructor's intervention.</p><p>The table also reveals that GCM yields high pre- cision and low recall values, which is possibly due to the model being more conservative owing to in- formation from all posts of the thread.</p></div>

The value of H (num- ber of categories) was set to be 4 and was pre- determined during the model selection procedure. Each row of the heat map represents a category and the columns represent values of individual fea- tures, f (w, c), defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f (w, c) = C(w,c) &lt;C(w,c)&gt;</formula><p>where, C(w, c) is total count of occurrences of a word, w, in all posts assigned to category, c and &lt; C(w, c) &gt; represents its expected count based on its frequency in the dataset. While the actual size of vocabulary is huge, we use only a small subset of words in our feature vector for this visu- alization. These feature values, after normaliza- tion, are represented in the heat map using col- ors ranging from bright cream (high value) to dark black (low value). The darker the shade of a cell, the lower is the value represented by it.</p><p>For visual convenience, the features are man- ually clustered into five groups (F1 to F5) each separated by a dark beige colored column in the heat map. The first column of the heat map rep- resents the F1 group which consists of words like thank you, thanks etc. These words are character- istic of posts that mark either the conclusion of a resolved thread or are posted towards the end of the course. Rows corresponding to the category 3 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> show two examples of such posts. Simi- larly, F2 represents the features related to logistics of the course and F3 captures introductory posts by new students. Finally, F4 contains words that are closely related to the subfield of gene and hu- man conditions and would appear in posts that dis- cuss specific aspects or chapters of the course con-tents, while F5 contains general buzz words that would appear frequently in any biology course.</p><p>Analyzing individual rows of the heat map, we can see that out of F1 to F4, Categories 1, 2, 3 and 4 are dominated by logistics (F2), course content related (F4), thank you (F1) and introductory posts (F3) respectively, represented by bright colors in their respective rows. We also observe similar cor- relations while examining the columns of the heat map. Also, F5, which contains words common to the gene and human health domain, is scattered across multiple categories. For example, dna/rna and breeding are sufficiently frequent in category 1 as well as 2. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> gives examples of representative posts from the four clusters. Due to space constraints, we show only part of the complete post. We can see that these examples agree with our observa- tions from the heat map.</p><p>Furthermore, as noted in Sec. 2, we compare the semantics of clusters learnt by our models with those proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stump et al. (2013)</ref> even though the two categorizations are not directly compara- ble. Nevertheless, generally speaking, our cate- gory 1 corresponds to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stump et al. (2013)</ref>'s Course structure/policies and category 2 corresponds to Content. Interestingly, categories 3 and 4, which represent valedictory and introductory posts, cor- respond to a single Social/affective from the previ- ous work.</p><p>We can, therefore, conclude that the model, in- deed splits the posts into categories that look se- mantically coherent to the human eyes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Choice of Number of Categories</head><p>Our chain based models, assigning forum posts to latent categories, are parameterized with H, the number of categories. We therefore, study the sen- sitivity of our models to this parameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 5</ref>, plots the 10-fold cross validation performance of the models with increasing values of H for the two datasets. Interestingly, the sensitivity of the two models to the value of H is very different.</p><p>The LCMM model's performance fluctuates as the value of H increases. The initial performance improvement might be due to an increase in the ex- pressive power of the model. Performance peaks at H = 4 and then decreases, perhaps owing to over-fitting of the data.</p><p>In contrast, GCM performance remains steady for various values of H which might be attributed to the explicit regularization coefficient which helps combat over-fitting, by encouraging zero weights for unnecessary categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">How important are linguistic features?</head><p>We now focus on the structure independent fea- tures and experiment with their predictive value, according to types. We divide the features used by the LR into the following categories: <ref type="bibr">4</ref> • Full: set of all features (feature no. 1 to 15)</p><p>• lexical: based on content of thread titles and posts (feature no. 7 to 8 and 12 to 13) The figure reveals that the MOOCs-specific features (purple bar) are important for both the datasets indicating a need for designing special- ized models for forums analysis in this domain.</p><p>Category Example posts <ref type="bibr">1</ref> 'I'm having some issues with video playback. I have downloaded the videos to my laptop...' 1 'There was no mention of the nuclear envelope in the Week One lecture, yet it was in the quiz. Is this a mistake?' 2 'DNA methylation is a crucial part of normal development of organisms and cell differentiation in higher organisms...'   Also, lexical features (red bar) and post features (blue bar) have pretty dramatic effects in GHC and WCR data respectively.</p><p>Interestingly, removing the landmark feature set (green bar) causes a considerable drop in predic- tive performance, even though it consists of only one feature. Other temporal features (orange bar) also turn out to be important for the prediction. From a separate instructor activity vs time graph (not shown due to space constraints), we observed that instructors tend to get more active as the course progresses and their activity level also in- creases around quizzes/exams deadlines.</p><p>We can, therefore, conclude that all feature types are important and that lexical as well as MOOC specific analysis is necessary for model- ing instructor's intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>One of the main challenges in MOOCs is man- aging student-instructor interaction. The massive scale of these courses rules out any form of per- sonalized interaction, leaving instructors with the need to go over the forum discussions, gauge stu- dent reactions and selectively respond when ap- propriate. This time consuming and error prone task stresses the need for methods and tools sup- plying this actionable information automatically. This paper takes a first step in that direction, and formulates the novel problem of predicting in- structor intervention in MOOC discussion forums. Our main technical contribution is to construct predictive models combining information about forum post content and posting behavior with in- formation about the course and its landmarks.</p><p>We propose three models for addressing the task. The first, a logistic regression model is trained on thread level and aggregated post fea- tures. The other two models take thread structure into account when making the prediction. These models assume that posts can be represented by categories which characterize post content at an abstract level, and treat category assignments as latent variables organized according to, and influ- enced by, the forum thread structure.</p><p>Our experiments on forum data from two differ- ent Coursera MOOCs show that utilizing thread structure is important for predicting instructor's behavior. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis shows that our latent categories are semantically coherent to human eye.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>5 .</head><label>5</label><figDesc>time of last posting on the thread 6. total number of posts in the thread 7. a binary feature indicating if the thread title contains the words lecture or lectures 8. a binary feature indicating if the thread title contains the words assignment, quiz, grade, project, exam (and their plural forms) Aggregated post features: 9. sum of number of votes received by the indi- vidual posts 10. mean and variance of the posting times of in- dividual posts in the thread 11. mean of time difference between the post- ing times of individual posts and the closest course landmark.
