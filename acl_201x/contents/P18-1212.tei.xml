				<p>Understanding temporal and causal relations between events is a fundamental natural language understanding task. Because a cause must occur earlier than its effect, temporal and causal relations are closely related and one relation often dictates the value of the other. However, limited attention has been paid to studying these two relations jointly. This paper presents a joint inference framework for them using constrained conditional models (CCMs). Specifically, we formulate the joint problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, enforcing constraints that are inherent in the nature of time and causality. We show that the joint inference framework results in statistically significant improvement in the extraction of both temporal and causal relations from text. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Understanding events is an important component of natural language understanding. An essential step in this process is identifying relations between events, which are needed in order to support appli- cations such as story completion, summarization, and timeline construction.</p><p>Among the many relation types that could exist between events, this paper focuses on the joint ex- traction of temporal and causal relations. It is well known that temporal and causal relations interact with each other and in many cases, the decision of one relation is made primarily based on evidence from the other. In Example 1, identifying the tem- poral relation between e1:died and e2:exploded is in fact a very hard case: There are no explicit tem- poral markers (e.g., "before", "after", or "since"); the events are in separate sentences so their syn- tactic connection is weak; although the occurrence time of e2:exploded is given (i.e., Friday) in text, it is not given for e1:died. However, given the causal relation, e2:exploded caused e1:died,it is clear that e2:exploded happened before e1:died. The temporal relation is dictated by the causal re- lation.</p><p>Ex 1: Temporal relation dictated by causal relation. More than 10 people (e1:died) on their way to the nearest hospital, police said. A suicide car bomb (e2:exploded) on Friday in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball in northwest Pakistan. Since e2:exploded is the reason of e1:died, the temporal relation is thus e2 being before e1. Ex 2: Causal relation dictated by temporal relation. Mir-Hossein Moussavi (e3:raged) after government's efforts to (e4:stifle) protesters. Since e3:raged is temporally after e4:stifle, e4 should be the cause of e3.</p><p>On the other hand, causal relation extraction can also benefit from knowing temporal relations. In Example 2, it is unclear whether the govern- ment stifled people because people raged, or peo- ple raged because the government stifled people: both situations are logically reasonable. However, if we account for the temporal relation (that is, e4:stifle happened before e3:raged), it is clear that e4:stifle is the cause and e3:raged is the effect. In this case, the causal relation is dictated by the tem- poral relation.</p><p>The first contribution of this work is propos- ing a joint framework for <ref type="bibr">Temporal and Causal Reasoning (TCR)</ref>, inspired by these examples. Assuming the availability of a temporal extraction system and a causal extraction system, the pro- posed joint framework combines these two using a constrained conditional model (CCM) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang et al., 2012</ref>) framework, with an integer linear pro-gramming (ILP) objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Roth and Yih, 2004</ref>) that enforces declarative constraints during the in- ference phase. Specifically, these constraints in- clude: (1) A cause must temporally precede its ef- fect. (2) Symmetry constraints, i.e., when a pair of events, (A, B), has a temporal relation r (e.g., before), then (B, A) must have the reverse relation of r (e.g., after). (3) Transitivity constraints, i.e., the relation between (A, C) must be temporally consistent with the relation derived from (A, B) and (B, C). These constraints originate from the one-dimensional nature of time and the physical nature of causality and build connections between temporal and causal relations, making CCM a nat- ural choice for this problem. As far as we know, very limited work has been done in joint extraction of both relations. Formulating the joint problem in the CCM framework is novel and thus the first contribution of this work.</p><p>A key obstacle in jointly studying temporal and causal relations lies in the absence of jointly anno- tated data. The second contribution of this work is the development of such a jointly annotated dataset which we did by augmenting the Event- Causality dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Do et al., 2011</ref>) with dense tem- poral annotations. This dataset allows us to show statistically significant improvements on both re- lations via the proposed joint framework. This paper also presents an empirical result of improving the temporal extraction compo- nent. Specifically, we incorporate explicit time expressions present in the text and high-precision knowledge-based rules into the ILP objective. These sources of information have been success- fully adopted by existing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mirza and Tonelli, 2016)</ref>, but were never used within a global ILP-based inference method. Results on TimeBank-Dense ( ), a benchmark dataset with temporal relations only, show that these modifications can also be helpful within ILP-based methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Temporal and causal relations can both be repre- sented by directed acyclic graphs, where the nodes are events and the edges are labeled with either before, after, etc. (in temporal graphs), or causes and caused by (in causal graphs). Existing work on temporal relation extraction was initiated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mani et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chambers et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bethard et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Ex 3</ref>: Global considerations are needed when mak- ing local decisions. The FAA on Friday (e5:announced) it will close 149 regional airport control towers because of forced spending cuts. Before Friday's (e6:announcement), it (e7:said) it would consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the "national inter- est" to do so.</p><p>which formulated the problem as that of learning a classification model for determining the label of each edge locally (i.e., local methods). A disad- vantage of these early methods is that the result- ing graph may break the symmetric and transitive constraints. There are conceptually two ways to enforce such graph constraints (i.e., global rea- soning). CAEVO ( ) grows the temporal graph in a multi-sieve manner, where predictions are added sieve-by-sieve. A graph clo- sure operation had to be performed after each sieve to enforce constraints. This is solving the global inference problem greedily. A second way is to perform exact inference via ILP and the symme- try and transitivity requirements can be enforced as ILP constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bramsen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Denis and Muller, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Do et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ning et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We adopt the ILP approach in the temporal component of this work for two reasons. First, as we show later, it is straightforward to build a joint framework with both temporal and causal re- lations as an extension of it. Second, the rela- tion between a pair of events is often determined by the relations among other events. In Ex 3, if a system is unaware of (e5, e6)=simultaneously when trying to make a decision for (e5, e7), it is likely to predict that e5 is before e7 2 ; but, in fact, (e5, e7)=after given the existence of e6. Us- ing global considerations is thus beneficial in this context not only for generating globally consistent temporal graphs, but also for making more reliable pairwise decisions.</p><p>Prior work on causal relations in natural lan- guage text was relatively sparse. Many causal ex- traction work in other domains assumes the exis- tence of ground truth timestamps (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sun et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Güler et al., 2016)</ref>), but gold timestamps rarely exist in natural language text. In NLP, peo- ple have focused on causal relation identification using lexical features or discourse relations. For example, based on a set of explicit causal dis- course markers (e.g., "because", "due to", and "as a result"), <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hidey and McKeown (2016)</ref> built par- allel Wikipedia articles and constructed an open set of implicit markers called AltLex. A classi- fier was then applied to identify causality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dunietz et al. (2017)</ref> used the concept of construction grammar to tag causally related clauses or phrases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Do et al. (2011)</ref> considered global statistics over a large corpora, the cause-effect association (CEA) scores, and combined it with discourse relations using ILP to identify causal relations. These work only focused on the causality task and did not ad- dress the temporal aspect.</p><p>However, as illustrated by Examples 1-2, tem- poral and causal relations are closely related, as assumed by many existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bethard and Martin, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rink et al., 2010</ref>). Here we ar- gue that being able to capture both aspects in a joint framework provides a more complete under- standing of events in natural language documents. Researchers have started paying attention to this direction recently. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mostafazadeh et al. (2016b)</ref> proposed an annotation framework, CaTeRs, which captured both temporal and causal aspects of event relations in common sense stories. CATENA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mirza and Tonelli, 2016</ref>) extended the multi-sieve framework of CAEVO to extracting both temporal and causal relations and exploited their interaction through post-editing temporal re- lations based on causal predictions. In this paper, we push this idea forward and tackle the problem in a joint and more principled way, as shown next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Temporal and Causal Reasoning</head><p>In this section, we explain the proposed joint infer- ence framework, Temporal and Causal Reasoning (TCR). To start with, we focus on introducing the temporal component, and clarify how to de- sign the transitivity constraints and how to enforce other readily available prior knowledge to improve its performance. With this temporal component already explained, we further incorporate causal relations and complete the TCR joint inference framework. Finally, we transform the joint prob- lem into an ILP so that it can be solved using off- the-shelf packages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Temporal Component</head><p>Let R T be the label set of temporal relations and E and T be the set of all events and the set of all time expressions (a.k.a. timex) in a document. For notation convenience, we use EE to represent the set of all event-event pairs; then ET and T T have obvious definitions. Given a pair in EE or ET , as- sume for now that we have corresponding classi- fiers producing confidence scores for every tempo- ral relation in R T . Let them be s ee (·) and s et (·), respectively. Then the inference formulation for all the temporal relations within this document is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ Y = arg max Y ∈Y ∑ i∈EE s ee {i → Yi} + ∑ j∈ET s et {j → Yj} (1)</formula><p>where Y k ∈ R T is the temporal label of pair k ∈ MM (Let M = E ∪ T be the set of all tem- poral nodes), "k → Y k " represents the case where the label of pair k is predicted to be Y k , Y is a vec- torization of all these Y k 's in one document, and Y is the constrained space that Y lies in. We do not include the scores for T T because the temporal relationship between timexes can be trivially determined using the normalized dates of these timexes, as was done in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Do et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mirza and Tonelli, 2016)</ref>. We impose these relations via equality constraints denoted as Y 0 . In addition, we add symmetry and transitivity constraints dictated by the nature of time (denoted by Y 1 ), and other prior knowl- edge derived from linguistic rules (denoted by Y 2 ), which will be explained subsequently. Finally, we set Y = ∩ 2 i=0 Y i in Eq. (1). Transitivity Constraints. Let the dimension of Y be n. Then a standard way to construct the symmetry and transitivity constraints is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bramsen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Denis and Muller, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Do et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ning et al., 2017</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y 1 = { Y ∈ R n T |∀m 1,2,3 ∈ M, Y (m1,m2) = ¯ Y (m2,m1) , Y (m1,m3) ∈ Trans(Y (m1,m2) , Y (m2,m3) ) }</formula><p>where the bar sign is used to represent the reverse relation hereafter, and Trans(r 1 , r 2 ) is a set com- prised of all the temporal relations from R T that do not conflict with r 1 and r 2 . The construction of Trans(r 1 , r 2 ) necessitates a clearer definition of R T , the importance of which is often overlooked by existing methods. Existing approaches all followed the interval representation of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen, 1984)</ref>, which yields 13 tempo- ral relations (denoted by˜Rby˜ by˜R T here) as shown in  ample, {before, after, includes, is included, simul- taneously, vague}. For notation convenience, we denote them R T = {b, a, i, ii, s, v}. Using a re- duced set is more convenient in data annotation and leads to better performance in practice.</p><p>However, there has been limited discussion in the literature on how to interpret the reduced re- lation types. For example, is the "before" in R T exactly the same as the "before" in the original set ( ˜ R T ) (as shown on the left-hand-side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), or is it a combination of multiple relations iñ R T</p><p>(the right-hand-side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>)? We compare two reduction schemes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, where scheme 1 ig- nores low frequency labels directly and scheme 2 absorbs low frequency ones into their tempo- rally closest labels. The two schemes barely have differences when a system only looks at a single pair of mentions at a time (this might explain the lack of discussion over this issue in the literature), but they lead to different Trans(r 1 , r 2 ) sets and this difference can be magnified when the prob- lem is solved jointly and when the label distribu- tion changes across domains. To completely cover the 13 relations, we adopt scheme 2 in this work. The resulting transitivity relations are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The top part of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> is a com- pact representation of three generic rules; for in- stance, Line 1 means that the labels themselves are transitive. Note that during human annotation, if an annotator looks at a pair of events and de- cides that multiple well-defined relations can ex- ist, he/she labels it vague; also, when aggregating the labels from multiple annotators, a label will be <ref type="bibr">No. r1 r2 Trans(r1, r2</ref> changed to vague if the annotators disagree with each other. In either case, vague is chosen to be the label when a single well-defined relation can- not be uniquely determined by the contextual in- formation. This explains why a vague relation (v) is always added in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> if more than one label in Trans(r 1 , r 2 ) is possible. As for Lines 6, 9-11 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> (where vague appears in Column r 2 ), Col- umn Trans(r 1 ,r 2 ) was designed in such a way that r 2 cannot be uniquely determined through r 1 and Trans(r 1 ,r 2 ). For instance, r 1 is after on Line 9, if we further put before into Trans(r 1 ,r 2 ), then r 2 would be uniquely determined to be before, con- flicting with r 2 being vague, so before should not be in Trans(r 1 ,r 2 ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">) 1 r r r 2 r s r 3 r1 r2 Trans(¯ r2, ¯ r1) 4 b i b, i, v 5 b ii b, ii, v 6 b v b, i, ii, v 7 a i a, i, v 8 a ii a, ii, v 9 a v a, i, ii ,v 10 i v b, a, i, v 11 ii v b, a, ii, v</formula><p>Enforcing Linguistic Rules. Besides the tran- sitivity constraints represented by Y 1 above, we also propose to enforce prior knowledge to fur- ther constrain the search space for Y . Specifically, linguistic insight has resulted in rules for predict- ing the temporal relations with special syntactic or semantic patterns, as was done in CAEVO (a state-of-the-art method). Since these rule predic- tions often have high-precision, it is worthwhile incorporating them in global reasoning methods as well.</p><p>In the CCM framework, these rules can be rep- resented as hard constraints in the search space for Y .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Full Model with Causal Relations</head><p>Now we have presented the joint inference frame- work for temporal relations in Eq. (1). It is easier to explain our complete TCR framework on top of it. Let W be the vectorization of all causal rela- tions and add the scores from the scoring function for causality s c (·) to Eq. (1). Specifically, the full inference formulation is now:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ˆ Y , ˆ W = arg max Y ∈Y,W ∈W Y ∑ i∈EE s ee {i → Y i } (3) + ∑ j∈ET s et {j → Y j } + ∑ k∈EE s c {k → W k }</formula><p>where W Y is the search space for W . W Y depends on the temporal labels Y in the sense that</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W Y = {W ∈ R m C |∀i, j ∈ E, if W (i,j) = c,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>then W (j,i) = ¯ c, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Y (i,j) = b}</formula><p>where m is the dimension of W (i.e., the total number of causal pairs), R C = {c, ¯ c, null} is the label set for causal relations (i.e., "causes", "caused by", and "no relation"), and W (i,j) is the causal label for pair (i, j). The constraint repre- sented by W Y means that if a pair of events i and j are labeled to be "causes", then the causal relation between j and i must be "caused by", and the tem- poral relation between i and j must be "before".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Scoring Functions</head><p>In the above, we have built the joint framework on top of scoring functions s ee (·), s et (·) and s c (·). To get s ee (·) and s et (·), we trained classifiers us- ing the averaged perceptron algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Freund and Schapire, 1998)</ref> and the same set of features used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Do et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ning et al., 2017)</ref>, and then used the soft-max scores in those scoring func- tions. For example, that means</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">s ee {i → r} = w T r ϕ(i) ∑ r ′ ∈RT w T r ′ ϕ(i) , i ∈ EE, r ∈ R T ,</formula><p>where {w r } is the learned weight vector for rela- tion r ∈ R T and ϕ(i) is the feature vector for pair i ∈ EE. Given a pair of ordered events, we need s c (·) to estimate the scores of them being "causes" or "caused by". Since this scoring function has the same nature as s ee (·), we can reuse the features from s ee (·) and learn an averaged perceptron for s c (·). In addition to these existing features, we also use prior statistics retrieved using our tem- poral system from a large corpus 3 , so as to know probabilistically which event happens before an- other event. For example, in Example 1, we have a pair of events, e1:died and e2:exploded. The prior knowledge we retrieved from that large corpus is that die happens before explode with probability 15% and happens after explode with probability 85%. We think this prior distribution is correlated with causal directionality, so it was also added as features when training s c (·).</p><p>Note that the scoring functions here are imple- mentation choice. The TCR joint framework is fully extensible to other scoring functions.</p></div>

The main purpose of TB-Dense was to alleviate the known issue of sparse annotations in the evaluation dataset provided with TE3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(UzZaman et al., 2013)</ref>, as pointed out in many previ- ous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chambers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ning et al., 2017)</ref>. Anno- tators of TB-Dense were forced to look at each pair of events or timexes within the same sen- tence or contiguous sentences, so that much fewer links were missed. Since causal link annotation is not available on TB-Dense, we only show our improvement in terms of temporal performance on  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2017)</ref> 47.1 53.3 50.0 † This is technically the same with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Do et al.

Without this, Systems 6-8 had F1=28.7, 45.7, and 48.5, respectively, same with the reported values in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ning et al. (2017)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Ablation study of the proposed system in terms of the standard temporal awareness metric. The baseline system is to make inference locally for each event pair without looking at the decisions from others. The "+" signs on lines 2-5 refer to adding a new source of information on top of its preceding system, with which the inference has to be global and done via ILP. All systems are significantly different to its pre- ceding one with p&lt;0.05 (McNemar's test).</p><p>TB-Dense. The standard train/dev/test split of TB- Dense was used and parameters were tuned to op- timize the F 1 performance on dev. Gold events and time expressions were also used as in existing systems.</p><p>The contributions of each proposed information sources are analyzed in the ablation study shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, where we can see the F 1 score was improved step-by-step as new sources of informa- tion were added. Recall that Y 1 represents tran- sitivity constraints, ET represents taking event- timex pairs into consideration, and Y 2 represents rules from CAEVO ( ). Sys- tem 1 is the baseline we are comparing to, which is a local method predicting temporal relations one at a time. System 2 only applied Y 1 via ILP on top of all EE pairs by removing the 2nd term in Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>; for fair comparison with System 1, we added the same ET predictions from Sys- tem 1. System 3 incorporated ET into the ILP and mainly contributed to an increase in precision (from 42.9 to 44.3); we think that there could be more gain if more time expressions existed in the testset. With the help of additional high-precision rules (Y 2 ), the temporal performance can further be improved, as shown by System 4. Finally, us- ing the causal extraction obtained via <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Do et al., 2011</ref>) in the joint framework, the proposed method achieved the best precision, recall, and F 1 scores in our ablation study (Systems 1-5). According to the McNemar's test <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Everitt, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dietterich, 1998)</ref>, all Systems 2-5 were significantly different to its preceding system with p&lt;0.05.</p><p>The second part of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> compares sev- eral state-of-the-art systems on the same test set. ClearTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bethard, 2013)</ref> was the top perform- ing system in TE3 in temporal relation extraction. Since it was designed for TE3 (not TB-Dense), it expectedly achieved a moderate recall on the test set of TB-Dense. CAEVO (  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ning et al. (2017)</ref> were more recent methods and achieved better scores on TB-Dense. Com- pared with these state-of-the-art methods, the pro- posed joint system (System 5) achieved the best F 1 score with a major improvement in recall. We think the low precision compared to System 8 is due to the lack of structured learning, and the low precision compared to System 7 is propagated from the baseline (System 1), which was tuned to maximize its F 1 score. However, the effectiveness of the proposed information sources is already jus- tified in Systems 1-5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Data Preparation</head><p>TB-Dense only has temporal relation annotations, so in the evaluations above, we only evaluated our temporal performance. One existing dataset with both temporal and causal annotations avail- able is the Causal-TimeBank dataset (Causal-TB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mirza and Tonelli, 2014</ref>). However, Causal-TB is sparse in temporal annotations and is even sparser in causal annotations: In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we can see that with four times more documents, Causal-TB still has fewer temporal relations (denoted as T-Links therein), compared to TB-Dense; as for causal re- lations (C-Links), it has less than two causal re- lations in each document on average. Note that the T-Link sparsity of Causal-TB originates from TimeBank, which is known to have missing links <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ning et al., 2017</ref>). The C- Link sparsity was a design choice of Causal-TB in which C-Links were annotated based on only ex- plicit causal markers (e.g., "A happened because of B").</p><p>Another dataset with parallel annotations is CaTeRs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Mostafazadeh et al., 2016b)</ref>, which was primarily designed for the Story Cloze Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a</ref>) based on common Doc Event T-Link C-Link TB <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">-Dense  36  1.6k  5.7k  - EventCausality  25  0.8k  - 580  Causal-TB  183  6.8k  5.1k  318  New Dataset  25  1.3k  3.4k  172   Table 3</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, it has more than 20 C-Links annotated per doc- ument on average (10 times denser than Causal- TB). However, one issue is that its notion for events is slightly different to that in the temporal relation extraction regime. To construct parallel annotations of both temporal and causal relations, we preprocessed all the articles in EventCausal- ity using ClearTK to extract events and then man- ually removed some obvious errors in them. To annotate temporal relations among these events, we adopted the annotation scheme from TB-Dense given its success in mitigating the issue of miss- ing annotations with the following modifications. First, we used a crowdsourcing platform, Crowd- Flower, to collect temporal relation annotations. For each decision of temporal relation, we asked 5 workers to annotate and chose the majority la- bel as our final annotation. Second, we discov- ered that comparisons involving ending points of events tend to be ambiguous and suffer from low inter-annotator agreement (IAA), so we asked the annotators to label relations based on the starting points of each event. This simplification does not change the nature of temporal relation extraction but leads to better annotation quality. For more details about this data collection scheme, please refer to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ning et al., 2018b</ref>) for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Results</head><p>Result on our new dataset jointly annotated with both temporal and causal relations is shown in Ta-  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Comparison between the proposed method and existing ones, in terms of both temporal and causal performances. See Sec. 4.2.1 for description of our new dataset. Per the McNemar's test, the joint system is significantly better than both baselines with p&lt;0.05. Lines 4-5 provide the best possible perfor- mance the joint system could achieve if gold tempo- ral/causal relations were given. ble 4. We split the new dataset into 20 documents for training and 5 documents for testing. In the training phase, the training parameters were tuned via 5-fold cross validation on the training set. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> demonstrates the improvement of the joint framework over individual components. The "temporal only" baseline is the improved tempo- ral extraction system for which the joint inference with causal links has NOT been applied. The "causal only" baseline is to use s c (·) alone for the prediction of each pair. That is, for a pair i, if s c {i → causes} &gt; s c {i → caused by}, we then assign "causes" to pair i; otherwise, we as- sign "caused by" to pair i. Note that the "causal accuracy" column in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> was evaluated only on gold causal pairs.</p><p>In the proposed joint system, the temporal and causal scores were added up for all event pairs. The temporal performance got strictly better in precision, recall, and F 1 , and the causal perfor- mance also got improved by a large margin from 70.5% to 77.3%, indicating that temporal signals and causal signals are helpful to each other. Ac- cording to the McNemar's test, both improve- ments are significant with p&lt;0.05.</p><p>The second part of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows that if gold relations were used, how well each compo- nent would possibly perform. Technically, these gold temporal/causal relations were enforced via adding extra constraints to ILP in Eq. (3) (imagine these gold relations as a special rule, and convert them into constraints like what we did in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2)</ref>). When using gold temporal relations, causal accu- racy went up to 91.9%. That is, 91.9% of the C-Links satisfied the assumption that the cause is temporally before the effect. First, this number is much higher than the 77.3% on line 3, so there is still room for improvement. Second, it means in this dataset, there were 8.1% of the C-Links in which the cause is temporally after its effect. We will discuss this seemingly counter-intuitive phe- nomenon in the Discussion section. When gold causal relations were used (line 5), the tempo- ral performance was slightly better than line 3 in terms of both precision and recall. The small dif- ference means that the temporal performance on line 3 was already very close to its best. Compared with the first line, we can see that gold causal relations led to approximately 2% improvement in precision and recall in temporal performance, which is a reasonable margin given the fact that C-Links are often much sparser than T-Links in practice.</p><p>Note that the temporal performance in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> is consistently better than those in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> because of the higher IAA in the new dataset. However, the improvement brought by joint reasoning with causal relations is the same, which further con- firms the capability of the proposed approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>We have consistently observed that on the TB- Dense dataset, if automatically tuned to optimize its F 1 score, a system is very likely to have low precisions and high recall (e.g., <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). We no- tice that our system often predicts non-vague rela- tions when the TB-Dense gold is vague, resulting in lower precision. However, on our new dataset, the same algorithm can achieve a more balanced precision and recall. This is an interesting phe- nomenon, possibly due to the annotation scheme difference which needs further investigation.</p><p>The temporal improvements in both <ref type="table">Table 2 and  Table 4</ref> are relatively small (although statistically significant). This is actually not surprising be- cause C-Links are much fewer than T-Links in newswires which focus more on the temporal de- velopment of stories. As a result, many T-Links are not accompanied with C-Links and the im- provements are diluted. But for those event pairs having both T-Links and C-Links, the proposed joint framework is an important scheme to syn- thesize both signals and improve both. The com- parison between Line 5 and Line 3 in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> is a showcase of the effectiveness. We think that a deeper reason for the improvement achieved via a joint framework is that causality often encodes Ex 4: Cause happened after effect. The shares fell to a record low of ¥60 and (e8:finished) at ¥67 before the market (e9:closed) for the New Year holidays. As she (e10:prepares) to (e11:host) her first show, Crowley writes on what viewers should expect.</p><p>humans prior knowledge as global information (e.g., "death" is caused by "explosion" rather than causes "explosion", regardless of the local con- text), while temporality often focuses more on the local context. From this standpoint, temporal in- formation and causal information are complemen- tary and helpful to each other.</p><p>When doing error analysis for the fourth line of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, we noticed some examples that break the commonly accepted temporal precedence as- sumption. It turns out that they are not annotation mistakes: In Example 4, e8:finished is obviously before e9:closed, but e9 is a cause of e8 since if the market did not close, the shares would not fin- ish. In the other sentence of Example 4, she pre- pares before hosting her show, but e11:host is the cause of e10:prepares since if not for hosting, no preparation would be needed. In both cases, the cause is temporally after the effect because people are inclined to make projections for the future and change their behaviors before the future comes. The proposed system is currently unable to handle these examples and we believe that a better defini- tion of what can be considered as events is needed, as part of further investigating how causality is ex- pressed in natural language.</p><p>Finally, the constraints connecting causal rela- tions to temporal relations are designed in this pa- per as "if A is the cause of B, then A must be be- fore B". People have suggested other possibilities that involve the includes and simultaneously rela- tions. While these other relations are simply dif- ferent interpretations of temporal precedence (and can be easily incorporated in our framework), we find that they rarely happen in our dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a novel joint framework, Temporal and Causal Reasoning (TCR), using CCMs and ILP to the extraction problem of temporal and causal relations between events. To show the ben- efit of TCR, we have developed a new dataset that jointly annotates temporal and causal annotations, and then exhibited that TCR can improve both temporal and causal components. We hope that this notable improvement can foster more interest in jointly studying multiple aspects of events (e.g., event sequencing, coreference, parent-child rela- tions) towards the goal of understanding events in natural language.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
