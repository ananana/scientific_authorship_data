			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce MediaGist, an online system for crosslingual analysis of aggregated news and commentaries based on summa-rization and sentiment analysis technologies. It is designed to assist journalists to detect and explore news topics, which are controversially reported or discussed in different countries. News articles from current week are clustered separately in currently 5 languages and the clusters are then linked across languages. Sentiment analysis provides a basis to compute controversy scores and summaries help to explore the differences. Recognized entities play an important role in most of the sys-tem&apos;s modules and provide another way to explore the data. We demonstrate the capabilities of MediaGist by listing highlights from the last week and present a rough evaluation of the system.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>News portals publish thousands of articles every day in various languages. Making sense out of such data without automated tools is impossible.</p><p>There are many news aggregators/analysers and each of them has its strengths. Google News ag- gregates headlines and displays the stories accord- ing to each reader's interests. IBM Watson News Explorer gives a more analytical way to read news through linked data visualizations. Europe Media Monitor (EMM) produces a summary of news sto- ries clustered near realtime in various languages and compares how the same events have been re- ported in the media written in different languages.</p><p>However, there is another source of information at the news sites -commentaries -which contain very valuable public opinion about the news top- ics and has not been explored enough yet. Includ- ing commentaries opens many new use cases for journalists, agencies, which study public opinion, and partially also for readers. Controversial top- ics, such as the refugee crisis in Europe, or the Volkswagen's emission scandal, and their percep- tion in different countries might be itself a source for reporting. Focusing on such topics should bring more traffic and rich discussions to the news portals. International agencies or political institu- tions will find useful the comparisons when study- ing particular public opinions. Crosslingually- organized news and commentaries will be useful for readers living in a multicultural environment, as they can quickly find and understand different views on the controversial topics.</p><p>MediaGist 1 builds on the ideas of news aggre- gators, but adds the comments' dimension. It con- tinuously gathers metadata about news articles and their commentaries, currently in 5 languages. Ar- ticles from current week are clustered monolin- gually several times a day. It extracts entities, la- bels news and commentaries with sentiment scores and generates summaries on both sides. It also links the clusters across languages, similarly to EMM. Having aggregated news on one side and commentaries on the other side, it compares the information by sentiment analysis and summariza- tion. A different sentiment of news and commen- taries indicate a controversial topic and summaries help to identify the difference qualitatively. The crosslingual links allow to discover and explore topics, which are controversially reported or dis- cussed in different countries.</p><p>The next section (2) relates MediaGist to the current news aggregation or analytics solutions. Section 3 describes MediGist from inside. The overall architecture is followed by a description of the NLP pipeline. Section 4 gives an overview of the system's functionality and shows highlights from the last week, followed by a rough evaluation of the system, conclusions and future plans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related sites</head><p>Google News 2 is an automatic service that aggre- gates headlines from more than 50K news sources worldwide, groups similar stories together, and displays them according to each reader's interests. The content is selected and ranked using many fac- tors, e.g. coverage, freshness, location, relevance and diversity of the story. There are more than 70 regional editions in many different languages.</p><p>IBM Watson News Explorer <ref type="bibr">3</ref> gives a more an- alytical way to read news. It gathers 250k articles a day from 70k sources and converts the unstruc- tured text into entities and concepts, and connects the dots through linked data visualizations.</p><p>EMM NewsBrief 4 is a summary of news stories (news clusters) from around the world, automati- cally classified according to thousands of criteria. It is updated every 10 minutes, and over 100k ar- ticles in 50+ languages run through it a day. It au- tomatically detects the stories that are the most re- ported in each language at the moment. The Alert system presents the stories in many different clas- sifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson and van der Goot, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The second EMM's technology, NewsEx- plorer 5 , allows to see the major news stories in various languages for any specific day and to com- pare how the same events have been reported in different languages . It shows the most mentioned names and other auto- matically derived information, eg. variant name spellings or a list of related entities .</p><p>To summarize, the current systems gather masses of news articles and cluster them into sto- ries. Some systems do it in many languages, and few link the stories across languages. Ana- lytical solutions add information extraction (loca- tions, entities, relations or categories). However, they do not integrate commentaries, which com- plement well the stories with public opinion. Me-diaGist adds the commentaries and uses them for various monolingual or crosslingual comparisons resulting in discovering and exploring controver- sies in the whole data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System overview</head><p>MediaGist processing starts with a crawler (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>). It gathers articles and their comments from predefined news sites <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . It creates an RSS file for each article, which goes down the NLP pipeline. The pipeline first recognizes entities, in both the article and its comments, and assigns a crosslingual id to each mention. The next step is performed by the sentiment analyser, which assigns to each article and comment a tonality score <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . The coreference resolver then enriches the list of entity mentions by name part references and definite descriptions. Each entity mention is then assigned a sentiment score and article comments are summarized 8 . These fully annotated article RSS files enter the clustering phase. Every four hours, for each language, the clusterer takes the ar- ticles published during the current week and cre- ates monolingual clusters. Since this step, RSS files contain information about all articles in the cluster. The crosslingual linker then adds to each cluster links to the most similar cluster in other languages. The last step is creating a summary of clustered articles and a summary of cluster's com- ments (already summarized per article before).</p><p>The RSS now contains all information needed by the presentation layer, the MediaGist website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">NER and coreference</head><p>The named entity recognizer is based on JRC- Names 9 , which is a highly multilingual named en- tity resource for person and organisation names <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Steinberger et al., 2011c)</ref>. It consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person), including across scripts .</p><p>Because the resource does not contain many morphological variants for Czech, it was extended by an in-house rule-based morphological analyser.</p><p>Coreference resolution was inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Steinberger et al., 2011a</ref>). In the cases of titles, it uses a list of person-title associations semi-automatically compiled over the past few years (Pouliquen and Steinberger, 2009).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sentiment analysis</head><p>The sentiment analyser is used for 2 purposes. Assigning first a document-level tonality score −100; +100 to each article and comment, and second, a sentiment score −100; +100 to each entity mention. It uses highly multilingual and comparable sentiment dictionaries having similar sizes and based on a common specification, cre- ated by triangulation from English and Spanish <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Steinberger et al., 2012</ref>). In the case of the tonal- ity score, it counts subjective terms in an article, resp. a comment, and in the case of the entity score, it counts terms around entity mentions. It includes rules for using negation, intensifiers and diminishers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Steinberger et al., 2011b)</ref>. Although machine learning approaches would produce bet- ter sentiment predictions, they require training data per language, and ideally per industry as well. And such data are currently expensive to create. With the rule-based approach, the system can eas- ily process multiple languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Clustering and crosslingual linking</head><p>The monolingual clustering algorithm is based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering with the group average strategy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hastie et al., 2009</ref>). The articles are represented by log-likelihood vectors of its terms and the similarity function is Cosine.</p><p>Crosslingual linking uses two kinds of features: entities and descriptors from EuroVoc 10 . EuroVoc <ref type="bibr">10</ref> http://eurovoc.europa.eu is a multilingual, multidisciplinary thesaurus cov- ering the activities of the EU, the European Parlia- ment in particular. It contains terms organized in a hierarchy in 23 EU languages. Using Eurovoc features ensures that the linked clusters share the same topic. If at the same time the clusters share the same entities 11 , it is very likely that the clus- ters are about the same story. A similar approach as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Steinberger, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Summarization</head><p>The summarizer is used for three steps of the pipeline. First, it summarizes article comments, then articles in the cluster and finally comments of the cluster. We use an extractive approach based on latent semantic analysis, which uses both lex- ical and entity features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kabadjov et al., 2013)</ref>. This approach performed well in the Multiling evaluation campaigns 12 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Functionality</head><p>The systems has two main views to explore the media data: cluster view and entity view. We can select a language, a period (=week) and sort the data by different criteria <ref type="bibr">13</ref> . Each view contains highlights of the selected period in the left panel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The cluster view</head><p>It displays title and description, taken from the central article of the cluster (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2)</ref>. The left part shows information about articles and the right part about commentaries. On both sides, it dis- plays generated summaries and aggregated tonal- <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The entity ids are unified across languages. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> There were already 3 editions of MultiLing's multilin- gual multi-document summarization shared task: 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Giannakopoulos et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">), 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Giannakopoulos et al., 2015</ref>). <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The system currently holds data from the last 24 weeks. MediaGist computes several controversy scores for each cluster. Articles' vs. comments' contro- versy compares tonality of articles and comments. The value correspond to the standard deviation of the two values. Entities' controversy compares sentiment of entity mentions in articles and com- ments. The value is a macro-average of standard deviations of each entity sentiment. Crosslingual rank controversy compares ranks of the cluster in different languages. Clusters are ranked for each language based on the number of articles. The value is a standard deviation of logarithms of the ranks. Logarithms give larger weights to the top ranks. This controversy is large if the topic is ranked at the top for some languages based on the coverage, while in other languages it is men- tioned only marginally. Large Crosslingual article controversy indicates a large difference in articles' tonality among languages. The value is a stan- dard deviation of average article tonalities across languages. This score says whether the topic is reported with the same tonality in different lan- guages or not. And finally, a large Crosslingual comment controversy indicates topics which are discussed with different tonality across languages. The score compares average comment tonalities across languages by the standard deviation. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Tonality/sentiment range is: −100; +100, green col- umn = positive, orange = neutral, red = negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The entity view</head><p>The entity view displays variants of the entity found in the data (e.g. for David Bowie in week Jan 11-17, 2016: Bowie (3816 mentions), David Bowie (914), David (74), singer (60), star (46), musician (33), popstar (5), etc.). It shows the aggregated entity sentiment in articles and com- ments, which is compared by Articles' vs. com- ments' controversy. The sentiment is summa- rized by the most frequent subjective terms on both sides. Because we have also the entities linked across languages, we can compute their crosslingual controversy in articles and in com- ments. We can then easily find, which entities are reported or discussed with different sentiment across languages. As an example, Volkswagen is discussed negatively in Czech but positively in German (when all periods are selected).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Highlights from the last week</head><p>The most international topic during week <ref type="bibr">(Mar 2127, 2016</ref>) was Fayal Cheffou charged over core role in Brussels bomb attacks -covered well in all 5 languages. The English summary:</p><p>At least 31 dead and more than 200 injured in bombings claimed by Islamic State. The attackers Brothers Khalid and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui have been identified as suicide bombers at the metro station and airport respectively. Before the Brus- sels attacks, Belgian prosecutors said DNA evidence had identified Moroccan-born Laachraoui as an accomplice of Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam. He was one of several men detained in police raids on Thursday. "What we feared has happened," said the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, at a press conference.</p><p>The following story was controversial in cov- erage: Ukrainian pilot given 22-year jail sen- tence by Russian court -one of the top clus-ters in Czech but only few articles in English and French. The same topic was seen as controver- sially reported as well -the tonality of Czech ar- ticles was much more negative than English and French ones. A controversially discussed topic: Sanders: 'We have a path towards victory' after win Washington caucuses -while positive in En- glish, negative in Czech. Reasons of the contro- versy can be found in the summaries.</p><p>Controversial entity in articles: Donald Trump -negative in English, close to neutral in Italian and French and positive in German and Czech. Difference between sentiment in articles and com- ments: John Key -positive in articles but neg- ative in comments (English). Controversial en- tity in comments: George W. Bush -while the sentiment is balanced in English, it is negative in Czech and positive in German. The most fre- quent sentiment terms indicate the reasons: En- glish: good, helped, better, evil, violence; German: liebesmüh (love effort), deutlich besser (clearly better), Czech: zločiny (crimes), odsuzovat (ac- cusing), ˇ spatn´yspatn´y (bad).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>We present a rough evaluation of the key modules of the system. We discus results of NER, coref- erence, sentiment analysis and summarization ob- tained in the previous research. In the case of clus- tering, crosslingual linking and controversy pre- dictions we validated the system output to get the first insight of their accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">NER and coreference</head><p>The precision of the applied NER and coreference was measured in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Steinberger et al. (2011a)</ref>. From the current MediaGist's languages, person recog- nition performs best for French (98.4%) and worst for Italian (92.1%). The coreference module re- solves name parts at precision of 98% and person title references at 70%. As the title references have not been continuously updated yet, several wrong references are caused by the missing temporal di- mension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Sentiment analysis</head><p>The accuracy of the sentiment analyser in all Me- diaGist's languages was measured in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Steinberger et al. (2011b)</ref>. For news sentences and entity tar- gets, we got the best accuracy for English (74%) and the worst for Italian (66%). However, in the case of aggregating the polarities per entity and considering only entities with a larger differ- ence between positive and negative mentions (ex- tremely polar entities), 78% of entity classifica- tions across all languages were correct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Summarization</head><p>The LSA-based summarizer was evaluated during the last edition of the Multiling's multi-document summarization shared task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Giannakopoulos et al., 2015)</ref> as the top performing system overall (it re- ceived the lowest sum of ranks over all 10 lan- guages). From the MediaGist's languages, it per- formed best in Czech, English and French. Ger- man and Italian was not included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Clustering and crosslingual linking</head><p>In the case of clustering and crosslingual linking, we asked two annotators to validate the output of the system. The annotators were not fluent speak- ers in all 5 languages, but they had enough knowl- edge to judge the task. We selected the top 5 En- glish clusters from the first 4 full weeks of 2016. The clusters were ranked based on the number of crosslingual links. The task of the clustering val- idation was to check whether the components of the cluster are relevant to the cluster's topic identi- fied by the title of its central article. In the case of the crosslingual linking, the task was to check the similarity of the linked clusters based on their arti- cle titles. Clustering validation was found not to be that subjective, the inter-annotator kappa was .89. The validation of crosslingual links was more dif- ficult, the annotators did not always agree (kappa was .63), mainly because of a different view on the right granularity of the topic (e.g. the clusters were both discussing the regugee crisis, but in one language it was about closing the borders and in the other about a disorder in Germany). From the total of 235 cluster components, 96% were judged as correct and from the 59 crosslingual links, 76% were pointing to the right cluster of the other lan- guage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Controversy scores</head><p>We selected the most interesting controversy score, crosslingual comment controversy, to be judged by two annotators. For each crosslingual link evaluated in 5.4, we took the corresponding comment summaries (each in a different language) and showed them to an annotator. Her task was to assess whether the view of the topic/entities is dif- ferent (controversial) in the two languages or not. The task definition was rather shallow, but still there was a fair agreement (kappa was .48). We then produced a gold controversy scores: for in- stance if we had a topic linked across 5 languages, there were 10 combinations judged twice. The Boolean judgements were aggregated and normal- ized, resulting in a score between 0 and 1. These golden scores were then compared against the sys- tem's crosslingual comment controversy scores by Pearson correlation: .51. Although the correlation is not perfect, the measure can already be useful to indicate controversy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>MediaGist uses language technology to detect controversy in world news. Sentiment analysis helps to identify controversial topics and entities across languages, and via summarization it is pos- sible to explore them in detail. The controversy scores are much dependent on the quality of sen- timent analysis. Improving the sentiment mod- ule will directly lead to better predictions. Fu- ture plans include increasing the data volume on on both vertical (sources) and horizontal (histori- cal data) axes. This will allow to study the evolu- tion of a news thread or of a person name. The sys- tem currently consumes raw commentaries. Rep- resenting a precise opinion of real Internet users will require to fight trolls and filter the conversa- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Mihaylov et al., 2015</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The architecture of MediaGist.</figDesc></figure>
