<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Entity linking (EL) is the task of automatically linking mentions of entities (e.g. persons, loca- tions, organizations) in a text to their correspond- ing entry in a given knowledge base (KB), such as Wikipedia or Freebase. Depending on the setting, the task may also require detection of entity men- tions 1 , as well as identifying and clustering Not- In-Lexicon (NIL) entities.</p><p>In recent years, the increasing interest in EL, re- flected in the emergence of shared tasks such as the TAC Entity Linking track ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ji et al., 2014</ref>), ERD 2014 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carmel et al., 2014</ref>), and NEEL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cano et al., 2014</ref>), has fostered research on evaluation met- rics for EL systems, leading to the development of a dedicated scorer that covers different aspects of EL system results using multiple metrics ).</p><p>Based on the observation that representations in entity linking (mentions linked to the same KB entry) are very similar to those encountered in coreference resolution (mentions linked by coref- erence relations to the same entity), these metrics include ones originally proposed for evaluation of coreference resolutions systems, such as the MUC score ( <ref type="bibr">Vilain et al., 1995)</ref>, B 3 (Bagga and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldwin, 1998)</ref>, and CEAF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Luo, 2005</ref>) and variants thereof <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cai and Strube, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>While such metrics, which express system per- formance in numeric terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores, are well-suited for comparing sys- tems, they are of limited use to EL system devel- opers trying to identify problem areas and compo- nents whose improvement will likely result in the largest performance increase.</p><p>To address this problem, we present the Visual Entity Explorer (VEX), an interactive tool for vi- sually exploring the results produced by an EL system. To our knowledge, there exist no other dedicated tools for visualizing the output of EL systems or similar representations.</p><p>VEX is available as free, open-source soft- ware for download at http://github.com/ noutenki/vex and as a web service at http: //cosyne.h-its.org/vex.</p><p>In the remainder of this paper, we first give an overview of VEX (Section 2), proceed to present several usage examples and discuss some of the in- sights gained from performing a visual error anal- ysis (Section 3), then describe its implementation (Section 4), before concluding and discussing fu- ture work (Section 5). gold annotations, correct results, and errors as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The document to be analyzed can be selected via the clickable list of document IDs on the left. Located bottom right, the entity selectors for gold, true positive, and false positive entities (defined below) can be used to toggle the display of individual entities 2 . The selected enti- ties are visualized in the top-right main area.</p><p>Similarly to the usage in coreference resolution, where a cluster of mentions linked by coreference relations is referred to as an entity, we define en- tity to mean a cluster of mentions clustered either implicitly by being linked to the same KB entry (in case of non-NIL mentions) or clustered explic- itly by performing NIL clustering (in case of NIL mentions). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For space reasons, the entity selectors are shown only partially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Visualizing Entity Linking Errors</head><p>Errors committed by an EL system can be broadly categorized into mention detection errors and link- ing/clustering errors. Mention detection errors, in turn, can be divided into partial errors and full er- rors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Partial Mention Detection Errors</head><p>A partial mention detection error is a system men- tion span that overlaps but is not identical to any gold mention span. In VEX, partial mention detec- tion errors are displayed using red square brackets, either inside or outside the gold mention spans sig- nified by golden-bordered rectangles (cf. the first and last mention in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Full Mention Detection Errors</head><p>A full mention detection error is either (a) a sys- tem mention span that has no overlapping gold mention span at all, corresponding to a false pos- itive (FP) detection, i.e. a precision error, or (b) a gold mention span that has no overlap with any system mention span, corresponding to a false negative (FN) detection, i.e. a recall error. In VEX, FP mention detections are marked by a dashed red border and struck-out red text (cf. the second men- tion in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), and FN mention detections by a dashed gold-colored border and black text (cf. the third mention in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). For further emphasis, both gold and system mentions are displayed in bold font.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Linking/Clustering Errors</head><p>Entities identified by the system are categorized -and possibly split up -into True Positive (TP) and False Positive (FP) entities. The mentions of system entities are connected using dashed green lines for TP entities and dashed red lines for FP en- tities, while gold entity mentions are connected by solid gold-colored lines. This choice of line styles prevents loss of information through occlusion in case of two lines connecting the same pair of men- tions, as is the case with the first and last mention in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, the text of system mentions linked to the correct KB entry or identified correctly as NIL is colored green and any text associated with erroneous system entity links red.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Usage examples</head><p>In this section we show how VEX can be used to perform a visual error analysis, gaining insights that arguably cannot be attained by relying only on evaluation metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Example 1</head><p>Figure 2 shows mentions of VULCAN INC. 3 as identified by an EL system (marked red and green) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> In this paper, SMALL CAPS denote KB entries. and the corresponding gold annotation <ref type="bibr">4</ref> (marked in gold color). Of the three gold mentions, two were detected and linked correctly by the system and are thus colored green and connected with a green dashed line. One gold mention is sur- rounded with a gold-colored dashed box to indi- cate a FN mention not detected by the system at all. The dashed red box signifies a FP entity, re- sulting from the system having detected a mention that is not listed in the gold standard. However, rather than a system error, this is arguably an an- notation mistake.</p><p>Inspection of other entities and other documents reveals that spurious FPs caused by gold anno- tation errors appear to be a common occurrence (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> for another example). Since the su- pervised machine learning algorithms commonly used for named entity recognition, such as Con- ditional Random Fields ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sutton and McCallum, 2007)</ref>, require consistent training data, such incon- sistencies hamper performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Example 2</head><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> we can also tell that two men- tion detection errors are caused by the inclusion of sentence-final punctuation that doubles as ab- breviation marker. The occurrence of similar cases in other documents, e.g. inconsistent annotation of "U.S." and "U.S" as mentions of UNITED STATES, shows the need for consistently applied annotation guidelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Example 3</head><p>Another type of mention detection error is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>: Here the system fails to detect "wash- ington" as a mention of WASHINGTON, D.C., likely due to the non-standard lower-case spelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Example 4</head><p>The visualization of the gold mentions of PAUL ALLEN in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows that the EL system sim- plistically partitioned and linked the mentions ac- cording to string match, resulting in three system entities, of which only the first, consisting of the two "Paul Allen" mentions, is a TP. Even though the four "Allen" mentions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> align cor- rectly with gold mentions, they are categorized as a FP entity, since the system erroneously linked them to the KB entry for the city of Allen, Texas, resulting in a system entity that does not intersect with any gold entity. The system commits a simi- lar mistake for the mention "Paul".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Insights</head><p>This analysis of only a few examples has already revealed several categories of errors, either com- mitted by the EL system or resulting from gold annotation mistakes:</p><p>• mention detection errors due to non-standard letter case, which suggest incorporating true- casing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lita et al., 2003</ref>) and/or a caseless named entity recognition model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) into the mention detection process could improve performance;</p><p>• mention detection errors due to off-by-one errors involving punctuation, which sug- gest the need for clear and consistently ap- plied annotation guidelines, enabling devel- opers to add hard-coded, task-specific post- processing rules for dealing with such cases;</p><p>• mention detection errors due to missing gold standard annotations, which suggest per- forming a simple string match against already annotated mentions to find cases of unanno- tated mentions could significantly improve the gold standard at little cost;</p><p>• linking/clustering errors, likely due to the overly strong influence of features based on string match with Wikipedia article titles, which in some cases appears to outweigh features designed to encourage clustering of mentions if there exists a substring match be- tween them, hence leading to an erroneous partitioning of the gold entity by its various surface forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Implementation</head><p>In this section we describe VEX's implementation and some of the design decisions made to achieve an entity visualization suited for convenient error analysis. VEX consists of three main components. The input component, implemented in Java 8, reads gold and system annotations files, as well as the original documents. Currently, the annotation for- mat read by the official TAC 2014 scorer <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , as well as a simple JSON input format are supported. All system and gold character offset ranges contained in the input files are converted into HTML spans and inserted into the document text. Since HTML elements are required to conform to a tree struc- ture, any overlap or nesting of spans is handled by breaking up such spans into non-overlapping sub- spans.</p><p>At this point, gold NIL clusters and system NIL clusters are aligned by employing the Kuhn- Munkres algorithm 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kuhn, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Munkres, 1957)</ref>, as is done in calculation of the CEAF met- ric ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Luo, 2005)</ref>. The input component then stores all inserted, non-overlapping spans in an in- memory database.</p><p>The processing component queries gold and system entity data for each document and inventorizes all errors of interest. All data col- lected by this component is added to the respec- tive HTML spans in the form of CSS classes, en- abling simple customization of the visualization via a plain-text stylesheet.</p><p>The output component employs a tem- plate engine <ref type="bibr">7</ref> to convert the data collected by the processing component into HTML and JavaScript for handling display and user interac- tion in the web browser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Design Decisions</head><p>One of VEX's main design goals is enabling the user to quickly identify entity linking and clus- tering errors. Because a naive approach to entity visualization by drawing edges between all possi- ble pairings of mention spans quickly leads to a cluttered graph <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4a</ref> spanning trees in error analysis for coreference resolution.</p><p>An Euclidean minimum spanning tree is a min- imum spanning tree (MST) of a graph whose ver- tices represent points in a metric space and whose edge weights are the spatial distances between points 8 , i.e., it spans all graph vertices while min- imizing total edge length. This allows for a much more concise visualization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4b)</ref>.</p><p>Since the actual positions of mention span el- ements on the user's screen depend on various user environment factors such as font size and browser window dimensions, the MSTs of dis- played entities are computed using a client-side JavaScript library 9 and are automatically redrawn if the browser window is resized. Drawing of edges is performed via jsPlumb 10 , a highly cus- tomizable library for line drawing in HTML doc- uments.</p><p>In order not to overemphasize mention detec- tion errors when displaying entities, VEX assumes a system mention span to be correct if it has a non- zero overlap with a gold mention span. For exam- ple, consider the first gold mention "Vulcan Inc" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, which has not been detected correctly by the system; it detected "Vulcan Inc." instead. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> In our case, the metric space is the DOM document being rendered by the web browser, a point is the top-left corner of a text span element, and the distance metric is the pixel distance between the top-left corners of text span elements.</p><p>9 https://github.com/abetusk/ euclideanmst.js. This library employs Kruskal's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Kruskal, 1956</ref>) for finding MSTs.</p><p>10 http://www.jsplumb.org</p><p>While a strict evaluation requiring perfect men- tion spans will give no credit at all for this par- tially correct result, seeing that this mention de- tection error is already visually signified (by the red square bracket), VEX treats the mention as de- tected correctly for the purpose of visualizing the entity graph, and counts it as a true positive in- stance if it has been linked correctly.</p><p>While VEX provides sane defaults, the visual- ization style can be easily customized via CSS, e.g., in order to achieve a finer-grained catego- rization of error types such as off-by-one mention detection errors, or classification of non-NILs as NILs and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We presented the Visual Entity Explorer (VEX), a tool for visual error analysis of entity linking (EL) systems. We have shown how VEX can be used for quickly identifying the components of an EL system that appear to have a high potential for improvement, as well as for finding errors in the gold standard annotations. Since visual error anal- ysis of our own EL system revealed several issues and possible improvements, we believe perform- ing such an analysis will prove useful for other de- velopers of EL systems, as well.</p><p>In future work, we plan to extend VEX with functionality for visualizing additional error types, and for exploring entities not only in a single doc- ument, but across documents. Given the structural similarities entities in coreference resolution and entities in entity linking share, we also will add methods for visualizing entities found by corefer- ence resolution systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Screenshot of VEX's main display, consisting of document list (left), entity selectors (bottom right), and the annotated document text (top right).</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,72.00,62.81,453.55,353.88" type="bitmap" /></figure>
