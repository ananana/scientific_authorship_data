				<p>This paper tackles the issue of the detection of user&apos;s verbal expressions of likes and dislikes in a human-agent interaction. We present a system grounded on the theoretical framework provided by (Martin and White, 2005) that integrates the interaction context by jointly processing agent&apos;s and user&apos;s utterances. It is designed as a rule-based and bottom-up process based on a symbolic representation of the structure of the sentence. This article also describes the annotation campaign-carried out through Amazon Mechanical Turk-for the creation of the evaluation data-set. Finally, we present all measures for rating agreement between our system and the human reference and obtain agreement scores that are equal or higher than substantial agreements.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the research field of the embodied conversa- tional agents (ECA), detecting sentiment-related phenomena 1 appears as a key task to improve human-agent interactions and to build long-term social relationships ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pecune et al., 2013)</ref>. Sev- eral models and applications have been proposed which mostly take into account non-verbal cues (acoustic features, facial or bodily expressions) to determine the user's emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Schuller et al., 2011</ref>). The verbal content is more and more inte- grated but still partially exploited in human-agent interactions. The very infrequent works, integrat- ing the detection of user's sentiments in ECAs based on linguistic cues, concern avatars and vi- sualisation issues rather than face-to-face interac- tion, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Neviarouskaya et al., 2010b</ref>). We identify so far two studies that in- tegrate a sentiment detection module for human- agent interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Smith et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yildirim et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>However, the research field of sentiment anal- ysis and opinion mining provides a set of inter- esting works dealing with the subjective informa- tion conveyed by the verbal content. Three types of approaches are considered: machine-learning, rule-based approaches and hybrid approaches that are a combination of the first two types. Machine learning methods have proven their worth for the positive and negative classification of sentences or texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Pang and Lee, 2008)</ref>. Rule-based ap- proaches are grounded on syntactic and semantic analyses of the sentence and provide deeper anal- yses of sentiment-related phenomena. For exam- ple, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Neviarouskaya et al., 2010a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Moilanen and Pulman, 2007</ref>) provide linguistic rules deal- ing with the principle of compositionality in or- der to improve the detection of opinion targets and the resolution of polarity. Similarly, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shaikh et al., 2009</ref>) provide a linguistic adaptation of the OCC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ortony, Clore and Collins (Ortony et al., 1990</ref>) based on logic and semantic rules. Hybrid approaches also begin to be used for more fine- grained opinion and sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Yang and Cardie, 2013)</ref> Sentiment/opinion detection methods used in human-agent interaction are rare and, when they are employed, they are not different from the ones used in opinion mining: they are consequently not designed for socio-affective interactions. In- deed, the development of a module for the detec- tion of sentiment-related phenomena in face-to- face human-agent interactions requires to tackle various scientific issues: the delimitation of the relevant sentiment-phenomenon to detect, the in- tegration of the multi-modal context and the man- agement of the spontaneous and conversational speech.</p><p>The present paper tackles two of the issues: the integration of the conversational context and the delimitation of the relevant phenomenon. Regard- ing the first issue, we propose a system relying on a rule-based method that allows us to model the agent's utterances in order to help the detection of user's sentiment-related phenomena.</p><p>Then, we delimit and specify the linguistic phe- nomenon to detect by focusing on one specific as- pect required by ECAs for modelling social rela- tionships: the user's likings that are given by the expressions of user's likes and dislikes in the ver- bal content.</p><p>This paper is organised as follows: first, we present the theoretical model which our system is grounded on (Section 2). Then, we provide a de- scription of the system: each stage of the bottom- up process is described, including the linguistic rules and the patterns used by the system. In Sec- tion 4, we introduce the annotation campaign we launched on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) in order to create a data-set for the evaluation of our system. Finally, we present and discuss the results of the system evaluation (Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Theoretical background</head><p>The liking is one of the key dimensions used for the modelling of social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pecune et al., 2013)</ref>. The definition of this concept is grounded on the Heider's Balance Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Heider, 1958)</ref> and is defined as: "the way relations among persons involving some impersonal entity are cog- nitively experienced by the individual" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zajonc, 1960)</ref>. Heider's theory is integrated in social agent computational models by defining scenarios where the agent and the user's likings toward each other are determined by their liking toward other entities (things, process or events). In such scenarios, the analysis of user's verbal content has a key role as a major source of information for determining of the user's likes and dislikes. Therefore, a linguis- tic description of this phenomenon is required to design a detection system.</p><p>In the research field of Opinion Mining and Sen- timent Analysis, the majority of opinion/sentiment detection systems focus on the positive/negative distinction or on the classification of a restricted number of emotion categories. Other in-depth ap- proaches, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wiebe et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Breck et al., 2007)</ref>, refer to the Private State Theory, which defines mental states as involving opinions, be- liefs, judgements, appraisals and affects. Beside those models, the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Martin and White, 2005</ref>) is increasingly used in several works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Neviarouskaya et al., 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bloom et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Whitelaw et al., 2005</ref>). This model provides a lin- guistic description and a focus on the verbal ex- pressions of sentiment and opinion and proposes a complex framework, for describing how attitudes are expressed in English. It distinguishes affects -which are concerned with emotional reactions -from judgements and appreciations -which re- late to evaluations toward people's behaviours and semiotic or natural phenomena. Finally, it mod- els attitudinal expressions as relying on three ele- ments: a source, the person evaluating or experi- encing, a target, the entity which is evaluated or which triggers an affect and a linguistic clue ex- pressing the evaluation.</p><p>In this model, likes and dislikes can be consid- ered as a subcategory of the Attitudes. This subcat- egory overlaps the three categories (affect, judg- ment, appreciation) defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Martin and White, 2005</ref>). For example, the sentence "This painting makes me sad" is considered as an affect, while the sentence "This painting is a master-work" is considered as an appreciation. But, in both cases, we can consider them as a user's like. How- ever, among the expressions of attitudes where the source is the user, some of them do not refer to a like or dislike. For example, "I'm very happy" refers to an affect and does not give any clue re- garding a possible like or dislike. Thus, a selec- tion of relevant attitudes have to be done. The rules used for this selection are presented in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A rule-based and symbolic method</head><p>On the basis of the Martin and White's model de- scribed in the previous section, we design a system able to detect expressions of attitudes correspond- ing to the user's likes and dislikes. It is grounded on linguistic rules modelling the syntactic and se- mantic structure of the sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Integrating the interaction context</head><p>The system presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> successively processes each adjacency pair (AP) of the dialogue  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sacks et al., 1974)</ref>, i.e. each user's speech turn and the agent's one immediately preceding it. We aim to detect two kinds of user's attitudinal expres- sions that can occur during the interaction: the first ones which are spontaneous and do not depend on the agent's sentence (Agent: What did you do to- day? User: I saw a great movie); and the second ones which are triggered by the agent's sentence (Agent: Do you like outdoors activities? User: Yeah very much).</p><p>In the last case, the detection of the attitude ex- pressed in the agent's sentence appears as a neces- sary step for the detection of the user's ones. This detection has to be done in an automatic way as, in the agent platform we use (the Greta platform, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bevacqua et al., 2010)</ref>, the agent's speech turns are not automatically generated but scripted. Thus, we cannot obtain the linguistic and semantic infor- mation about attitude by using the generation data. Furthermore, in order to make the dialogue setting as light as possible, it is not possible to script such values for each agent's sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">A bottom-Up process</head><p>The relevant expressions of attitudes are de- tected by using a bottom-up and rule-based process, which launches successively the different levels of analysis: lexical level, chunk level, sentence level. These three stages comprise formal grammars, which are implemented within the Unitex plateform <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Paumier, 2015)</ref>. During these various stages, values are assigned to the three boolean variables which are finally used to decide whether the user is expressing a like or a dislike:</p><p>RelevantAttExpr(agtSentence), RelevantAttExpr(usrSentence), Y esN oAnswer(usrSentence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Lexical level</head><p>After a tokenisation and a POS-tagging, the sys- tem checks whether the sentence (the user or the agent's one) contains lexical clues of atti- tudinal expressions. Three parts of speech are taken into account: the nouns, the adjectives and the verbs. We use a re-adaptation of the Wordnet-affect lexicon <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Valitutti, 2004</ref>). In or- der to adapt this lexicon to our goal, a selec- tion of relevant lexical entries has to be done. Among all the synsets, we select those which can be linked to like and dislike and that belong to the following main categories: positive-emotion, negative-emotion, neutral-emotion. As the lexi- con is applied by the Unitex plateform, we turn the Wordnet-Affect lexicon into a unitex dictio- nary format. Finally, this transformation provides three dictionaries: one for the nouns, one for the adjectives and one for the verbs. If the lexical pro- cessing has found one or several lexical clues of attitude, the system continues the analysis and get to the next stage, else RelevantAttExpr(X) = F alse and the system quits the analysis of the sen- tence. Regarding the user's sentence, the system also checks if one or several tokens of sentence match with a yes or a no word, by using a short lexicon manually built which comprises less than ten words for each sentence type. If the test suc- ceeds Y esN oAnswer(usrSentence) = T rue, else Y esN oAnswer(usrSentence) = F alse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Chunk level</head><p>At this level, we design formal grammar -imple- mented as finite state automatons within the Uni- tex plateform. Three main chunks are defined: the verbal, the adjectival and the nominal chunks. All these chunks can imply a lexical unit of attitude. In such case, a polarity value is assigned to the entire chunk by applying rules which consider valence shifters and polarity conflict (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Sentence level</head><p>Attitudinal value The system parse of each sen- tence for checking if the sentence matches with an attitudinal expression, according to its syntactic structure. This parsing phase is grounded on a set of patterns (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Among the attitudinal patterns provided in the literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Neviarouskaya et al., 2010a</ref>; ?), we selected those expressing a like or dislike according to a previous corpus- based study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Langlet and Clavel, 2014</ref>) (develop- ment corpus presented in Section 4.1). Depend- ing on the speaker of the processed sentence -the agent or the user -sentence structures can be in- terrogative or affirmative surface structures. In the agent's sentence, the system looks for both affir- mative and interrogative forms, while in the user's sentences, it only takes into account affirmative structures.</p><p>Type of the source Simultaneously, the system checks the source of the attitude. The type of a relevant source varies depending on the sentence processed: in the agent's sentence, the system aims to detect attitudes able to be validated or in- validated by the user and whose source is either the agent -lexically represented by a first person pronoun (Src(agt) → "I"|"me") -or the user - lexically represented by a second person pronoun (Src(usr) → "you'); in the user's sentence, the system aims to detect only the attitudes whose source is the user -represented by a first person pronoun (Src(usr) → "I"|"me").</p><p>Target and polarity At this stage, the system is also able to define the polarity of the expression by detecting the valence shifters which can modify the polarity of the attitudinal chunk and by apply- ing the appropriate polarity rules described in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 3</ref>. Regarding the target, the system is only able to assign to the target one of four generic classes. The first two classes concern the two members of the conversation -agent and user. The third class, called other, deals with all entities and processes which are neither the agent or the user. The last one -unknown -concerns all the target referring by a pronoun, and whose class -even generic - cannot be known. In a future work, the other cate- gory could be detailed by using an ontological re- source, and unknown category by referring to an anaphora resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">User's utterance level within the AP</head><p>Generating attitude feature set Once the sen- tence level is done, the T rue value is assigned to the relevantAttExpr(usrSentence) variable in two steps.</p><p>Firstly, the syntactic structure of the user's sentence matches with one of the attitudinal patterns <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref> whose source is the user (Src(user)).</p><p>The feature set of the atti- tudinal expression is generated according to the information found at the parsing stage: source ∈ {user, agent}, polarity ∈ {neg, pos}, targetT ype ∈ {user, agent, other, unknown}.</p><p>Secondly, if the agent's sentence matches with one of the attitudinal patterns whose source is either the user or the agent (Src(user|agent)), then relevantAttExpr(agtSentence) = T rue.</p><p>In this second case, if Y esN oAnswer(usrSentence) == T rue, the user validates or invalidates the attitude. Thus, the system defines relevantAttExpr(usrSentence) == T rue, even if any sentence matching with a relevant pattern has been found in the user's sentence. The feature set associated to the user's attitude is built according to those assigned to the attitudinal expression found is the agent's sentence. Since the user assumes or rejects the attitude expressed by the agent, the system considers that he/she utters an attitudinal expression that he/she is the source. Regarding the polarity, if the user validates the statement expressed by the agent, the polarity of his/her attitude is the same as the agent's one. Otherwise, if the user expresses a no answer, the polarity is the opposite of the agent's one.</p><p>Converting attitude into like-dislike The pat- terns used for the parsing phase refer to attitudes that are good candidates for ex- pressions of like or dislike.</p><p>When the relevantAttExpr(usrSentence) == T rue, the system converts the attitude into a like or a dis- like on the basis of the feature set associated to the expression of attitude: an attitude with a pos- itive polarity (attitude(pol : pos)) is considered as a like, and an attitude with a negative polarity (attitude(pol : neg)) is considered as a dislike. The target is the same as the attitudinal expression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Corpus for evaluating the system 4.1 Semaine corpus</head><p>In order to evaluate our system, an annotated data set of sentences extracted from the Semaine cor- pus <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(McKeown et al., 2011</ref>) has been created. This corpus comprises 65 manually-transcribed sessions where a human user interacts with a hu- man operator playing the role of the virtual agent. These interactions are based on a scenario involv- ing four agent characters: Poppy, happy and out- going, Prudence, sensible and level-headed, Spike, angry and confrontational and Obadiah, depres- sive and gloomy. Agent's sentences are con- strained by a script (however, some deviations to the script occur in the database) aimed at putting the user in the same state as the one of the played character. 30 sessions of the corpus have been used for the development set. The rest of the data has been considered to build the evaluation corpus following the protocol described in the next para- graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Annotation protocol on AMT</head><p>We use AMT platform to carry out the annota- tion campaign. It allows us to easily recruit a large number of English native speakers. Recent works have shown the reliability of the annota- tions provided by this platform. For various tasks of language annotation -evaluation of machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Callison-Burch, 2009)</ref>, affect recogni- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Snow et al., 2008)</ref>, or dictionary validation (Taboada et al., 2011) -they observe a high agree- ment of non-expert raters with the gold standards.</p><p>For our annotation protocol, the recruited anno- tators are put in the same conditions as the system: each annotator has to label the user's likes and dislikes by only considering the AP (without the whole interaction) and the verbal content (with- out the audio and video). Among the pairs having less than thirty words in the evaluation corpus, we randomly selected 600 APs -made of an agent's speech turn and a user's one (see Section 3.1). This length of the sentence has been restricted to avoid annotation difficulties.</p><p>The dataset is divided in 60 subsets of 10 APs. In order to secure the annotation and to prevent the annotators from doing the annotation task two times, we use TurkGate tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Goldin and Darlow, 2013)</ref>. The AMT workers have been selected ac- cording to their approval rate -greater than or equal to 99% -and to the number of task approved -greater than or equal to 10000. Each subset of the corpus is randomly assigned to one annotator, and the order in which the AP are presented to each annotator is also randomly defined. A train- ing phase is previously subjected to each annotator in order to familiarise him/her to the annotation principles. Finally, 240 AMT workers have par- ticipated to the annotation campaign (4 for each subset).</p><p>Questionnaire As the annotation is done by non-expert annotators, we design a simplified and intuitive annotation process: for each pair, the an- notators have to answer to a set of questions fea- tured in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The goal of the questionnaire is to determine whether the annotator is able to deduce a user's like or dislike from the APs. In order to facilitate the annotation and to make the interpretation of each sentence as spontaneous as possible, the question have been designed without linguistic technical word. In this way, the task is more functional for the annotator and it is easier for him/her to put his/herself to the place of the hearer. Each question of the questionnaire focuses on one of the outputs of the detection system:</p><p>• The first question examines the presence of an expression of like or dislike and provides a yes/no answer.</p><p>• the second question deals with the multiple occurrences of like/dislike expressions in the same speech turn. We limited the answer to "4" (maximum number of like/dislike ex- pressions observed in the dataset). If the an- notator detects more than one expression of like/dislike, the questions 3 to 4 are asked for each expression of like/dislike.</p><p>• the third question deals with the type of the target. As answers, only the four types - <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Annotation process on AMT those the system is able to detect -are pro- posed.</p><p>• The fourth question concerns the polarity of the expression: positive (like) or negative (dislike).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Inter-annotator agreement and consistency</head><p>We measure the inter-annotators agreement or consistency at each stage of the questionnaire. All the measures presented in the section have been applied for each subset of the corpus (60 subsets of 10 APs, 4 annotators for each subset). Regarding the answer to the first question of the questionnaire, we measure how the annota- tors are agreeing on the presence of at least one user expression of like or dislike by using the <ref type="bibr">Fleiss' Kappa (Fleiss, 1971</ref>) (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Sec- ond, we measure the consistency on the annotation of the number of user's expressions to each pair by using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cronbach, 1951</ref>). As, for labeling the number of likes- dislikes expressed in each pair, the crowd-workers have to select a value on a scale (from 1 to 4), it ap- pears as suitable to measure the relative similarity between ratings rather than the agreement about an exact value. The Cronbach's alpha is designed for evaluating the internal consistency of a scale annotation. In this way, it measures the degree to which different raters or observers make consis- tent estimates of the same phenomenon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fleiss' Kappa Cronbach's alpha</head><p>The obtained scores are encouraging. Regard- ing the agreement on the presence of an expres- sion of like or dislike, even if the median score is comprised between 0.30 and 0.40, the maxi- mal value equals to 0.79. Moreover, 40% of the subsets has a kappa score comprised between 0.40 and 0.60. The consistency score is also significant: 51% of the annotated sub-corpus has a score equal or higher than 0.7, which is considered as an ac- ceptable level of agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(George and Mallery, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>For the polarity and the target type, we select the pairs where at least two annotators agree on the presence of an expression of like or dislike, and we consider only the annotations provided by these annotators. After this selection, we obtain a sub-set of ratings with a unfixed set of annota- tors. As the Fleiss' Kappa must be applied on data with an invariable and fixed set of raters, we con- sider the percent agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gwet, 2010)</ref> as more appropriate. Even though, it seems sometimes difficult for the annotators to agree on the pres- ence of a user's expression of like or dislike, their agreement on the polarity of such expressions ap- pears as more significant: 41% of the sub-corpus has a percentage of agreement between 50% and 75% and 52% of the sub-corpus has a percentage of agreement upper than 75%. The agreement is also significant regarding the target: 61% of the sub-corpus has a percentage of agreement upper than 50%. All these results are quite positive for a system-oriented annotation of a such subjective phenomenon.</p><p>5 Evaluation of the system <ref type="bibr">5</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.1 Protocol</head><p>From the 600 pairs of the previously annotated corpus, we keep 503 pairs for the evaluation of the system by removing the pairs where a consensus can not be found between the 4 annotators -that is that we keep as a reference the majority vote corresponding to the data where at least three an- notators agree. We use three different measures to evaluate the system performance relying on the agreement measures presented in Section 4.3: the detection of the presence of a user's expression of like or dislike is evaluated by the Fleiss' kappa between the system output and the reference; the consistency on the number of detected expressions is evaluated by the Cronbach's alpha coefficient; the agreement on the polarity is measured by us- ing the Fleiss' kappa; and the agreement on the target type with the percentage of agreement. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> presents the results obtained for each de- tection task (presence of a like/dislike expression, detection of the correct number of expressions contained in an sentence, and correct classification between like and dislike). The agreement between</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results</head><p>No Expr-Expr k = 0.61 Nb of expressions rated α = 0.67 Polarity k = 0.84 Target type p = 53% <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Agreement scores between the system output and the reference the system output and the reference is substantial for the detection of the presence of a user expres- sion (k = 0.61) and the number of user expres- sions is also correctly detected by the system (ac- ceptable α largely higher than 0.6). However, the major part of the corpus contains no more than 1 like/dislike expression (98% of the pairs are an- notated by the reference and the system as con- taining 0 or 1 like/dislike expression). 4% of the pairs (25 pairs) is annotated by the system as con- taining 1 expression, while the referred annotation does not indicate the presence of any like/dislike expression. For 8% of the pairs (43 pairs), it is the opposite phenomenon (1 expression annotated by the reference but not by the system). The Fleiss' kappa score obtained for the polarity is really en- couraging since it equals 0.844. Regarding the target type, we obtain a percentage of agreement at 53%. The disagreement frequently concerns a confusion between the unknown and other cate- gories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Discussion</head><p>We have carried out an in-depth analysis of the disagreement between the system outputs and the human annotations in order to identify tracks for the improvement of the system. We identified two main types of difficulties. The first difficulty concerns the processing of spontaneous speech. The Semaine corpus con- tains a great number of disfluent utterances that disrupt the syntactical structure of the speech turn and thus hinder both the annotation process and the detection system. In the following pair, Agent: ''Oh!" -User: ''are just very good really good film and read a book", the grammatical structure of the user sentence is fuzzy (absence of the sub- ject, presence of repairs) which makes the pars- ing of the sentence and thus the detection of atti- tudinal patterns difficult. However, the annotators have here correctly identified the presence of a like and the type of the target ("the film" in the Others category), which is not the case for all the anno- tations of the disfluent utterances. To handle this difficulty, it would be interesting to integrate a sys- tem able to automatically label disfluencies, such as the one presented in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dutrey et al., 2014</ref>). The disfluent structure of the sentence could thus be in- tegrated to our syntactic and semantic rules. How- ever, the automatic detection of disfluencies is still an open challenge, in particular in the case of edit disfluencies where the speaker corrects or alters the utterance or abandons it entirely and starts over <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Strassel, 2004</ref>).</p><p>The second difficulty concerns the lack of con- text provided by some of the APs. Our system of- fers a first step in the integration of the interac- tion context by considering jointly the user's ut- terance and the previous agent's one that allow us to correctly analyse a large scale of expressions. However, the system and the annotators have to fo- cus on the APs without considering the preceding speech turns, which can cause disagreements not only between the system outputs and the human annotations, but also between the human annota- tors. In the following example, Agent: "good. ah good" -User: "my favourite emotion", the source (here, the user) can be easily identified but the in- formation contained in the AP is not sufficient to identify the target. An interesting answer to this issue is to take into account the whole conversa- tion preceding a user's utterance as a significant context for the latter. This will imply the design of new complex rules taking into account a larger interaction context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and future works</head><p>We have introduced a NLP-based system able to detect user's expressions of likes and dislikes in the conversation with an ECA. This system re- lies on syntactic and semantic rules integrating the interaction context by analysing the content of the agent's utterances to help the analysis of the user's ones. It is designed as a bottom-up and rule-based process. The system has been evalu- ated by using an evaluation data set created under AMT platform. This first and pioneering version of the system shows encouraging results for the different tasks performed by the system that con- cern the detection of relevant like/dislike expres- sions (substantial agreement with a Fleiss kappa at 0.61), the categorization of the expressions be- tween like and dislike (almost perfect agreement with a Fleiss kappa at 0.84) -polarity assignment -and the identification of the target type (53% of agreement between the reference and the sys- tem output). Beyond these quite optimistic results, we have provided some tracks for the system im- provement that concerns a deeper integration of the interaction context and the processing of spon- taneous speech features.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Process overview</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,103.45,62.81,390.64,294.53" type="bitmap" /></figure>
