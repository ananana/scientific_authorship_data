				<p>The purpose of text geolocation is to associate geographic information contained in a document with a set (or sets) of coordinates , either implicitly by using linguistic features and/or explicitly by using geographic metadata combined with heuristics. We introduce a geocoder (loca-tion mention disambiguator) that achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on three diverse datasets by exploiting the implicit lexical clues. Moreover, we propose a new method for systematic encoding of geographic metadata to generate two distinct views of the same text. To that end, we introduce the Map Vector (MapVec), a sparse representation obtained by plotting prior geographic probabilities, derived from population figures, on a World Map. We then integrate the implicit (lan-guage) and explicit (map) features to significantly improve a range of metrics. We also introduce an open-source dataset for geoparsing of news events covering global disease outbreaks and epidemics to help future evaluation in geoparsing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Geocoding 1 is a specific case of text geoloca- tion, which aims at disambiguating place refer- ences in text. For example, Melbourne can refer to more than ten possible locations and a geocoder's task is to identify the place coordinates for the intended Melbourne in a context such as "Mel- bourne hosts one of the four annual Grand Slam tennis tournaments." This is central to the success of tasks such as indexing and searching documents by geography ( <ref type="bibr">Bhargava et al., 2017)</ref>, geospatial <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Also called Toponym Resolution in related literature.</p><p>analysis of social media <ref type="bibr">(Buchel and Pennington, 2017</ref>), mapping of disease risk using inte- grated data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hay et al., 2013)</ref>, and emergency re- sponse systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ashktorab et al., 2014</ref>). Previ- ous geocoding methods (Section 2) have lever- aged lexical semantics to associate the implicit geographic information in natural language with coordinates. These models have achieved good results in the past. However, focusing only on lexical features, to the exclusion of other feature spaces such as the Cartesian Coordinate System, puts a ceiling on the amount of semantics we are able to extract from text. Our proposed solution is the Map Vector (MapVec), a sparse, geographic vector for explicit modelling of geographic dis- tributions of location mentions. As in previous work, we use population data and geographic co- ordinates, observing that the most populous Mel- bourne is also the most likely to be the intended location. However, MapVec is the first instance, to our best knowledge, of the topological semantics of context locations explicitly isolated into a stan- dardized vector representation, which can then be easily transferred to an independent task and com- bined with other features. MapVec is able to en- code the prior geographic distribution of any num- ber of locations into a single vector. Our extensive evaluation shows how this representation of con- text locations can be integrated with linguistic fea- tures to achieve a significant improvement over a SOTA lexical model. MapVec can be deployed as a standalone neural geocoder, significantly beating the population baseline, while remaining effective with simpler machine learning algorithms. This paper's contributions are: (1) Lexical Geocoder outperforming existing systems by analysing only the textual context; (2) MapVec, a geographic representation of locations using a sparse, probabilistic vector to extract and isolate spatial features; (3) CamCoder, a novel geocoder that exploits both lexical and geographic knowl- edge producing SOTA results across multiple datasets; and (4) GeoVirus, an open-source dataset for the evaluation of geoparsing (Location Recog- nition and Disambiguation) of news events cover- ing global disease outbreaks and epidemics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Depending on the task objective, geocoding methodologies can be divided into two distinct categories: (1) document geocoding, which aims at locating a piece of text as a whole, for example geolocating Twitter users ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rahimi et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rahimi et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roller et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rahimi et al., 2015)</ref>, Wikipedia articles and/or web pages ( <ref type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Backstrom et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wing and Baldridge, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dredze et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wing and Baldridge, 2014)</ref>. This is an active area of NLP research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hulden et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martins, 2017, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Iso et al., 2017)</ref>; (2) geocoding of place mentions, which focuses on the disambigua- tion of location (named) entities i.e. this paper and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Karimzadeh et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">DeLozier et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Santos et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Speriosu and Baldridge, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhang and Gelernter, 2014</ref>). Due to the differences in evaluation and objective, the categories cannot be directly or fairly compared. Geocoding is typi- cally the second step in Geoparsing. The first step, usually referred to as Geotagging, is a Named Entity Recognition component which extracts all location references in a given text. This phase may optionally include metonymy resolution, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Zhang and Gelernter, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gritta et al., 2017a</ref>). The goal of geocoding is to choose the correct coordinates for a location mention from a set of candidates. <ref type="bibr">Gritta et al. (2017b)</ref> provided a com- prehensive survey of five recent geoparsers. The authors established an evaluation framework, with a new dataset, for their experimental analysis. We use this evaluation framework in our experiments. We briefly describe the methodology of each geocoder featured in our evaluation (names are capitalised and appear in italics) as well as survey the related work in geocoding.</p><p>Computational methods in geocoding broadly divide into rule-based, statistical and machine learning-based. Edinburgh Geoparser ( ) is a fully rule- based geocoder that uses hand-built heuristics combined with large lists from Wikipedia and the Geonames 2 gazetteer. It uses metadata (feature type, population, country code) with heuristics such as contextual information, spatial clustering and user locality to rank candidates. <ref type="bibr">GeoTxT (Karimzadeh et al., 2013</ref>) is another rule-based geocoder with a free web service 3 for identifying locations in unstructured text and grounding them to coordinates. Disambiguation is driven by multiple heuristics and uses the administrative level (country, province, city), population size, the Levenshtein Distance of the place referenced and the candidate's name and spatial minimisation to resolve ambiguous locations. ( <ref type="bibr">Dredze et al., 2013</ref>) is a rule-based Twitter geocoder using only metadata (coordinates in tweets, GPS tags, user's reported location) and custom place lists for fast and simple geocoding. CLAVIN (Car- tographic Location And Vicinity INdexer) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> is an open-source geocoder, which offers context- based entity recognition and linking. It seems to be mostly rule-based though details of its algorithm are underspecified, short of reading the source code. Unlike the Edinburgh Parser, this geocoder seems to overly rely on population data, seemingly mirroring the behaviour of a naive population baseline. Rule-based systems can perform well though the variance in performance is high (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Yahoo! Placemaker is a free web service with a proprietary geo-database and algorithm from Yahoo! 5 letting anyone geoparse text in a globally-aware and language-independent manner. It is unclear how geocoding is performed, however, the inclusion of proprietary methods makes evaluation broader and more informative.</p><p>The statistical geocoder <ref type="bibr">Topocluster (DeLozier et al., 2015</ref>) divides the world surface into a grid (0.5 x 0.5 degrees, approximately 60K tiles) and uses lexical features to model the geographic dis- tribution of context words over this grid. Building on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Speriosu and Baldridge (2013)</ref>, it uses a window of 15 words (our approach scales this up by more than 20 times) to perform hot spot analysis using Getis-Ord Local Statistic of indi- vidual words' association with geographic space. The classification decision was made by finding the grid square with the strongest overlap of individual geo-distributions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hulden et al. (2015)</ref> used Kernel Density Estimation to learn the word distribution over a world grid with a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 degrees and classified documents with Kullback-Leibler divergence or a Naive Bayes model, reminiscent of an earlier approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wing and Baldridge (2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roller et al. (2012)</ref> used the Good-Turing Frequency Estimation to learn document probability distributions over the vocabulary with Kullback-Leibler divergence as the similarity function to choose the correct bucket in the k-d tree (world representation). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Iso et al. (2017)</ref> combined Gaussian Density Estimation with a CNN-model to geolocate Japanese tweets with Convolutional Mixture Density Networks.</p><p>Among the recent machine learning methods, bag-of-words representations combined with a Support Vector Machine ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Melo and Martins, 2015)</ref> or Logistic Regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wing and Baldridge, 2014</ref>) have also achieved good results. For Twitter-based geolocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zhang and Gelernter, 2014</ref>), bag-of-words classifiers were success- fully augmented with social network data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jurgens et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rahimi et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rahimi et al., , 2015</ref>). The machine learning-based geocoder by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Santos et al. (2015)</ref> supplemented lexical features, repre- sented as a bag-of-words, with an exhaustive set of manually generated geographic features and spa- tial heuristics such as geospatial containment and geodesic distances between entities. The rank- ing of locations was learned with LambdaMART <ref type="bibr">(Burges, 2010)</ref>. Unlike our geocoder, the addition of geographic features did not significantly im- prove scores, reporting: "The geo-specific features seem to have a limited impact over a strong base- line system." Unable to obtain a codebase, their re- sults feature in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The latest neural network approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rahimi et al., 2017</ref>) with normalised bag-of-word representations have achieved SOTA scores when augmented with social network data for Twitter document (user's concatenated tweets) geolocation (Bakerman et al., 2018).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>geocoded. Consider an example disambiguation of Cairo in a sentence: "The Giza pyramid com- plex is an archaeological site on the Giza Plateau, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt.". Here, Cairo is the Target Entity; Egypt, Giza and Giza Plateau are the Location Mentions; the rest of the sentence forms the Context Words (excluding stopwords). The context window is up to 200 words each side of the Target Entity, approximately an order of magnitude larger than most previous approaches.</p><p>We used separate layers, convolutional and/or dense (fully-connected), with ReLu activations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Nair and Hinton, 2010</ref>) to break up the task into smaller, focused modules in order to learn distinct lexical feature patterns, phrases and keywords for different types of inputs, concatenating only at a higher level of abstraction. Unigrams and bigrams were learned for context words and location men- tions (1,000 filters of size 1 and 2 for each input), trigrams for the target entity (1,000 filters of size 3). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Global Maximum Pooling were chosen for their position invariance (detecting location-indicative words anywhere in context) and efficient input size scaling. The dense layers have 250 units each, with a dropout layer (p = 0.5) to prevent overfit- ting. The fourth input is MapVec, the geographic vector representation of location mentions. It feeds into two dense layers with 5,000 and 1,000 units respectively. The concatenated hidden lay- ers then get fully connected to the softmax layer. The model is optimised with <ref type="bibr">RMSProp (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012</ref>). We approach geocoding as a classification task where the model predicts one of 7,823 classes (units in the softmax layer in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref>), each being a 2x2 degree tile representing part of the world's surface, slightly coarser than MapVec (see Section 3.1 next). The coordinates of the location candidate with the smallest FD (Equa- tion 1) are the model's final output.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F D = error − error candidatePop maximumPop Bias (1)</formula><p>FD for each candidate is computed by reducing the prediction error (the distance from predicted coordinates to candidate coordinates) by the value of error multiplied by the estimated prior proba- bility (candidate population divided by maximum population) multiplied by the Bias parameter. The value of Bias = 0.9 was determined to be optimal for highest development data scores and is identi- cal for all highly diverse test datasets. Equation 1 is designed to bias the model towards more popu- lated locations to reflect real-world data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Map Vector (MapVec)</head><p>Word embeddings and/or distributional vectors encode a word's meaning in terms of its linguistic context. However, location (named) entities also carry explicit topological semantic knowledge such as a coordinate position and a population count for all places with an identical name. Until now, this knowledge was only used as part of simple disparate heuristics and manual disam- biguation procedures. However, it is possible to plot this spatial data on a world map, which can then be reshaped into a 1D feature vector, or a Map Vector, the geographic representation of location mentions. MapVec is a novel standard- ised method for generating geographic features from text documents beyond lexical features. This enables a strong geocoding classification performance gain by extracting additional spatial knowledge that would normally be ignored. Geographic semantics cannot be inferred from language alone (too imprecise and incomplete). probability from a set of coordinates. A contin- uous representation of a region was generated by using the hidden layer of the neural network. However, all locations in the same region will be assigned an identical vector, which assumes that their semantics are also identical. Another way to obtain geographic representations is by generating embeddings directly from Geonames data using heuristics-driven DeepWalk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Perozzi et al., 2014</ref>) with geodesic distances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kejriwal and Szekely, 2017)</ref>. However, to assign a vector, places must first be disambiguated (catch-22). While these generation methods are original and interesting in theory, deploying them in the real-world is infeasible, hence we invented the Map Vector.</p><p>MapVec initially begins as a 180x360 world map of geodesic tiles. There are other ways of representing the surface of the Earth such as using nested hierarchies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Melo and Martins, 2015)</ref> or k-dimensional trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Roller et al., 2012)</ref>, however, this is beyond the scope of this work. The 1x1 tile size, in degrees of geographic coordinates, was empirically determined to be optimal to keep MapVec's size computationally efficient while maintaining meaningful resolution. This map is then populated with the prior geographic distribution of each location mentioned in context (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for an example). We use population count to estimate a location's prior probability as more populous places are more likely to be mentioned in common discourse. For each location mention and for each of its ambiguous candidates, their prior probability is added to the correct tile indicating its geographic position (see Algorithm 1). Tiles that cover areas of open water (64.1%) were removed to reduce size.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data and Preprocessing</head><p>Training data was generated from geographically annotated Wikipedia pages <ref type="bibr">(dumped February 2017)</ref>. Each page provided up to 30 training in- stances, limited to avoid bias from large pages. This resulted in collecting approximately 1.4M training instances, which were uniformly subsam- pled down to 400K to shorten training cycles as further increases offer diminishing returns. We used the Python-based NLP toolkit Spacy 6 (Hon- nibal and Johnson, 2015) for text preprocessing. All words were lowercased, lemmatised, any stop- words, dates, numbers and so on were replaced with a special token ("0"). Word vectors were ini- tialised with pretrained word embeddings 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). We do not employ ex- plicit feature selection as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Bo et al., 2012)</ref>, only a minimum frequency count, which was shown to work almost as well as deliberate selection (Van <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Laere et al., 2014)</ref>. The vocabulary size was limited to the most frequent 331K words, mini- mum ten occurrences for words and two for loca- tion references in the 1.4M training corpus. A fi- nal training instance comprises four types of con- text information: Context Words (excluding lo- cation mentions, up to 2x200 words), Location Mentions (excluding context words, up to 2x200 words), Target Entity (up to 15 words) and the MapVec geographic representation of context lo- cations. We have also checked for any over- laps between our Wikipedia-based training data and the WikToR dataset. Those examples were removed. The aforementioned 1.4M Wikipedia training corpus was once again uniformly sub- sampled to generate a disjoint development set of 400K instances. While developing our models mainly on this data, we also used small subsets of LGL (18%), GeoVirus (26%) and WikToR (9%) described in Section 4.2 to verify that development set improvements generalised to target domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>Our evaluation compares the geocoding perfor- mance of six systems from Section 2, our geocoder (CamCoder) and the population baseline. Among these, our CNN-based model is the only neural approach. We have included all open-source/free geocoders in working order we were able to find and they are the most up-to-date versions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Geocoding Metrics</head><p>We use the three standard and comprehensive metrics, each measuring an important aspect of geocoding, giving an accurate, holistic evalu- ation of performance. A more detailed cost- benefit analysis of geocoding metrics is available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Karimzadeh, 2016)</ref> and ( <ref type="bibr">Gritta et al., 2017b</ref>).</p><p>(1) Average (Mean) Error is the sum of all geocod- ing errors per dataset divided by the number of er- rors. It is an informative metric as it also indicates the total error but treats all errors as equivalent and is sensitive to outliers; (2) Accuracy@161km is the percentage of errors that are smaller than 161km (100 miles). While it is easy to interpret, giving fast and intuitive understanding of geocod- ing performance in percentage terms, it ignores all errors greater than 161km; (3) Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a comprehensive metric, ini- tially introduced for geocoding in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jurgens et al., 2015)</ref>. AUC reduces the importance of large er- rors (1,000km+) since accuracy on successfully resolved places is more desirable. While it is not an intuitive metric, AUC is robust to outliers and measures all errors. A versatile geocoder should be able to maximise all three metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Datasets</head><p>News Corpus: The Local Global Corpus (LGL) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lieberman et al. (2010)</ref> contains 588 news ar- ticles (4460 test instances), which were collected from geographically distributed newspaper sites. This is the most frequently used geocoding eval- uation dataset to date. The toponyms are mostly smaller places no larger than a US state. Approxi- mately 16% of locations in the corpus do not have any coordinates assigned; hence, we do not use those in the evaluation, which is also how the pre- vious figures were obtained. Wikipedia Corpus: This corpus was deliberately designed for ambi- guity hence the population heuristic is not effec- tive. Wikipedia Toponym Retrieval (WikToR) by <ref type="bibr">Gritta et al. (2017b)</ref> is a programmatically created corpus and although not necessarily representative of the real world distribution, it is a test of am- biguity for geocoders. It is also a large corpus (25,000+ examples) containing the first few para- graphs of 5,000 Wikipedia pages. High quality, free and open datasets are not readily available (GeoVirus tries to address this). The following corpora could not be included: <ref type="bibr">WoTR (DeLozier et al., 2016</ref>) due to limited coverage (southern US) and domain type (historical language, the 1860s), <ref type="bibr">(De Oliveira et al., 2017)</ref> contains fewer than 180 locations, GeoCorpora ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wallgrün et al., 2017)</ref> could not be retrieved in full due to deleted Twit- ter users/tweets, GeoText ( <ref type="bibr">Eisenstein et al., 2010</ref>) only allows for user geocoding, <ref type="bibr">SpatialML (Mani et al., 2010</ref>) involves prohibitive costs, GeoSem- Cor ( <ref type="bibr">Buscaldi and Rosso, 2008</ref>) was annotated with WordNet senses (rather than coordinates).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>All tested models (except CamCoder) operate as end-to-end systems; therefore, it is not possible to perform geocoding separately. Each system geop- arses its particular majority of the dataset to ob- tain a representative data sample, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  1</ref> as strongly correlated scores for subsets of dif- ferent sizes, with which to assess model perfor- mance. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> also shows scores in brackets for the overlapping partition of all systems in order to compare performance on identical instances: GeoVirus 601 (26%), LGL 787 (17%) and Wik- ToR 2,202 (9%). The geocoding difficulty based on the ambiguity of each dataset is: LGL (moder- ate to hard), WIK (very hard), GEO (easy to mod- erate). A population baseline also features in the evaluation. The baseline is conceptually simple: choose the candidate with the highest population, akin to the most frequent word sense in WSD. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the effectiveness of this heuristic, which is competitive with many geocoders, even outperforming some. However, the baseline is not effective on WikToR as the dataset was de- liberately constructed as a tough ambiguity test. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows how several geocoders mirror the behaviour of the population baseline. This sim- ple but effective heuristic is rarely used in system comparisons, and where evaluated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Santos et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Leidner, 2008)</ref>, it is inconsistent with ex- pected figures (due to unpublished resources, we are unable to investigate).</p><p>We note that no single computational paradigm dominates  the outstanding geocoder on the highly ambiguous WikToR data. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model using only MapVec with no lexical features is almost as effective but more importantly, it is significantly better than the population baseline <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2</ref>). This is because the Map Vector benefits from wide contextual awareness, encoded in Algorithm 1, while a simple population baseline does not. When we combined the lexical and geographic feature spaces in one model (Cam- Coder 9 ), we observed a substantial increase in the SOTA scores. We have also reproduced the context2vec model to obtain a continuous context representation using bidirectional LSTMs to encode lexical features, denoted as LSTM 10 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. This enabled us to test the effect of integrating MapVec into another deep learning model as opposed to CNNs. Supplemented with MapVec, we observed a significant improvement, demonstrating how enriching various neural models with a geographic vector representation boosts classification results.</p><p>Deep learning is the dominant paradigm in our experiments. However, it is important that MapVec is still effective with simpler machine learning algorithms. To that end, we have evalu- ated it with the Random Forest without using any lexical features. This model was well suited to the geocoding task despite training with only half of the 400K training data (due to memory con- straints, partial fit is unavailable for batch training in SciKit Learn). Scores were on par with more so- phisticated systems. The Naive Bayes was less ef- <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Single model settings/parameters for all tests. 10 https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/ fective with MapVec though still somewhat viable as a geocoder given the lack of lexical features and a naive algorithm, narrowly beating popula- tion. GeoVirus scores remain highly competitive across most geocoders. This is due to the nature of the dataset; locations skewed towards their domi- nant "senses" simulating ideal geocoding condi- tions, enabling high accuracy for the population baseline. GeoVirus alone may not serve as the best scenario to assess a geocoder's performance, however, it is nevertheless important and valu- able to determine behaviour in a standard envi- ronment. For example, GeoVirus helped us diag- nose Yahoo! Placemaker's lower accuracy in what should be an easy test for a geocoder. The <ref type="figure">fig- ures</ref> show that while the average error is low, the accuracy@161km is noticeably lower than most systems. When coupled with other complemen- tary datasets such as LGL and WikToR, it fa- cilitates a comprehensive assessment of geocod- ing behaviour in many types of scenarios, expos- ing potential domain dependence. We note that GeoVirus has a dual function, NER (not evaluated but useful for future work) and Geocoding. We made all of our resources freely available 11 for full reproducibility (Goodman et al., 2016).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Discussion and Errors</head><p>The Pearson correlation coefficient of the target entity ambiguity and the error size was only r ≈ 0.2 suggesting that CamCoder's geocoding errors do not simply rise with location ambiguity. Errors were also not correlated (r ≈ 0.0) with population size with all types of locations geocoded to vari- ous degrees of accuracy. All error curves follow a power law distribution with between 89% and 96% of errors less than 1500km, the rest rapidly increasing into thousands of kilometers. Errors also appear to be uniformly geographically dis- tributed across the world. The strong lexical com- ponent shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> is reflected by the lack of a relationship between error size and the num- ber of locations found in the context. The num- ber of total words in context is also independent of geocoding accuracy. This suggests that Cam- Coder learns strong linguistic cues beyond simple association of place names with the target entity and is able to cope with flexible-sized contexts. A CNN Geocoder would expect to perform well for the following reasons: Our context window is 400 words rather than 10-40 words as in pre- vious approaches. The model learns 1,000 fea- ture maps per input and per feature type, tracking 5,000 different word patterns (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams), a significant text processing capa- bility. The lexical model also takes advantage of our own 50-dimensional word embeddings, tuned on geographic Wikipedia pages only, allowing for greater generalisation than bag-of-unigrams mod- els; and the large training/development datasets (400K each), optimising geocoding over a diverse global set of places allowing our model to gener- alise to unseen instances. We note that MapVec generation is sensitive to NER performance with higher F-Scores leading to better quality of the ge- ographic vector representation(s). Precision errors can introduce noise while recall errors may with- hold important locations. The average F-Score for the featured geoparsers is F ≈ 0.7 (standard de- viation ≈ 0.1). Spacy's NER performance over the three datasets is also F ≈ 0.7 with a simi- lar variation between datasets. In order to further interpret scores in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 1 and 2</ref>, with respect to maximising geocoding performance, we briefly discuss the Oracle score. Oracle is the geocod- ing performance upper bound given by the Geon- ames data, i.e. the highest possible score(s) us- ing Geonames coordinates as the geocoding out- put. In other words, it quantifies the minimum er- ror for each dataset given the perfect location dis- ambiguation. This means it quantifies the differ- ence between "gold standard" coordinates and the coordinates in the Geonames database. The fol- lowing are the Oracle scores for LGL (AUC=0.04, a@161km=99) annotated with Geonames, Wik- ToR (AUC=0.14, a@161km=92) and GeoVirus (AUC=0.27, a@161km=88), which are annotated with Wikipedia data. Subtracting the Oracle score from a geocoder's score quantifies the scope of its theoretical future improvement, given a particular database/gazetteer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Geocoding methods commonly employ lexical features, which have proved to be very effec- tive. Our lexical model was the best language- only geocoder in extensive tests. It is possible, however, to go beyond lexical semantics. Loca- tions also have a rich topological meaning, which has not yet been successfully isolated and de- ployed. We need a means of extracting and en- coding this additional knowledge. To that end, we introduced MapVec, an algorithm and a con- tainer for encoding context locations in geodesic vector space. We showed how CamCoder, us- ing lexical and MapVec features, outperformed both approaches, achieving a new SOTA. MapVec remains effective with various machine learning frameworks (Random Forest, CNN and MLP) and substantially improves accuracy when combined with other neural models (LSTMs). Finally, we introduced GeoVirus, an open-source dataset that helps facilitate geoparsing evaluation across more diverse domains with different lexical-geographic distributions ( <ref type="bibr">Flatow et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dredze et al., 2016)</ref>. Tasks that could benefit from our meth- ods include social media placing tasks ( <ref type="bibr">Choi et al., 2014</ref>), inferring user location on Twitter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zheng et al., 2017)</ref>, geolocation of images based on de- scriptions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Serdyukov et al., 2009</ref>) and detect- ing/analyzing incidents from social media <ref type="bibr">(Berlingerio et al., 2013)</ref>. Future work may see our methods applied to document geolocation to as- sess the effectiveness of scaling geodesic vectors from paragraphs to entire documents.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 shows</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 shows our new geocoder CamCoder implemented in Keras (Chollet, 2015).

Finally, normalise the array (to a [0 − 1] range) by divid- ing by the maximum value of the MapVec array. this world map is reshaped into a one-dimensional Map Vector of length 23,002. The following features of MapVec are the most salient: Interpretability: Word vectors typically need intrinsic (Gerz et al., 2016) and extrinsic tasks (Senel et al., 2017) to interpret their se- mantics. MapVec generation is a fully transpar- ent, human readable and modifiable method. Ef- ficiency: MapVec is an efficient way of embed- ding any number of locations using the same stan- dardised vector. The alternative means creating, storing, disambiguating and computing with mil- lions of unique location vectors. Domain Inde- pendence: Word vectors vary depending on the source, time, type and language of the training data and the parameters of generation. MapVec is language-independent and stable over time, do- main, size of dataset since the world geography is objectively measured and changes very slowly.</figDesc></figure>
