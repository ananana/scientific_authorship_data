				<p>We propose an unsupervised probabilistic model for zero pronoun resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first such model that (1) is trained on zero pronouns in an unsu-pervised manner; (2) jointly identifies and resolves anaphoric zero pronouns; and (3) exploits discourse information provided by a salience model. Experiments demonstrate that our unsupervised model significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art un-supervised counterpart when resolving the Chinese zero pronouns in the OntoNotes corpus.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A zero pronoun (ZP) is a gap in a sentence that is found when a phonetically null form is used to refer to a real-world entity. An anaphoric zero pro- noun (AZP) is a ZP that corefers with one or more preceding mentions in the associated text. Below is an example taken from the Chinese TreeBank (CTB), where the ZP (denoted as *pro*) refers to 俄罗斯 (Russia).</p><p>[俄罗斯] 作为米洛舍夫维奇一贯的支持者， *pro* 曾经提出调停这场政治危机。 ( <ref type="bibr">[Russia]</ref> is a consistent supporter of Milošević, *pro* has proposed to mediate the political crisis.)</p><p>As we can see, ZPs lack grammatical attributes that are useful for overt pronoun resolution such as number and gender. This makes ZP resolution more challenging than overt pronoun resolution.</p><p>Automatic ZP resolution is typically composed of two steps. The first step, AZP identification, in- volves extracting ZPs that are anaphoric. The sec- ond step, AZP resolution, aims to identify an an- tecedent of an AZP. State-of-the-art ZP resolvers have tackled both of these steps in a supervised manner, training one classifier for AZP identifica- tion and another for AZP resolution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhao and Ng (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kong and Zhou (2010)</ref>).</p><p>More recently, we have proposed an unsuper- vised AZP resolution model (henceforth the CN14 model) that rivals its supervised counterparts in performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen and Ng, 2014</ref>). The idea is to resolve AZPs by using a probabilistic pronoun res- olution model trained on overt pronouns in an un- supervised manner. This is an appealing approach, as its language-independent generative process en- ables it to be applied to languages where data an- notated with ZP links are not available.</p><p>In light of the advantages of unsupervised mod- els, we examine in this paper the possibility of ad- vancing the state of the art in unsupervised AZP resolution. The design of our unsupervised model is motivated by a key question: can we resolve AZPs by using a probabilistic model trained on zero pronouns in an unsupervised manner? As mentioned above, the CN14 model was trained on overt pronouns, but it is not clear how much this helped its resolution performance. In particular, the contexts in which overt and zero pronouns oc- cur may not statistically resemble each other. For example, a ZP is likely to be closer to its antecedent than its overt counterpart. As another example, the verbs governing a ZP and its antecedent are more likely to be identical than the verbs govern- ing an overt pronoun and its antecedent. Given such differences, it is not clear whether the knowl- edge learned from overt pronouns is always appli- cable to the resolution of AZPs. For this reason, we propose to train an unsupervised AZP resolu- tion model directly on zero pronouns. Moreover, while we previously employed a pipeline architec- ture where we (1) used a set of heuristic rules for AZP identification, and then (2) applied their prob- abilistic model to all and only those ZPs that were determined to be anaphoric <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen and Ng, 2014)</ref>, in this work we identify and resolve AZPs in a joint fashion. To our knowledge, the model we are proposing here is the first unsupervised model for joint AZP identification and resolution. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In addition, motivated by work on overt pronoun resolution, we hypothesize that AZP resolution can be improved by exploiting discourse information. Specifically, we design a model of salience and in- corporate salience information into our model as a feature. Inspired by traditional work on discourse- based anaphora resolution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lappin and Leass (1994)</ref>), we compute salience based on the corefer- ence clusters constructed so far using a rule-based coreference resolver. While ZPs have been ex- ploited to improve coreference resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kong and Ng, 2013)</ref>, we are the first to improve AZP resolution using coreference information.</p><p>When evaluated on the Chinese portion of the OntoNotes corpus, our AZP resolver outperforms the CN14 model, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Early approaches to AZP resolution employed heuristic rules to resolve AZPs in Chinese (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Converse (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yeh and Chen (2007)</ref>) and Span- ish (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ferrández and Peral (2000)</ref>). More re- cently, supervised approaches have been exten- sively employed to resolve AZPs in Chinese (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhao and Ng (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kong and Zhou (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen and Ng (2013)</ref>), Korean (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Han (2006)</ref>), Japanese (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Seki et al.

As mentioned before, in order to reduce reliance on annotated data, we recently proposed an unsupervised probabilistic model for Chinese AZP resolution that rivaled its supervised counterparts in performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen and Ng, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Generative Model</head><p>Next, we present our model for jointly identifying and resolving AZPs in an unsupervised manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Notation</head><p>Let z be a ZP. C, the set of candidate antecedents of z, contains (1) the maximal or modifier NPs that precede z in the associated text that are at most two sentences away from it; and (2) a dummy can- didate antecedent d (to which z will be resolved if it is non-anaphoric). k is the context surround- ing z as well as every candidate antecedent c in C; k c is the context surrounding z and candidate antecedent c; and l is a binary variable indicating whether c is the correct antecedent of z.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Training</head><p>Our model estimates P (z, k, c, l), the probability of seeing (1) the ZP z; (2) the context k surround- ing z and its candidate antecedents; (3) a candidate antecedent c of z; and (4) whether c is the correct antecedent of z. Since we estimate this probability from a raw, unannotated corpus, we are treating z, k, and c as observed data 2 and l as hidden data.</p><p>Motivated in part by previous work on En- glish overt pronoun resolution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cherry and Bergsma (2005)</ref> and Charniak and Elsner <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2009)</ref>), we estimate the model parameters using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dempster et al., 1977)</ref>. Specifically, we use EM to iteratively (1) estimate the model parameters from data in which each ZP is labeled with the probability that it corefers with each of its candidate antecedents, and (2) apply the resulting model to re-label each ZP with the probability that it corefers with each of its candidate antecedents. Below we describe the details of the E-step and the M-step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">E-Step</head><p>The goal of the E-step is to compute P (l=1|z, k, c), the probability that a candi- date antecedent c is the correct antecedent of z given context k. Applying the definition of conditional probability and the Theorem of Total Probability, we can rewrite P (l=1|z, k, c) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (l=1|z, k, c) = P (z, k, c, l=1) P (z, k, c, l=1) + P (z, k, c, l=0)</formula><p>(1) Assuming that exactly one of z's candidate an- tecedents is its correct antecedent, we can rewrite P (z, k, c, l=0) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (z, k, c, l=0) = ∑ c ′ ∈C,c ′ ̸ =c P (z, k, c ′ , l=1)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Given Equation (2), we can rewrite <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Here, we treat z as observed data because we assume that the set of ZPs has been identified by a separate process. We adopt the heuristics for ZP identification that we introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen and Ng (2014)</ref>. P (l=1|z, k, c) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (l=1|z, k, c) = P (z, k, c, l=1) ∑ c ′ ∈C P (z, k, c ′ , l=1)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Applying the Chain Rule, we can rewrite P (z, k, c, l=1) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (z, k, c, l=1) = P (z|k, c, l=1) * P (l=1|k, c) * P (c|k) * P (k)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Next, since z is a phonetically null form (and therefore is not represented by any linguistic at- tributes), we assume that each of its candidate an- tecedents and the associated context has the same probability of generating it. So we can rewrite P (z|k, c, l=1) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P (z|k, c, l=1) = P (z|k, c ′ , l=1) ∀ c, c ′ ∈ C (5)</formula><p>Moreover, we assume that (1) given z and c's context, the probability of c being the antecedent of z is not affected by the context of the other can- didate antecedents; and (2) k c is sufficient for de- termining whether c is the antecedent of z. So,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (l=1|k, c) ≈ P (l=1|k c , c) ≈ P (l=1|k c )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Next, applying Bayes Rule to P (l=1|k c ), we get: P (k c |l=1)P (l=1) P (k c |l=1)P (l=1) + P (k c |l=0)P (l=0)</p><p>Representing k c as a set of n features f 1 c , . . . f n c and assuming that each f i c is conditionally inde- pendent given l, we can approximate Expression (7) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∏ i P (f i c |l=1)P (l=1) ∏ i P (f i c |l=1)P (l=1) + ∏ i P (f i c |l=0)P (l=0)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, we assume that given context k, each candidate antecedent of z is generated with equal probability. In other words,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P (c|k) = P (c ′ |k) ∀ c, c ′ ∈ C<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Given Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(5)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(8)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(9)</ref>, we can rewrite P (l=1|z, k, c) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P (l=1|z, k, c) = P (z, k, c, l=1) ∑ c ′ ∈C P (z, k, c ′ , l=1) = P (z|k, c, l=1) * P (l=1|k, c) * P (c|k) ∑ c ′ ∈C P (z|k, c ′ , l=1) * P (l=1|k, c ′ ) * P (c ′ |k) ≈ P (l=1|k c ) ∑ c ′ ∈C P (l=1|k c ′ ) ≈ ∏ i P (f i c |l=1) Zc ∑ c ′ ∈C ∏ i P (f i c ′ |l=1) Z c ′<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Z x = ∏ i P (f i x |l=1)P (l=1)+ ∏ i P (f i x |l=0)P (l=0)<label>(11)</label></formula><p>As we can see from Equation (10), our model has one group of parameters, namely P (f i c |l=1). Using Equation (10) and the current parameter es- timates, we can compute P <ref type="figure">(l=1|z, k, c)</ref>.</p><p>A point deserves mention before we describe the M-step. By including d as a dummy candidate antecedent for each z, we effectively model AZP identification and resolution in a joint fashion. If the model resolves z to d, it means that the model posits z as non-anaphoric; on the other hand, if the model resolves z to a non-dummy candidate antecedent c, it means that the model posits z as anaphoric and c as z's correct antecedent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">M-Step</head><p>Given P (l=1|z, k, c), the goal of the M-step is to (re)estimate the model parameters, P (l=1|k c ), us- ing maximum likelihood estimation. Specifically, P (l=1|k c ) is estimated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P (l=1|k c ) = Count(k c , l=1) + θ Count(k c ) + θ * 2<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where Count(k c ) is the number of times k c ap- pears in the training data, Count(k c , l=1) is the expected number of times k c is the context sur- rounding an AZP and its antecedent c, and θ is the Laplace smoothing parameter, which we set to 1. Given context k ′ c , we compute Count(k ′ c , l=1) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Count(k ′ c , l=1) = ∑ k:kc=k ′ c P (l=1|z, k, c)<label>(13)</label></formula><p>To start the induction process, we initialize all parameters with uniform values. Specifically, P (l=1|k c ) is set to 0.5. Then we iteratively run the E-step and the M-step until convergence.</p><p>There is an important question we have not ad- dressed: what features should we use to represent context k c , which we need to estimate P (l=1|k c )?</p><p>We answer this question in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Inference</head><p>After training, we can apply the resulting model to resolve ZPs. Given a test document, we process its ZPs in a left-to-right manner. For each ZP z enoun- tered, we determine its antecedent as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">322ˆc 322ˆ 322ˆc = arg max c∈C P (l=1|z, k, c)<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where C is the set of candidate antecedents of z. If we resolve a ZP to a preceding NP c, we fill its gap with c. Hence, when we process a ZP z, all of its preceding AZPs in the associated text have already been resolved, having had their gaps filled with their associated NPs. To resolve z, we create test instances between z and its candidate antecedents in the same way we described before. The only dif- ference is that z's candidate antecedents may now include the NPs to which previous AZPs were re- solved. In other words, this incremental resolution procedure may increase the number of candidate antecedents of each ZP z. Some of these addi- tional candidate antecedents are closer to z than were their parent NPs, thus facilitating the resolu- tion of z to the NPs in the following way: If the model resolves z to the additional candidate an- tecedent that fills the gap left behind by, say, AZP z ′ , we postprocess the output by resolving z to the NP that z ′ is resolved to. 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Context Features</head><p>To fully specify our model, we need to describe how to represent k c , which is needed to compute P (l=1|k c ). Recall that k c encodes the context sur- rounding candidate antecedent c and the associated ZP z. As described below, we represent k c using eight features. Note that (1) all but feature 1 are computed based on syntactic parse trees, and (2) features 2, 3, and 6 are ternary-valued features.</p><p>1. the sentence distance between c and z;</p><p>2. whether the node spanning c has an ancestor NP node; if so, whether this NP node is a de- scendant of c's lowest ancestor IP node;</p><p>3. whether the node spanning c has an ancestor VP node; if so, whether this VP node is a de- scendant of c's lowest ancestor IP node;</p><p>4. whether vp has an ancestor NP node, where vp is the VP node spanning the VP that fol- lows z;</p><p>5. whether vp has an ancestor VP node;</p><p>6. whether z is the first word of a sentence; if not, whether z is the first word of an IP clause;</p><p>7. whether c is a subject whose governing verb is lexically identical to the verb governing z;  8. c's salience rank (see Section 5).</p><p>Note that features 1, 2, 3 and 7 are not directly applicable to the dummy candidate. To compute the feature values of the dummy candidate, we first find the highest ranking non-dummy entity E in the salience list, and then set the values of these four features of the dummy candidate to the corre- sponding feature values of the rightmost mention of E. The motivation is that we want the dummy candidate to compete with the most salient non- dummy candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Adding Salience</head><p>Recall from Section 4 that feature 8 requires the computation of salience. Intuitively, salient enti- ties are more likely to contain the antecedent of an AZP.</p><p>We model salience as follows. For each ZP z, we compute the salience score for each (partial) entity preceding z. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> To reduce the size of the list of preceding entities, we only consider a partial entity active if one of its mentions appears within two sentences of the active ZP z. We compute the salience score of each active entity w.r.t. z using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∑ m∈E g(m) * decay(m) (15)</formula><p>where m is a mention belonging to active entity E, g(m) is a grammatical score which is set to 4, 2, or 1 depending on whether m's grammati- cal role is Subject, Object, or Other, respec- tively, and decay(m) is decay factor that is set to 0.5 dis (where dis is the sentence distance between m and z). After computing the scores, we first sort the list of the active entities in descending order of salience. Then, within each active entity, we sort the mentions in increasing order of distance from z. Finally, we set the salience rank of each mention m to its position in the sorted list, but cap the rank  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: AZP resolution results of the baseline and our model on the test set.</p><p>at 5 in order to reduce sparseness during parameter estimation. Note that the above list contains only non- dummy entities. We model the salience of a dummy entity D, which contains only the dummy candidate for z, as follows. Intuitively, if z is non- anaphoric, D should be the most salient entity. Hence, we put D at the top of the list if z satisfies any of the following three conditions, all of which are strong indicators of non-anaphoricity: (1) z ap- pears at the beginning of a document; (2) the verb following z is 有 (there is) or 没有 (there is not) with part of speech VE; or (3) the VP node in the syntactic parse tree following z does not span any verb. If none of these conditions is satisfied, we put D at the bottom of the list.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Datasets. We employ the Chinese portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus that was used in the official CoNLL-2012 shared task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pradhan et al., 2012</ref>). In the CoNLL-2012 data, the training set and de- velopment set contain ZP coreference annotations, but the test set does not. Therefore, we train our models on the training set and perform evaluation on the development set. Statistics on the datasets are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The documents in these datasets come from six sources, namely Broadcast News (BN), Newswires (NW), Broadcast Conver- sations (BC), Telephone Conversations (TC), Web Blogs (WB), and Magazines (MZ).</p><p>Evaluation measures. We express results in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F) on resolving AZPs, considering an AZP z correctly resolved if it is resolved to any NP in the same coreference chain as z.</p><p>Evaluation settings. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen and Ng (2014)</ref>, we evaluate our model in three settings. In Setting 1, we assume the availability of gold syn- tactic parse trees and gold AZPs. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In Setting 2, we employ gold syntactic parse trees and system (i.e., automatically identified) AZPs. Finally, in Set- ting 3 (the end-to-end setting), we employ system syntactic parse trees and system AZPs. The gold and system syntactic parse trees, as well as the gold AZPs, are obtained from the CoNLL-2012 shared task dataset, while the system AZPs are identified by our generative model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Results</head><p>As our baseline, we employ the CN14 system, which has achieved the best result to date on our test set. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows results obtained using both the baseline system and our model on the entire test set as well as on each of the six sources. As we can see, our model significantly 6 outperforms the baseline under all three settings by 2.5%, 3.9% and 1.6% respectively in terms of overall F-score.</p></div>
