			<abstract>
				<p>The reading material used in a language learning classroom should ideally be rich in terms of the grammatical constructions and vocabulary to be taught and in line with the learner&apos;s interests. We developed an online Information Retrieval system that helps teachers search for texts appropriate in form, content, and reading level. It identifies the 87 grammatical constructions spelled out in the official English language curriculum of schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The tool incorporates a classical efficient algorithm for reranking the results by assigning weights to selected constructions and prioritizing the documents containing them. Supplemented by an interactive vi-sualization module, it allows for a multi-faceted presentation and analysis of the retrieved documents.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The learner's exposure to a language influences their acquisition of it. The importance of input in second language (L2) learning has been repeatedly emphasized by the proponents of major Second Language Acquisition theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Krashen, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gass and Varonis, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Swain, 1985)</ref>, with psy- cholinguists highlighting the significance of fre- quency and perceptual salience of target construc- tions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Slobin, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>In line with this research, a pedagogical ap- proach of input flood <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Trahey and White, 1993)</ref> is extensively used by L2 teachers. However, manu- ally searching for linguistically rich reading ma- terial takes a lot of time and effort. As a re- sult, teachers often make use of easily accessible schoolbook texts. However, this limits the choice of texts, and they are typically less up-to-date and less in line with students' interests than authentic texts. In the same vein, a survey conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Purcell et al. (2012)</ref> revealed that teachers expect their students to use online search engines in a typical research assignment with a very high probability of 94%, compared to the 18% usage of printed or electronic textbooks.</p><p>With this in mind, we developed an online In- formation Retrieval (IR) system that uses efficient algorithms to retrieve, annotate and rerank web documents based on the grammatical construc- tions they contain. The paper presents FLAIR 1 (Form-Focused Linguistically Aware Information Retrieval), a tool that provides a balance of con- tent and form in the search for appropriate reading material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview and Architecture</head><p>The FLAIR pipeline can be broadly reduced to four primary operations -Web Search, Text Crawling, Parsing and Ranking. As demonstrated by the diagram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the first three opera- tions are delegated to the server as they require the most resources. Ranking, however, is performed locally on the client endpoint to reduce latency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Web Crawling</head><p>We chose to use Microsoft Bing 2 as our primary search engine given its readily available Java bind- ings. By default, the top 20 results are fetched for any given search query. A basic filter is applied to exclude web documents with low text content. The search is conducted repeatedly until the result- ing list of documents contains at least 20 items. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text Extraction</head><p>The Text Extractor makes use of the Boilerpipe library 3 extracting plain text with the help of its DefaultExtractor. The choice is motivated by the high performance of the library as compared to other text extraction techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kohlschütter et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parsing</head><p>Text parsing is facilitated by the Stanford CoreNLP library <ref type="bibr">4 (Manning et al., 2014</ref>), which was chosen for its robust, performant and open- source implementation. Our initial prototype used the standard PCFG parser for constituent parsing, but its cubic time complexity was a significant is- sue when parsing texts with long sentences. We therefore switched to a shift-reduce implementa- tion 5 that scales linearly with sentence and parse length. While it resulted in a higher memory over- head due to its large language models, it allowed us to substantially improve the performance of our code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ranking</head><p>The final stage of the pipeline involves ranking the results according to a number of grammati- cal constructions and syntactic properties. Each parameter can be assigned a specific weight that then affects its ranking relative to the other pa- rameters. The parsed data is cached locally on the client side for each session. This allows us to perform the ranking calculations on the local computer, thereby avoid a server request-response roundtrip for each re-ranking operation.</p><p>We chose the classical IR algorithm BM25 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Robertson and Walker, 1994)</ref> as the basis for our ranking model. It helps to avoid the dominance of one single grammatical construction over the others and is independent of the normalization unit as it uses a ratio of the document length to the average document length in the collection. The final score of each document determines its place in the ranking and is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G(q, d) = t∈q∩d (k+1)×tf t,d tf t,d +k×(1−b+b× |d| avdl ) × log N +1 dft</formula><p>where q is a FLAIR query containing one or more linguistic forms, t is a linguistic form, d is a document, tf t,d is the number of occurrences of t in d, |d| is document length, avdl is the average document length in the collection, df t is the number of documents containing t, and k is a free parameter set to 1.7. The free parameter b specifies the importance of the document length. The functionality of the tool allows the user to adjust the importance of the document length with a slider that assigns a value from 0 to 1 to the parameter b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Technical Implementation</head><p>FLAIR is written in Java and implemented as a Java EE web application. The core architecture re- volves around a client-server implementation that uses WebSocket (Fette and Melnikov, 2011) and Ajax (Garrett and others, 2005) technologies for full-duplex, responsive communication. All server operations are performed in parallel, and each op- eration is divided into subtasks that are executed asynchronously. Operations initiated by the client are dispatched as asynchronous messages to the server. The client then waits for a response from the latter, which are relayed as rudimentary push messages encoded in JSON. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> By using WebSock- ets to implement the server endpoint, we were able to reduce most of the overhead associated with HTTP responses. The sequence of operations performed within the client boundary is described as follows:</p><p>1. Send search query to server and initiate web search </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">FLAIR Interface</head><p>The main layout consists of four elements -a set- tings panel, a search field, a list of results, and a reading interface, where the identified target con- structions are highlighted. The interactive visual- ization incorporates the technique of parallel coor- dinates used for visualizing multivariate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Inselberg and Dimsdale, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>The</p><note type="other">visualization provides an overview of the distribution of the selected linguistic characteris- tics in the set of retrieved documents. Vertical axes represent parameters -linguistic forms, num- ber of sentences, number of words and the read- ability score, and each polyline stands for a doc- ument having certain linguistic characteristics and thus, going through different points on the param- eter axes. The interactive design allows for more control over a user-selected set of linguistic char- acteristics. Users can select a range of values for one or more constructions to precisely identify and retrieve documents.</note><p>Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate FLAIR in use: The user has entered the query Germany and selected Past Perfect and Present Perfect as target con- structions. After reranking the 20 retrieved docu- ments, the interactive visualization was used to se- lect only the documents with a non-zero frequency of both constructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Detection of Linguistic Forms</head><p>We based our choice of the 87 linguistic forms on the official school curriculum for English in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. 7 As most of the linguistic structures listed there do not have a one-to-one mapping to the standard output of NLP tools, we used a rule-based approach to ap- proximate them.</p><p>For closed word classes, string matching (e.g., articles) or look-up lists (e.g, prepositions) can be used to differentiate between their forms. How- ever, detection of some grammatical constructions and syntactic structures requires a deeper syntactic analysis. Identification of the degrees of compar- ison of long adjectives requires keeping track of two consequent tokens and their POS tags, as is the case with the construction used to that cannot be simply matched (cf. the passive "It is used to build rockets"). More challenging structures, such  as real and unreal conditionals and different gram- matical tenses, are identified by means of complex patterns and additional constraints. For a more elaborate discussion of the detection of linguistic forms, the pilot evaluation and the use cases, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chinkina and Meurers (2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Performance Evaluation</head><p>Parallelization of the tool allowed us to reduce the overall processing time by at least a factor of 25 (e.g., 35 seconds compared to 15 minutes for top 20 results). However, due to the highly parallel nature of the system, its performance is largely dependent on the hardware on which it is deployed. Amongst the different operations per- formed by the pipeline, web crawling and text an- notation prove to be the most time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks. Web crawling is an I/O task that is contingent on external factors such as remote network resources and bandwidth, thereby making it a potential bottleneck and also an unre- liable target for profiling. We conducted several searches and calculated the relative time each op- eration took. It took around 50-65% of the total time (from entering the query till displaying a list of results) to fetch the results and extract the docu- ments and around 20-30% of the total time to parse them.</p><p>The Stanford parser is responsible for text anno- tation operations, and its shift-reduce constituent parser offers best-in-class performance and accu- racy. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We analyzed the performance of the parser on the constructions that our tool depends on for the detection of linguistic patterns. Among the biggest challenges were gerunds that got anno- tated as either nouns (NN) or gerunds/present par- ticiples (VBG). Phrasal verbs, such as settle in, also appeared to be problematic for the parser and were sometimes not presented as a single entity in the list of dependencies.</p><p>The FLAIR light-weight algorithm for detecting linguistic forms builds upon the results of the Stan- ford parser while adding negligible overhead. To evaluate it, we collected nine news articles with the average length of 39 sentences by submitting three search queries and saving the top three re- sults for each of them. We then annotated all sen- tences for the 87 grammatical constructions and compared the results to the system output. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides the precision, recall, and F-measure for selected linguistic forms identified by FLAIR 9 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic target</head><p>Prec As the numbers show, some constructions are eas- ily detectable (plural irregular noun forms, e.g., children) while others cannot be reliably identi- fied by the parser (conditionals). The reasons for a low performance are many-fold: the ambiguity of a construction (real conditionals), the unreliable output of the text extractor module (simple sen- tences) or the Stanford Parser (-ing verb forms), and the FLAIR parser module itself (unreal con- ditionals). Given the decent F-scores and our goal of covering the whole curriculum, we include all constructions into the final system -indepen- dent of their F-score. As for the effectiveness of the tool ina real-life setting, full user studies with language teachers and learners are necessary for a proper evaluation of distinctive components of FLAIR (see Section 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>While most of the state-of-the-art IR systems de- signed for language teachers and learners imple- ment a text complexity module, they differ in how they treat vocabulary and grammar. Vocabulary models are built using either word lists <ref type="bibr">(LAWSE by Ott and Meurers, 2011</ref>) or the data from learner models (REAP by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown and Eskenazi, 2004</ref>). Grammar is given little to no attention: Bennöhr (2005) takes into account the complexity of differ- ent conjunctions in her TextFinder algorithm. Distinguishing features of FLAIR aimed at mak- ing it usable in a real-life setting are that (i) it cov- ers the full range of grammatical forms and cate- gories specified in the official English curriculum for German schools, and (ii) its parallel processing model allows to efficiently retrieve, annotate and rerank 20 web documents in a matter of seconds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Outlook</head><p>The paper presented FLAIR -an Information Re- trieval system that uses state-of-the-art NLP tools and algorithms to maximize the number of spe- cific linguistic forms in the top retrieved texts. It supports language teachers in their search for ap- propriate reading material in the following way:</p><p>• A parsing algorithm detects the 87 linguistic constructions spelled out in the official cur- riculum for the English language.</p><p>• Parallel processing allows to fetch and parse several documents at the same time, making the system efficient for real-life use.</p><p>• The responsive design of FLAIR ensures a seamless interaction with the system.</p><p>The tool offers input enrichment of online materi- als. In a broader context of computer-assisted lan- guage learning, it can be used to support input en- hancement (e.g., WERTi by Meurers et al., 2010) and exercise generation (e.g., Language Muse SM by <ref type="bibr">Burstein et al., 2012)</ref>. Recent work includes the integration of the Academic Word List <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Coxhead, 2000</ref>) to estimate the register of documents on-the-fly and rerank them accordingly. The option of searching for and highlighting the occurrences of words from customized vocabulary lists has also been imple- mented. In addition to the already available length and readability filters, we are working on the op- tions to constrain the search space by including support for i) search restricted to specific web do- mains and data sets, such as Project Gutenberg <ref type="bibr">10</ref> or news pages, and ii) search through one's own data set. We also plan to implement and test more sophisticated text readability formulas <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Vajjala and Meurers, 2014</ref>) and extend our informa- tion retrieval algorithm. Finally, a pilot online user study targeting language teachers is the first step we are taking to empirically evaluate the efficacy of the tool.</p><p>On the technical side, FLAIR was built from the ground up to be easily scalable and extensible. Our implementation taps the parallelizability of text parsing and distributes the task homogenously over any given hardware. While FLAIR presently supports the English language exclusively, its ar- chitecture enables us to add support for more lan- guages and grammatical constructions with a min- imal amount of work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: FLAIR architecture.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,86.17,62.81,425.19,187.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
