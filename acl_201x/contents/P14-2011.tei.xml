				<p>Tree kernel is an effective technique for relation extraction. However, the traditional syntactic tree representation is often too coarse or ambiguous to accurately capture the semantic relation information between two entities. In this paper, we propose a new tree kernel, called feature-enriched tree kernel (FTK), which can enhance the traditional tree kernel by: 1) refining the syntactic tree representation by annotating each tree node with a set of dis-criminant features; and 2) proposing a new tree kernel which can better measure the syntactic tree similarity by taking all features into consideration. Experimental results show that our method can achieve a 5.4% F-measure improvement over the traditional convolution tree kernel.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Relation Extraction (RE) aims to identify a set of predefined relations between pairs of entities in text. In recent years, relation extraction has re- ceived considerable research attention. An effec- tive technique is the tree kernel ( <ref type="bibr">Zelenko et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Qian et al., 2008)</ref>, which can exploit syntactic parse tree information for relation extraction. Given a pair of entities in a sentence, the tree kernel-based RE method first represents the relation information between them using a proper sub-tree (e.g., SPT - the sub-tree enclosed by the shortest path linking the two involved entities). For example, the three syntactic tree representations in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Then the similarity between two trees are computed using a tree kernel, e.g., the convolution tree kernel pro- posed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Collins and Duffy (2001)</ref>. Finally, new relation instances are extracted using kernel based classifiers, e.g., the SVM classifier.</p><p>Unfortunately, one main shortcoming of the traditional tree kernel is that the syntactic tree rep- resentation usually cannot accurately capture the <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The ambiguity of possessive structure relation information between two entities. This is mainly due to the following two reasons:</p><p>1) The syntactic tree focuses on representing syntactic relation/structure, which is often too coarse or ambiguous to capture the semantic re- lation information. In a syntactic tree, each node indicates a clause/phrase/word and is only labeled with a Treebank tag ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Marcus et al., 1993</ref>). The Treebank tag, unfortunately, is usually too coarse or too general to capture semantic information. For example, all the three trees in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> share the same possessive syntactic structure, but ex- press quite different semantic relations: where "Mary's brothers" expresses PER-SOC Family relation, "Mary's toys" expresses Possession rela- tion, and "New York's airports" expresses PHYS- Located relation.</p><p>2) Some critical information may lost during sub-tree representation extraction. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, when extracting SPT representation, all nodes outside the shortest-path will be pruned, such as the nodes <ref type="bibr">[NN plants]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[POS 's]</ref> in tree T1. In this pruning process, the critical infor- mation "word town is the possessor of the posses- sive phrase the town's plants" will be lost, which in turn will lead to the misclassification of the DISC relation between one and town.</p><p>This paper proposes a new tree kernel, referred as feature-enriched tree kernel (FTK), which can effectively resolve the above problems by enhanc- ing the traditional tree kernel in following ways: 1) We refine the syntactic tree representa- tion by annotating each tree node with a set of dis- criminant features.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">better capture the semantic relation information  between two entities. For example, in order to dif- ferentiate the syntactic tree representations in Fig- ure 1, FTK will annotate them with several fea- tures indicating "</ref>brother is a male sibling", "toy is an artifact", "New York is a city", "airport is facility", etc.</p><p>2) Based on the refined syntactic tree repre- sentation, we propose a new tree kernel -feature- enriched tree kernel, which can better measure the similarity between two trees by also taking all fea- tures into consideration. We have experimented our method on the ACE 2004 RDC corpus. Experimental results show that our method can achieve a 5.4% F-measure im- provement over the traditional convolution tree kernel based method. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the feature-enriched tree kernel. Section 3 presents the features we used. Section 4 dis- cusses the experiments. Section 5 briefly reviews the related work. Finally Section 6 concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Feature-Enriched Tree Kernel</head><p>In this section, we describe the proposed feature- enriched tree kernel (FTK) for relation extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Refining Syntactic Tree Representation</head><p>As described in above, syntactic tree is often too coarse or too ambiguous to represent the semantic relation information between two entities. To re- solve this problem, we refine the syntactic tree representation by annotating each tree node with a set of discriminant features. where is its phrase label (i.e., its Treebank tag), and is a feature vector which indicates the characteristics of node , which is represented as:</p><p>where fi is a feature and is associated with a weight . The feature we used includes charac- teristics of relation instance, phrase properties and context information (See Section 3 for details).</p><p>For demonstration, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows the feature- enriched version of tree T2 and tree T4 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  2</ref>. We can see that, although T2 and T4 share the same syntactic structure, the annotated features can still differentiate them. For example, the NP5 node in tree T2 and the NP5 node in tree T4 are differentiated using their features Possessive- Phrase and PPPhrase, which indicate that NP5 in T2 is a possessive phrase, meanwhile NP5 in T4 is a preposition phrase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Feature-Enriched Tree Kernel</head><p>This section describes how to take into account the annotated features for a better tree similarity.</p><p>In Collins and Duffy's convolution tree kernel (CTK), the similarity between two trees T1 and T2 is the number of their common sub-trees:</p><p>Using this formula, CTK only considers whether two enumerated sub-trees have the identical syn-   two sub-trees and have the identical syntac- tic structure and 0 otherwise). Such an assumption makes CTK can only capture the syntactic struc- ture similarity between two trees, while ignoring other useful information. To resolve the above problem, the feature-en- riched tree kernel (FTK) compute the similarity between two trees as the sum of the similarities between their common sub-trees: where is the similarity between enumer- ated sub-trees and , which is computed as: where</p><p>is the same indicator function as in CTK;</p><p>is a pair of aligned nodes between and , where and are correspondingly in the same position of tree and ;</p><p>is the set of all aligned node pairs;</p><p>is the feature vector similarity between node and , computed as the dot product between their feature vectors and . Notice that, if all nodes are not annotated with features, will be equal to . In this perspective, we can view as a similarity adjusted version of , i.e., only considers whether two nodes are equal, in contrast further considers the feature similarity between two nodes. The Computation of FTK. As the same as CTK, FTK can be efficiently computed as: where is the set of nodes in tree , and evaluates the sum of the similarities of common sub-trees rooted at node and node , which is recursively computed as follows:</p><p>1) If the production rules of and are differ- ent, = 0; 2) If both and is pre-terminal nodes, ; Otherwise go to step 3; 3) Calculate recursively as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">¢(n 1 ;n 2 ) = ¸ £ (1 + sim(n 1 ; n 2 )) £ #ch(n 1 ) X k=1 (1 + ¢(ch(n 1 ; k); ch(n 2 ; k)) ¢(n 1 ;n 2 ) = ¸ £ (1 + sim(n 1 ; n 2 )) £ #ch(n 1 ) X k=1</formula><p>(1 + ¢(ch(n 1 ; k); ch(n 2 ; k))</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Features for Relation Extraction</head><p>This section presents the features we used to en- rich the syntactic tree representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Instance Feature</head><p>Relation instances of the same type often share some common characteristics. In this paper, we add the following instance features to the root node of a sub-tree representation:</p><p>1) Syntactico-Semantic structure. A fea- ture indicates whether a relation instance has the following four syntactico-semantic structures in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chan &amp; Roth, 2011</ref>) -Premodifiers, Possessive, Preposition, Formulaic and Verbal.</p><p>2) Entity-related information of argu- ments. Features about the entity information of arguments, including: a) #TP1-#TP2: the concat of the major entity types of arguments; b) #ST1- #ST2: the concat of the sub entity types of argu- ments; c) #MT1-#MT2: the concat of the mention types of arguments.</p><p>3) Base phrase chunking features. Fea- tures about the phrase path between two argu- ments and the phrases' head before and after the arguments, which are the same as the phrase chunking features in <ref type="bibr">(Zhou, et al., 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Phrase Feature</head><p>As discussed in above, the Treebank tag is too coarse to capture the property of a phrase node. Therefore, we enrich each phrase node with fea- tures about its lexical pattern, its content infor- mation, and its lexical semantics: 1) Lexical Pattern. We capture the lexical pattern of a phrase node using the following fea- tures: a) LP_Poss: A feature indicates the node is a possessive phrase; b) LP_PP: A feature indi- cates the node is a preposition phrase; c) LP_CC: A feature indicates the node is a conjunction phrase; d) LP_EndWithPUNC: A feature indicates the node ends with a punctuation; e) LP_EndWith- POSS: A feature indicates the node ends with a possessive word.</p><p>2) Content Information. We capture the property of a node's content using the following features: a) MB_#Num: The number of mentions contained in the phrase; b) MB_C_#Type: A fea- ture indicates that the phrase contains a mention with major entity type #Type; c) MW_#Num: The number of words within the phrase.</p><p>3) Lexical Semantics. If the node is a pre- terminal node, we capture its lexical semantic by adding features indicating its WordNet sense in- formation. Specifically, the first WordNet sense of the terminal word, and all this sense's hyponym senses will be added as features. For example, WordNet senses {New York#1, city#1, district#1, region#1, …} will be added as features to the <ref type="bibr">[NN New York]</ref> node in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Context Information Feature</head><p>The context information of a phrase node is criti- cal for identifying the role and the importance of a sub-tree in the whole relation instance. This pa- per captures the following context information: 1) Contextual path from sub-tree root to the phrase node. As shown in <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2007)</ref>, the context path from root to the phrase node is an effective context information feature. In this paper, we use the same settings in ( <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2007)</ref>, i.e., each phrase node is enriched with its context paths of length 1, 2, 3.</p><p>2) Relative position with arguments. We observed that a phrase's relative position with the relation's arguments is useful for identifying the role of the phrase node in the whole relation in- stance. To capture the relative position infor- mation, we define five possible relative positions between a phrase node and an argument, corre- sponding match, cover, within, overlap and other. Using these five relative positions, we capture the context information using the following features: a) #RP_Arg1Head_#Arg1Type: a feature in- dicates the relative position of a phrase node with argument 1's head phrase, where #RP is the rela- tive position (one of match, cover, within, overlap, other), and #Arg1Type is the major entity type of argument 1. One example feature may be Feature weighting. Currently, we set all fea- tures with an uniform weight , which is used to control the relative importance of the fea- ture in the final tree similarity: the larger the fea- ture weight, the more important the feature in the final tree similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Setting</head><p>To assess the feature-enriched tree kernel, we evaluate our method on the ACE RDC 2004 cor- pus using the same experimental settings as <ref type="bibr">(Qian et al., 2008)</ref>. That is, we parse all sentences using the Charniak's parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Charniak, 2001)</ref>, relation instances are generated by iterating over all pairs of entity mentions occurring in the same sentence.</p><p>In our experiments, we implement the feature-en- riched tree kernel by extending the SVM light <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Joachims, 1998</ref>) with the proposed tree kernel func- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Moschitti, 2004)</ref>. We apply the one vs. oth- ers strategy for multiple classification using SVM. For SVM training, the parameter C is set to 2.4 for all experiments, and the tree kernel parameter λ is tuned to 0.2 for FTK and 0.4 (the optimal param- eter setting used in <ref type="bibr">Qian et al.(2008)</ref>) for CTK.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Overall performance</head><p>We compare our method with the standard convo- lution tree kernel (CTK) on the state-of-the-art context sensitive shortest path-enclosed tree rep- resentation (CSPT, <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2007</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. FTK on the 7 major relation types and their F-measure improvement over CTK From <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> and 2, we can see that: 1) By refining the syntactic tree with discri- minant features and incorporating these features into the final tree similarity, FTK can significantly improve the relation extraction performance: compared with the convolution tree kernel base- line CTK, our method can achieve a 5.4% F-meas- ure improvement.</p><p>2) All types of features can improve the per- formance of relation extraction: FTK can corre- spondingly get 2.6%, 2.2% and 4.9% F-measure improvements using instance features, phrase fea- tures and context information features.</p><p>3) Within the three types of features, context information feature can achieve the highest F- measure improvement. We believe this may be- cause: ① The context information is useful in providing clues for identifying the role and the im- portance of a sub-tree; and ② The context-free as- sumption of CTK is too strong, some critical in- formation will lost in the CTK computation.</p><p>4) The performance improvement of FTK varies significantly on different relation types: in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, most performance improvement gains from the EMP-ORG, PHYS, GPE-AFF and DISC relation types. We believe this may because the discriminant features will better complement the syntactic tree for capturing EMP-ORG, PHYS, GPE-AFF and DISC relation. On contrast the fea- tures may be redundant to the syntactic infor- mation for other relation types.  adopts two extra techniques: composing tree ker- nel with a state-of-the-art feature-based kernel and using a more proper sub-tree representation. We believe these two techniques can also be used to further improve the performance of our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>This section briefly reviews the related work. A classical technique for relation extraction is to model the task as a feature-based classification problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kambhatla, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jiang &amp; Zhai, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chan &amp; Roth, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chan &amp; Roth, 2011)</ref>, and feature engineering is obviously the key for performance improvement. As an al- ternative, tree kernel-based method implicitly de- fines features by directly measuring the similarity between two structures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bunescu and Mooney, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bunescu and Mooney, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zelenko et al, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Culotta and Sorensen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2006</ref>).
