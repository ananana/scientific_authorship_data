			<abstract>
				<p>Previous models for the assessment of commitment towards a predicate in a sentence (also known as factuality prediction) were trained and tested against a specific annotated dataset, subsequently limiting the generality of their results. In this work we propose an intuitive method for mapping three previously annotated corpora onto a single factuality scale, thereby enabling models to be tested across these corpora. In addition, we design a novel model for factuality prediction by first extending a previous rule-based factuality prediction system and applying it over an abstraction of dependency trees, and then using the output of this system in a supervised classifier. We show that this model outperforms previous methods on all three datasets. We make both the unified factu-ality corpus and our new model publicly available.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Factuality prediction is the task of determining the level of commitment towards a predicate in a sen- tence according to a specific source, e.g., the au- thor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009)</ref>. For instance, the author uses linguistic cues to mark the embed- ded proposition as factual in (1) (cue: surprising), as uncertain in (2) and (3) (cues: risk, might), and as counterfactual (cue: did not manage) or uncer- tain (cue: will not manage) in (4).</p><p>(1) It is not surprising that they work.</p><p>(2) She takes the risk to find out the truth.</p><p>(3) She might find out the truth.</p><p>(4) He did/will not manage to be in time.</p><p>Detecting factuality is hard as the linguistic means used to express it closely interact. For example, lexical cues, such as the proposition-embedding predicates in (1) and (4) interact with negation (in (1), (4)) and tense (in (4)).</p><p>Detecting factuality has many potential applica- tions. For instance, in knowledge base population, only propositions marked as factual should be ad- mitted into the knowledge base, while hypotheti- cal or negated ones should be left out. Similarly, for argumentation analysis and question answer- ing, factuality can play a major role in backing a specific claim or supporting evidence for an an- swer to a question at hand.</p><p>Recent research efforts have approached the factuality task from two complementing direc- tions: automatic prediction and large scale anno- tation. Previous attempts for automatic factuality prediction either took a rule-based, deep syntac- tic approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lotan et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2012</ref>) or a machine learning approach over more shallow features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. In terms of annotation, each effort was largely carried out independently of the others, picking up different factuality flavors and different annotation scales.</p><p>In correlation, the proposed algorithms have targeted a single annotated resource which they aim to recover. Subsequently, this separation be- tween annotated corpora has prevented a compar- ison across datasets. Further, the models are non- portable, inhibiting advancements in one dataset to carry over to any of the other annotations.</p><p>Our contribution in this work is twofold. First, we suggest that the task can benefit from a uni- fied representation. We exemplify this by mapping the representation of two recent datasets <ref type="bibr">(FactBank (Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009)</ref> and MEAN- TIME ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Minard et al., 2016)</ref>) onto the [−3, +3] scale, as annotated by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. This unification allows us to test the generality of mod-els which were previously applicable on a single dataset. Second, we design a new model for fac- tuality prediction that extends <ref type="bibr">TruthTeller (Lotan et al., 2013)</ref>, which employed implicative signa- tures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(MacCartney and Manning, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Karttunen, 2012)</ref> over dependency trees using a large predi- cate lexicon. We first extend TruthTeller's lexicon by about 40% through a semi-automatic process (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Eckle-Kohler (2016)</ref>). We then apply TruthTeller's rules over an abstraction of depen- dency trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Stanovsky et al., 2016)</ref>, which repre- sents predicate-argument structures more consis- tently, thereby allowing TruthTeller rules to ap- ply on a wider range of syntactic constructions. Finally, we surpass previous methods by using the output from TruthTeller as deep linguistically- informed features in a supervised classifier, thus successfully integrating a rule-based approach in a machine learning framework.</p><p>Overall, we hope that our unified representation will enable training and testing on larger, more di- verse datasets, and that the good performance of our new model indicates its usability across differ- ent flavors of factuality prediction. We make both the unified factuality corpus and the new model publicly available. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Factuality prediction requires the identification of uncertainty, a concept which largely corresponds to the linguistic notion of modality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hacquard, 2011)</ref>. Modality expresses possibilities and ne- cessities by means of negation, modal verbs (may, might, can), main verbs (agree, refuse), adjectives (dishonest), future tense (will, won't), and more. Looking at the numerous and varied possibilities language offers to express all the different shades of modality, it is clear that factuality does not as- sume any fixed set of discrete values either. In- stead, the underlying linguistic system forms a continuous spectrum ranging from factual to coun- terfactual <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>While linguistic theory assigns a spectrum of factuality values, recent years have seen many practical efforts to capture the notion of factual- ity in a consistent annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Nissim et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">OGorman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Minard et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ghia et al., 2016)</ref>. Each of these make certain deci-sions regarding the granularity of factuality that they aim to extract. In the course of this work we chose to set our focus on three of these anno- tations: <ref type="bibr">FactBank (Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009</ref>), MEANTIME ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Minard et al., 2016</ref>) and the UW corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. We use these specific corpora as they represent recent efforts, display a range of different design choices (e.g., in their no- tion of factuality and method of annotation), and are made publicly available which ensures the ease of the reproducibility of our experiments. <ref type="table">Table  1</ref> sums the properties and variations of these cor- pora. For example, we can see that: (1) the UW corpus uses a continuous scale and is annotated by crowdsourcing, while MEANTIME and FactBank were annotated discretely by experts, (2) Fact- Bank annotates factuality from different perspec- tives, and (3) MEANTIME is significantly smaller compared to the other corpora.</p><p>In parallel with the creation of these annotated resources, several efforts were made to predict fac- tuality in an automatic manner. The methods for doing so can be largely divided into rule-based systems which examine deep linguistic features, and machine learning algorithms which generally extract more shallow features. The De Facto fac- tuality profiler <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2012)</ref> and TruthTeller algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lotan et al., 2013</ref>) take the rule-based approach and assign a discrete anno- tation of factuality (following the values assigned by FactBank) using a deterministic rule-based top- down approach on dependency trees, changing the factuality assessment when encountering factual- ity affecting predicates or modality and negation cues (following implicative signatures by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Karttunen (2012)</ref>). In addition to a factuality assess- ment, TruthTeller assigns three values per predi- cate in the sentence: (1) implicative signature from a hand-coded lexicon indicating how this predi- cate changes the factuality of its embedded clause, in positive and negative contexts, (2) clause truth, marking the factuality assessment of the entire clause, and (3) negation and uncertainty, indicat- ing whether this predicate is affected by negation or modality. Both of these algorithms rely on a hand-written lexicon of predicates, indicating how they modify the factuality status of their embed- ded predicates (e.g., refuse negates while assure asserts it). In this work we will make use of the more recent TruthTeller which uses a much larger lexicon of 1,700 predicates (verbs, adjectives and  </p></div>

(2015)</ref> have used SVM regression techniques to predict a continuous factuality value from lexical and syntactic features (lemma, part of speech, and dependency paths). Similarly to the TruthTeller approach, they also predict a single factuality value pertaining to the author's commit- ment towards the predicate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Unified Factuality Representation</head><p>We achieve a unified representation by map- ping FactBank and MEANTIME onto the UW [−3, +3] range in a simple automatic rule-based manner. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> describes these rules (see column "Our mapping"), which were hand-written by consult- ing the annotation guidelines of each of the cor- pora. Specifically, in converting FactBank we take only the author's perspective annotations as these comply with the annotations of the other corpora, and for MEANTIME we use their pro- posed abstraction into factual, uncertain and pos- sible (in the future). We map from the discrete values (MEANTIME and FactBank) to the contin- uous scale (UW) since this conversion is lossless: if two events receive different factuality values in the original annotation, they will also differ in the unified representation, and vice versa. Further- more, since FactBank and MEANTIME are both discrete, it is not clear a priori how to map between them.</p><p>Label distribution Given the above conversion, we can plot the label distribution of all three cor- pora on the same scale <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>). This analysis reveals that all corpora are significantly skewed to- wards the factual end of the scale, where the ma- jority of the annotation mass is located. In par- ticular, we find that MEANTIME is especially bi- ased, assigning the factual value (+3) to 90% of its event annotations. Overall, we suspect that this is an inherent trait of the news domain which tends to be more factual than other text types (e.g., edu- cational texts or opinion pieces).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Model</head><p>Following the automatic conversion which achieves a unified representation for our three datasets, we devise a factuality prediction model composed of three main components: <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>   Integrating PropS with TruthTeller PropS was recently presented as an abstraction over de- pendency trees. Most convenient in our case is its re-ordering of non-verbal predicates (adjectival, conditional, non-lexical, etc.) such that each pred- icate is the direct head of its respective arguments. For example, for adjectival predication, compare the different parses in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. PropS positions dishonest as the head of said, which is subse- quently the head of paid. This chain allows the im- plicative signature encoded in TruthTeller to cap- ture this complex relation. The dependency syn-tax, in contrast, obstructs this relation by positing dishonest as a leaf node under when. The overall consistency of PropS annotation allows the top- down approach of TruthTeller to apply to predi- cates beyond the verbal case. Finally, we take as features all four TruthTeller annotations (see Section 2) of the target predicate, its PropS head and its children (padding or trun- cating to 4 children). For a fair comparison with the UW system, we use these features to train an SVM regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Basak et al., 2007</ref>) model to pre- dict the final factuality value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>In this section we describe the experiments we car- ried out on the three unified datasets (FactBank, MEANTIME, and UW). For a fair comparison, we use the same train, development, test split of the datasets for all systems. We preprocess the data with the spaCy Python library. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In all our experiments we compute the metrics used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lee et al. (2015)</ref>: (1) Mean Absolute Error 5 (MAE), which computes the absolute fit of the model and (2) Pearson correlation coefficient between auto- matic predictions and gold labels, especially infor- mative in biased test sets as it assesses how well the model captures the variability in the gold data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Baselines</head><p>We test the performance of our model on the uni- fied factuality corpus against that of several algo- rithms, representing the state-of-the-art (SoA) in competing approaches.</p><p>Rule-based approach For a SoA rule-based ap- proach we use TruthTeller with extended lexicon as described in Section 4. We convert its dis- crete predictions to the [-3, +3] scale using a hand- written conversion table, similarly to our mapping of FactBank annotations.</p><p>Supervised approach The SoA for supervised learning is represented by the features from the UW system. We note that for practical issues, we did not use the same solver <ref type="bibr">6</ref> , but instead used sup- port vector regression (SVR) model with a linear kernel (as implemented in the scikit-learn Python library 7 ). All hyperparameters were tuned on the development set.</p><p>Semantic representation approach In addition to the rule-based and supervised approaches, we experimented with a semantic abstraction of the sentence. For that end, we extracted features in- spired by the UW system on the popular AMR formalism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banarescu et al., 2013</ref>) using a SoA parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pust et al., 2015)</ref>. Our hope was that this would improve performance by focusing on the more semantically-significant portions of the predicate-argument structure. In particular, we ex- tracted the following features from the predicted AMR structures: immediate parents, grandparents and siblings of the target node, lemma and POS tag of the target and preceding token in the sen- tence, and a Boolean feature based on the AMR polarity role (indicating semantic negation).</p><p>All-factual approach Finally, we compare against an all-factual baseline which assigns +3.0 to all predicates. Since the task is by nature heav- ily biased towards the factual label, it is interest- ing to compare against such a simple (yet strong) lower bound. See the supplemental material for a technical elaboration on the baselines implemen- tation.</p></div>

An interesting di- rection for future work is to address the inher- ent bias in the data towards the factual end of the scale by uniformly bucketing the factuality values, which will affect the way the evaluation is carried out on top of these annotations. We made both the unified representation and the trained model publicly available 8 , hoping that it will enable factuality research across larger, more diverse datasets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FactBank</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
