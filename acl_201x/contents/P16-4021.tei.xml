			<abstract>
				<p>This paper presents a conversational, mul-timedia, virtual science tutor for elementary school students. It is built using state of the art speech recognition and spoken language understanding technology. This virtual science tutor is unique in that it elicits self-explanations from students for various science phenomena by engaging them in spoken dialogs and guided by illustrations, animations and interactive simulations. There is a lot of evidence that self-explanation works well as a tutorial paradigm, Summative evaluations indicate that students are highly engaged in the tutoring sessions, and achieve learning outcomes equivalent to expert human tutors. Tutorials are developed through a process of recording and annotating data from sessions with students, and then updating tutor models. It enthusiastically supported by students and teachers. Teachers report that it is feasible to integrate into their curriculum .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>According to the 2009 National Assessment of Ed- ucational Progress <ref type="bibr">(NAEP, 2009)</ref>, only 34 percent of fourth-graders, 30 percent of eighth-graders, and 21 percent of twelfth-graders tested as profi- cient in science. Thus, over two thirds of U.S. stu- dents are not proficient in science. The vast major- ity of these students are in low-performing schools that include a high percentage of disadvantaged students from families with low socioeconomic status, which often include English learners with low English language proficiency. Analysis of the NAEP scores in reading, math and science over the past twenty years indicate that this situation is getting worse. For example, the gap between English learners and English-only students, which is over one standard deviation lower for English learners, has increased rather than decreased over the past 20 years. Moreover, science instruction is often underemphasized in U.S. schools, with read- ing and math being stressed.</p><p>The Program for International Student As- sessment (PISA), coordinated by the Organiza- tion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is administered every three years in 65 countries across the world. According to their findings in 2012, the U.S. average science score was not measurably different from the OECD av- erage.</p><p>Our approach to address this problem is a con- versational multimedia virtual tutor for elemen- tary school science. The operating principles for the tutor are grounded on research from education and cognitive science where it has been shown that eliciting self-explanations plays an important role ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chi et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chi et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chi et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hausmann and VanLehn, 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hausmann and VanLehn, 2007b)</ref>. Speech, language and charac- ter animation technologies play a central role be- cause the focus of the system is on engagement and spoken explanations by students during spo- ken dialogs with the virtual tutor. Summative eval- uations indicate that students are highly engaged in the tutoring sessions, and achieve learning out- comes equivalent to expert human tutors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ward et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ward et al., 2013</ref>). Surveys of partici- pating teachers indicate that it is feasible to incor- porate the intervention into their curriculum. Also, importantly, most student surveys indicate enthu- siastic support for the system.</p><p>Tutorials are developed through an iterative pro- cess of recording, annotating and analyzing logs from sessions with students, and then updating tu- tor models. This approach has been used to de-velop over 100 tutorial dialog sessions, of about 15 minutes each, in 8 areas of elementary school science.</p><p>My Science Tutor (MyST) provides a supple- ment to normal classroom science instruction that immerses students in a multimedia environment with a virtual science tutor that models an en- gaging and effective human tutor. The focus of the program is to improve each student's engage- ment, motivation and learning by helping them learn to visualize, reason about and explain sci- ence during conversations with the virtual tutor. The learning principles embedded in MyST are consistent with conclusions and recommendations of the National Research Council Report, "Taking Science to School: Learning and Teaching Science in <ref type="bibr">Grades K-8" (NRC, 2007)</ref>, which emphasizes the critical importance of scientific discourse in K- 12 science education. The report identifies the fol- lowing crucial principles of scientific proficiency:</p><p>Students who are proficient in science:</p><p>1. Know, use, and interpret scientific explana- tions of the natural world;</p><p>2. Generate and evaluate scientific evidence and explanations;</p><p>3. Understand the nature and development of scientific knowledge; and 4. Participate productively in scientific prac- tices and discourse.</p><p>The report also emphasizes that scientific in- quiry and discourse is a learned skill, so students need to be involved in activities in which they learn appropriate norms and language for produc- tive participation in scientific discourse and argu- mentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The MyST Application</head><p>MyST provides students with the scaffolding, modeling and practice they need to learn to rea- son and talk about science. Students learn science through natural spoken dialogs with the virtual tu- tor Marni, a 3-D computer character. Marni asks students open-ended questions related to illustra- tions, silent animations or interactive simulations displayed on the computer screen. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the student's screen with Marni asking questions about media displayed in a tuto- rial. The student's computer shows a full screen window that contains Marni, a display area for presenting media and a display button that indi- cates the listening status of the system. Marni pro- duces accurate visual speech, with head and face movements that are synchronized with her speech. The media facilitate dialogs with Marni by help- ing students visualize the science they are dis- cussing. The primary focus of dialogs is to elicit explanations from students. MyST compares the student's spoken explanations to reference expla- nations for the lesson by matching the extracted semantic roles using the Phoenix parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ward, 1991)</ref>, then presents follow-on questions and me- dia, to help the student construct a correct explana- tion of the phenomena being studied. The virtual tutor Marni, who speaks with a recorded human voice, is designed to model an effective human tu- tor that the student can relate to and work with to learn science. MyST provides a non-threatening and supportive environment for students to express their ideas. The dialogs scaffold learning by pro- viding students with support when needed until they can apply new skills and knowledge indepen- dently.</p><p>MyST is intended to be used as an intervention for struggling students, with intended users being K-12 science students. While it should prove a benefit to all students, struggling students should benefit most. Depending on the recording condi- tions and ambient noise, as well as the character- istics of the student and session, the recognition word error rate ranges from low 20s to mid-40s. MyST will contain tutorials for 3 topics per grade, with content aligned with NGSS. For each topic, students engage in an average of 10 spoken dia- log sessions with the tutor, lasting approximately 20 minutes each. oThe MyST tutorial sessions are in addition to the normal classroom instruction for the module. Tutoring sessions can be assigned as homework or during regular school hours, at the teacher's discretion. In the initial studies, tutor- ing was always done during regular school hours. Teachers specify the space in the school to be used, generally any relatively quiet room. Students are sent to use the system a few at a time, depending on how many computers are available (5 comput- ers per classroom were used in the efficacy study). All students are given a demo at the beginning of the school year and given a chance to ask ques- tions. Teachers schedule time for students, but stu- dents log on and use the system without supervi- sion, so it has minimal impact on teacher time or other human resources. In studies thus far, surveys report that teachers did not have problems using the system and it did not interfere with their other activities.</p><p>The application will eventually be deployed us- ing a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. It will run on a server and students will access it through their browser. If internet service is not available or reliable, it can be run stand-alone and the data up- loaded when service is available. Both content and user populations will evolve and system models need to incorporate dynamic adaptation in an effi- cient way. Data from all user sessions is logged in a database and is available for continuous evalua- tion and re-training of system models. The system is designed to work well even if it doesn't under- stand the user, but becomes more engaging and ef- ficient as it understands the user better. As training data grows model parameters become more accu- rate and more explicit models are trained, such as acoustic models for ELL students. Unsupervised training is combined with active learning to op- timize use of the data for tuning system models. Teachers in the initial studies did not feel that they would have a problem implementing the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Theoretical Framework</head><p>The theory of change, and theoretical and empir- ical support Science curricula are structured with new concepts building on those already encoun- tered. Struggling students fall further and fur- ther behind if they don't understand the content of each topic. Research has demonstrated that hu- man tutors are effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bloom, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Madden and Slavin, 1989)</ref>, media presentations are effec- tive <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Mayer, 2001</ref>) and QtA dialog strategies are effective (Murphy and Edwards, 2005). A system that emulates a human tutor using media presen- tations to focus a student's attention and conduct- ing a QtA-style dialog with the student should also be effective. This additional time spent thinking and talking about the science concepts covered in class will enable students who would have fallen behind to understand the content of the current investigation so they will be prepared to partic-ipate in and understand subsequent topics. Stu- dent learning will increase because they are ex- cited about and engaged by interesting and infor- mative presentations that help them visualize and understand the science and because they will learn to engage in conversations in which they construct, reflect on and revise mental models and explana- tions about the science they are seeing and trying to explain. MyST dialogs are designed to provide students with understandable multimedia scenar- ios, explanations and challenges and a support- ive social context for communication and learn- ing. Science is introduced through scenarios that students can relate to and make sense of, and pro- vide a context for introducing and using science vocabulary and making connections between vo- cabulary, objects, concepts and their prior knowl- edge. Multimedia learning tools show and explain science, and then enable students to revisit the me- dia and explain the science in their own words.</p><p>Research has demonstrated that having students produce explanations improves learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chi et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chi et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">King, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">King et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Palincsar and Brown, 1984)</ref>. In a series of studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chi et al. (1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">2001)</ref> found that hav- ing college students generate self-explanations of their understanding of physics problems improved learning. Self-explanation also improved learn- ing about the circulatory system by eighth grade students in a controlled experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chi et al., 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Hausmann and Van Lehn (2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">2007b)</ref> note that: "self-explaining has consistently been shown to be effective in producing robust learn- ing gains in the laboratory and in the classroom." Experiments by <ref type="bibr">Hausmann and Van Lehn (Hausmann and VanLehn, 2007a)</ref> indicate that it is the process of actively producing explanations, rather than the accuracy of the explanations, that makes the biggest contribution to learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Semantic Underpinnings</head><p>The patterns used in MyST to extract frames from student responses are trained from annotated data. The specification of tutorial semantics begins with creating a narrative. A tutorial narrative is a set of natural language statements that express the con- cepts to be discussed in as simple a form as possi- ble. These do not represent the questions that the system asks, but are the set of points that the stu- dent should express.</p><p>The narrative represents what an ideal explana- tion from a student would look like. The narra- tive statements are manually annotated to reflect the desired semantic parses. These parsed state- ments define the domain of the tutorial. The initial grammar patterns are extracted from the narratives and have all of the roles and entities that will be discussed, but only a few (or one) ways of express- ing them. As the system is used, the grammar is expanded to cover the various ways students artic- ulate their understandings of the science concepts. This is done by annotating recordings of student responses generated in real use. So the life cy- cle of the natural language processing model for a module is:</p><p>1. Create and annotate a narrative to define the domain of the tutorial 2. Field the system to collect data from real users 3. Sample incoming data and annotate 4. Evaluate current model and re-train 5. Repeat step 3-4 as long as the module is used As the system is used, it logs all transac- tions and records student speech. When tutori- als are deployed for live use, incoming data are processed automatically to assess system confi- dence in the interpretation of student responses. High-confidence items are added to the training database, and low confidence sessions are selected for transcription and annotation. The system also provides a text input mode that students can use to interact with the Avatar. Once annotated, the data are added to the training set and system models (acoustic models, language models and extraction patterns) are retrained. Periodically, data are sam- pled for test sets and a learning curve is plotted for each module. All elements of this process are automatic except for transcription and annotation.</p><p>The semantics of each domain are constrained, but student responses can vary greatly in the ways they choose to express concepts and terms. It takes time, effort and data to get good coverage of stu- dent responses. Semantic annotation for the sys- tem consists of annotating:</p><p>Entities-The basic concepts talked about in the session and the phrases that would be consid- ered synonyms. Electricity could be expressed as electricity, energy, power, current or electrical en- ergy. Coverage of term synonyms from annotated data is generally achieved fairly quickly. Roles- How the entities in an event or concept are related to each other. The larger problem is to attain cov- erage of the patterns discriminating between pos- sible role assignments. Not only is there more dis- fluency and variability here, annotating them is a more difficult task for someone not trained to do it. Currently, it takes about one hour for a highly- trained annotator to mark up the data collected in a single 20-minute tutorial session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Extrinsic Evaluation</head><p>An assessment was conducted in schools to com- pare learning gains from human tutoring and MyST tutoring to business-as-usual classrooms. Learning gain was measured using standardized assessments given to students in each condition before and after each science module. Both tu- toring conditions had significantly higher learning gains than the control group. While the effect size for human tutors vs. control (d=0.68) was larger than for MyST vs. control (d=0.53), statistical tests supported the hypothesis of no significant dif- ference between the two.</p><p>A simple two-group comparison using a Re- peated Measures ANOVA shows a statistically sig- nificant effect at F=46.4, df 1,759, p &lt;.0001 favor- ing the treatment group. The interaction between group and module was also significant at F=9.5, p &lt; .001. We also used an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to compare post-test scores. This pro- cedure adjusts for pre-test differences while com- paring the post-test average scores. The two-group comparison was significant at F=7.4, df 1,768, p=.018. We also saw a significant interaction be- tween treatment group and module with F=12.4, df 3,768. Testing the main effects with a hierarchi- cal mixed model with students nested within class- rooms we found a significant effect for the treat- ment group at F=6.2, df 1,2l7,662, p=0.013. No significant interaction effect was found for mod- ule by group.</p><p>A written survey was given to the students who participated in the gas. Measures were taken to avoid bias wherein students give overly positive answers to questionnaires. The survey included questions that asked for ratings of student experi- ence and impressions of the program and its us- ability. Across schools, 47% of students said they would like to talk with Marni after every science investigation, 62% said they enjoyed working with Marni "a lot," and 53% selected "I am more ex- cited about science" after using the program. Only 4% felt that the tutoring did not help. Teachers were asked for anonymous feedback to help as- sess the feasibility of an intervention using the sys- tem and their perceptions of the impact of the sys- tem. A teacher survey was given to all participat- ing teachers directly after their students completed tutoring. The survey asked teachers about the per- ceived impact of using Marni for student learn- ing and engagement, impacts on instruction and scheduling, willingness to potentially adopt Marni as part of classroom instruction, and overall favor- ability toward participating in the research project. Teachers answered items related to potential barri- ers in implementing new technology in the class- room. 100% of responding teachers said that they felt it had a positive impact on their students, they would be interested in the program if it were avail- able and they would recommend it to other teach- ers. 93% said that they would like to participate in the project again. 74% indicated that they would like to have all of their students use the system (not just struggling students). Following these studies, Boulder Learning combined the best elements of the initial systems into the current MyST system, and with continued funding from IES (Cognition and Student Learning Goal 3), is conducting an efficacy study. We are currently in the 3rd year of a 4 year study. While data collection will continue for another year, preliminary results support the learning gain performance from the initial studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">MyST Conversations Corpus of Student Speech (MCCSC)</head><p>We are making a cleaned up version of the corpus available to the research community 1 for free and for commercial use at a pre-determined cost. The first release of the corpus v0.1.0 comprises 298 hours of speech out of which 198 hours are man- ually transcribed. This covers roughly 1.4 million words of text. We are in the process of cleaning up about the same amount of collected data for future distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Future Work</head><p>In the near future we plan to evaluate applying a statistical labeler trained on existing corpora to the task of Role assignment. This approach should provide increased robustness to novel input and substantially reduce the human annotation effort required to attain a given level of coverage. The Proposition Bank (PropBank) provides a corpus of sentences annotated with domain-independent se- mantic roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). PropBank has been widely used for the development of machine learning based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) sys- tems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pradhan et al. (2005)</ref> used a rich set of syntactic and semantic features to obtain a perfor- mance with F-score in the low-80s. It has been an integral component of most question answer- ing systems for the past decade. Since its first application to the newswire text, PropBank has been extended to cover many more predicates and diverse genres in the DARPA OntoNotes project <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Weischedel et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pradhan et al., 2013</ref>) and the DARPA BOLT program. We plan to map Prop- Bank SRL output onto MyST frames. Domain specific entity patterns will still need to be applied to produce the canonical extracted form, but that is a much simpler task than role assignment and one more suited to non-linguists.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A snapshot of the screen as seen by a student.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,78.55,72.63,418.92,314.19" type="bitmap" /></figure>
