				<p>While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering complex questions remains challenging , typically requiring both a large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrieval-based methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art struc-tured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Effective question answering (QA) systems have been a long-standing quest of AI research. Struc- tured curated KBs have been used successfully for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berant and Liang, 2014</ref>). However, these KBs are expensive to build and typically domain-specific. Automatically con- structed open vocabulary (subject; predicate; ob- ject) style tuples have broader coverage, but have only been used for simple questions where a single tuple suffices <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fader et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yin et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Our goal in this work is to develop a QA system that can perform reasoning with Open IE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banko et al., 2007</ref>) tuples for complex multiple-choice questions that require tuples from multiple sen- tences. Such a system can answer complex ques- tions in resource-poor domains where curated knowledge is unavailable. Elementary-level sci- ence exams is one such domain, requiring com- plex reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clark, 2015)</ref>. Due to the lack of a large-scale structured KB, state-of-the-art sys- tems for this task either rely on shallow reasoning with large text corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2016)</ref> or deeper, structured reasoning with a small amount of automatically acquired <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Khot et al., 2015</ref>) or manually curated (  knowledge.</p><p>Consider the following question from an Alaska state 4th grade science test:</p><p>Which object in our solar system reflects light and is a satellite that orbits around one planet? (A) Earth (B) Mercury (C) the Sun (D) the Moon This question is challenging for QA systems be- cause of its complex structure and the need for multi-fact reasoning. A natural way to answer it is by combining facts such as (Moon; is; in the solar system), (Moon; reflects; light), (Moon; is; satellite), and (Moon; orbits; around one planet).</p><p>A candidate system for such reasoning, and which we draw inspiration from, is the TABLEILP system of . TABLEILP treats QA as a search for an optimal subgraph that connects terms in the question and answer via rows in a set of curated tables, and solves the optimization problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We similarly want to search for an optimal subgraph. However, a large, automatically extracted tuple KB makes the reasoning context different on three fronts: (a) unlike reasoning with tables, chaining tuples is less important and reliable as join rules aren't available; <ref type="table">(b) conjunctive evidence becomes  paramount, as, unlike a long table row, a single  tuple is less likely to cover the entire question;  and (c) again, unlike table rows, tuples are noisy,  making combining redundant evidence essen- tial. Consequently, a table-knowledge centered</ref> inference model isn't the best fit for noisy tuples.</p><p>To address this challenge, we present a new ILP-based model of inference with tuples, im- plemented in a reasoner called TUPLEINF. We demonstrate that TUPLEINF significantly outper- forms TABLEILP by 11.8% on a broad set of over 1,300 science questions, without requiring manu- ally curated tables, using a substantially simpler ILP formulation, and generalizing well to higher grade levels. The gains persist even when both solvers are provided identical knowledge. This demonstrates for the first time how Open IE based QA can be extended from simple lookup questions to an effective system for complex questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>We discuss two classes of related work: retrieval- based web question-answering (simple reason- ing with large scale KB) and science question- answering (complex reasoning with small KB).</p><p>Web QA: There exist several systems for retrieval-based Web QA problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferrucci et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brill et al., 2002</ref>). While structured KBs such as Freebase have been used in many <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berant and Liang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kwiatkowski et al., 2013</ref>), such approaches are limited by the coverage of the data. QA systems using semi- structured Open IE tuples <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fader et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fader et al., , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yin et al., 2015)</ref> or automatically extracted web tables ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sun et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pasupat and Liang, 2015)</ref> have broader coverage but are limited to simple questions with a single query.</p><p>Science QA: Elementary-level science QA tasks require reasoning to handle complex questions. Markov Logic Networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Richardson and Domingos, 2006</ref>) have been used to perform probabilistic reasoning over a small set of logical rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Khot et al., 2015)</ref>. Simple IR techniques have also been proposed for science tests  and Gaokao tests (equivalent to the SAT exam in China) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The work most related to TUPLEINF is the aforementioned TABLEILP solver. This approach focuses on building inference chains using man- ually defined join rules for a small set of curated tables. While it can also use open vocabulary tu- ples (as we assess in our experiments), its efficacy is limited by the difficulty of defining reliable join rules for such tuples. Further, each row in some complex curated tables covers all relevant contex- tual information (e.g., each row of the adaptation table contains (animal, adaptation, challenge, ex- planation)), whereas recovering such information requires combining multiple Open IE tuples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tuple Inference Solver</head><p>We first describe the tuples used by our solver. We define a tuple as (subject; predicate; objects) with zero or more objects. We refer to the subject, pred- icate, and objects as the fields of the tuple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Tuple KB</head><p>We use the text corpora (S) from Clark et al. <ref type="formula">(2016)</ref> to build our tuple KB. S contains 5 ⇥ 10 10 tokens (280 GB of plain text) extracted from Web pages as well as around 80,000 sen- tences from various domain-targeted sources. For each test set, we use the corresponding train- ing questions Q tr to retrieve domain-relevant sen- tences from S. Specifically, for each multiple- choice question (q, A) 2 Q tr and each choice a 2 A, we use all non-stopword stemmed tokens in q and a as an ElasticSearch 1 query against S. We take the top 200 hits, run Open IE v4, 2 and aggre- gate the resulting tuples over all a 2 A and over all questions in Q tr to create the tuple KB (T ). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tuple Selection</head><p>Given a multiple-choice question qa with question text q and answer choices A={a i }, we select the most relevant tuples from T and S as follows.</p><p>Selecting from Tuple KB: We use an inverted index to find the 1,000 tuples that have the most overlapping tokens with question tokens tok (qa). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We also filter out any tuples that overlap only with tok (q) as they do not support any answer. We compute the normalized TF-IDF score by treating the question, q, as a query and each tuple, t, as a </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">tf(x, q) = 1 if x 2 q, 0 otherwise idf(x) = log (1 + N/n x ) tf-idf(t, q) = X x2t\q idf (x)</formula><p>where N is the total number of tuples in the KB and n x is the number of tuples containing x. We normalize the tf-idf score by the number of tokens in t and q, and take the 50 top-scoring tuples T qa .</p><p>On-the-fly tuples from text: To handle ques- tions from new domains not covered by the train- ing set, we extract additional tuples on the fly from S (similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sharma et al. (2015)</ref>). We perform the same ElasticSearch query described earlier for building T. We ignore sentences that cover none or all answer choices as they are not discriminative. We also ignore long sentences (&gt;300 characters) and sentences with negation 5 as they tend to lead to noisy inference. We then run Open IE on these sentences and re-score the resulting tuples using the Jaccard score 6 due to the lossy nature of Open IE, and finally take the 50 top-scoring tuples T 0 qa .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Support Graph Search</head><p>Similar to TABLEILP, we view the QA task as searching for a graph that best connects the terms in the question (qterms) with an answer choice via the knowledge; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for a simple il- lustrative example. Unlike standard alignment models used for tasks such as Recognizing Tex- tual Entailment (RTE) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dagan et al., 2010)</ref>, how- ever, we must score alignments between a set T qa [ T 0 qa of structured tuples and a (potentially multi-sentence) multiple-choice question qa.</p><p>The qterms, answer choices, and tuples fields form the set of possible vertices, V, of the support graph. Edges connecting qterms to tuple fields and tuple fields to answer choices form the set of pos- sible edges, E. The support graph, G(V, E), is a subgraph of G(V, E) where V and E denote "ac- tive" nodes and edges, resp. We define an ILP optimization model to search for the best support graph (i.e., the active nodes and edges) as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables</head><p>The ILP has a binary variable for each qterm (x q ), tuple (x t ), tuple field (x f ), and answer choice (x a ), indicating whether the corresponding graph node is active. There is a binary activity variable (x e ) for each edge e 2 E. For efficiency, we only create a qterm!field edge and a field!choice edge if the corresponding coefficient is no smaller than a certain threshold (0.1 and 0.2, resp.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective Function</head><p>The objective function coefficient c e of each edge e(t, h) is determined by a word-overlap score. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> While TABLEILP used WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Miller, 1995)</ref> paths to compute the edge weight, this measure re- sults in unreliable scores when faced with longer phrases found in Open IE tuples.</p><p>Compared to a curated KB, it is easy to find Open IE tuples that match irrelevant parts of the questions. To mitigate this issue, we scale the co- efficients c q of qterms in our ILP objective to focus on important terms. Since the later terms in a ques- tion tend to provide the most critical information, we scale qterm coefficients based on their position in the question. Also, qterms that appear in almost all of the selected tuples tend not to be discrim- inative as any tuple would support such a qterm. Hence we scale qterm coefficients inversely by the frequency with which they occur in the selected tuples. Appendix A describes the coefficient for qterm as well as other variables in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constraints</head><p>Since Open IE tuples do not come with schema and join rules, we can define a substantially sim- pler model compared to TABLEILP. This reduces the reasoning capability but also eliminates the re- liance on hand-authored join rules and regular ex- pressions used in TABLEILP. We discovered (see empirical evaluation) that this simple model can achieve the same score as TABLEILP on the Re- gents test (target test set used by TABLEILP) and generalizes better to different grade levels.</p><p>We start with a few constraints defining what is an active node or edge, shown as the first groups of constraints in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. To avoid positive edge coefficients in the objective function resulting in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: High-level ILP constraints; we report re- sults for ~ w = (2, 4, 4, 4, 2); the model can be im- proved with more careful parameter selection spurious edges in the support graph, we limit the number of active edges from an active tuple, ques- tion choice, tuple fields, and qterms (second group of constraints in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Our model is also ca- pable of using multiple tuples to support different parts of the question as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. To avoid spurious tuples that only connect with the question (or choice) or ignore the relation being expressed in the tuple, we add constraints that re- quire each tuple to connect a qterm with an answer choice (third group of constraints in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>We also define new constraints based on the Open IE tuple structure. Since an Open IE tu- ple expresses a fact about the tuple's subject, we require that the subject must be active. To avoid issues such as (Planet; orbit; Sun) matching the sample question in the introduction ("Which object. . .orbits around a planet"), we also add an ordering constraint (fourth group in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>We note that TUPLEINF only combines parallel evidence, i.e., each tuple must individually con- nect words in the question to the answer choice. For reliable multi-hop reasoning using OpenIE tu- ples, one can add inter-tuple connections to the support graph search, controlled by a small num- ber of rules over Open IE predicates. Learning such rules for the Science domain is an open prob- lem and potential avenue for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Comparing our method with two state-of-the-art systems for 4th and 8th grade science exams, we demonstrate that (a) TUPLEINF with only au- tomatically extracted tuples significantly outper- forms TABLEILP with its original curated knowl-   , and includes professionally written licensed ques- tions. (2) 8th Grade set (293 train, 282 test) con- tains 8th grade questions from various states. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We consider two knowledge sources:</p><p>(1) The Sentence corpus (S) consists of domain-targeted 80K sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages used by . This corpus is used as a collection of sentences by the IR solver. It is also used to create the tuple KB T (Sec. 3.1) and on-the-fly question- specific tuples T 0 qa (Sec. 3.2) for TUPLEINF. (2) TABLEILP uses ⇠70 Curated tables (C) containing about 7,600 rows, designed for 4th grade NY Regents exams.</p><p>We compare TUPLEINF with two state-of-the- art baselines. IR is a simple yet powerful information-retrieval baseline  that selects the answer option with the best match- ing sentence in a corpus. TABLEILP is the state- of-the-art structured inference baseline ( ) developed for science questions.   <ref type="table">Grade 8th Grade   IR(S)</ref> 52.0 52.8 IR(S) + TABLEILP(C) 53.3 54.5 IR(S) + TUPLEINF(T+T') 55.3 55.1 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: TUPLEINF is complementarity to IR, re- sulting in a strong ensemble the same knowledge (C+T), 10 the improved selec- tion and simplified model of TUPLEINF 11 results in a statistically significant improvement. Our simple model, TUPLEINF(C + T), also achieves scores comparable to TABLEILP on the latter's target Regents questions (61.4% vs TABLEILP's reported 61.5%) without any specialized rules. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows that while TUPLEINF achieves similar scores as the IR solver, the approaches are complementary (structured lossy knowledge reasoning vs. lossless sentence retrieval). The two solvers, in fact, differ on 47.3% of the train- ing questions. To exploit this complementarity, we train an ensemble system  which, as shown in the table, provides a substan- tial boost over the individual solvers. Further, IR + TUPLEINF is consistently better than IR + TABLEILP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Results</head><p>Finally, in combination with IR and the statis- tical association based PMI solver (which scores 54.1% by itself) of , TUPLEINF achieves a score of 58.2% on the 4th grade set. This compares favorably to TABLEILP's ensem- ble score of 56.7%, again attesting to TUPLEINF's strength. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Error Analysis</head><p>We describe four classes of failure of TUPLEINF, and the future work they suggest.</p><p>Missing Important Words: Which material will spread out to completely fill a larger con- tainer? (A) air (B) ice (C) sand (D) water In this question, we have tuples that support that water will spread out and fill a larger container, but miss the critical word "completely". A method for detecting salient question words would help here.</p><p>Lossy IE: Which action is the best method to separate a mixture of salt and water? . . . The IR solver correctly answers this question by using the sentence: Separate the salt and wa- ter mixture by evaporating the water. However, TUPLEINF is not able to answer this question as Open IE is unable to extract tuples from this im- perative sentence. While the additional structure from Open IE is generally helpful for more ro- bust matching, the conversion to tuples sometimes loses important bits of information.</p><p>Bad Alignment: Which of the following gases is necessary for humans to breathe in order to live? (A) Oxygen (B) Carbon dioxide (C) Helium (D) Water vapor TUPLEINF returns "Carbon dioxide" as the answer because of the tuple (humans; breathe out; carbon dioxide). The chunk "to breathe" in the question has a high alignment score to the "breathe out" re- lation in the tuple, even though they have com- pletely different meaning. An improved phrase alignment module can mitigate this issue.</p><p>Out of Scope: Deer live in forest for shelter. If the forest was cut down, which situation would most likely happen? . . . Such questions require modeling a state presented in the question and reasoning over this state, which is out of scope of our solver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a new QA system, TUPLEINF, that can reason over a large, potentially noisy knowl- edge base of (subject, predicate, object) style tu- ples, in order to answer complex questions. Our results establish TUPLEINF as a new state-of-the- art structured reasoning solver for elementary- level science that does not rely on curated knowl- edge and generalizes to higher grade levels. Our error analysis points to lossy IE and textual mis- alignments as two main causes of failure, suggest- ing future work around incorporating tuple context and distributional similarity measures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example support graph linking a question (top), two tuples from the KB (colored) and an answer option (nitrogen). document:</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,75.45,62.81,211.38,72.54" type="bitmap" /></figure>
