				<p>In conversation, speakers tend to &quot;ac-commodate&quot; or &quot;align&quot; to their partners, changing the style and substance of their communications to be more similar to their partners&apos; utterances. We focus here on &quot;linguistic alignment,&quot; changes in word choice based on others&apos; choices. Although linguistic alignment is observed across many different contexts and its degree correlates with important social factors such as power and likability, its sources are still uncertain. We build on a recent probabilis-tic model of alignment, using it to separate out alignment attributable to words versus word categories. We model alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies. Our results show evidence of alignment, but it is primarily lexical rather than categorical. Furthermore , we find that discourse acts modulate alignment substantially. This evidence supports the view that alignment is shaped by strategic communicative processes related to the ongoing discourse.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In conversation, people tend to adapt to one an- other across a broad range of behaviors. This adaptation behavior is collectively known as "communication accommodation" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Giles et al., 1991)</ref>. Linguistic alignment, the use of sim- ilar words to a conversational partner, is one prominent form of accommodation. Alignment is found robustly across many settings, including in- person, computer-mediated, and web-based con- versation (Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Mizil et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Giles et al., 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002</ref>). In addition, the strength of alignment to conversational partners varies with relevant socio- logical factors, such as the power of the partners, their social network centrality, and their likability. Potentially, this alignment could be used to infer these factors in situations where they are difficult to observe directly.</p><p>Although linguistic alignment appears to reflect important social dynamics, the mechanisms un- derlying alignment are still not well-understood. One particular question is whether alignment is supported by relatively automatic priming mecha- nisms, or higher-level, discourse and communica- tive strategies. The Interactive Alignment Model proposes that conversational partners prime each other, causing alignment via the primed reuse of structures ranging from individual lexical items to syntactic abstractions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pickering and Garrod, 2004</ref>). In contrast, Accommodation Theory em- phasizes the relatively more communicative and strategic nature of alignment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Giles et al., 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Relative to this theoretical landscape, a number of questions have emerged. First, does alignment occur at structural levels? If alignment is driven by interactive priming of structures, effects of align- ment should be expected not only at the lexical level but also for structural elements or categories as well. In contrast, if alignment is primarily com- municative, then alignment strength might differ and be greater for specific words that serve par- ticular conversational or discourse functions in a particular situation.</p><p>Second, does alignment vary with conversa- tional goals? If alignment is driven primarily by priming, it should be relatively consistent across different aspects of a discourse. In contrast, from a strategic or communicative perspective, align- ment -in which preceding words and concepts are reused -must be balanced against a need to move the conversation forward by introducing new words and concepts. Thus, on a communica-tive account, alignment should be modulated by the speaker's discourse act, reflecting whether the balance of the concern is convergence on a current focus or conveyal of new information.</p><p>Our goal in the current work is to investigate these questions. We make use of a recent prob- abilistic model of linguistic alignment, modify- ing it to operate robustly over corpora with highly varying distributional structures and to consider both lexical and category-based alignment. We use two corpora of spontaneous conversations, the Switchboard Corpus and a corpus of Twitter con- versations, to perform two experiments. First, in both datasets we measure alignment across dif- ferent levels of representation and find very lim- ited evidence for category-level alignment. Sec- ond, we make use of annotations in Switchboard to measure alignment across different discourse acts, finding that the level of alignment depends on the discourse actions that are included in the analy- sis. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the idea that alignment arises from discourse- level, strategic processes that operate primarily over lexical items.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Why does alignment matter?</head><p>Linguistic alignment, like other kinds of accom- modation, can be a critical part of achieving so- cial goals. Performance in cooperative decision- making tasks is positively related to the par- ticipants' linguistic convergence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fusaroli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kacewicz et al., 2013)</ref>. Romantically, match-making in speed dating and stability in es- tablished relationships have both been linked to increased alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ireland et al., 2011</ref>). Align- ment can also improve perceived persuasiveness, encouraging listeners to follow good health prac- tices ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kline and Ceropski, 1984)</ref> or to leave larger tips <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(van Baaren et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Alignment is also important as an indicator of implicit sociological variables. Less power- ful conversants generally accommodate to more to powerful conversants. Prominent examples in- clude interviews and jury trials ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Willemyns et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gnisci, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012)</ref>. A similar effect is found for network structure: speakers align more to more network- central speakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Noble and Fernández, 2015)</ref>. Additionally, factors such as gender, likability, re- spect, and attraction all interact with the magni- tude of accommodation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bilous and Krauss, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Natale, 1975)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Sources of linguistic alignment</head><p>Despite the important outcomes associated with alignment, its sources are not clear. The most prominent strand of work on alignment has fo- cused on the level of word categories, looking at how interlocutors change their frequency of us- ing, for instance, pronouns or quantitative words <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ireland et al., 2011</ref>). These results show alignment effects at the category level, but it is in principle possi- ble that these effects arose purely from alignment on individual words (and that conclusion would not be inconsistent with the interpretation of that work).</p><p>Syntactic alignment is one area in which the- oretical predictions have been tested, though re- sults have been somewhat equivocal. The Interac- tive Alignment Model has generally been taken to suggest that there should be cross-person priming of syntactic categories and structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pickering and Garrod, 2004)</ref>. But while some studies have found support for syntactic priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gries, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dubey et al., 2005</ref>), others have found negative or null alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Healey et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reitter et al., 2006</ref>). In one particularly thorough study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Healey et al. (2014)</ref> found across two corpora that speak- ers syntactically diverged from their interlocutors once lexical alignment was accounted for.</p><p>Furthermore, positive alignment is generally re- garded as a good conversational tactic, but there is clearly a limit to its virtues, at least when it comes to content words. Alignment is inher- ently backward-looking, while the general goal of a conversation is to exchange information that is not already known by both parties, an inher- ently forward-looking goal. Perhaps because of this, some recent work finding positive alignment has limited itself to "non-topical" word categories, which are less contentful (Danescu-Niculescu- Mizil et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doyle et al., 2016)</ref>. And sug- gestively, alignment within a task-relevant syntac- tic category was a better predictor of decision- making performance than overall lexical align- ment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fusaroli et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, although individual studies do bear on the sources of alignment, the picture is still not clear. Because most work on alignment has been done either on categories of words or aggregating across the lexicon, we do not have a good sense of whether there are systematic differences in align- ment at different levels of representation. A fur- ther complication is that there is no standard mea- sure of alignment; we turn to this issue next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Measures of alignment</head><p>The metrics used in previous work fall into two basic categories: distributional and conditional. Distributional methods such as Linguistic Style Matching (LSM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ireland et al., 2011</ref>) or the Zelig Quotient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jones et al., 2014</ref>) calculate the similarity be- tween the conversation participants over their fre- quencies of word or word category use in all utter- ances within the conversation. In contrast, condi- tional metrics, such as Local Linguistic Alignment (LLA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fusaroli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang et al., 2014</ref>) and the metric used by Danescu-Nicolescu-Mizil et al. (2011), look at how a message conditions its reply, with alignment indicated by elevated word use in the reply when that word was in the preced- ing message.</p><p>While distributional methods have been popu- lar, a major weakness of such methods is that they do not necessarily show true alignment, only sim- ilarity. A high level of distributional similarity does not imply that two conversational partners have aligned to one another, because they might instead have been similar to begin with. In con- trast, conditional measures allow for stronger in- ferences about the temporal sequence of alignment (even though they cannot guarantee any causal in- terpretation). Thus, we focus here on conditional measures exclusively.</p><p>By-message conditional methods Several ex- isting conditional methods have started from the simplified representation that messages either do or do not contain particular words ("markers"), irrespective of message length or marker count. (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doyle et al., 2016)</ref>. We refer to these as "by-message" methods. Consider the following example of con- ditional alignment, using pronouns as the marker: Bob aligns to Alice if his replies are more likely to contain a pronoun when in response to a message from Alice that contains a pronoun.</p><p>Bob's reply Alice's message has pronoun no pronoun has pronoun 8 2 no pronoun 5 5</p><p>Here, Alice sends 10 messages that contain at least one pronoun, and 8 of Bob's replies contain at least one pronoun. But Alice also sends 10 mes- sages that don't contain any pronouns, and only 5 of Bob's replies to these contain pronouns. This increased likelihood of a pronoun-containing re- ply to a pronoun-containing message is the condi- tional alignment.</p><p>Different models quantify this conditional alignment slightly differently.</p><p>Danescu- Niculescu-Mizil et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2011)</ref> proposed a subtractive conditional probability model, where alignment is the difference between the likelihood of a pronoun-containing reply B to a pronoun-containing message A and the probability of a pronoun-containing reply to any message:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">align SCP = p(B|A) − p(B)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Doyle et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2016)</ref> showed that this measure can be affected by the overall frequency of the category being aligned on, though. To correct this issue, they proposed a Hierarchical Alignment Model (HAM), which defines alignment as a lin- ear effect on the log-odds of a reply containing the relevant marker (e.g., a pronoun), similar to a lin- ear predictor in a logistic regression. 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(2) align HAM ≈ logit −1 (p(B|A)) − logit −1 (p(B|¬A))</formula><p>These binary conditional methods depend on the assumption that all messages have similar, and small, numbers of words, however. The prob- ability that a message contains at least one of any marker of interest is dependent on the mes- sage's length, so if messages vary substantially in their length, these alignment values can be at least noisy, if not biased. They are also not robust as messages increase in length, since the likelihood that a message contains any marker approaches 1 as message length increases.</p><p>By-word conditional methods A solution to the problem of variable message lengths is simply to shift from binarized data to count data. Instead of counting how many times Bob's replies con- tain at least one pronoun, we can count what pro- portion of his replies' word tokens are pronouns.</p><p>Some existing measures use a related quantity, the proportion of the preceding message that appears in its reply, to estimate alignment, notably Local Linguistic Alignment (LLA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fusaroli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang et al., 2014</ref>) and the lexical similarity (LS) measure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Healey et al. (2014)</ref>. LLA is defined as the number of word tokens (w i ) that appear in both the message (M a ) and the reply (M b ), divided by the product of the total number of word tokens in the message and reply:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">align LLA = w i ∈M b δ(w i ∈ M a ) length(M a )length(M b )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>These measures have an aspect of conditional- ity, as they only count words that appear in both the message and the reply. But they nevertheless fail to control for the baseline frequency of the ini- tial marker, and hence may be biased in measure- ments across words or categories of different fre- quencies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doyle et al., 2016</ref>). They also can be affected by reply length, as the maximum align- ment estimate is only possible when the reply is shorter than the message.</p><p>All of these by-word conditional models treat the reply as a bag of words, without order informa- tion. The by-word models, including the WHAM model we propose, are agnostic about reply length effects, correcting for the artifactual length effects of by-message models, but assuming that all mes- sages have similar alignment strengths indepen- dent of length. This is in contrast to models that explicitly model priming effects as decaying over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Reitter et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Reitter, 2008)</ref>, which predict higher alignment in shorter replies. Future by-word alignment models could infer a discount- ing for words that occur later in the reply, simi- lar to the beta value on the log-distance from the prime proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reitter et al. (2006)</ref>.</p><p>Our goal in this work is to create a model that combines the benefits of the existing by-message conditional models with the length-robustness of a by-word conditional method. We present WHAM, a modification of the HAM model that satisfies this goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Word-Based Hierarchical</head><p>Alignment Model (WHAM)</p><p>We propose the Word-Based Hierarchical Align- ment Model (WHAM). Like HAM, WHAM as- sumes that word use in replies is shaped by whether the preceding message contained the marker of interest. But WHAM uses marker to- ken frequencies within replies, so that a 40-word reply with two instances of the marker is repre- sented differently from a 3-word reply containing one instance. For each marker, WHAM treats each reply as a series of token-by-token independent draws from a binomial distribution. The binomial probabil- ity µ is dependent on whether the preceding mes- sage did (µ align ) or did not (µ base ) contain the marker, and the inferred alignment value is the difference between these probabilities in log-odds space (η align ). The graphical model is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>For a set of message-reply pairs between a speaker-replier dyad (a, b), we first separate the replies into two sets based on whether the preced- ing message contained the marker m (the "align- ment" set) or not (the "baseline" set). All replies within a set are then aggregated in a single bag- of-words representation, with marker token counts C align m,a,b and C base m,a,b , and total token counts N base m,a,b and N base m,a,b , the observed variables on the far right of the model. Moving from right to left, these counts are assumed to come from binomial draws with probability µ align m,a,b or µ base m,a,b . The µ values are generated from η values in log-odds space by an inverse-logit transform, similar to linear predic- tors in logistic regression.</p><p>The η base variables are representations of the baseline frequency of a marker in log-odds space, and µ base is simply a conversion of η base to proba- bility space, the equivalent of an intercept term in a logistic regression. η align is an additive value, with µ align = logit −1 (η base + η align ), the equiv- alent of a binary feature coefficient in a logistic regression. Alignment is then the change in log- odds of the replier using m above baseline usage, given that the initial message uses m.</p><p>The remainder of the model is a hierarchy of normal distributions that allow social and word category structure to be integrated into the anal- ysis. In the present work, we have three levels in the hierarchy: category level, marker level, 2 and conversational dyad level. All of these nor- mal distributions have identical standard devia- tions σ 2 = .25. 3 A Cauchy(0, 2.5) distribution </p></div>

The alignment hierarchy is headed by a normal distri- bution centered at 0, biasing the model equally in favor of positive and negative alignments. For our marker set, we adopt the Linguistic In- quiry and Word Count (LIWC) system to catego- rize words <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pennebaker et al., 2007</ref>). We use a set of 11 categories that have shown alignment ef- fects in previous work (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011). These can be loosely grouped into a set of five syntactic categories (articles, con- junctions, prepositions, pronouns, and quantifiers) and six conceptual categories (certainty, discrep- ancy, exclusion, inclusion, negation, and tenta- tive). Categories and example elements are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We manually lemmatized all words in each category. We implemented WHAM in RStan <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carpenter, 2015)</ref>, with code available at http: //github.com/langcog/disc_align.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Validating WHAM</head><p>A major goal of our by-word alignment model, WHAM, is to fix the length issues discussed in Section 2.3. We test WHAM and the by-message HAM model on simulated data, using a method similar to Simulation 2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doyle et al. (2016)</ref>, to sonable parameter convergence (improved by smaller σ 2 ) and good model log-probability (improved by larger σ 2 ). see how robust they are to different reply lengths. We generate 500 speaker-replier dyads, each ex- changing an average of 5 message pairs (drawn from a geometric distribution). Each message pair consists of a message whose length in words is drawn from a uniform distribution <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">25]</ref>, and a reply of length L. Because our goal is to test the effect of length on the models' performances, we create separate simulated datasets for different val- ues of L, and see whether the model correctly es- timates the alignment value η align . Three inde- pendent simulations were run for each alignment- length pair. We present data here for a simulated q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q word category with a baseline frequency of 0.1, around the middle of the attested category fre- quency range (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> plots the true alignment value in the simulations against the model-estimated align- ment values. Different colors represent different reply lengths L, ranging from single-word replies (light yellow) to 50-word replies (dark orange). The WHAM model shows consistently accurate alignment estimates over the range of simulated alignment values and reply lengths. The HAM model estimates the alignment far less accurately, and the reply length biases its estimates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data</head><p>Moving on to real data, we use two corpora for our experiments. The first is a collection of Twitter conversations collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Doyle &amp; Frank (2015)</ref> to examine information density in conversation. This corpus focuses on conversations within a set of 14 mostly distinct sub-communities on Twitter, and contains 63,673 conversation threads, cover- ing 228,923 total tweets. We divide these con- versations into message pairs, also called conver- sational turns, which are two consecutive tweets within a conversation thread. The second tweet is always in reply to the first (according to the Twitter API), although this does not necessarily mean that the content of the reply is a response to the preced- ing tweet. Retweets (including explicit retweets and some common manual retweet methods) were removed automatically. This processing leaves us with 122,693 message pairs, spanning 2,815 users. The tweets were parsed into word tokens using the Twokenizer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Owoputi et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The second corpus is the SwDA version of the Switchboard corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Godfrey et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jurafsky et al., 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> This corpus is a collection of transcribed telephone conversations, with each ut- terance labeled with the discourse act it is per- forming (e.g., statement of opinion, signal of non- understanding). It contains 221,616 total utter- ances in 1,155 conversations. We combine con- secutive utterances by the same speaker without interruption from the listener into a single message and treat consecutive pairs of messages from dif- ferent speakers as conversation turns, resulting in 110,615 message pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiment 1: Lexical-and Category-Level Alignment</head><p>Our first experiment examines how alignment dif- fers across the lexical and categorical levels. We use the WHAM framework to infer alignment on word and category counts, and also introduce a measure to estimate the influence of one word in a category on other words in its category, "category- not-word" alignment. We include this last type of alignment because it is possible that the category alignment effects in previous work are the result of lexical alignment on the individual words in the category, without any influence across words in the category. If categorical alignment is a real effect over and above lexical alignment, as an interactive-priming source for alignment would suggest, then the presence of a word in a message should not only increase the chance of seeing that word in the reply, but also other words in its cate- gory.</p></div>

B: Yeah, I loved it.).</p><p>The differences between lexical, categorical, and CNW alignment are also relevant to discus- sions of "lexical boosts" in the syntactic priming literature, an increased priming effect at the cate- gorical level when there is lexical repetition. Lex- icalist residual activation accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pickering and Branigan, 1998</ref>) predict such a boost, while im- plicit learning accounts do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bock and Griffin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chang et al., 2006</ref>). In the context of this experiment, such a lexical boost could make lexi- cal and categorical alignment appear elevated and closer together, but would not have a substantial effect on CNW alignment. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> To investigate CNW alignment, we look at a subset of the data: for each word w, exclude all messages that contain a word from that category (S) that is not w. This limits the category align- ment influence on the reply to the single word w. Then, instead of looking at how often w appears in the reply, we look at how often all other words in category S appear in the reply. The model then in- fers the influence of w on the other words in the category independent of their lexical alignment. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The categories being investigated in our work contain mostly non-topical, closed-class words, which have not ex- hibited lexical boosts in past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bock, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pickering and Branigan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hartsuiker et al., 2008</ref>), but such boost- ing may be detectable in estimates on topical categories. Within the WHAM model, we change the count variables C · and N · so that C align is the number of tokens of {S − w} in replies to messages contain- ing w but not {S − w}. C base is then the number in replies to messages not containing any words in S. Similarly, N align is the total token counts over replies containing w but not any other words in S, and N base the total token counts over replies containing no words in S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Methods</head><p>We conducted three sets of simulations, fitting the model with marker categories, individual words, and with the CNW scheme described above. In each, the model was fit with two chains of 200 it- erations of the sampler for each dataset. We then extracted alignment estimates from each of the fi- nal 100 samples, and we report 95% highest pos- terior density intervals on η align S . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the alignment on each marker category in the Twitter and Switchboard corpora. There were substantial differences in the overall rate of alignment between the corpora: Mean cat- egory alignment on Twitter was .19, while Switch- board category alignment was −.051. These dif- ferences may reflect the nature of the two dis- course contexts: Replies on Twitter are composed while looking at the preceding message, encour- aging the replier to take more account of the other tweeter's words, and a replier can draft and edit their reply to make it better fit the conversation. Messages on Switchboard, on the other hand, are evanescent, so a replier must compose a reply without looking back at the message, without edit- ing, and in real-time. Differences in the discourse structure of these corpora may also be contribut- ing, an effect we will consider in Experiment 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Results</head><p>Despite the difference in reply construction in the two corpora, the results across levels of align- ment were similar. Alignment was found primar- ily at the lexical -rather than the category -level. Lexical and category alignment were not signifi- cantly different from each other, but the strength of lexical alignment was significantly larger than the CNW alignment, according to a t-test over cat- egories (Twitter: t(10) = .21, p &lt; .001; Swbd: t(10) = .12, p = .003). CNW alignment was significantly negative on Switchboard (t(10) = −.11, p = .01) and not significantly different from zero on Twitter (t(10) = .009, p = .79). WHAM -unlike other previous measures - provides estimates of alignment that are unbiased by either marker frequency or message length, but we still observed modest alignment on Twit- ter, replicating previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doyle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011</ref>). Alignment was smaller in Switchboard, and in both cases there were no category effects. Thus, the categor- ical alignment results may result primarily from lexical alignment, inconsistent with the predic- tions of interactive priming accounts of alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiment 2: Discourse Acts and Alignment</head><p>Messages within a discourse can serve a very wide range of purposes. This variety has effects for both linguistic structure and the relationship to neigh- boring messages. For example, a simple yes/no question is likely to receive a short, constrained re- ply, while a statement of an opinion is more likely to yield a longer reply. In addition, different types of messages can either introduce new information to the conversation (e.g., statements, questions, of- fers) or look back at existing information (e.g., ac- knowledgments, reformulations, yes/no answers). We hypothesize that alignment will be substan- tially different depending on the discourse act, as speakers' conversational goals vary. Thus, our second experiment examines how alignment dif- fers depending on discourse act. We focus on a particular kind of discourse act, the backchannel <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Yngve, 1970)</ref>. Backchannels are extremely common in Switchboard, accounting for almost 20% of utterances, and include utter- ances such as single words signaling understand- ing or misunderstanding (yeah, uh-huh, no) or simple messages expressing empathy without try- ing to take a full conversational turn (It must have been tough). Backchannels are a particularly inter- esting case because their short and constrained na- ture makes it difficult to align on some categories (e.g., backchannels rarely contain quantifiers or prepositions), while the purpose of giving feed- back to the speaker makes it important to align on others (e.g., matching the positive/negative tone or certainty of a speaker). In addition, backchannels are primarily restricted to spoken corpora. Twitter conversations contain far fewer backchannels than Switchboard, which may account for some of their alignment differences-especially as the results of this experiment suggest that backchannels reduce overall alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Methods</head><p>We use the discourse-annotated Switchboard cor- pus to compare alignment in conversations con- taining backchannels with those whose backchan- nels have been removed. We make this compari- son by creating a second corpus, removing every utterance classified as a backchannel from the cor- pus prior to parsing the utterances into conversa- tion turns as before. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Results</head><p>Alignment values for the Switchboard corpus without backchannels are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. As expected, alignment is on average higher without the backchannels (p = .09 for category, p &lt; .05 for lexical and CNW), reflecting the constrained nature of backchannels. Lexical alignment is sig- nificantly higher than category alignment (t(10) = −.08, p = .03), consistent with the findings of Ex- periment 1. The mean category alignment without backchannels is .029. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> compares the category alignments for the full Switchboard corpus (green) and Switch- board without backchannels (orange). Alignment on the full corpus is lower for all but two cat- egories, exhibiting the reduced opportunity for alignment provided by backchannels. Syntac- tic category alignment is especially affected by backchannels, whose constrained forms provide very little ability to align syntactically.</p><p>Interestingly, the two categories that do show greater alignment when backchannels are included are certainty and negation. These categories are both important for backchannels; a negative backchannel is generally inappropriate in reply to a non-negative message, and similarly a confident backchannel would often be out of place in reply to an uncertain message. These influences of dis- course acts on alignment are more consistent with a discourse-strategic origin for alignment than a priming-based account.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>Linguistic alignment is a prominent type of com- municative accommodation, but its sources are un- clear. We presented WHAM, a length-robust ex- tension of a probabilistic alignment model. Using this model, we find evidence that linguistic align- ment is primarily lexical, and that it is strongly af- fected by at least some aspects of the discourse goal of a message. This combination of a primarily-lexical origin for linguistic alignment and its variation by word category and discourse act suggest that alignment is primarily a higher-level discourse strategy rather than a low-level priming-based mechanism. This set of results is consistent with both Accommo- dation Theory and the set of findings, reviewed above, that sociological factors affect the level of observed alignment. The effect of discourse acts on alignment further suggests that alignment is not a completely automatic process but rather one of many discourse strategies that speakers use to achieve their conversational goals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Actual versus estimated alignment on simulated data.
