				<p>We present a study of aspects of discourse structure-specifically discourse devices used to organize information in a sentence that significantly impact the quality of machine translation. Our analysis is based on manual evaluations of translations of news from Chinese and Ara-bic to English. We find that there is a particularly strong mismatch in the notion of what constitutes a sentence in Chi-nese and English, which occurs often and is associated with significant degradation in translation quality. Also related to lower translation quality is the need to employ multiple explicit discourse connec-tives (because, but, etc.), as well as the presence of ambiguous discourse connec-tives in the English translation. Furthermore , the mismatches between discourse expressions across languages significantly impact translation quality.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this study we examine how the use of dis- course devices to organize information in a sen- tence -and the mismatch in their usage across languages -influence machine translation (MT) quality. The goal is to identify discourse process- ing tasks with high potential for improving trans- lation systems.</p><p>Historically MT researchers have focused their attention on the mismatch of linear realization of syntactic arguments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Galley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Collins et al., 2005</ref>), lexico-morphological mismatch ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Minkov et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Habash and Sadat, 2006</ref>) and word polysemy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Carpuat and Wu, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chan et al., 2007)</ref>. Discourse structure has largely been considered irrelevant to MT, mostly due to the as- sumption that discourse analysis is needed to inter- pret multi-sentential text while statistical MT sys- tems are trained to translate a single sentence in one language into a single sentence in another.</p><p>However, discourse devices are at play in the or- ganization of information into complex sentences. The mere definition of sentence may differ across languages. Chinese for example is anecdotally known to allow for very long sentences which at times require the use of multiple English sentences to express the same content and preserve gram- maticality. Similarly discourse connectives like because, but, since and while often relate informa- tion expressed in simple sentential clauses. There are a number of possible complications in trans- lating these connectives: they may be ambiguous between possible senses, e.g., English while is am- biguous between COMPARISON and TEMPORAL; explicit discourse connectives may be translated into implicit discourse relations or translated in morphology rather than lexical items <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Meyer and Webber, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Meyer and Poláková, 2013</ref>).</p><p>In our work, we quantify the relationship be- tween information packaging, discourse devices, and translation quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data and experiment settings</head><p>We examine the quality of translations to English from Chinese and Arabic using Human-targeted Translation Edit Rates (HTER) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Snover et al., 2006</ref>), which roughly captures the minimal num- ber of edits necessary to transform the system output into an acceptable English translation of the source sentence. By comparing MT output with post-edited references, HTER provides more reliable estimates of translation quality than us- ing translated references, especially at the seg- ment level. The data for the analysis is drawn from an extended set of newswire reports in the 2008/2010 NIST Metrics for Machine Translation GALE Evaluation set 1 . For Chinese, there are 305 sentences (segments) translated to English by three different translation systems. For Arabic, there are 363 Arabic sentences (segments) trans- lated by two systems.</p><p>The presence of discourse devices is analyzed only on the English side: the reference, the system hypothesis and its edited translation. Discourse connectives and their senses are identified using existing tools developed for English. Beyond its practical limitations, analyzing the reference inter- estingly reflects the choices made by the human translator: whether to choose to use a discourse connective, or to insert one to make an implicit re- lation on the source side explicit on the target side.</p><p>We first conduct analysis of variance (ANOVA) with HTER as dependent variable and the dis- course factors as independent variables, and sys- tems as subjects. We examine within-subject sig- nificance in each ANOVA model. For discourse factors that are significant at the 95% confidence level or higher according to the ANOVA analy- sis, we provide detailed breakdown of the system HTER for each value of the discourse factor.</p><p>In this paper we do not compare the perfor- mance of individual systems, but instead seek to understand if a discourse phenomena is problem- atic across systems. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Sentence length and HTER</head><p>The presence of complex discourse structure is likely to be associated with longer sentences. It stands to reason that long sentences will be harder to process automatically and this reasoning has motivated the first approaches to text simplifica- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekar et al., 1996)</ref>. So before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we exam- ine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length. A strong correlation between the two would call for revival of interest in text sim- plification where syntactically complex sentences are transformed into several shorter sentences as a preprocessing step.</p><p>We find however that no strong relationship ex- ists between the two, as shown by the correlation coefficients between HTER values and the number of words in each segment in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Lan. Sys1 Sys2 Sys3 ZH 0.097 (0.099) 0.117 (0.152) 0.144 (0.173) AR</formula><p>0.071(0.148) -0.089 (-0.029) - <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Pearson (Spearman) correlation coeffi- cient between segment length and HTER values.</p><p>Next we examine if sentence-discourse diver- gence between languages and the presence of (am- biguous) discourse connectives would be more in- dicative of the expected translation quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">When a sentence becomes discourse</head><p>Some languages allow more information to be packed into a single sentence than is possible in another language, making single-sentence transla- tions cumbersome and often ungrammatical. Chi- nese is known for sentences of this kind; for exam- ple, the usage of punctuation is very different in Chinese in the sense that a comma can sometimes function as a full stop in English, motivating a se- ries of disambiguation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jin et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xue and Yang, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Xu and Li, 2013)</ref>. Special han- dling of long Chinese sentences were also shown to improve machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jin and Liu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yin et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>To investigate the prevalence of sentences in the source language (Chinese and Arabic in our case) that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in the target language (English for the purposes of this study), we separate the translation segments in the source language into two classes: a source sen- tence is considered 1-1 if the reference translation consists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if the reference contains more than one sentence.</p><p>For Chinese, 26.2% of the source segments are 1-many. These sentences tend to be much longer than average (36.6% of all words in all reference translations are part of such segments). For Ara- bic, the numbers are 15.2% and 26.3%, respec- tively. Below is an example of a 1-many Chinese segment, along with the human reference and its translation by one of the systems:</p><p>[source] 俄警方宣称，Erinys有一重要竞争对手RISC， 利特维年科生前最后见面的人卢戈沃伊与友人都是从事 这些行业。 [ref] Russian police claim that Erinys has an important com- petitor RISC. The last people Litvinenko saw while he was alive, Lugovoi and his friends, were all engaged in these in- dustries.</p><p>[sys] Russian police have claimed that a major competitor, Litvinenko his last meeting with friends are engaged in these industries.</p><p>We conducted ANOVA on HTER, separately for each language, with type of segment <ref type="formula">(1-</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: ANOVA for both languages; average HTER for the three Chinese to English systems, stratified on type of segment (1-1 and 1-many). An (*) denotes significance at p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>1-many) as the independent variable and systems treated as subjects. The test revealed that there is a significant difference in translation quality be- tween 1-1 and 1-many segments for Chinese but not for Arabic. For the Chinese to English systems we further ran a Wilcoxon rank sum test to iden- tify the statistical significance in performance for individual systems. For two of the three systems the difference is significant, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>We have now established that 1-many segments in Chinese to English translation are highly preva- lent and their translations are of consistently lower quality compared to 1-1 segments. This finding suggests a cross language discourse analysis task of identifying Chinese sentences that cannot be translated into single English sentences. This task may be related to existing efforts in comma dis- ambiguation in Chinese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jin et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xue and Yang, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Xu and Li, 2013</ref>) but the relation- ship between the two problems needs to be clar- ified in follow up work. Once 1-many segments are identified, source-side text simplification tech- niques may be developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Siddharthan, 2006</ref>) to improve translation quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Explicit discourse relations</head><p>Explicit discourse relations such as COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY or TEMPORAL are signaled by an explicit connective, i.e., however or because. The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Prasad et al., 2008</ref>) provides annotations for the arguments and relation senses of one hundred pre-selected discourse connectives over the news portion of the Penn Treebank corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Marcus et al., 1993</ref>). Based on the PDTB, accurate systems for explicit discourse relation identification have been devel- oped <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Pitler and Nenkova, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lin et al., 2014</ref>). The accuracy of these systems is 94% or higher, close to human performance on the task. Here we <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Number of connectives: ANOVA for both languages; proportion of data in each factor level and average HTER for the three Chinese-English systems, of the entire dataset and of 1-many trans- lations. An (*) or (+) sign denotes significance at 95% and 90% confidence levels, respectively. study the influence of explicit discourse relations on machine translation quality and their interac- tion with 1-1 and 1-many segments.</p><note type="other">AOV Arabic Chinese P r(&gt; F ) 0.39 0.0058* No Conn &gt; 1 Conn all % data (ZH) 53.77 15.08 1-many % data (ZH) 13.77 5.25 HTER mean HTER mean all ZH-Sys1 16.11 19.84 + ZH-Sys2 19.96 22.39 ZH-Sys3 20.70 25.00* 1-many ZH-Sys1 16.94 22.75 + ZH-Sys2 20.47 23.25 ZH-Sys3 22.30 29.68*</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Number of connectives</head><p>We identify discourse connectives and their senses (TEMPORAL, COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY or EXPANSION) in each reference segment using the system in Pitler and Nenkova (2009) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . We com- pare the translation quality obtained on segments with reference translation containing no discourse connective, exactly one discourse connective and more than one discourse connective. The ANOVA indicates that the number of con- nectives is not a significant factor for Arabic trans- lation, but significantly impacts Chinese transla- tion quality. A closer inspection using Wilcoxon rank sum tests reveals that the difference in trans- lation quality is statistically significant only be- tween the groups of segments with no connective vs. those with more than one connective. Addi- tionally, we ran Wilcoxon rank sum test over 1- 1 and 1-many segments individually and find that the presence of discourse connectives is associated with worse quality only in the latter case. Effects above are illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.  In transla- tion this becomes a problem when the ambiguity is present in one language but not in the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Ambiguity of connectives</head><p>In such cases the sense in source ought to be dis- ambiguated before translation. Here we compare the translation quality of segments which contain ambiguous discourse connectives in the reference translation to those that do not. This analysis gives lower bound on the translation quality degradation associated with discourse phenomena as it does not capture problems arising from connective am- biguity on the source side. We base our classification of discourse connec- tives into ambiguous or not according to the dis- tribution of their senses in the PDTB. We call a connective ambiguous if its most frequent sense among COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, EXPAN- SION, TEMPORAL accounts for less than 80% of occurrence of that connective in the PDTB. Nine- teen connectives meet this criterion of ambiguity. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In the ANOVA tests for each language, we com- pared the quality of segments which contained an ambiguous connective in the reference with those that do not, with systems treated as subjects. For Arabic the presence of ambiguous connective did not yield a statistically significant difference. The difference however was highly significant for Chi- nese, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>The finding that discourse connective ambigu- ity is associated with change in translation quality for Chinese but not for Arabic is rather interesting. It appears that the language pair in translation im- pacts the expected gains from discourse analysis on translation.  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: ANOVA for both languages; average HTER for Chinese sentences containing a CON- TINGENCY relation (6.89% of all data) or both COMPARISON and TEMPORAL (4.59% of all data). An (*) or (+) sign denotes significance at 95% and 90% confidence levels, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Relation senses</head><p>Here we study whether discourse relations of spe- cific senses pose more difficulties on translations than others and whether there are interactions be- tween senses. In the ANOVA analysis we used a binary factor for each of the four possible senses. For example, we compare the translation quality of segments that contain COMPARISON relations in the reference translation with those that do not. The relation sense makes a significant differ- ence in translation quality for Chinese but not for Arabic. For Chinese specifically sentences that ex- press CONTINGENCY relations have worse qual- ity translations than sentences that do not express CONTINGENCY. One explanation for this ten- dency may be that CONTINGENCY in Chinese con- tains more ambiguity with other relations such as TEMPORAL, as tense is expressed lexically in Chi- nese (no morphological tense marking on verbs). Finally, the interaction between COMPARISON and TEMPORAL is significant for both languages. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the effect of relation sense on HTER values for Chinese.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Human edits of discourse connectives</head><p>A relation expressed implicitly without a connec- tive in one language may need to be explicit in another. Moreover, the expressions themselves are used differently; for example, the paired con- nective "虽 然...但 是" (despite...but) in Chinese should not be translated into two redundant con- nectives in English. It is also possible that the source language contains an explicit discourse connective which is not translated in the target lan- guage, as has been quantitatively studied recently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Meyer and Webber (2013)</ref>. An example from our dataset is shown below:</p><p>[source] 还有些人可到大学的游戏专业深造，而后被聘 请为大游戏厂商的技术顾问等。 [ref] Still some others can receive further professional game training in universities and later(Temporal) be employed as technical consultants by large game manufacturers, etc.</p><p>[sys] Some people may go to the university games profes- sional education, which is appointed as the big game manu- facturers such as technical advisers.</p><p>[edited] Some people may go to university to receive profes- sional game education, and later(Temporal) be appointed by the big game manufacturers as technical advisers.</p><p>The system fails to translate the discourse con- nective "而后" (later), leading to a probable mis- interpretation between receiving education and be- ing appointed as technical advisors.</p><p>Due to the lack of reliable tools and resources, we approximate mismatches between discourse expressions in the source and MT output using discourse-related edits. We identify explicit dis- course connectives and their senses in the system translation and the human edited version of that translation. Then we consider the following mu- tually exclusive possibilities: (i) there are no dis- course connectives in either the system output or the edit; (ii) the system output and its edited ver- sion contain exactly the same discourse connec- tives with the same senses; (iii) there is a discourse connective present in the system output but not in the edit or vice versa. In the ANOVA we use a factor with three levels corresponding to the three cases described above. The factor is significant for both Chinese and Arabic. In both languages, the mismatch case (iii) involves significantly higher HTER than either case (i) or (ii). The human edit rate in the mismatch class is on average four points greater than that in the other classes.</p><p>Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit ex- pression of discourse relation is related to the first problem we studied, i.e., if the source seg- ment is translated into one or multiple sentences in English, since discourse relations between adja- cent sentences are more often implicit (than intra- sentence ones). For this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation qual- ity of segments with discourse mismatch condi- tioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many. For both languages a significant difference was found for 1-1 sentences but not 1-many. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the proportion of data in each of the con- ditioned classes and the average HTER for sen-  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Data portions, ANOVA for both lan- guages and average HTER for segments where there is a discourse mismatch between system and edited translations. An (*) denotes significance at p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>tences from the mismatch case (iii) where a dis- course connective was edited and the others (no such edits). Translation quality degrades signifi- cantly for all systems for the mismatch case, over all data as well as 1-1 segments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We showed that translation from Chinese to En- glish is made more difficult by various discourse events such as the use of discourse connectives, the ambiguity of the connectives and the type of relations they signal. None of these discourse fac- tors has a significant impact on translation qual- ity from Arabic to English. Translation quality from both languages is adversely affected by trans- lations of discourse relations expressed implicitly in one language but explicitly in the other or by paired connectives. Our experiments indicate that discourse usage may affect machine translation between some language pairs but not others, and for particular relations such as CONTINGENCY. Finally, we established the need to identify sen- tences in the source language that would be trans- lated into multiple sentences in English. Espe- cially in translating from Chinese to English, there is a large number of such sentences which are cur- rently translated much worse than other sentences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>A number of discourse connectives are ambiguous with respect to the discourse relation they convey.
