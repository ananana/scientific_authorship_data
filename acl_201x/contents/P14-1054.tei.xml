				<p>Chinese is an ancient hieroglyphic. It is inattentive to structure. Therefore, segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate. In this paper, we propose an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction. The Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature, reducing errors caused by word segmentation. In order to utilize the structure information of a relation instance, we discuss how soft constraint can be used to capture the local dependency. Both Omni-word feature and soft constraint make a better use of sentence information and minimize the influences caused by Chinese word segmenta-tion and parsing. We test these methods on the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus. The results show a significant improvement in Chi-nese relation extraction, outperforming other methods in F-score by 10% in 6 relation types and 15% in 18 relation subtypes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Information Extraction (IE) aims at extracting syntactic or semantic units with concrete concepts or linguistic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Grishman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">McCallum, 2005</ref>). Instead of dealing with the whole doc- uments, focusing on designated information, most of the IE systems extract named entities, relations, quantifiers or events from sentences.</p><p>The relation recognition task is to find the rela- tionships between two entities. Successful recog- nition of relation implies correctly detecting both the relation arguments and relation type. Although this task has received extensive research. The per- formance of relation extraction is still unsatisfac- tory with a F-score of 67.5% for English (23 sub- types) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. Chinese relation extrac- tion also faces a weak performance having F-score about 66.6% in 18 subtypes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dandan et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>The difficulty of Chinese IE is that Chinese words are written next to each other without de- limiter in between. Lacking of orthographic word makes Chinese word segmentation difficult. In Chinese, a single sentence often has several seg- mentation paths leading to the segmentation ambi- guity problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Liang, 1984)</ref>. The lack of delimiter also causes the Out-of-Vocabulary problem (OOV, also known as new word detection) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Huang and Zhao, 2007</ref>). These problems are worsened by the fact that Chinese has a large number of characters and words. Currently, the state-of-the-art Chinese OOV recognition system has performance about 75% in recall ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhong et al., 2012</ref>). The errors caused by segmentation and OOV will accumulate and propagate to subsequent processing (e.g. part- of-speech (POS) tagging or parsing).</p><p>Therefore, the Chinese relation extraction is more difficult. According to our survey, com- pared to the same work in English, the Chinese re- lation extraction researches make less significant progress.</p><p>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extrac- tion. We apply these approaches in a maximum entropy based system to extract relations from the ACE 2005 corpus. Experimental results show that our method has made a significant improvement.</p><p>The contributions of this paper include</p><p>1. Propose a novel Omni-word feature for Chi- nese relation extraction. Unlike the tradi- tional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word fea- ture uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature.</p><p>2. Aiming at the Chinese inattentive structure, we utilize the soft constraint to capture the local dependency in a relation instance. Four constraint conditions are proposed to gener-ate combined features to capture the local de- pendency and maximize the classification de- termination.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work. The Omni- word feature and soft constrain are proposed in Section 3. We give the experimental results in Sec- tion 3.2 and analyze the performance in Section 4. Conclusions are given in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>There are two paradigms extracting the relation- ship between two entities: the Open Relation Ex- traction (ORE) and the Traditional Relation Ex- traction (TRE) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banko et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Based on massive and heterogeneous corpora, the ORE systems deal with millions or billions of documents. Even strict filtrations or constrains are employed to filter the redundancy information, they often generate tens of thousands of relations dynamically ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al., 2010)</ref>. The practi- cability of ORE systems depends on the adequate- ness of information in a big corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brin, 1999</ref>). Most of the ORE systems utilize weak supervi- sion knowledge to guide the extracting process, such as: <ref type="bibr">Databases (Craven and Kumlien, 1999</ref>), Wikipedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wu and Weld, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoffmann et al., 2010)</ref>, Regular expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brin, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agichtein and Gravano, 2000</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Ontology (Carlson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mohamed et al., 2011</ref>) or Knowledge Base extracted automatically from Internet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Takamatsu et al., 2012)</ref>. However, when iteratively coping with large heterogeneous data, the ORE systems suffer from the "semantic drift" problem, caused by error accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Curran et al., 2007)</ref>. Agichtein, <ref type="bibr">Carlson and Fader et al. (2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2000)</ref> propose syntactic and se- mantic constraints to prevent this deficiency. The soft constraints, proposed in this paper, are com- bined features like these syntactic or semantic con- straints, which will be discussed in Section 3.2.</p><p>The TRE paradigm takes hand-tagged ex- amples as input, extracting predefined relation types ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banko et al., 2008</ref>). The TRE systems use techniques such as: Rules (Regulars, Pat- terns and Propositions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Miller et al., 1998</ref>), Ker- nel method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2006b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zelenko et al., 2003)</ref>, Belief network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Roth and Yih, 2002</ref>), Lin- ear programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Roth and Yih, 2007)</ref>, Maximum entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kambhatla, 2004</ref>) or SVM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">GuoDong et al., 2005</ref>). Compared to the ORE systems, the TRE systems have a robust performance. Disad- vantages of the TRE systems are that the manu- ally annotated corpus is required, which is time- consuming and costly in human labor. And mi- grating between different applications is difficult. However, the TRE systems are evaluable and com- parable. Different systems running on the same corpus can be evaluated appropriately.</p><p>In the field of Chinese relation extraction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Liu et al. (2012)</ref> proposed a convolution tree ker- nel. Combining with external semantic resources, a better performance was achieved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Che et al. (2005)</ref> introduced a feature based method, which utilized lexicon information around entities and was evaluated on Winnow and SVM classi- fiers.  explored the position feature between two entities. For each type of these relations, a SVM was trained and tested independently. Based on Deep Belief Net- work,  proposed a model han- dling the high dimensional feature space. In addi- tion, there are mixed models. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lin et al. (2010)</ref> employed a model, combining both the feature based and the tree kernel based methods.</p><p>Despite the popularity of kernel based method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huang et al. (2008)</ref> experimented with different kernel methods and inferred that simply migrating from English kernel methods can result in a bad performance in Chinese relation extraction. <ref type="bibr">Chen and Li et al. (2008;</ref> also pointed out that, due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmenta- tion and parsing, the tree kernel based approach is inappropriate for Chinese relation extraction. The reason of the tree kernel based approach not achieve the same level of accuracy as that from En- glish may be that segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate than process- ing English.</p><p>In our research, we proposed an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method. Both ap- proaches are based on the Chinese characteristics. Therefore, better performance is expected. In the following, we introduce the feature construction, which discusses the proposed two approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Feature Construction</head><p>In this section, the employed candidate features are discussed. And four constraint conditions are proposed to transform the candidate features into combined features. The soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Candidate Feature Set</head><p>In the ACE corpus, an entity is an object or set of objects in the world. An entity mention is a ref- erence to an entity. The entity mention is anno- tated with its full extent and its head, referred to as the extend mention and the head mention respec- tively. The extent mention includes both the head and its modifiers. Each relation has two entities as arguments: Arg-1 and Arg-2, referred to as E1 and E2. A relation mention (or instance) is the embod- iment of a relation. It is referred by the sentence (or clause) in which the relation is located in. In our work, we focus on the detection and recogni- tion of relation mention.</p><p>Relation identification is handled as a classifi- cation problem. Entity-related information (e.g. head noun, entity type, subtype, CLASS, LDC- TYPE, etc.) are supposed to be known and pro- vided by the corpus. In our experiment, the entity type, subtype and the head noun are used.</p><p>All the employed features are simply classi- fied into five categories: Entity Type and Subtype, Head Noun, Position Feature, POS Tag and Omni- word Feature. The first four are widely used. The last one is proposed in this paper and is discussed in detail.</p><p>Entity Type and Subtype: In ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus, there are 7 entity types (Person, Organization, GPE, Location, Facility, Weapon and Vehicle) and 44 subtypes (e.g. Group, Gov- ernment, Continent, etc.).</p><p>Head Noun: The head noun (or head mention) of entity mention is manually annotated. This fea- ture is useful and widely used.</p><p>Position Feature: The position structure be- tween two entity mentions (extend mentions). Be- cause the entity mentions can be nested, two en- tity mentions may have four coarse structures: "E1 is before E2", "E1 is after E2", "E1 nests in E2" and "E2 nests in E1", encoded as: 'E1_B_E2', 'E1_A_E2', 'E1_N_E2' and 'E2_N_E1'.</p><p>POS Tag: In our model, we use only the ad- jacent entity POS tags, which lie in two sides of the entity mention. These POS tags are labelled by the ICTCLAS package 2 . The POS tags are not used independently. It is encoded by combining <ref type="bibr">1</ref> If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of "soft constraint" denoting features generated by the em- ployed constraint conditions. 2 http://ictclas.org/ the POS tag with the adjacent entity mention in- formation. For example 'E1_Right_n' means that the right side of the first entity is a noun ("n"). Omni-word Feature: The notion of "word" in Chinese is vague and has never played a role in the Chinese philological tradition <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sproat et al., 1996)</ref>. Some Chinese segmentation perfor- mance has been reported precision scores above 95% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Peng et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xue, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhang et al., 2003)</ref>. However, for the same sentence, even native peoples in China often disagree on word boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hoosain, 1992;</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sproat et al. (1996)</ref> has showed that there is a con- sistence of 75% on the segmentation among differ- ent native Chinese speakers. The word-formation of Chinese also implies that the meanings of a compound word are made up, usually, by the meanings of words that contained in it ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hu and Du, 2012)</ref>. So, fragments of phrase are also infor- mative.</p><p>Because high precision can be received by using simple lexical features <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kambhatla, 2004;</ref>. Making better use of such information is beneficial. In consideration of the Chinese char- acteristics, we use every potential word in a rela- tion mention as the lexical features. For example, relation mention '台 北 大 安 森 林 公 园' (Taipei Daan Forest Park) has a "PART-WHOLE" relation type. The traditional segmentation method may generate four lexical features {'台北', '大安', '森 林', '公园'}, which is a partition of the relation mention. On the other hand, the Omni-word fea- ture denoting all the possible words in the relation mention may generate features as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{'台', '北', '大', '安', '森', '林', '公', '园', '台北', '大安', '森林', '公园', '森林公园', '大安森林公园'} 3</formula><p>Most of these features are nested or overlapped mutually. So, the traditional character-based or word-based feature is only a subset of the Omni- word feature. To extract the Omni-word feature, only a lexicon is required, then scan the sentence to collect every word.</p><p>Because the number of lexicon entry determines the dimension of the feature space, performance of Omni-word feature is influenced by the lexicon being employed. In this paper, we generate the lexicon by merging two lexicons. The first lexicon is obtained by segmenting every relation instance using the ICTCLAS package, collecting very word produced by ICTCLAS. Because the ICTCLAS package was trained on annotated corpus contain- ing many meaningful lexicon entries. We expect this lexicon to improve the performance. The sec- ond lexicon is the Lexicon Common Words in Con- temporary Chinese <ref type="bibr">4</ref> .</p><p>Despite the Omni-word can be seen as a sub- set of n-Gram feature. It is not the same as the n-Gram feature. N-Gram features are more frag- mented. In most of the instances, the n-Gram fea- tures have no semantic meanings attached to them, thus have varied distributions. Furthermore, for a single Chinese word, occurrences of 4 charac- ters are frequent. Even 7 or more characters are not rare. Because Chinese has plenty of char- acters 5 , when the corpus becoming larger, the n- Gram (n¿4) method is difficult to be adopted. On the other hand, the Omni-word can avoid these problems and take advantages of Chinese charac- teristics (the word-formation and the ambiguity of word segmentation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Soft Constraint</head><p>The structure information (or dependent informa- tion) of relation instance is critical for recognition. However, even in English, "deeper" analysis (e.g. logical syntactic relations or predicate-argument structure) may suffer from a worse performance caused by inaccurate chunking or parsing. Hence, the local dependency contexts around the rela- tion arguments are more helpful <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zhao and Grishman, 2005</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhang et al. (2006a)</ref> also showed that Path-enclosed Tree (PT) achieves the best per- formance in the kernel based relation extraction. In this field, the tree kernel based method com- monly uses the parse tree to capture the struc- ture information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zelenko et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Culotta and Sorensen, 2004</ref>). On the other hand, the feature based method usually uses the combined feature to capture such structure information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">GuoDong et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kambhatla, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>In the open relation extraction domain, syntac- tic and semantic constraints are widely employed to prevent the "semantic drift" problem. Such con- straints can also be seen as structural constraint.</p><p>Most of these constraints are hard constraints. Any relation instance violating these constraints (or be- low a predefined threshold) will be abandoned. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agichtein and Gravano (2000)</ref> </p><note type="other">gen- erates patterns according to a confidence threshold (τ t ). Fader et al. (2011) utilizes a confidence func- tion. And Carlson et al. (2010) filters candidate instances and patterns using the number of times they co-occurs. Deleting of relation instances is acceptable for open relation extraction because it always deals with a big data set. But it's not suitable for tra- ditional relation extraction, and will result in a low recall. Utilizing the notion of combined fea- ture (GuoDong et al., 2005; Kambhatla, 2004), we replace the hard constraint by the soft constraint. Each soft constraint (combined feature) has a pa- rameter trained by the classifier indicating the dis- crimination ability it has. No subjective or priori judgement is adopted to delete any potential de- terminative constraint (except for the reason of di- mensionality reduction).</note><p>Most of the researches make use of the com- bined feature, but rarely analyze the influence of the approaches we combine them. In this paper, we use the soft constraint to model the local de- pendency. It is a subset of the combined feature, generated by four constraint conditions: singleton, position sensitive, bin sensitive and semantic pair . For every employed candidate feature, an appro- priate constraint condition is selected to combine them with additional information to maximize the classification determination.</p><p>Singleton: A feature is employed as a single- ton feature when it is used without combining with any information. In our experiments, only the po- sition feature is used as singleton feature.</p><p>Position Sensitive: A position sensitive feature has a label indicating which entity mention it de- pends on. In our experiment, the Head noun and POS Tag are utilized as position sensitive features, which has been introduced in Section 3.1. For ex- ample, '台北_E1' means that the head noun '台 北' depend on the first entity mention.</p><p>Semantic Pair: Semantic pair is generated by combining two semantic units. Two kinds of semantic pair are employed. Those are gener- ated by combining two entity types or two en- tity subtypes into a semantic pair. For example, 'Person_Location' denotes that the type of the first relation argument is a "Person" (entity type) and the second is a "Location" (entity type). Semantic pair can capture both the semantic and structure information in a relation mention.</p><p>Bin Sensitive: In our study, Omni-word feature is not added as "bag of words". To use the Omni- word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions. Together with the two en- tity mentions, we get five parts: "FIRST", "MID- DLE", "END", "E1" and "E2" (or less, if the two entity mentions are nested). Each part is taken as an independent bin. A flag is used to distin- guish them. For example, '台 北_Bin_F', '台 北_Bin_E1' and '台北_Bin_E' mean that the lexicon entry '台 北' appears in three bins: the FIRST bin, the first entity mention (E1) bin and the END bin. They will be used as three indepen- dent features.</p><p>To sum up, among the five candidate feature sets, the position feature is used as a singleton fea- ture. Both head noun and POS tag are position sensitive. Entity types and subtypes are employed as semantic pair. Only Omni-word feature is bin sensitive. In the following experiments, focusing on Chinese relation extraction, we will analyze the performance of candidate feature sets and study the influence of the constraint conditions. sectionExperiments In this section, methodologies of the Omni- word feature and the soft constraint are tested. Then they are compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Settings and Results</head><p>We use the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus, which was collected from newswires, broadcasts and we- blogs, containing 633 documents with 6 major re- lation types and 18 subtypes. There are 8,023 rela- tions and 9,317 relation mentions. After deleting 5 documents containing wrong annotations 6 , we keep 9,244 relation mentions as positive instances.</p><p>To get the negative instances, each document is segmented into sentences <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . Those sentences that do not contain any entity mention pair are deleted. For each of the remained sentences, we iteratively extract every entity mention pair as the arguments of relation instances for predicting. For example, suppose a sentence has three entity mentions: A,B <ref type="bibr">6 DAVYZW {20041230.1024</ref><ref type="bibr">6 DAVYZW {20041230. , 20050110.1403</ref><ref type="bibr">6 DAVYZW {20041230. , 20050111.1514</ref><ref type="bibr">6 DAVYZW {20041230. , 20050127.1720</ref>.1538}. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The five punctuations are used as sentence boundaries: Period (。), Question mark (？), Exclamatory mark (！), Semicolon (；) and Comma (，).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and C. Because the relation arguments are order sensitive, six entity mention pairs can be gener- ated: [A,B], [A,C], [B,C], [B,A], [C,A] and [C,B].</head><p>After discarding the entity mention pairs that were used as positive instances, we generated 93,283 negative relation instances labelled as "OTHER". Then, we have 7 relation types and 19 subtypes.</p><p>A maximum entropy multi-class classifier is trained and tested on the generated relation in- stances. We adopt the five-fold cross validation for training and testing. Because we are interested in the 6 annotated major relation types and the 18 subtypes, we average the results of five runs on the 6 positive relation types (and 18 subtypes) as the final performance. F-score is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2 × (P recision × Recall) P recision + Recall</formula><p>To implement the maximum entropy model, the toolkit provided by Le <ref type="formula">(2004)</ref> is employed. The iteration is set to 30.</p><p>Five candidate feature sets are employed to gen- erate the combined features. The entity type and subtype, head noun, position feature are referred to as F thp 8 . The POS tags are referred to as F pos . The Omni-word feature set is denoted by F ow . <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> gives the performance of our system on the 6 types and 18 subtypes. Note that, in this pa- per, bare numbers and numbers in the parentheses represent the results of the 6 types and the 18 sub- types respectively. In Row 1, because F thp are features directly ob- tained from annotated corpus, we take this per-formance as our referential performance. In Row 2, with only the F ow feature, the F-score already reaches 77.74% in 6 types and 60.31% in 18 sub- types. The last row shows that adding the F pos al- most has no effect on the performance when both the F thp and F ow are in use. The results show that F ow is effective for Chinese relation extraction.</p><p>The superiorities of Owni-word feature depend on three reasons. First, the specificity of Chi- nese word-formation indicates that the subphrases of Chinese word (or phrase) are also informative. Second, most of relation instances have limited context. The Owni-word feature, utilizing every possible word in them, is a better way to capture more information. Third, the entity mentions are manually annotated. They can precisely segment the relation instance into corresponding bins. Seg- mentation of bins bears the sentence structure in- formation. Therefore, the Owni-word feature with bin information can make a better use of both the syntactic information and the local dependency.</p></div>

In order to give a bet- ter comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, based on our experiment settings and data, we im- plement the two feature based methods proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Che et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang et al. (2011)</ref> in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Ta- ble 2. The results are shown in Table 3</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, Ei (i ∈ 1, 2) represents entity men- tion. "Order" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Che et al. (2005)</ref> denotes the posi- tion structure of entity mention pair. Four types of order are employed (the same as ours). W ord Ei+ − k and P OS Ei+ − k are the words and POS of Ei, "+ − k" means that it is the kth word (of POS) after (+) or before (-) the corresponding entity mention. In this paper, k = 1 and k = 2 were set.</p><p>In Row 2, the "Uni-Gram" represents the Uni- gram features of internal and external character sequences. Internal character sequences are the four entity extend and head mentions. Five kinds of external character sequences are used: one In- Between character sequence between E1 and E2 and four character sequences around E1 and E2 in a given window size w s. The w s is set to 4. The "Bi-Gram" is the 2-gram feature of internal and external character sequences. Instead of the 4 po- sition structures, the 9 position structures are used. Please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang et al. (2011)</ref> for the details of these 9 position structures.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, it is shown that our system outper- forms other systems, in F-score, by 10% on 6 re- lation types and by 15% on 18 subtypes.</p><p>For researchers who are interested in our work, the source code of our system and our imple- mentations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Che et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang et al. (2011)</ref> are available at https://github. com/YPench/CRDC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In this section, we analyze the influences of em- ployed feature sets and constraint conditions on the performances.</p><p>Most papers in relation extraction try to aug- ment the number of employed features. In our ex- periment, we found that this does not always guar- antee the best performance, despite the classifier being adopted is claimed to control these features independently. Because features may interact mu- tually in an indirect way, even with the same fea- ture set, different constraint conditions can have significant influences on the final performance.</p><p>In Section 3, we introduced five candidate fea- ture sets. Instead of using them as independent features, we combined them with additional in- 577 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Comparing With the State-of-the-Art Methods</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System</head><p>Feature Set P R F formation. We proposed four constraint condi- tions to generate the soft constraint features. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, the performances of candidate features are compared when different constraint conditions was employed. In Column 3 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> (Constraint Condi- tion), (1), <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> stand for the referen- tial feature sets 9 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Symbol "/" means that the corresponding candidate features in the refer- ential feature set are substituted by the new con- straint condition. Par in Column 4 is the num- ber of parameters in the trained maximum entropy model, which indicate the model complexity. I in Column 5 is the influence on performance. "-" and "+" mean that the performance is decreased or in- creased.</p><p>The first observation is that the combined fea- tures are more powerful than used as singletons. Model parameters are increased by the combined features. Increasing of parameters projects the relation extraction problem into a higher dimen- sional space, making the decision boundaries be- come more flexible.</p><p>The named entities in the ACE corpus are also annotated with the CLASS and LDCTYPE labels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhou et al. (2010)</ref> has shown that these labels can result in a weaker performance. Row 1, 2 and 3 show that, no matter how they are used, the perfor- mances decrease obviously. The reason of the per- formance degradation may be caused by the prob- lem of over-fitting or data sparseness.</p><p>At most of the time, increase of model param- eters can result in a better performance. Except in Row 8 and Row 11, when two head nouns of entity pair were combined as semantic pair and when POS tag were combined with the en- tity type, the performances are decreased. There are 7356 head nouns in the training set. Combin- ing two head nouns may increase the feature space <ref type="bibr">9</ref> (1), (2), (3), (4) and <ref type="formula">(5)</ref>  by 7356 × (7356 − 1). Such a large feature space makes the occurrence of features close to a random distribution, leading to a worse data sparseness.</p><p>In Row 4, 10 and 13, these features are used as singleton, the performance degrades considerably. This means that, the missing of sentence structure information on the employed features can lead to a bad performance.</p><p>Row 9 and 12 show an interesting result. Com- paring the reference set (5) with the reference set (3), the Head noun and adjacent entity POS tag get a better performance when used as singletons. These results reflect the interactions between dif- ferent features. Discussion of this issue is be- yond this paper's scope. In this paper, for a better demonstration of the constraint condition, we still use the Position Sensitive as the default setting to use the Head noun and the adjacent entity POS tag.</p><p>Row 13 and 14 compare the Omni-word fea- ture (By-Omni-word) with the traditional seg- mentation based feature (By-Segmentation). By- Segmentation denotes the traditional segmentation based feature set generated by a segmentation tool, collecting every output of relation mention. In this place, the ICTCLAS package is adopted too.</p><p>Conventionally, if a sentence is perfectly seg- mented, By-Segmentation is straightforward and effective. But, our experiment shows different ob- servations. Row 13 and 14 show that the Omni- word method outperforms the traditional method. Especially, when the bin information is used (Row 15), the performance of Omni-word feature in- creases considerably.</p><p>Row 14 shows that, compared with the tradi- tional method, the Omni-word feature improves the performance by about 8.79% in 6 relation types and 11.83% in 18 subtypes in F-core. Such improvement may reside in the three reasons dis- cussed in Section 3.3.</p><p>In short, from <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> we have seen that the en- tity type and subtype maximize the performance when used as semantic pair. Head noun and adjacent entity POS tag are employed to com- bine with positional information. Omni-word fea- ture with bins information can increase the perfor- mance considerably. Our model (in Section 3.3) uses these settings. This insures that the perfor- mances of the candidate features are optimized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, We proposed a novel Omni-word feature taking advantages of Chinese sub-phrases. We also introduced the soft constraint method for Chinese relation recognition. The soft constraint utilizes four constraint conditions to catch the structure information in a relation instance. Both the Omni-word feature and soft constrain make better use of information a sentence has, and min- imize the deficiency caused by Chinese segmenta- tion and parsing.</p><p>The size of the employed lexicon determines the dimension of the feature space. The first impres- sion is that more lexicon entries result in more power. However, more lexicon entries also in- crease the computational complexity and bring in noises. In our future work, we will study this issue. The notion of soft constraints can also be extended to include more patterns, rules, regexes or syntac-tic constraints that have been used for information extraction. The usability of these strategies is also left for future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Che et al.
