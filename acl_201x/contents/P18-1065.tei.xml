				<p>As the popularity of free-form user-generated reviews in e-commerce and review websites continues to increase, there is a growing need for automatic mechanisms that sift through the vast number of reviews and identify quality content. On-line review helpfulness modeling and prediction is a task which studies the factors that determine review helpfulness and attempts to accurately predict it. This survey paper provides an overview of the most relevant work on product review helpful-ness prediction and understanding in the past decade, discusses gained insights, and provides guidelines for future research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Research on the computational modeling and pre- diction of online review helpfulness has generally proceeded in two directions. One concerns the au- tomatic prediction of the helpfulness of a review, where helpfulness is typically defined as the frac- tion of "helpful" votes it receives. Review help- fulness research in the NLP and text mining com- munities has largely focused on identifying tex- tual content features of a review that are useful for automatic helpfulness prediction. The other di- rection concerns understanding the nature of help- fulness, where researchers seek to understand the process of human evaluation of review helpfulness and the factors that influence it.</p><p>The increasing popularity of modeling and pre- diction of review helpfulness since its inception more than a decade ago can be attributed to its practical significance. Nowadays, customers reg- ularly rely on different kinds of user reviews (e.g., hotels, restaurants, products, movies) to decide what to spend their money on. Given the large number of reviews available in web platforms, a review helpfulness prediction system could sub- stantially save people's time by allowing them to focus on the most helpful reviews. Hence, a suc- cessful review helpfulness prediction system could be as useful as a product recommender system.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike in many key areas of re- search in NLP, it is by no means easy to determine the state of the art in automatic helpfulness pre- diction. Empirical comparisons are complicated for at least two reasons. First, historically, sys- tems have been trained on different datasets, not all of which are publicly available. Second, re- searchers have not built on the successes of each other, evaluating their ideas against baselines that are not necessarily the state of the art. Worse still, new features are not always properly evaluated. This somewhat disorganized situation can be at- tributed in part to the lack of a common forum for researchers to discuss a long-term vision and a roadmap for research in this area.</p><p>Our goal in this survey is to present an overview of the current state of research on computational modeling and prediction of product review help- fulness. Our focus on product reviews is moti- vated by the fact that they are the most widely studied type of review. Despite this focus, it is by no means the case that our work is only applicable to product reviews. While online platforms differ in objectives and review domains (e.g., Amazon is an online product store, Yelp is a business re- view website, and TripAdvisor is a booking web- site for a variety of travel activities), the principles that govern the helpfulness voting process are ro- bust across platforms and domains. This means that most, if not all, of our findings are transfer- able to other kinds of online reviews. We believe that this survey will be useful to researchers and developers interested in a better understanding of the mechanisms behind review helpfulness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Datasets</head><p>The main source of product reviews used in past research is Amazon.com, but interesting work has been done on data from Ciao.com (a now defunct product review website). The main difference be- tween these two sources is the metadata associated with them: Amazon.com offers anonymous vot- ing information, whereas Ciao attaches userIDs to helpfulness votes. Ciao also uses helpfulness votes in the range of 0 to 5, whereas Amazon votes are binary. Furthermore, Ciao offers information on a social trust network, where users choose to con- nect to reviewers if they find their reviews con- sistently helpful, unlike Amazon.com, which does not offer any such social trust network. These dif- ferences have allowed researchers to make obser- vations on Ciao.com data that cannot be made on Amazon.com.</p><p>Datasets are collected from the aforementioned sources through web scraping or APIs. When it comes to Amazon datasets, researchers can choose one of two pre-collected datasets: the Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset <ref type="bibr">1 (Blitzer et al., 2007</ref>) (MDSD) and the Amazon Review Dataset 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McAuley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">He and McAuley, 2016</ref>) (ARD). These datasets have a similar number of product categories (25 and 24, respectively). However, the latest version of MDSD contains 1,422,530 reviews, while ARD contains 142.8 million reviews. Furthermore, ARD offers a va- riety of metadata that is not present in MDSD (e.g., product salesrank). To the best of our knowl- edge, there is only one pre-collected Ciao dataset 3 <ref type="bibr">(302,232 reviews, 43,666 users, and 8,894,899</ref> helpfulness votes), which was made available by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al. (2013)</ref>. Few researchers have used these pre-collected datasets, however. Instead, most have relied on collecting their own datasets directly from websites. As mentioned before, the general lack of testing on pre-collected datasets has made system comparisons difficult.</p><p>The majority of researchers simply use helpful- ness scores (the fraction of users who vote a re- view as helpful) as found in websites as ground truth for system training and evaluation. Given that these scores are volatile when reviews have few votes, researchers frequently filter out reviews Votes : <ref type="bibr">[97,</ref><ref type="bibr">102]</ref> Text : I'm a much bigger fan of the Targus folding keyboard. For starters it folds into the size of a handspring. Second of all the Landware version's keys are incredibly small. The one feature benefit of landware is that it's a rigid design so it can be used on your lap -while the Targus version is very flexible and needs to be placed on a flat surface to type. Some researchers have argued that helpfulness scores might not be good indicators of actual help- fulness, and have resorted to rating or ranking re- views themselves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tsur and Rappoport, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yang et al., 2015)</ref>, but these ap- proaches are not the norm.</p><p>Researchers have observed interesting patterns in review datasets. For instance, positive reviews are more likely to have high helpfulness scores (O' <ref type="bibr">Mahony et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang et al., 2015)</ref>, top ranking reviews hold a disproportionate amount of votes when compared to lower-ranked reviews ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 2007)</ref>, and more recent reviews tend to get fewer votes than older reviews ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 2007)</ref>. Although some of these effects may be the consequence of website voting mechanisms (e.g., Amazon shows reviews based on their helpful- ness), they should be taken in consideration when selecting and pre-processing datasets.</p><p>Perhaps the most important observation is that helpfulness scores may not be strongly corre- lated to review quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tsur and Rappoport, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yang et al., 2015)</ref>. In at least one study, independent anno- tators agreed more frequently (85%) with an al- ternate helpfulness ranking than with one based on helpfulness scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tsur and Rappoport, 2009)</ref>. The example review in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows discrep- ancies between quality and score. While this re- view is relatively short and contains only a couple of judgments on its product, 97 out of 102 peo- ple voted it as helpful (0.95 score). The quality of this review does not seem to match its near-perfect score. As we will see in Section 4, these discrep- ancies could be explained as the consequence of several moderating factors, which have a direct in- fluence on the helpfulness voting process but are largely ignored in current helpfulness prediction systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Helpfulness Prediction</head><p>Helpfulness prediction tasks include score regres- sion (predicting the helpfulness score h ∈ [0, 1] of a review), binary review classification (classi- fying a review as helpful or not), and review rank- ing (ordering a set of reviews by their helpfulness). In this section, we present the evaluation measures and approaches explored in past work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Performance Measures</head><p>Regarding performance measures, classification tasks have used Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Regression tasks have mostly used mean squared error (MSE), which measures the average of the sum of the squared error, and root mean squared error (RMSE), which is defined as the square root of MSE. Ranking systems have used Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), which is popularly used to measure the relevance of search results in information retrieval (here, helpfulness is used as a measure of relevance), and NDCG@k, a special version of NDCG that only takes into ac- count the top k items in a ranking (this is used because users only read a limited number of re- views). Researchers have also used Pearson and Spearman correlations to measure model fit and ranking performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Approaches</head><p>Next, we provide a high-level overview of the ap- proaches that have been employed to predict the helpfulness of online product reviews.</p><p>Regression has primarily been attempted through support vector regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yang et al., 2015)</ref>. However, probabilistic matrix factorization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al., 2013)</ref>, linear regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lu et al., 2010)</ref>, and extended tensor factorization models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moghaddam et al., 2012</ref>) have successfully been used to integrate sophisticated constraints into the learning process and have achieved improvements over regular regression models. Multi-layer neural networks have also been used towards this purpose ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lee and Choeh, 2014</ref>). In particular, there seems to be progress toward more sophisticated models. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mukherjee et al. (2017)</ref> used a HMM-LDA based model to jointly infer reviewer expertise, predict aspects, and review helpfulness, which showed significant improvement over simpler models. Classification approaches have mostly been based on SVMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hong et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zeng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Krishnamoorthy, 2015)</ref>, but thresholded linear regression models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011)</ref>, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, J48 and JRip have also been used <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Krishnamoorthy, 2015)</ref>. Recent work has also approached this task with neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Malik and Hussain, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. Regarding ranking, some researchers have used ranking-specific methods such as SVM ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tsur and Rappoport, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hong et al., 2012</ref>), but others have attempted to recover rankings from classification <ref type="bibr">Smyth, 2009, 2010</ref>) or regression (Mukherjee et al., 2017) outputs. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides an overview of some of the most relevant features used in helpfulness predic- tion systems, explains the intuition behind them and, whenever possible, their correlation to help- fulness and impact on performance. Here, we dif- ferentiate primarily between content and context features. Content features focus on information directly derived from the review, such as review text and star rating, whereas context features fo- cus on information from outside the review, such as reviewer/user information.</p><p>Content features include Review Length Fea- tures, which are based on the intuition that longer reviews have more information and are thus more helpful; Readability Features, which are based on the conjecture that if a review is easier to read, it will be found helpful by more users; Word-Based Features, which are based on the idea of identify- ing key words whose presence indicates the impor- tance of the information found in a review; Word- Category Features, which identify the presence of words belonging to specific word lists; and Con- tent Divergence Features, which measure how dif- ferent the contents of the review are from specific reference texts. Context features include Reviewer Features, which collect meaningful reviewer his- torical information to predict future helpfulness scores; and User-Reviewer Idiosyncrasy Features, which attempt to capture the similarity between users and reviewers. We also include a couple of Miscellaneous Features, which are based on meta- data and sentiment analysis; these features are bet- ter understood in the context of the moderating factors presented in Section 4.</p><p>Researchers have managed to mostly agree on some observations regarding which features are   <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al. (2007)</ref>, but the individual predic- tive power of these features was not studied. Content Divergence Features: Measure the difference between reviews and some reference text.

Some researchers argue that star rating is useful because of the presence of positivity bias (i.e., reviews with positive star ratings are seen as more help- ful), while few researchers disagree on the ex- istence of a connection between star ratings and helpfulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Otterbacher, 2009)</ref>. Review readabil- ity metrics, which measure how "easy" it is to read a review, have been found to have a positive cor- relation to helpfulness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Korfiatis et al., 2012</ref>), but have not been as thor- oughly tested as other features. A recurrent idea is that of capturing review content relevance: un- igram TF-IDF statistics (the relative importance of the words in a review when compared to other reviews of the same product) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kim et al., 2006</ref>), dominant terms (computed using a custom metric similar to TF-IDF, but tailored for book reviews) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tsur and Rappoport, 2009)</ref>, and latent review top- ics (the themes present in the review) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McAuley and Leskovec, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mukherjee et al., 2017</ref>) stand out particularly.</p><note type="other">) with only few researchers disagreeing on the existence of the correlation (Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006; Korfiatis et al., 2012). There is general agreement that a review's star rating can also be useful for helpfulness prediction. Some researchers use the extremity of the rating (positive, negative, neu- tral) as a feature (positive and negative reviews are seen as more useful than neutral reviews) (Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011), while others use star ratings directly (</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The State of Helpfulness Prediction</head><p>The classical approach to helpfulness prediction has consisted of finding new hand-crafted features that can improve system performance. Although many interesting features continue to be found (e.g., emotion (Martin and Pu, 2014), aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Yang et al., 2016)</ref>, and argument ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu et al., 2017</ref>) based features), advances have been hindered by the lack of standard datasets, which are needed for perfor- mance comparisons, and feature ablation studies, which are needed to properly evaluate the contri- bution of newly proposed features.</p><p>Even so, as in many other areas of NLP, recent systems based on neural network architectures have shown performance increases both when us- ing hand-crafted features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lee and Choeh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Malik and Hussain, 2017)</ref> and when performing raw-text predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. More- over, recent systems have been shown to be able to tackle domain knowledge transfer considerably well ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. Although these systems were not compared against a robust hand-crafted feature baseline, the fact that authors are begin- ning to use pre-collected datasets (ARD) enables fairer comparisons. Intuitively, we expect models based on neural network architectures to be bet- ter at capturing latent semantics, as well as some of the feature interactions we will present in Sec- tion 4. In parallel, systems that have incorpo- rated user and reviewer features, particularly those that learn from individual user votes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al., 2013</ref>), have shown large performance increases over extensive hand-crafted-only feature baselines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al., 2013)</ref>, and more so- phisticated models focused on review semantics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mukherjee et al., 2017</ref>) have also outperformed hand-crafted-only feature baselines significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Helpfulness Voting Process: Entities and Moderating Factors</head><p>So far we have presented an overview of the fea- tures used in helpfulness prediction systems. With a few exceptions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mudambi and Schuff, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al., 2013</ref>), past work on helpfulness prediction has focused exclu- sively on non-moderating factors (i.e., observable features which can contribute towards helpfulness scores, but cannot alter or influence the voting pro- cess itself). Even so, researchers have gained key insights on certain moderating factors (i.e., mech- anisms and properties that can influence the voting process outcome). These findings are relevant not only because they can be used to enhance helpful- ness prediction, but because, when put together, they constitute arguments in favor of reconsider- ing the helpfulness prediction task and its focus. In this section, we will present a variety of moder- ating factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The Voting Process and its Entities</head><p>To start our discussion on moderating factors, let us provide a brief, intuitive definition of the steps involved in the helpfulness voting process and out- line the entities involved in it 5 : 1. A reviewer, a, writes a review r on product p 2. A user, u, reads the review by reviewer a on product p and internally assigns it a score s using some criterion c. 3. If the score s is over some threshold t, the user votes the review as "helpful". Other- wise, the user votes it as "not helpful". Intuitively, one can expect these four entities - reviewers, users, reviews, and products -to play a role in determining the outcome of the voting process. Moreover, it is reasonable to expect both the nature of these entities and the interactions be- tween them to be sometimes expressed through hidden features/variables. For instance, one can- not directly observe a user's opinion of a prod- uct unless he/she writes a review, and one can- not directly observe a particular user's information needs or a product's nature, which would indicate what kind of review is most helpful for it. In the next subsections, we will discuss different mod- erating factors that have been discovered for each of these entities, the observable features that have been used to approximate them, and their effects on the voting process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">User-Product Predispositions</head><p>Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Mizil et al. (2009)</ref> showed that the difference between user and reviewer opinions can influence helpfulness votes. Since user opinions are hidden, based on the assump- tion that star ratings are good indicators of opin- ion, Danescu et al. studied the interplay between review star rating deviation from the mean (the divergence between the reviewer's opinion and the average opinion of the product) and star rat- ing variance (the level of opinion consensus for a product) for 1 million Amazon US book reviews, making the following observations:</p><p>1. When star rating variance is very low, the most helpful reviews are those with the av- erage star rating. 2. With moderate variance, the most helpful re- views are those with a slightly-above-average star rating. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Here we assume voting participation and do not attempt to reconcile it with polarity, but a deeper understanding of participation could lead to better interpretations of votes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">As variance becomes large, reviews with star</head><p>ratings both above and below the average are more helpful (positive reviews still deemed somewhat more helpful).</p><p>These observations held when controlling for review text, and constitute one of the most straightforward pieces of evidence against text- only review helpfulness understanding and pre- diction. Although these observations show only aggregated user behavior, they have a theoretical backing by past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Wilson and Peterson, 1989)</ref>, and hint that a deeper understanding of user opinions can lead to better prediction systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">User-Reviewer Idiosyncrasy</head><p>Tang et al. <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> found that, by observing users' actions, user-reviewer idiosyncrasy similar- ity could be measured and used to enhance help- fulness prediction. They showed that the exis- tence and strength of connections between review- ers and users in a social network, along with prod- uct rating history similarity, moderated the general user opinion of a particular reviewer's reviews. Specifically, they analyzed social network connec- tions in Ciao's circle of trust, a social network where a user connects to a reviewer if they consis- tently find their reviews helpful, along with users' and reviewers' product rating histories, and made the following observations:</p><p>1. Users are likely to think of reviews from their connected reviewers as more helpful. 2. The more strongly users connect to a re- viewer, the more helpful users consider the reviews from the reviewer. 6 3. Users are likely to consider the reviews from reviewers with similar product ratings as more helpful. 4. The more similar the product ratings of users and reviewers, the more helpful users con- sider the reviews from the reviewer.</p><p>As Tang et al. proposed that differences in help- fulness scores are not necessarily a consequence of review quality, but of differences of opinion be- tween users (if everyone thought the same way, all reviews would have a score of either 0 or 1), they were among the first to advocate for user-specific helpfulness prediction, which aims to predict how a specific user will vote, instead of predicting the aggregated votes of the community. Under this ap- proach, Tang et al. implemented their observations in a probabilistic matrix factorization framework and achieved a 28.38% relative improvement over a text-reviewer-based baseline that included an ex- tensive set of text features present in other systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lu et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>This suggests that the similarity between re- viewers' idiosyncrasy as expressed in reviews and that of users can be approximated by studying user and reviewer actions. Further, the informa- tion used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al. (2013)</ref> towards this pur- pose is not the only kind that could prove use- ful. It could easily be extended to include the vast amount of user information stored by current day e-commerce websites such as Amazon. Users' age, gender, purchase history, location, browsing and purchase patterns, and review history (both writing and rating) could be used to define prior probabilities on some user x liking the review of a reviewer y. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> As some of this information has already been used in recommender systems, it would be of interest to explore the extent to which techniques from this field (specifically those from collaborative filtering) can be applied to helpful- ness prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Product Nature</head><p>Product nature moderates users' information needs and the criteria of a helpful review. On- line stores now have an astoundingly large cata- log of products, which can be very different in price, use, target market, complexity, popularity, etc. Hence, it is reasonable to expect the informa- tion needs of users to depend at least somewhat on the product in question. Consider the task of buy- ing a house vs buying a TV. We can easily see that the amount and nature of information needed to buy a TV or a house is considerably different. Fur- ther, the quality of these products stems from dif- ferent sources: a TV's perceived quality depends mostly on its technical features, whereas the per- ceived quality of a house depends to some degree on the potential buyer. Therefore, it is perfectly sensible to expect helpful reviews for products of different "types" to be different. Below we show that the nature of a product moderates the effects of star ratings, review length, and subjectivity on helpfulness scores.</p><p>Researchers have proven the influence of prod- uct nature on the helpfulness voting process by dif- ferentiating between search and experience goods. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nelson (1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nelson ( , 1974</ref>, the quality of search goods is derived from objective attributes (e.g., a camera), whereas the quality of experience goods is based on subjective attributes (e.g., a mu- sic CD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mudambi and Schuff (2010)</ref> first identi- fied that review length (word count) is positively correlated to review helpfulness, and then made the following observations:</p><p>• For experience goods, reviews with extreme star ratings (high or low) are associated with lower levels of helpfulness than reviews with moderate star ratings.</p><p>• Review depth has a greater positive effect on the helpfulness of the review for search goods than experience goods. These observations make it clear that the nature of a product can impact the way a user will judge a review's helpfulness. However, approximating the nature of a product is not a trivial task. As stated by Mudambi and Schuff, even if these observa- tions hold, classifying products as search or expe- rience goods is a complicated task, since products fall at some point along a spectrum and commonly have aspects of both search and experience goods. This means that finding methods of automatically discovering product features or classifications that influence the helpfulness voting process is an im- portant task for future research.</p><p>What other product categorizations are there that could influence helpfulness and be easily col- lected/computed? We propose to start by using categories already present in e-commerce web- sites. Intuitively, it would make sense for prod- ucts under the "computers" category to be simi- lar in their information needs. And as such, sys- tems trained on computer reviews should learn similar parameters. As most e-commerce websites use a hierarchical product categorization system, by starting at the most specific subcategories one could potentially generalize subcategory-learned parameters into category-wide trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Review Nature</head><p>A review's style influences the properties that make it helpful. It is well known that when it comes to expressing opinions, the way informa- tion is presented can be almost as important as the information itself. Even if two reviewers have a similar opinion on a product, the way they frame their opinion can make a big difference when it comes to how helpful their reviews are. Consider the task of deciding whether to buy a specific car. What advice could prove useful for this decision? We could consider regular advice that is mostly concerned with the car itself, comparative advice that relates various aspects of the car with its alter- natives, and suggestive advice, which focuses on usage recommendations. <ref type="bibr">Qazi et al. (2016)</ref> used these three types of advice to classify hotel reviews from TripAdvi- sor.com and made the following observations:</p><p>• For comparative reviews, longer reviews are considered more helpful.</p><p>• For suggestive and regular reviews, shorter reviews are more helpful.</p><p>Similar findings on the influence of review na- ture were made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang et al. (2015)</ref>: when differentiating between reviews written by regular and top Amazon reviewers, they made the follow- ing observations:</p><p>• The influence of word count on review help- fulness is bounded (after 144 words, the ef- fect stops) for regular reviewers.</p><p>• For top reviewers, the effect is nonexistent. Similarly to product nature, an important re- search question for future work is how to identify and exploit review categories for effective help- fulness prediction. We expect more sophisticated textual features to be necessary to differentiate be- tween meaningful styles of reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Review Context</head><p>Sipos et al. <ref type="formula">(2014)</ref> found evidence that helpfulness votes are the consequence of judgments of relative quality (i.e., how the review compares to its neigh- bors) and that aggregate user voting polarity is in- fluenced by the specific review ranking that web- sites display at any given point in time. To prove this, they collected daily snapshots of the top 50 reviews of 595 Amazon products over a 5 month period. Four months after the data collection pe- riod ended, they collected the full review rankings for all 595 products. This final review ranking was taken to be the "true" ranking. They studied daily changes and observed that:</p><p>• A review receives more positive votes when it is under-ranked (under its final ranking).</p><p>• A review receives more positive votes when it is superior to its neighbors.</p><p>• A review receives fewer positive votes when it is over-ranked (over its final ranking).</p><p>• A review receives fewer positive votes when it is locally inferior to its neighbors.</p><p>Sipos et al. noted that these observations are consistent with the interpretation that users vote to correct "misorderings" in the ranking. This has important consequences for user-specific helpful- ness prediction systems. Recall that votes may express judgments over a set of reviews. If re- searchers build training sets that identify user votes and contain sufficient information to repli- cate context at the time of voting, systems could learn more about user preferences: a vote would no longer inform solely on a user's perceived help- fulness of a review x, but on the user's perceived helpfulness of x with respect to its neighbors. This could be particularly useful in sparsity scenarios, and could lead to better helpfulness predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>Online product review helpfulness modeling and prediction is a multi-faceted task that involves using content and context information to under- stand and predict helpfulness scores. Researchers now have at their disposal at least three public, pre-collected product review datasets -MDSD, ARD, and Ciao -to build and test systems. Al- though significant advances have been made on finding hand-crafted features for helpfulness pre- diction, effective comparisons between proposed approaches have been hindered by the lack of stan- dard evaluation datasets, well-defined baselines, and feature ablation studies. However, there have been exciting developments in helpfulness pre- diction: systems that have attempted to exploit user and reviewer information, along with those based on sophisticated models (e.g., probabilis- tic matrix factorization, HMM-LDA) and neural network architectures, are promising prospects for future work. Furthermore, a variety of insightful observations have been made on moderating fac- tors. In particular, product opinions, user idiosyn- crasy, product and review nature, along with re- view voting context have been shown to influence the way users vote. This provides suggestive evi- dence that researchers should adopt a holistic view of the helpfulness voting process, which may re- quire information not present in current datasets.</p><p>We conclude our survey with several recom- mendations for future work on computational modeling and prediction of review helpfulness.</p><p>Task If one acknowledges the role that users play in determining whether a review is helpful or not, it seems contradictory to insist on predict- ing helpfulness scores, which represent the aver- age perception of a subset of users that (1) may not be representative of the entire population and (2) may not serve users well if their perceptions do not align with the subset of users that voted (even if the subset consisted of the entire popu- lation). This is why we consider that user-specific helpfulness prediction, first presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moghaddam et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al. (2013)</ref>, should be the goal of future work, as it allows systems to tailor their predictions to users' preferences and needs (much like a recommender system). Note that pursuing user-specific helpfulness prediction is not enough. A substantial amount of work must still be done to find, approximate, and implement moderating factors in helpfulness prediction sys- tems, as well as build models that can adequately reflect the effects of these factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Given that we recommend user-specific helpfulness prediction, we propose the develop- ment of a gold standard that contains informa- tion that can facilitate the design of user-specific models (e.g., records of who voted and how, data relevant to user-profiling recommendations such as age, location, social networks, purchase and browsing history and patterns, product reviews written, and review and product rating histories). Furthermore, as users frequently vote on reviews in a different context (scores and neighboring re- views can vary over time), this dataset should in- clude temporal information, which would allow researchers to reconstruct the context under which votes are cast. To build this dataset, we recom- mend that researchers work with companies such as Amazon, which may have such information.</p><p>Features and knowledge sources While we en- courage the development of user-specific helpful- ness prediction, we by no means imply that a model should be trained for each user. In fact, this may not be feasible if a user has cast only a small number of votes. There are multiple ways to approach this task. One is to train a user-specific model for each cluster of "similar" users. Taking inspirations from collaborative filtering, we could define or learn user similarity based on their pur- chasing/browsing/review and product rating histo- ries ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2014</ref>) as well as profiling informa- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Krulwich, 1997)</ref>, which should be available in the aforementioned dataset. Further, "similar" reviews (i.e., reviews on which users vote simi- larly) could be exploited ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sarwar et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Linden et al., 2003)</ref>. Once product and user/reviewer factors are incorporated into a model, it may be- come feasible to use past instances to predict help- fulness votes (how similar is a test instance to past situations where a user has voted "helpful"?). Baseline systems To design a strong baseline system, first, researchers should consider all pro- posed features so far, including content features, context features, and features used to approach moderating factors. Second, combinations of these features should be systematically tested on the different models proposed by researchers. As we have seen that product nature influences the voting process, these tests should be conducted over different products and product categories. We recommend identifying specific experience and search products, since the effects of product na- ture have already been proven for them. Although ideally, these tests would be carried out on our proposed gold-standard dataset, we believe that the Ciao dataset introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">ARD (McAuley et al., 2015)</ref> can prove use- ful to define a baseline in the short term. Towards this purpose, the systems proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mukherjee et al. (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Malik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hussain (2017), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al. (2018)</ref> could serve as baselines after being enriched with extra features. Other platforms, review domains and lan- guages While we focused on Amazon product reviews written in English, the majority of the fea- tures discussed in Section 3 are platform-, domain- and language-independent, and the existence and importance of moderating factors described in Section 4 is by no means limited to product re- views. Consequently, we encourage researchers to evaluate the usefulness of these features and study these moderating factors in different do- mains, platforms, and languages, possibly identi- fying new features and moderating factors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example Review that do not have a minimum number of votes. Some researchers have argued that helpfulness scores might not be good indicators of actual helpfulness, and have resorted to rating or ranking reviews themselves (Liu et al., 2007; Tsur and Rappoport, 2009; Yang et al., 2015), but these approaches are not the norm. Researchers have observed interesting patterns in review datasets. For instance, positive reviews are more likely to have high helpfulness scores (O'Mahony et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2015), top ranking reviews hold a disproportionate amount of votes when compared to lower-ranked reviews (Liu et al., 2007), and more recent reviews tend to get fewer votes than older reviews (Liu et al., 2007). Although some of these effects may be the consequence of website voting mechanisms (e.g., Amazon shows reviews based on their helpfulness), they should be taken in consideration when selecting and pre-processing datasets. Perhaps the most important observation is that helpfulness scores may not be strongly correlated to review quality (Liu et al., 2007; DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2009; Tsur and Rappoport, 2009; Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011; Yang et al., 2015). In at least one study, independent annotators agreed more frequently (85%) with an alternate helpfulness ranking than with one based on helpfulness scores (Tsur and Rappoport, 2009). The example review in Figure 1 shows discrepancies between quality and score. While this review is relatively short and contains only a couple of judgments on its product, 97 out of 102 people voted it as helpful (0.95 score). The quality of this review does not seem to match its near-perfect score. As we will see in Section 4, these discrepancies could be explained as the consequence of several moderating factors, which have a direct influence on the helpfulness voting process but are largely ignored in current helpfulness prediction systems.</figDesc></figure>
