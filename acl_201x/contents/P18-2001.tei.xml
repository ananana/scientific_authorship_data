				<p>We reformulate the problem of encoding a multi-scale representation of a sequence in a language model by casting it in a continuous learning framework. We propose a hierarchical multi-scale language model in which short timescale dependencies are encoded in the hidden state of a lower-level recurrent neural network while longer timescale dependencies are encoded in the dynamic of the lower-level network by having a meta-learner update the weights of the lower-level neural network in an online meta-learning fashion. We use elastic weights consolidation as a higher-level to prevent catastrophic forgetting in our continuous learning framework.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language models are a major class of natural lan- guage processing (NLP) models whose develop- ment has lead to major progress in many areas like translation, speech recognition or summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Schwenk, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arisoy et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nallapati et al., 2016</ref>). Recently, the task of language modeling has been shown to be an ad- equate proxy for learning unsupervised represen- tations of high-quality in tasks like text classifica- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Howard and Ruder, 2018)</ref>, sentiment detec- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Radford et al., 2017)</ref> or word vector learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Peters et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>More generally, language modeling is an exam- ple of online/sequential prediction task, in which a model tries to predict the next observation given a sequence of past observations. The development of better models for sequential prediction is be- lieved to be beneficial for a wide range of applica- tions like model-based planning or reinforcement learning as these models have to encode some form of memory or causal model of the world to accurately predict a future event given past events.</p><p>One of the main issues limiting the performance of language models (LMs) is the problem of cap- turing long-term dependencies within a sequence.</p><p>Neural network based language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997;</ref>) learn to implicitly store dependencies in a vector of hidden activities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mikolov et al., 2010)</ref>. They can be extended by attention mech- anisms, memories or caches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Tran et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Graves et al., 2014</ref>) to capture long-range connections more explicitly. Unfortunately, the very local context is often so highly informative that LMs typically end up using their memories mostly to store short term context ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daniluk et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we study the possibility of com- bining short-term representations, stored in neural activations (hidden state), with medium-term rep- resentations encoded in a set of dynamical weights of the language model. Our work extends a series of recent experiments on networks with dynami- cally evolving weights ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ba et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ha et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Krause et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moniz and Krueger, 2018</ref>) which show improvements in sequential prediction tasks. We build upon these works by formulating the task as a hierarchical online meta- learning task as detailed below.</p><p>The motivation behind this work stems from two observations.</p><p>On the one hand, there is evidence from a phys- iological point of view that time-coherent pro- cesses like working memory can involve differing mechanisms at differing time-scales. Biological neural activations typically have a 10 ms coher- ence timescale, while short-term synaptic plastic- ity can temporarily modulate the dynamic of the neural network it-self on timescales of 100 ms to minutes. Longer time-scales (a few minutes to several hours) see long-term learning kicks in with permanent modifications to neural excitabil- ity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tsodyks et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abbott and Regehr, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barak and Tsodyks, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ba et al., 2016)</ref>. Interestingly, these psychological observations are paralleled, on the computational side, by a se- ries of recent works on recurrent networks with dynamically evolving weights that show benefits from dynamically updating the weights of a net- work during a sequential task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ba et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ha et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Krause et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moniz and Krueger, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In parallel to that, it has also been shown that temporal data with multiple time-scales dependen- cies can naturally be encoded in a hierarchical rep- resentation where higher-level features are chang- ing slowly to store long time-scale dependencies and lower-level features are changing faster to encode short time-scale dependencies and local timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schmidhuber, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">El Hihi and Bengio, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Koutnk et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chung et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>As a consequence, we would like our model to encode information in a multi-scale hierarchical representation where</p><p>1. short time-scale dependencies can be en- coded in fast-updated neural activations (hid- den state),</p><p>2. medium time-scale dependencies can be en- coded in the dynamic of the network by using dynamic weights updated more slowly, and 3. a long time-scale memory can be encoded in a static set of parameters of the model.</p><p>In the present work, we take as dynamic weights the full set of weights of a RNN language model (usually word embeddings plus recurrent, input and output weights of each recurrent layer).</p></div>

Thus, prior to computing the probability of a fu- ture token w t , a set of parameters θ t is estimated from the past parameters and tokens as θ t = argmax θ P (θ | w t−1 , . . . , w 0 , θ t−1 . . . θ 0 ) and the updated parameters θ t are used to compute the probability of the next token w t .</p><p>In our hierarchical neural network language model, the updated parameters θ t are estimated by a higher level neural network g parametrized by a set of (static) parameters φ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">θ t = g φ (w t−1 , . . . , w 0 , θ t−1 . . . θ 0 )<label>(3)</label></formula></div>

The meta-learner can be a feed-forward or a RNN network. In our experiments, simple lin- ear feed-forward networks lead to the lower per- plexities, probably because it was easier to regu- larize and optimize. The meta-learner implements coordinate-sharing as described in <ref type="table">(Andrychow- icz</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Continual learning</head><p>The interaction between the meta-learner and the language model implements a form of continual- learning and the language model thus faces a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(French, 1999</ref>). In our case, this correspond to the lower-level network over-specializing to the lexi- cal field of a particular topic after several updates of the meta-learner (e.g. while processing a long article on a specific topic).</p><p>To mitigate this effect we use a higher-level static memory initialized using "elastic weight consolidation" (EWC) introduced by Kirkpatrick  A squared (resp. underlined) word means the first model has a lower (resp. higher) loss on that word than the second model. We emphasize only words associated with a significant difference in loss by setting a threshold at 10 percent of the maximum absolute loss of each sample.</p><p>et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2017)</ref> to reduce forgetting in multi-task re- inforcement learning. Casting our task in the EWC framework, we define a task A which is the language modeling task (prediction of next token) when no context is stored in the weights of the lower-level network. The solution of task A is a set of weights toward which the model could advantageously come back when the context stored in the weights become irrelevant (for example when switching between paragraphs on different topics). To obtain a set of weights for task A, we train the lower-level net- work (RNN) alone on the training dataset and ob- tain a set of weights that would perform well on average, i.e. when no specific context has been provided by a context-dependent weight update performed by the meta-learner.</p><p>We then define a task B which is a language modeling task when a context has been stored in the weights of the lower-level network by an up- date of the meta-learner. The aim of EWC is to learn task B while retaining some performance on task A.</p><p>Empirical results suggest that many weights configurations result in similar performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sussmann, 1992)</ref> and there is thus likely a solu- tion for task B close to a solution for task A. The idea behind EWC is to learn task B while protect- ing the performance in task A by constraining the parameters to stay around the solution found for task A.</p><p>This constraint is implemented as a quadratic penalty, similarly to spring anchoring the param- eters, hence the name elastic. The stiffness of the springs should be greater for parameters that most affect performance in task A. We can for- mally write this constrain by using Bayes rule to express the conditional log probability of the pa- rameters when the training dataset D is split be- tween the training dataset for task A (D A ) and the training dataset for task B (D B ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">log p(θ | D) = log p(D B | θ)+log p(θ | D A )−log p(D B )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The true posterior probability on task A p(θ | D A ) is intractable, so we approximate the posterior as a Gaussian distribution with mean given by the pa- rameters and a diagonal precision given by the di- agonal of the Fisher information matrix F which is equivalent to the second derivative of the loss near a minimum and can be computed from first-order derivatives alone.</p><p>Several works have been devoted to dynamically updating the weights of neural networks during in- ference. A few recent architectures are the Fast- Weights of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ba et al. (2016)</ref>, the Hypernetworks of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ha et al. (2016)</ref> and the Nested LSTM of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moniz and Krueger (2018)</ref>. The weights update rules of theses models use as inputs one or several of (i) a previous hidden state of a RNN network or higher level network and/or (ii) the current or previous inputs to the network. However, these models do not use the predictions of the network on the pre- vious tokens (i.e. the loss and gradient of the loss of the model) as in the present work. The archi- tecture that is most related to the present work is the study on dynamical evaluation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Krause et al. (2017)</ref> in which a loss function similar to the loss function of the present work is obtained empiri- cally and optimized using a large hyper-parameter search on the parameters of the SGD-like rule.</p></div>

We hypothesis that this may be caused by several reasons. First, storing a hid- den state in the meta-learner might be less im- portant in an online meta-learning setup than it is in a standard meta-learning setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrychowicz et al., 2016)</ref> as the target distribution of the weights is non-stationary. Second, the size of the hidden state cannot be increased significantly without reducing the number of steps along which the meta-learner is unrolled during meta-training which may be detrimental.</p><p>Some quantitative experiments are shown on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> using a linear feed-forward network to illustrate the effect of the various layers in the hi- erarchical model. The curves shows differences in batch perplexity between model variants.</p><p>The top curve compares a one-level model (lan- guage model) with a two-levels model (language model + meta-learner). The meta-learner is able to learn medium-term representations to progres- sively reduce perplexity along articles (see e.g. ar- ticles C and E). Right sample 1 (resp. 2) details sentences at the begging (resp. middle) of arti- cle E related to a warship called "Ironclad". The addition of the meta-learner reduces the loss on a number of expression related to the warship like "ironclad" or "steel armor".</p><p>Bottom curve compares a three-levels model (language model + meta-learner + long-term memory) with the two-levels model. The local loss is reduced at topics changes and beginning of new topics (see e.g. articles B, D and F). The right sample 3 can be contrasted with sample 1 to illustrate how the hierarchical model is able to better recover a good parameter space following a change in topic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Lower-level / short time-scale: a RNN-based language model f encoding representations in the activations of a hidden state, 2.
