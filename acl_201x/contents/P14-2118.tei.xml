				<p>We quantify the lexical subjectivity of adjectives using a corpus-based method, and show for the first time that it correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora. These cognitive dimensions together influence how word meanings combine, and we exploit this fact to achieve performance improvements on the semantic classification of adjective-noun pairs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Concreteness, the degree to which language has a perceptible physical referent, and subjectivity, the extent to which linguistic meaning depends on the perspective of the speaker, are well established cognitive and linguistic notions. Recent results suggest that they could also be useful knowledge for natural language processing systems that aim to extract and represent the meaning of language.</p><p>Insight into concreteness can help systems to classify adjective-noun pairs according to their se- mantics. In the non-literal expressions kill the pro- cess or black comedy, a verb or adjective that oc- curs with a concrete argument in literal phrases takes an abstract argument. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Turney et al. (2011)</ref> present a supervised model that exploits this effect to correctly classify 79% of adjective-noun pairs as having literal or non-literal meaning.</p><p>Subjectivity analysis has already proved highly applicable to a range of NLP applications, includ- ing sentiment analysis, information extraction and text categorization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pang and Lee, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Riloff and Wiebe, 2003)</ref>. For such applications, subjec- tivity is analyzed at the phrasal or document level. However, recent work has highlighted the applica- tion of subjectivity analysis to lexical semantics, for instance to the tasks of disambiguating words according to their usage or sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banea et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>The importance of concreteness to NLP systems is likely to grow with the emergence of multi- modal semantic models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bruni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013)</ref>. Such models, which learn representations from both linguistic and per- ceptual input, outperform text-only models on a range of evaluations. However, while multi-modal models acquire richer representations of concrete concepts, their ability to represent abstract con- cepts can be weaker than text-only models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hill et al., 2013)</ref>. A principled treatment of concreteness is thus likely to be important if the multi-modal approach is to prove effective on a wider range of concepts. In a similar vein, interest in subjectiv- ity analysis is set to grow with interest in extract- ing sentiment and opinion from the web and social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benson et al., 2011</ref>). Moreover, given that humans seem to exploit both concreteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Paivio, 1990</ref>) and subjectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Canestrelli et al., 2013)</ref> clues when processing language, it is likely that the same clues should benefit computational mod- els aiming to replicate human-level performance in this area.</p><p>In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems: distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Turney et al., 2011)</ref>, and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs ). We describe an unsupervised corpus-based method to quantify ad- jective subjectivity, and show that it effectively predicts the labels of a hand-coded subjectivity lexicon. Further, we show for the first time that adjective subjectivity correlates with noun con- creteness in large corpora. In addition, we anal- yse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics. We conclude by dis-cussing other potential applications of concrete- ness and subjectivity to NLP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Dimensions of meaning</head><p>Concreteness A large and growing body of em- pirical evidence indicates clear differences be- tween concrete concepts, such as donut or hot- dog and abstract concepts, such as guilt or obesity.</p><p>Concrete words are more easily learned, remem- bered and processed than abstract words <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Paivio, 1991)</ref>, while differences in brain activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Binder et al., 2005</ref>) and cognitive representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hill et al., 2013</ref>) have also been observed. In linguistic conctructions, concreteness appears to influence compound and phrasal semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Traugott, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bowdle and Gentner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Turney et al., 2011</ref>). Together with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate hu- man performance in language processing tasks.</p><p>While automatic methods have been proposed for the quantification of lexical concreteness, they each rely on dictionaries or similar hand-coded resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kwong, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Turney et al., 2011</ref>). We instead extract scores from a recently released dataset of lexical concepts rated on a 1-5 scale for concreteness by 20 annotators in a crowdsourcing experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brysbaert et al., 2013</ref>). 1</p><p>Subjectivity Subjectivity is the degree to which language is interpretable independently of the speaker's perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Langacker, 2002</ref>). For ex- ample, the utterance he sits across the table is more subjective than he sits opposite Sam as its truth depends on the speaker's position. Language may also be subjective because it conveys evalua- tions or opinions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mihalcea et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Computational applications of subjectivity, in- cluding sentiment analysis and information ex- traction, have focused largely on phrase or doc- ument meaning. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In contrast, here we present six corpus-based features designed to quantify the lex- ical subjectivity of adjectives. The features Com- parability and Modifiability are identified as pre- dictors of subjectivity by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wiebe (2000)</ref>. The re- mainder are motivated by corpus studies and/or observations from the theoretical literature. 3</p><p>Adverbiability: <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Quirk et al. (1985)</ref> theorizes that subjective adjectives tend to develop derived ad- verbial forms, whereas more objective adjectives do not. We thus define adverbiability as the fre- quency of derived adverbial forms relative to the frequency of their base form, e.g.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>hotly hot + hotly</head><p>Comparability: Wiebe (2000) oberve that grad- able are more likely to be subjective. Following Wiebe, we note that the existence of comparative forms for an adjective are indicative of gradabil- ity. We thus define comparability as the frequency of comparative or superlative forms relative to the frequency of the base form, e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">hotter + hottest hot + hotter + hottest</formula><p>LeftTendency: Adamson <ref type="formula">(2000)</ref> proposes that more subjective adjectives typically occur furthest from the noun in multiple-modifier strings such as (hot crossed buns). We consequently extract the LeftTendency of our adjectives, defined as the fre- quency of occurrence as the leftmost of two ad- jectives as a proportion of the overall frequency of occurrence in multiple-modifier strings.</p><p>Modifiability: Another characteristic of gradable adjectives noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wiebe (2000)</ref> is that they ad- mit degree modifiers (very/quite delicious). We therefore extract the relative frequency of occur- rence with one of a hand-coded list of English de- gree modifiers.</p><p>Predicativity: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bolinger (1967)</ref> proposed that sub- jective adjectives occur in predicative construc- tions (the cake is sweet), rather than attribu- tive constructions (the German capital) more fre- quently than objective adjectives. We therefore ex- tract the relative frequency of occurrence in such constructions.</p><p>Non-nominality: Many adjectives also function as nouns (sweet cake vs. (boiled sweet). Un- like nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjec- tive, and the number of adjectives in texts corre- lates with human judgements of their subjectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000</ref>). We there- fore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that 'pure' adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives.</p><p>Concreteness meets Subjectivity Demonstra- ble commonalities in how different people per- ceive the physical world suggest that concrete lan- guage may be more objective than abstract lan- guage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Langacker, 1997)</ref>. Intuitively, adjectives ascribing physical properties (wooden shed) are more objective than those conveying abstract traits (suspicious man). Indeed, in certain cases the original, apparently objective, senses of polyse- mous adjectives are not modifiable (very wooden shed?), while their more abstract sense extensions are (very wooden personality). Motivated by these observations, in the follow- ing sections we test two hypotheses. (1) Subjec- tive / objective adjectives are more likely to mod- ify abstract / concrete nouns respectively. (2) Sub- jectivity and concreteness can predict aspects of how adjective and noun concepts combine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Analysis</head><p>In addressing (1), we extracted the 2,000 highest- frequency nouns from the Brysbaert et al. <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> concreteness dataset. We denote by CON C(n) the mean concreteness rating for noun n. For the 24,908 adjectives that occur in some adjective- noun pair with one of these nouns in the British National Corpus (BNC) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Leech et al., 1994)</ref>, we extracted subjectivity features from the Google Books Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goldberg and Orwant, 2013</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">SU BJ(a) = 6 i=1 s a i .</formula><p>To verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wilson et al. (2005)</ref> lexicon. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The combination of all features produced an overall classifiction accuracy of 79%.</p><p>The performance of individual features as predic- tors in isolation is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (top).</p><p>We first tested the relationship between con- creteness and subjectivity with a correlation anal- ysis over noun concepts. For each noun n we de-  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: The most and least subjective adjectives and most and least concrete nouns in our data.</p><p>fined its subjectivity profile as the mean of the sub- jectivity vectors of its modifying adjectives</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">SU BJpf l(n) = 1 |A n | a∈A n s a</formula><p>where the bag A n contains an adjective a for each occurrence of the pair (a, n) in the BNC. As hy- pothesized, CON C(n) was a significant predictor of the magnitude of the subjectivity profile (Pear- son r = −0.421, p &lt; 0.01). This effect is illus- trated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (bottom)</ref>.</p><p>To explore the relationship between concrete- ness, subjectivity and meaning, we plotted the 20,000 highest frequency (a, n) pairs in the BNC in the CONC-SUBJ semantic space <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2,  top)</ref>. In addition, to examine the effect of con- creteness alone on adjective-noun semantics, we (a, n) ∆ (a, n) ∆ white hope 4.61 mature attitude 4.05 fresh hope 4.34 injured pride 4.03 male pride 4.28 black mood 3.99 wild hope 4.06 white spirit 3.93 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: The eight pairs with highest ∆ = ExpCON C(a) − CON C(n) in our data.</p><p>defined a new adjective feature</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ExpCON C(a) = 1 |N a | n∈N a CON C(n)</formula><p>where the bag N a contains noun n for each occur- rence of the pair (a, n) in the BNC. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> (bot- tom) illustrates the the CONC-ExpCONC space.</p><p>In both spaces, the extremities reflect particular meaning combination types. Pairs in the bottom- left region of the CONC-SUBJ space (objective adjectives with abstract nouns, such as green pol- itics) seem to exhibit a non-literal, or at least non prototypical modification type. In contrast, for pairs in the objective+concrete corner, the adjec- tives appear to perform a classifying or categoriz- ing function (baptist minister).</p><p>In the CONC-ExpCONC space, on the diag- onal, where noun-concreteness is 'as expected', pairings appear to combine literally. Away from the diagonal, meaning composition is less pre- dictable. In the top-left, where ExpCONC is greater than CONC, the combinations are almost all non-literal, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>In this section we have outlined a set of corpus features that, taken together, enable effective ap- proximation of adjective subjectivity. The results of our analyses also demonstrate a clear interac- tion between subjectivity and concreteness scores for nouns attributed by human raters. Specifi- cally, objective adjectives are more likely to mod- ify concrete nouns and subjective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract nouns. Qualita- tive investigations further suggest the interaction between these dimensions to be useful in the se- mantic characterization of adjective-noun pairs, a proposition we test formally in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the potential of our adjective subjec- tivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Non-literal Composition Task</head><p>To evaluate their model of lexical concreteness, Turney et al. (2011) developed a list of 100 com- mon adjective-noun pairs classified as either deno- tative (used literally) or connotative (non-literal) by five annotators. Using an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al. (logistic re- gression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on sub- jectivity and concreteness convey sufficient infor- mation to perform the same classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Modification-type Classification</head><p>Boleda et al. (2012) introduce a set of 370 adjective-noun pairs grouped into modification types by human judges. Because a red car is both a car and red, the pair is classed as intersec- tive, whereas dark humour, which is not literally dark, is classed as subsective. To create a distinct but analogous binary categorization problem to the composition task, we filtered out pairs not unani- mously allocated to either class. We again aim to classify the remaining 211 intersective and 93 sub- sective pairs with a logistic regression.   <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Prediction accuracy (%) of models with different features on the two tasks. The baseline method allocates all test pairs to the majority class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>Models were trained with concreteness features (CONC and ExpCONC), subjectivity features (SUBJ and SUBJpfl) and the combination of both types (Combined). The performance of each model is presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, along with a base- line score reflecting the strategy of allocating all pairs to the largest class.</p><p>On the non-literal composition task, the con- creteness Notably, our combined model improves on the concreteness-only model, confirming that the interaction of concreteness and subjectivity provides additional information perti- nent to meaning composition. The modification-type task has no performance benchmark since  do not use their data for classification. Although all models improve on the majority-class baseline, the com- bined model was again most effective. Additive improvement over the baseline in each case was lower than for the composition task, which may reflect the greater subtlety inherent in the sub- sective/intersective classification. Indeed, inter- annotator agreement for this goldstandard (Co- hen's κ = 0.87) was lower than for the composi- tion task (0.95), implying a less cognitively salient distinction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have shown that objective adjectives are most likely to modify concrete nouns, and that non- literal combinations can emerge when this princi- ple is violated (Section 3). Indeed, the occurrence of an adjective with a more abstract noun than those it typically modifies is a strikingly consistent indicator of metaphoricity <ref type="table">(Table 2</ref>). In addition, we showed that both concreteness and subjectivity improve the automatic classification of adjective- noun pairs according to compositionality or mod- ification type (Section 4). Importantly, a classifier with both subjectivity and concreteness features outperforms concreteness-only classifiers, includ- ing those proposed in previous work.</p><p>The results underline the relevance of both sub- jectivity and concreteness to lexical and phrasal semantics, and their application to language pro- cessing tasks. We hypothesize that concreteness and subjectivity are fundamental to human lan- guage processing because language is precisely the conveyance of information about the world from one party to another. In decoding this sig- nal, it is clearly informative to understand to what extent the information refers directly to the world, and also to what extent it reports a fact versus an opinion. We believe these dimensions will ulti- mately prove essential for computational systems aiming to replicate human performance in inter- preting language. As the results suggest, they may be particularly important for capturing the intrica- cies of semantic composition and thus extending representations beyond the lexeme.</p><p>Of course, two dimensions alone are not suf- ficient to reflect all of the subtleties of adjective and noun semantics. For instance, our model clas- sifies white spirit, a transparent cleaning product, as non-literal, since the lexical concreteness score does not allow for strong noun polysemy. Further, it makes no allowance for wider sentential context, which can be an important clue to modification type in such cases.</p><p>We aim to address these limitations in future work by integrating subjectivity and concreteness with conventially acquired semantic representa- tions, and, ultimately, models that integrate input corresponding to the perceptual modalities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Adjective-noun pairs in two semantic spaces.

The concrete- ness model performance represents further confir- mation of the link between concreteness and com- position. The improvement of this model over Turney et al. (2011) is perhaps to be expected, since our model exploits the wide scope of the new Brysbaert et al.
