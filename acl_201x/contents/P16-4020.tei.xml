			<abstract>
				<p>We present a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) system that generates fill-in-the-blank items for preposition usage. The system takes a set of carrier sentences as input, chooses a preposition in each sentence as the key, and then automatically generates distractors. It person-alizes item selection for the user in two ways. First, it logs items to which the user previously gave incorrect answers, and offers similar items in a future session as review. Second, it progresses from easier to harder sentences, to minimize any hindrance on preposition learning that might be posed by difficult vocabulary.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many learners of English find it challenging to master the use of prepositions. Preposition usage is a frequent error category in various learner cor- pora ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Izumi et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dahlmeier et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>; indeed, entire exercise books have been devoted to training learners on preposi- tion usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Watcyn-Jones and Allsop, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yates, 2010)</ref>. To address this area of difficulty, we present a system that automatically generates fill- in-the-blank (FIB) preposition items with multiple choices.</p><p>Also known as gap-fill or cloze items, FIB items are a common form of exercise in computer- assisted language learning (CALL) applications. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows an example item designed for teach- ing English preposition usage. It contains a sen- tence, "The objective is to kick the ball into the opponent's goal", with the preposition "into" blanked out; this sentence serves as the stem (or carrier sentence). It is followed by four choices for the blank, one of which is the key (i.e., the correct answer), and the other three are distrac- tors. These choices enable the CALL application to provide immediate and objective feedback to the learner.</p><p>Traditional exercise books no longer meet all the needs of today's learners. The pedagogical benefits of using authentic textual material have been well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Larimer and Schleicher, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Erbaggio et al., 2012)</ref>. One recent approach turns text on web pages into slot-fill items <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Meurers et al., 2010)</ref>. By offering the learner the free- dom to choose his or her own preferred text, this approach motivates the learner to complete the ex- ercises.</p><p>Our system automatically constructs FIB prepo- sition items from sentences in Wikipedia, a cor- pus that contains authentic language. As more users own mobile devices, mobile applications are now among the most efficient ways to provide on-demand language learning services. Although user attention on mobile devices can be brief and sporadic, each FIB item can be completed within a short time, and therefore our system offers an educational option for users to spend their idle moments. Focusing on prepositions, the system generates distractors based on error statistics com- piled from learner corpora. Further, it maintains an estimate of the user's vocabulary level, and tai- The objective is to kick the ball the opponent's goal.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system that offers these personalization features for preposition items.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews previous work. Section 3 out- lines the algorithms for generating the fill-in-the- blank items. Section 4 gives details about the per- sonalization features in the item selection process. Section 5 reports implementation details and eval- uation results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Previous work</head><p>The Internet presents the language learner with an embarassment of riches. A plethora of CALL websites-Duolingo, LearnEnglish Grammar by the British Council, or Rosetta Stone, to name just a few-provide a variety of speaking, listen- ing, translation, matching and multiple choice ex- ercises. In these exercises, the carrier sentences and other language materials are typically hand- crafted. As a result, the number of items are lim- ited, the language use can sometimes lack authen- ticity, and the content may not match the users' individual interests.</p><p>Promoting use of authentic material, the WERTi system provides input enhancement to web pages for the purpose of language learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Meurers et al., 2010)</ref>. It highlights grammatical constructions on which the user needs practice, and turns them into slot-fill exercises. It handles a wide range of constructions, including prepositions, determin- ers, gerunds, to-infinitives, wh-questions, tenses and phrasal verbs. On the one hand, the system offers much flexibility since it is up to the user to select the page. On the other, the selected text does not necessarily suit the user in terms of its lan- guage quality, level of difficulty and the desired grammatical constructions.</p><p>A number of other systems use text corpora to create grammar exercises. The KillerFiller tool in the VISL project, for example, generates slot-fill items from texts drawn from corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bick, 2005</ref>). Similar to the WERTi system, an item takes the original word as its only key, and does not account for the possibility of multiple correct answers.</p><p>Other systems attempt to generate distractors for the key.   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for the item produced from the bottom sentence.</p><p>Unlike our approach, they did not adapt to the learner's behavior. While some of these systems serve to provide draft FIB items for teachers to post-edit (Skory and Eskenazi, 2010), most remain research prototypes. A closely related research topic for this paper is automatic correction of grammatical errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ng et al., 2014</ref>). While the goal of distractor generation is to identify words that yield incorrect sentences, it is not merely the inverse of the error correction task. An important element of the distractor gener- ation task is to ensure that distractor appears plau- sible to the user. In contrast to the considerable ef- fort in developing tools for detecting and correct- ing preposition errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Felice and Pulman, 2009)</ref>, there is only one previous study on preposition distractor genera- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lee and Seneff, 2007)</ref>. Our system builds on this study by incorporating novel algorithms for distractor generation and personalization features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Item creation</head><p>The system considers all English sentences in the Wikicorpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reese et al., 2010</ref>) that have fewer than 20 words as carrier sentence candidates. In each candidate sentence, the system scans for prepositions, and extracts two features from the linguistic context of each preposition:</p><p>• The prepositional object. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, for example, the words "Monday" and "goal" are respectively the prepositional objects of the keys, "on" and "into".</p><p>Co-occurrence method ... kicked the chair with ... ... kicked the can with ... ... with the goal of ... Learner Error method ... kicked it &lt;error&gt;in&lt;/error&gt; the goal. ... kick the ball &lt;error&gt;in&lt;/error&gt; the other team's goal.</p><p>Learner Revision method ... kick the ball to his own goal.</p><p>... kick the ball into the goal.</p><p>... kick the ball to the goal.</p><p>... kick it towards the goal. The Co-occurrence method (Section 3.1) generates "with" as the distractor for the carrier sentence in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>; the Learner Error method (Section 3.2) generates "in"; the Learner Revision method (Section 3.3) generates "to".</p><p>• The head of the noun phrase or verb phrase (NP/VP head) to which the prepositional phrase (PP) is attached. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the PP "into the opponents' goal" is attached to the VP head "kick"; the PP "on Monday" is at- tached to the NP head "meeting".</p><p>In order to retrieve the preposition, the preposi- tional object, and the NP/VP head (cf. Section 3), we parsed the Wikicorpus, as well as the corpora mentioned below, with the Stanford parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Manning et al., 2014</ref>). The system passes the two fea- tures above to the following methods to attempt to generate distractors. If more than one key is possi- ble, it prefers the one for which all three methods can generate a distractor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Co-occurrence method</head><p>This method requires co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus of well-formed English sentences. It selects as distractor the preposition that co- occurs most frequently with either the preposi- tional object or the NP/VP head, but not both. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>, this method generates the dis- tractor "with" for the carrier sentence in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, since many instances of "kick ... with" and "with ... goal" are attested. The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lee and Seneff (2007)</ref> for details.</p><p>Our system used the English portion of Wiki- corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reese et al., 2010</ref>) to derive statistics for this method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Learner error method</head><p>This method requires examples of English sen- tences from an error-annotated learner corpus. The corpus must indicate the preposition errors, but does not need to provide corrections for these errors. The method retrieves all sentences that have a PP with the given prepositional object and attached to the given NP/VP head, and selects the preposition that is most frequently marked as wrong.</p><p>To derive statistics for this method, our sys- tem used the NUS Corpus of Learner En- glish ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dahlmeier et al., 2013)</ref>, the EF-Cambridge Open Language Database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Geertzen et al., 2013)</ref> and a corpus of essay drafts written by Chinese learners of English (Lee et al., 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Learner revision method</head><p>Finally, our system exploits the revision behavior of learners in their English writing. This method requires draft versions of the same text written by a learner. It retrieves all learner sentences in a draft that contains a PP with the given prepositional ob- ject, and attached to the given NP/VP head. It then selects as distractor the preposition that is most of- ten edited in a later draft. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>, this method generates the distractor "to" for the carrier sentence in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, since it is most often edited in the given linguistic context. The reader is re- ferred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lee et al. (2016)</ref> for details.</p><p>To derive statistics for this method, our sys- tem also used the aforementioned corpus of essay drafts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Item selection</head><p>Learners benefit most from items that are neither too easy nor too difficult. Following principles from adaptive testing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bejar et al., 2003)</ref>, the sys- tem tracks the user's performance in order to select the most suitable items. It does so by considering the vocabulary level of the carrier sentence (Sec- tion 4.1) and the user's previous mistakes (Sec- tion 4.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Sentence difficulty</head><p>A potential pitfall with the use of authentic sen- tences, such as those from Wikipedia, is that dif-ficult vocabulary can hinder the learning of prepo- sition usage. To minimize this barrier, the system starts with simpler carrier sentences for each new user, and then progresses to harder ones.</p><p>For simplicity, we chose to estimate the diffi- culty of a sentence with respect to its vocabulary. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Specifically, we categorized each word into one of ten levels, using graded vocabulary lists compiled by the Hong Kong Education Bureau (2012) and the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The lists consist of about 4,000 words categorized into four sets, namely, those suitable for students in junior primary school, senior primary, junior secondary, or senior secondary. Levels 1 to 4 correspond to these four sets. If the word does not belong to these sets, it is classified at a level between 5 and 10, according to decreasing word frequency in the Google corpus. The difficulty level of a sentence is then defined as the level of its most difficult word.</p><p>For each new user, the system starts with sen- tences at Level 4 or lower. It keeps track of his or her performance for the last ten items. If the user gave correct answers for more than 60% of the items from the current level, the system incre- ments the difficulty level by one. Otherwise, it de- creases the difficulty level by one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Preposition difficulty</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the system presents an item to the user. If the user selects a distractor rather than the key, he or she is informed by a pop-up box <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref>, and may then make another attempt. At this point, the user may also request to see a "similar" item to reinforce the learning of the preposition usage <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4)</ref>. Two items are defined as "similar" if they have the same preposition as key, and the same prepositional object and NP/VP head.</p><p>The system records all items to which the user gave incorrect answers; we will refer to this set of items as the "wrong list". When the user logs in next time, the system begins with a review ses- sion. For each item in the "wrong list", it retrieves a "similar" item from the database <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4)</ref>, thus facilitating the user in reviewing prepositional us- age with which he had difficulty in a previous ses- sion. If the user now successfully chooses the key, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The difficulty level of a sentence depends also on syntac- tic and semantic features. Most metrics for measuring read- ability, however, have focused on the document rather than the sentence level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Miltsakaki and Troutt, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pitler and Nenkova, 2008)</ref>.  the item is taken off the "wrong list". After the review session, the system resumes random selec- tion of items within the estimated level of sentence difficulty, as described in the last section.</p><p>5 Implementation and evaluation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Architecture</head><p>We used the MySQL database, and JSP for the website backend. There are three main tables. The Question table stores all carrier sentences selected from the English portion of the Wikicorpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reese et al., 2010</ref>). To expedite item retrieval and iden- tification of "similar" items, the table stores the key, prepositional object and NP/VP head of each item, as well as the difficulty level of the carrier sentence.</p><p>The Answer table stores the distractors for each item. Currently, the distractors do not change ac- cording to user identity, but we anticipate a future version that personalizes the distractors with re- spect to the user's mother tongue.</p><p>The User table stores the user profile. Informa- tion includes the user's personal "wrong list", his or her estimated vocabulary level, as well as login time stamps. As review for the user, the system offers an item that is similar to the one in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which also has "in" as the key, "eat" as the VP head and "restaurant" as the prepositional object.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Interface</head><p>For a better user experience on mobile devices, we used JQuery Mobile for interface development. At the start page, the user can register for a new ac- count, or log in with an existing user name and password. Alternatively, the user can choose to access the system as a guest. In this case, he or she would be treated as a new user, but no user history would be recorded.</p><p>The user can attempt an arbitrary number of preposition items before logging out. Each item is presented on its own page, with the distractor and key displayed in random order <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). The user chooses the best preposition by tapping on its button. If the answer is correct, the system ad- vances to the next item; otherwise, it informs the user via a pop-up box <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref>, and then flags the distractor in red. The user may try again until he or she successfully chooses the key.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Evaluation</head><p>To assess system quality, we asked two profes- sional English teachers to annotate a set of 400 items, which included both automatically gener- ated and human-crafted items. For each choice in an item, the teachers judged whether it is correct or incorrect. They did not know whether each choice was the key or a distractor. They may judge one, multiple, or none of the choices as correct.</p><p>A distractor is called "reliable" if it yields an incorrect sentence. As reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lee et al. (2016)</ref>, the proportion of distractors judged reliable reached 97.4% for the Learner Revision method, 96.1% for the Co-occurrence method, and 95.6% for the Learner Error method.</p><p>For each incorrect choice, the two annotators further assessed its plausibility as a distractor from their experience in teaching English to na- tive speakers of Chinese. They may label it as ei- ther "obviously wrong", "somewhat plausible", or "plausible". The Learner Error method produced the best distractors, with 51.2% rated "plausible", followed by the Learner Revision method (45.4%) and the Co-occurrence method (34.6%). The num- ber of plausible distractors per item among the au- tomatically generated items compares favourably to the human-crafted ones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lee et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a CALL system that turns sen- tences from Wikipedia into fill-in-the-blank items for preposition usage. Using statistics from both standard and learner corpora, it generates plausi- ble distractors to provide multiple choices.</p><p>The system tailors item selection for individual learners in two ways. First, it chooses carrier sen- tences that matches the learner's estimated vocab- ulary level. Second, to facilitate learning, it of- fers review sessions with items that are similar to those with which the learner previously demon- strated difficulty.</p><p>In future work, we plan to extend the system coverage beyond preposition to other common learner error types.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Chen et al.
