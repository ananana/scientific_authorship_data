				<p>The canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions has attracted considerable attention among linguists and has been a topic of many studies. However , most of these studies require either manual analyses or measurements of human characteristics such as brain activities or reading times for each example. Thus, while these analyses are reliable for the examples they focus on, they cannot be generalized to other examples. On the other hand, the trend of actual usage can be collected automatically from a large corpus. Thus, in this paper, we assume that there is a relationship between the canonical word order and the proportion of each word order in a large corpus and present a corpus-based analysis of canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Japanese has a much freer word order than En- glish. For example, a Japanese double object con- struction has six possible word orders as follows:</p><p>(1) a: Ken-ga Aya-ni camera-wo miseta.</p><p>Ken-NOM Aya-DAT camera-ACC showed b: Ken-ga camera-wo Aya-ni miseta.</p><p>Ken-NOM camera-ACC Aya-DAT showed c: Aya-ni Ken-ga camera-wo miseta.</p><p>Aya-DAT Ken-NOM camera-ACC showed d: Aya-ni camera-wo Ken-ga miseta.</p><p>Aya-DAT camera-ACC Ken-NOM showed e: Camera-wo Ken-ga Aya-ni miseta.</p><p>camera-ACC Ken-NOM Aya-DAT showed f: Camera-wo Aya-ni Ken-ga miseta.</p><p>camera-ACC Aya-DAT <ref type="bibr">Ken-NOM showed</ref> In these examples, the position of the verb miseta (showed) is fixed but the positions of its nomina- tive (NOM), dative (DAT), and accusative (ACC) ar- guments are scrambled. Note that, although the word orders are different, they have essentially the same meaning "Ken showed a camera to Aya."</p><p>In the field of linguistics, each language is as- sumed to have a basic word order that is funda- mental to its sentence structure and in most cases there is a generally accepted theory on the word order for each structure. That is, even if there are several possible word orders for essentially same sentences consisting of the same elements, only one of them is regarded as the canonical word order and the others are considered to be gener- ated by scrambling it. However, in the case of Japanese double object constructions, there are several claims on the canonical argument order.</p><p>There have been a number of studies on the canonical word order of Japanese double ob- ject constructions ranging from theoretical stud- ies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Hoji, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Miyagawa and Tsujioka, 2004</ref>) to empirical ones based on psychological exper- iments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Koizumi and Tamaoka, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nakamoto et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Shigenaga, 2014</ref>) and brain science ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Koso et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Inubushi et al., 2009)</ref>. How- ever, most of them required either manual analyses or measurements of human characteristics such as brain activities or reading times for each example. Thus, while these analyses are reliable for the ex- ample they focus on, they cannot be easily gener- alized to other examples <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . That is, another manual analysis or measurement is required to consider the canonical word order of another example.</p><p>On the other hand, the trend of actual usage can be collected from a large corpus. While it is dif- ficult to say whether a word order is canonical or not from one specific example, we can consider that a word order would be canonical if it is over- whelmingly dominant in a large corpus. For exam- ple, since the DAT-ACC order 2 is overwhelmingly dominant in the case that the verb is kanjiru (feel), its dative argument is kotoba (word), and its ac- cusative argument is aijô (affection) as shown in Example (2), we can consider that the DAT-ACC order would be canonical in this case. Note that, the numbers in parentheses represent the propor- tion of each word order in Examples (2) and (3); φ X denotes the omitted noun or pronoun X in this paper.</p><p>(2) DAT-ACC: Kotoba-ni aijô-wo kanjiru.</p><p>(97.5%)</p><p>word-DAT affection-ACC feel ACC-DAT: Aijô-wo kotoba-ni kanjiru.</p><p>(2.5%) affection-ACC word-DAT feel (φ I feel the affection in φ your words.)</p><p>On the contrary, since the ACC-DAT order is overwhelmingly dominant in the case that the verb is sasou (ask), its dative argument is dêto (date), and its accusative argument is josei (woman) as shown in Example (3), the ACC-DAT order is con- sidered to be canonical in this case.</p><p>(3) DAT-ACC: Dêto-ni josei-wo sasou.</p><p>(0.4%) date-DAT woman-ACC ask ACC-DAT: Josei-wo dêto-ni sasou.</p><p>(99.6%) woman-ACC date-DAT ask (φ I ask a woman out on a date.) Therefore, in this paper, we assume that there is a relationship between the canonical word order and the proportion of each word order in a large corpus and attempt to evaluate several claims on the canonical word order of Japanese double ob- ject constructions on the basis of a large corpus. Since we extract examples of double object con- structions only from reliable parts of parses of a very large corpus, consisting of more than 10 bil- lion unique sentences, we can reliably leverage a large amount of examples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze the canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions on the basis of such a large corpus.</p><p>2 Japanese double object constructions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Relevant Japanese grammar</head><p>We briefly describe the relevant Japanese gram- mar. Japanese word order is basically subject- object-verb (SOV) order, but the word order is of- ten scrambled and does not mark syntactic rela- tions. Instead, postpositional case particles func- tion as case markers. For example, nominative, dative, and accusative cases are represented by case particles ga, ni, and wo, respectively.</p><p>In a double object construction, the subject, indirect object, and direct object are typically marked with the case particles ga (nominative), ni (dative), and wo (accusative), respectively, as shown in Example (4)-a.</p><p>(4) a: Watashi-ga kare-ni camera-wo miseta.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I-NOM</head><p>him-DAT camera-ACC showed b: Watashi-wa kare-ni camera-wo miseta.</p><p>I-TOP him-DAT camera-ACC showed c: φ I kare-ni camera-wo miseta.</p><p>φI -NOM him-DAT camera-ACC showed (I showed him a camera.)</p><p>However, when an argument represents the topic of the sentence (TOP), the topic marker wa is used as a postpositional particle, and case particles ga and wo do not appear explicitly. For example, since watashi (I) in Example (4)-b represents the topic of the sentence, the nominative case particle ga is replaced by the topic marker wa.</p><p>Similarly, an argument modified by its predicate does not accompany a postpositional case particle that represents the syntactic relation between the predicate and argument. For example, since cam- era in Example (5) is modified by the predicate miseta (showed), the accusative case particle wo does not appear explicitly.</p><p>(5) Watashi-ga kare-ni miseta camera.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I-NOM</head><p>him-DAT showed camera (A camera that I showed him.)</p><p>In addition, arguments are often omitted in Japanese when we can easily guess what the omit- ted argument is or we do not suppose a specific object. For example, the nominative argument is omitted in Example (4)-c, since we can easily guess the subject is the first person.</p><p>These characteristics make it difficult to auto- matically extract examples of word orders in dou- ble object construction from a corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Canonical argument order</head><p>There are three major claims as to the canonical ar- gument order of Japanese double object construc- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Koizumi and Tamaoka, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>One is the traditional analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Hoji (1985)</ref>, which argues that only the nominative, dative, ac- cusative (DAT-ACC) order like in Example (1)-a is canonical for all cases. The second claim, made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Matsuoka (2003)</ref>, argues that Japanese double object constructions have two canonical word or- ders, the DAT-ACC order and the ACC-DAT order, depending on the verb types. The third claim, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Miyagawa (1997)</ref>, asserts that both the DAT-ACC order and ACC-DAT order are canonical for all cases.</p><p>Note that, the definition of the term canonical word order varies from study to study. Some stud- ies presume that there is only one canonical word order for one construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Hoji, 1985)</ref>, while oth- ers presume that a canonical word order can be different for each verb or each tuple of a verb and its arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Matsuoka, 2003)</ref>. In addition, some studies presume that there can be multiple canonical word orders for one sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Miyagawa, 1997)</ref>. In this paper, we basically adopt the position that there is only one canonical word or- der for one tuple of a verb and its arguments but the canonical word orders can be different for dif- ferent tuples of a verb and its arguments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Other features related to word order</head><p>There are a number of known features that af- fect word order. For example, it is often said that long arguments tend to be placed far from the verb, whereas short arguments tend to be placed near the verb. The From-Old-to-New Principle ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kuno, 2006</ref>) is also well known; it argues that the unmarked word order of constituents is old, pre- dictable information first; and new, unpredictable information last. Note that these types of features are not specific to argument orders in Japanese double object constituents. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bresnan et al. (2007)</ref> reported the similar features were also observed in the English dative alternation and use- ful for predicting the dative alternation.</p><p>However, since we are interested in the canoni- cal word order, we do not want to take these fea- tures into account. In this work, we assume that these features can be ignored by using a very large corpus and analyzing the word order on the basis of statistical information acquired from the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Claims on the canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions</head><p>In this paper, we will address the following five claims on the canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions.</p><p>Claim A: The DAT-ACC order is canonical.</p><p>Claim B: There are two canonical word orders, the DAT-ACC and the ACC-DAT order, de- pending on the verb types.</p><p>Claim C: An argument whose grammatical case is infrequently omitted with a given verb tends to be placed near the verb.</p><p>Claim D: The canonical word order varies de- pending on the semantic role and animacy of the dative argument.</p><p>Claim E: An argument that frequently co-occurs with the verb tends to be placed near the verb.</p><p>Claim A <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Hoji, 1985)</ref> presumes that there is only one canonical word order for Japanese double object constructions regardless of the verb type. On the other hand, Claims B and C argue that the canonical word order varies depending on verb, but they still do not take into account the lexical information of the arguments. Thus, these claims can be verified by investigating the distribution of word orders for each verb.</p><p>With regard to Claim B, Matsuoka (2003) clas- sified causative-inchoative alternating verbs into two types: show-type and pass-type, and claimed the DAT-ACC order is the canonical order for show-type verbs, whereas the ACC-DAT order is the canonical order for pass-type verbs. The def- initions of each verb type are as follows. In the case of show-type verbs, the dative argument of a causative sentence is the subject of its correspond- ing inchoative sentence as shown in Example (6). On the other hand, in the case of pass-type verbs, the accusative argument is the subject of its corre- sponding inchoative sentence as shown in Exam- ple (7).</p><p>(6) Causative: Kare-ni camera-wo miseta.</p><p>him-DAT camera-ACC showed (φ I showed him a camera.)</p><p>Inchoative: Kare-ga mita.</p><p>he-NOM saw (He saw φ something .) (7) Causative: Camera-wo kare-ni watashita.</p><p>camera-ACC him-DAT passed (φ I passed him a camera.)</p><p>Inchoative: Camera-ga watatta.</p><p>camera-NOM passed (A camera passed to φ someone .) Claim C is based on our observation. It is based on the assumption that if an argument of a verb is important for interpreting the meaning of the verb, it tends to be placed near the verb and does not tend to be omitted.</p><p>Claims D and E take into account the lexi- cal information of arguments and assume that the canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions is affected by the characteristics of the dative and/or accusative arguments. With re- gard to <ref type="bibr">Claim D, Matsuoka (2003)</ref> asserted that the canonical order varies depending on the se- mantic role of the dative argument. Specifically, the DAT-ACC order is more preferred when the semantic role of dative argument is animate Pos- sessor than when the semantic role is inanimate Goal.</p><p>Claim E is based on our observation again, which argues that if the dative or accusative ar- gument frequently co-occurs with the verb, it has a strong relationship with the verb, and thus is placed nearby. A typical example that satisfies this claim is idiomatic expressions as will be discussed in Section 5.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Example collection</head><p>A corpus-based analysis of canonical word or- der can leverage a much larger number of exam- ples than approaches based on theoretical analysis, psychological experiments, or brain science can. However, automatically collected examples some- times include inappropriate ones. For example, if we extract all sequences of a verb and its preced- ing argument candidates, the sequence "Kagi-wo kare-ni iwareta" (φ I am told the key by him) is mistakenly extracted from Example (8), although kagi-wo is not actually an argument of iwareta but an argument of oita. As predicted, we can alleviate this problem by using a dependency parser. However, the accu- racy of the state-of-the-art Japanese dependency parser is not very high, specifically about 92% for news paper articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Yoshinaga and Kitsuregawa, 2014)</ref>, and thus, inappropriate examples would be extracted even if we used one.</p><p>Therefore, in this work, we decided to extract examples only from reliable parts of dependency parses. Specifically, we used a corpus consisting of more than 10 billion unique sentences extracted from the Web, selected parse trees that have no syntactic ambiguity, and then extracted examples only from the selected parse trees. This strat- egy basically follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002)</ref>'s strategy for automatic case frame con- struction. The detailed procedure of example col- lection is as follows:</p><p>1. Extract Japanese Web pages using linguistic information, split the Web pages into sen- tences using periods and HTML tags, and merge sentences that are the exactly same into one sentence to avoid collecting the same example several times, which might be ex- tracted from a mirror site. both the dative and accusative argu- ments out of all examples that include the target verb is larger than 5%.</p><p>We employ the syntactic analyzer KNP with op- tions "-dpnd-fast -tab -check." KNP with these options outputs all head candidates for each bun- setsu 6 on the basis of heuristic rules. We then ex- tract the example of a verb and its argument if the argument candidate have only one head candidate.</p><p>For example, since Japanese is a head-final lan- guage and only the verb bunsetsu can be the head of the most noun bunsetsu in Japanese, basho-ni in Example (8) has only one head candidate oita (put), whereas kagi-wo and kare-ni have two head candidates iwareta (told) and oita (put). Thus, we extract only the example "basho-ni oita" from Ex- ample <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. In addition, when an argument consists of a compound noun, we only extract the head noun and its postpositional particle as the argu- ment to avoid data sparsity.</p><p>Condition 3-(c) is set in order to extract only ditransitive verbs, which take both dative and ac- cusative arguments. Although the threshold of 5% seems small at first glance, most verbs that sat- isfy it are actually ditransitive. This is because ar- guments are often omitted in Japanese, and thus, only some of the examples explicitly include both dative and accusative arguments even in the case of ditransitive verb.</p><p>Out of a corpus consisting of more than 10 bil- lion unique sentences, 648 verbs satisfied these conditions. Hereafter, we will focus on these 648 verbs. The average number of occurrences of each verb was about 350 thousand and the av- erage number of extracted examples that include both dative and accusative arguments was about 59 thousand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Corpus-based analysis of canonical word order</head><p>Here, we present a corpus-based analysis of the canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions. We will address Claims A and C in Section 5.1, Claim B in Section 5.2, Claim D in Section 5.3, and Claim E in Section 5.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Word order for each verb</head><p>Let us examine the relation between the proportion of the DAT only example R DAT-only and the propor- tion of the ACC-DAT order R ACC-DAT for each of the 648 verbs to inspect Claims A and C.</p><p>R DAT-only is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R DAT-only = N DAT-only N DAT-only + N ACC-only ,</formula><p>where N DAT/ACC-only is the number of example types that only include the corresponding argu- ment out of the dative and accusative arguments. For example, we count the number of example types like Example (9) that include an accusative argument but do not include a dative argument to get the value of N ACC-only . Accordingly, the large R DAT-only value indicates that the dative argument is less frequently omitted than the accusative argu- ment.</p><p>(9) Gakuchô-ga gakui-wo juyo-shita.</p><p>president-NOM degree-ACC conferred (The president conferred a degree on φ someone .)</p><p>However, if we use all extracted examples that include only one of the dative and accusative argu- ments for calculating R DAT-only , the value is likely to suffer from a bias that the larger R ACC-DAT is, the larger R DAT-only becomes. This is because the arguments that tend to be placed near the verb have relatively few syntactic ambiguity. Since we ex- tract the examples from the reliable parts of parses that have no syntactic ambiguity, these arguments tend to be included in the extracted examples more frequently than the other arguments.</p><p>To avoid this bias, we use only these examples in which the nominative case is also extracted for calculating R DAT-only . This is based on the as- sumption that since Japanese word order is basi- cally subject-object-verb order, if the nominative argument is collected but one of the dative and accusative arguments is not collected, the argu- ment is actually omitted. Through a preliminary investigation on Kyoto University Text Corpus 7 , we confirmed the effect of this constraint to avoid the bias.</p><p>On the other hand, R ACC-DAT is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R ACC-DAT = N ACC-DAT N DAT-ACC + N ACC-DAT ,</formula><p>where N DAT-ACC/ACC-DAT is the number of ex- ample types that include both the dative and ac- cusative arguments in the corresponding order. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows the results. The left figure shows the relation between the proportion of the DAT Pearson's correlation coefficient between R DAT-only and R ACC-DAT is 0.391, which weakly supports Claim C: an argument whose grammati- cal case is infrequently omitted with a given verb tends to be placed near the verb. The proportion of the ACC-DAT order for all 648 verbs is 0.328. Thus, if we presume that there is only one canonical word order for Japanese double object constructions, this result suggests that the DAT-ACC order is the canonical one, as claimed by Hoji (Claim A). However, the right figure shows that the proportions of the ACC-DAT order differ from verb to verb. Moreover, the values of R ACC-DAT for 435 out of 648 verbs are between 0.2 and 0.8. From these observations, we can say the preferred word order cannot be determined even if the verb is given in most cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Word order and verb type</head><p>To inspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Matsuoka (2003)</ref>'s claim that the DAT-ACC order is canonical for show-type verbs, whereas the ACC-DAT order is canonical for pass- type verbs, we investigated the proportions of the ACC-DAT order for several pass-type and show- type verbs. In this investigation, we used 11 pass- type verbs and 22 show-type verbs that were used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Koizumi and Tamaoka (2004)</ref> in their psycho- logical experiments <ref type="bibr">8</ref> . <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the results. Although we can see that the macro average of R ACC-DAT of pass-type verbs is larger than that of show-type verbs, the difference is not significant 9 . Moreover, even in the case of pass-type verbs, the DAT-ACC order is dominant, which suggests Matsuoka (2003)'s claim is not true. Note that this conclusion is consistent with the experimental results reported by both <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Miyamoto and Takahashi (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Koizumi and Tamaoka (2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Relation between word order and semantic role of the dative argument</head><p>Next, let us examine the relation between the cate- gory of the dative argument and the word order to verify the effect of the semantic role of the dative argument. We selected eight categories in the JU- MAN dictionary 10 that appear more than 1 million times as dative arguments. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> shows the re- sults. We can see that there are differences in the Show-type <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Proportions of the ACC-DAT order for each pass-type verb and show-type verb.  proportions of the ACC-DAT order. In particular, when the dative argument's category is PLACE- FUNCTION such as shita (bottom) and yoko (side) or ANIMAL-PART such as te (hand) and mi (body), the ACC-DAT order is more preferred than other- wise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Pass-type verb RACC-DAT verb RACC-DAT verb RACC-DAT shiraseru (notify) 0.522 modosu (put back) 0.771 otosu (drop) 0.351 azukeru (deposit) 0.399 tomeru (lodge) 0.748 morasu (leak) 0.332 kotodukeru (leave a message) 0.386 tsutsumu (wrap) 0.603 ukaberu (float) 0.255 satosu (admonish) 0.325 tsutaeru (inform) 0.522 mukeru (direct) 0.251 miseru (show) 0.301 noseru (place on) 0.496 nokosu (leave) 0.238 kabuseru (cover) 0.256 todokeru (deliver) 0.491 umeru (bury) 0</formula><note type="other">.223 osieru (teach) 0.235 naraberu (range) 0.481 mazeru (blend) 0.200 sazukeru (give) 0.186 kaesu (give back) 0.448 ateru (hit) 0.185 abiseru (shower) 0.177 butsukeru (knock) 0.436 kakeru (hang) 0.108 kasu (lend) 0.118 tsukeru (attach) 0.368 kasaneru (pile) 0.084 kiseru (dress) 0.113 watasu (pass) 0.362 tateru (build) 0.069 Macro average 0.274 Macro average 0.365</note><p>As mentioned in Section 3, Matsuoka (2003) claimed the DAT-ACC order is more preferred when the semantic role of the dative argument is animate Possessor than when the semantic role is inanimate Goal. Thus, we thought the DAT-ACC order would be preferred when the dative argu- ment's category is PERSON, but we could not find such a trend. We think, however, this is due to that dative arguments of the PERSON category do not always have the semantic role of an animate Pos- sessor. Thus, we conducted a further investigation in an attempt to verify Matsuoka (2003)'s claim.</p><p>First, we collected examples that satisfied the following two conditions: the accusative argu- ment belongs to ARTIFACT-OTHER category, and the dative argument belongs to either PLACE- INSTITUTION or PERSON category. We call the former Type-A 11 , and the latter Type-B hereafter, and consider that the semantic role of the da- tive argument is inanimate Goal in most cases <ref type="bibr">11</ref> That is, the categories of the accusative and dative ar- guments of a Type-A example are ARTIFACT-OTHER and PLACE-INSTITUTION, respectively. of Type-A, whereas it is animate Possessor in most cases of Type-B. Example (10) shows typ- ical examples of Type-A and Type-B. Here, the categories of hon (book), gakkô (school), and sensei (teacher) are ARTIFACT-OTHER, PLACE- INSTITUTION, and PERSON, respectively, and the semantic roles of dative arguments are considered to be Goal in (10)-a and Possessor in (10)-b.</p><p>(10) a: Hon-wo gakkô-ni kaeshita.</p><p>book-ACC school-DAT returned (φ someone returned the book to school.) b: Sensei-ni hon-wo kaeshita.</p><p>teacher-DAT book-ACC returned (φ someone returned the book to the teacher.)</p><p>Next, we extracted verbs that had at least 100 examples of both types, calculated the proportion of the ACC-DAT order R ACC-DAT for each verb and type, and counted the number of verbs for which the values of R ACC-DAT were significantly different between Type-A and Type-B <ref type="bibr">12</ref> . Out of 126 verbs that have at least 100 examples for both types, 64 verbs show the trend that Type-A prefers the ACC-DAT order more than Type-B does, and only 30 verbs have the opposite trend. This fact sup- ports Matsuoka (2003)'s claim. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Relation between word order and degree of co-occurrence of verb and arguments</head><p>Now let us turn to the relation between the propor- tion of the ACC-DAT order R ACC-DAT and the de- gree of co-occurrence of a verb and its argument to verify Claim E. Here, we leverage the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) for measur- ing the degree of co-occurrence between a verb and its argument. NPMI is a normalized version of PMI. The value ranges between [-1,+1] and takes - 1 for never occurring together, 0 for independence, +1 for complete co-occurrence. The NPMI of a verb v and its argument n c (c ∈ {DAT,ACC}) is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">NPMI(n c , v) = PMI(n c , v) −log(p(n c , v)) ,</formula><p>where PMI(n c , v) = log p(n c , v) p(n c )p(v) .</p><p>We investigate the relation between the pro- portion of the ACC-DAT order R ACC-DAT and the difference of NPMI(n DAT , v) from NPMI(n ACC , v), i.e., NPMI(n DAT , v) − NPMI(n ACC , v). If Claim E is true, when the dative argument co-occurs with the verb frequently, the dative argument tends to be placed near the verb and thus the proportion of the ACC-DAT order would take a large value.</p><p>We investigated 2302 tuples of a verb and its dative and accusative arguments that appear more than 500 times in the corpus. The average num- ber of occurrences of each tuple was 1532. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the difference of NPMI and R ACC-DAT is 0.567, which supports Claim E: an argument that frequently co- occurs with the verb tends to be placed near the verb. Moreover, the values of R ACC-DAT are larger than 0.9 or smaller than 0.1 for 1631 out of 2302 tuples. This result indicates that if a tuple of a verb and its dative and accusative arguments is given, the preferred word order is determined. This is contrastive to the conclusion that the preferred word order cannot be determined even if the verb is given as discussed in Section 5.1.</p><p>One of the typical examples that satisfy Claim E is an idiomatic expression. Indeed, a verb and its argument that are used as an idiom co-occur frequently and are usually placed adjacent to each other. In addition, it is well known that if the ar- gument order is scrambled, the idiomatic meaning disappears ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Miyagawa and Tsujioka, 2004</ref>). Thus, we investigated to what extent idiomatic expres-sions affected the findings discussed above. For all 2302 tuples, we manually judged whether the verb and the adjacent argument are used as an id- iom in most cases. As a result, the verbs and their accusative arguments are judged as idiomatic for 404; the verbs and their dative arguments are judged as idiomatic for 84 out of 2302 tuples. We show these tuples by + and × in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, respec- tively. As predicted, the values of R ACC-DAT are smaller than 0.1 for all of the former examples, and larger than 0.9 for all of the latter examples. However, even if we ignore these idiomatic exam- ples, Pearson's correlation coefficient between the difference of NPMI and R ACC-DAT is 0.513, which is usually considered as moderate correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>This paper presented a corpus-based analysis of canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions. Our analysis suggests 1) the canon- ical word order of such constructions varies from verb to verb, 2) there is only a weak relation be- tween the canonical word order and the verb type: show-type and pass-type, 3) an argument whose grammatical case is infrequently omitted with a given verb tends to be placed near the verb, 4) the canonical word order varies depending on the se- mantic role of the dative argument, and 5) an argu- ment that frequently co-occurs with the verb tends to be placed near the verb.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 8 )</head><label>8</label><figDesc>Kagi-wo kare-ni iwareta basho-ni oita. key-ACC him-DAT told place-DAT put (φ I put the key on the place where he told φ me .)</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Note that in this work, we assume that there could be different canonical word orders for different double-object sentences as will be explained in Section 2.2.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> Since Japanese word order is basically subject-objectverb (SOV) and thus the canonical position of nominative argument is considered to be the first position, we simply call the nominative, dative, accusative order as the DAT-ACC order, and the nominative, accusative, dative order as the ACC-DAT order in this paper.</note>
