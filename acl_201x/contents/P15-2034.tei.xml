			<abstract>
				<p>With massively parallel corpora of hundreds or thousands of translations of the same text, it is possible to automatically perform typological studies of language structure using very large language samples. We investigate the domain of word order using multilingual word alignment and high-precision annotation transfer in a corpus with 1144 translations in 986 languages of the New Testament. Results are encouraging, with 86% to 96% agreement between our method and the manually created WALS database for a range of different word order features. Beyond reproducing the categorical data in WALS and extending it to hundreds of other languages, we also provide quantitative data for the relative frequencies of different word orders , and show the usefulness of this for language comparison. Our method has applications for basic research in linguistic typology, as well as for NLP tasks like transfer learning for dependency parsing , which has been shown to benefit from word order information.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Since the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Greenberg (1963)</ref>, word order features have played a central role in linguistic ty- pology research. There is a great deal of varia- tion across languages, and interesting interactions between different features which may hint at cog- nitive constraints in the processing of human lan- guage. A full theoretical discussion on word order typology is beyond the scope of this paper, but the interested reader is referred to e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dryer (2007)</ref> for an overview of the field.</p><p>This study uses multilingual word alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( ¨ Ostling, 2014</ref>) and high-precision annotation pro- jection of part-of-speech (PoS) tags and depen- dency parse trees to investigate five different word order properties in 986 different languages, through a corpus of New Testament translations. The results are validated through comparison to relevant chapters in the World Atlas on Language Structures, WALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013)</ref>, and we find a very high level of agreement be- tween this database and our method.</p><p>We identify two primary applications of this method. First, it provides a new tool for basic re- search in linguistic typology. Second, it has been shown that using these word order features leads to increased accuracy during dependency parsing model transfer <ref type="bibr">(Täckström et al., 2013</ref>). These benefits can now be extended to hundreds of more languages. The quantified word order characteris- tics computed for each of the 986 languages in the New Testament corpus, including about 600 not in the WALS samples for these features, are available for download. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Using parallel texts for linguistic typology has be- come increasingly popular recently, as massively parallel texts with hundreds or thousands of lan- guages have become easily accessible through the web ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cysouw and Wälchli, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dahl, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wälchli, 2014)</ref>. Specific applications include data-driven language classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mayer and Cysouw, 2012</ref>) and lexical typology <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Wälchli and Cysouw, 2012)</ref>. However, unlike our work, none of these authors developed automatic methods for studying syntactic properties like word order, nor did they utilize recent advances in the field of word alignment algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>The first step consists of using supervised systems for annotating the source texts with Universal PoS Tags ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Petrov et al., 2012</ref>) and dependency struc- ture in the Universal Dependency Treebank format . For PoS tagging, we use the Stanford Tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Toutanova et al., 2003)</ref> fol- lowed by a conversion step from the Penn Tree- bank tagset to the "universal" PoS tags using the tables published by Petrov et al. Next, we use the MaltParser dependency parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nivre et al., 2007</ref>) trained on the Universal Dependency Treebank us- ing MaltOptimizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The corpus is then aligned using the multilin- gual alignment tool of¨Ostlingof¨ of¨Ostling (2014). This model learns an "interlingua" representation of the text, in this case the New Testament, to which all trans- lations are then aligned independently. An inter- lingua sentence e is assumed to generate the cor- responding sentences f (l) for each of the L lan- guages through a set of alignment variables a (l) for each language. This can be seen as a multilin- gual extension of the IBM model 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown et al., 1993</ref>) with Dirichlet priors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mermer and Saraçlar, 2011)</ref>, where not only the alignment variables are hidden but also the source e. The probability of a sentence and its alignments (in L languages) under this model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (a (1...L) ,f (1...L) |e) = L l=1 J j=1 p t (f (l) j |e a (l) j ) · I i=1 p c (e i )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the translation distributions p t are assumed to have symmetric Dirichlet priors and the source token distribution p c a Chinese Restaurant Process prior. Given the parallel sentences f (1...L) , then a (1...L) and e are sampled using Gibbs sampling. The advantage of this method is that the multi- source transfer can be done once, to the interlin- gua representation, then transferred in a second step to all of the 986 languages investigated. It would be possible to instead perform 986 separate multi-source projection steps, but at the expense of having to perform a large number of bitext align- ments.</p><p>From the annotated source texts, PoS and de- pendency annotations are transferred to the inter- lingua representation. Since alignments are noisy and low recall is acceptable in this task, we use an aggressive filtering scheme: dependency links must be transferred from at least 80% of source texts in order to be included. For PoS tags, which are only used to double-check grammati- cal relations and should not impact precision neg- atively, the majority tag among aligned words is used. Apart from compensating for noisy align- ments and parsing errors, this method also helps to catch violations against the direct correspon- dence assumption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hwa et al., 2002</ref>) by filter- ing out instances where different source texts use different constructions, favoring the most proto- typical cases. Each word order feature is coded in terms of dependency relations, with additional constraints on the parts of speech that can be in- volved. For instance, when investigating the order between nouns and their modifying adjectives we look for an AMOD dependency relation between an ADJ-tagged and a NOUN-tagged word, and note the order between the adjective and the noun. This method rests on the assumption that translation equivalents have the same grammatical functions across translations, which is not always the case. For instance, if one language uses a passive con- struction where the source texts all use the active voice, we would obtain the wrong order between subject and object.</p><p>To summarize, our algorithm consists of the fol- lowing steps:</p><p>1. Compute an interlingua representation of the parallel text, as well as word alignments link- ing it to each of the translations.</p><p>2. Annotate a subset of translations with PoS tags and dependency structure.</p><p>3. Use multi-source annotation projection from this subset to the interlingua representation, including only dependency links where the same link is projected from at least 80% of the source translations.</p><p>4. Use single-source annotation projection from the interlingua representation to each of the 986 translations.</p><p>5. For each construction of interest, and for each language, count the frequency of each order- ing of its constituents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data and methodology</head><p>A corpus of web-crawled translations of the New Testament was used, comprising 1144 translations in 986 different languages. Of these, we used five English translations as source texts for annotation projection. Ideally more languages should be used as sources, but since we only had access to com- plete annotation pipelines for English and German we only considered these two languages, and pre- liminary experiments using some German transla- tions in addition to the English ones did not lead to significantly different results. A typologically more diverse set of source languages would help to identify those instances in the text which are most consistently translated across languages, in order to reduce the probability that peculiarities of the source language(s) will bias the results. In order to evaluate our method automatically, we used data from the WALS database <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013</ref>) which classifies languages ac- cording to a large number of features. Several fea- tures concern word order, and we focused on five of these (listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Only languages which are represented both in the New Testament cor- pus and the WALS data were used for the evalua- tion. In addition, we exclude languages for which WALS does not indicate a particular word order. This might be due to e.g. lacking adpositions alto- gether (which makes the adposition/noun order of that language undefined), or because no specific order is considered dominant.</p><p>The frequencies of all possible word orders for a feature are then counted, and for the purpose of evaluation the most common order is chosen as the algorithm's output. Although the relative frequen- cies of the different possible word orders are dis- carded for the sake of comparability with WALS, these frequencies are themselves an important re- sult of our work and tell a much richer story of the word order properties (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. Counting the number of instances (token fre- quency) of each word order is the most straight- forward way to estimate the relative proportions of each ordering, but the results are biased towards the behavior of the most frequent words, which often have idiosyncratic, non-productive features. Therefore, we also compute the corresponding statistics where each type is counted only once for each word order it participates in, disregarding its frequency. The type-based counts should better capture the behavior of productive patterns in the language. For the purpose of this study, we define the type of our relations as follows:</p><p>• adjective-noun: the form of the adjective</p><p>• adposition-noun: the forms of both adposi- tion and noun</p><p>• verb-(subject)-(object): the form of the verb For instance, given the following three sentences: "we see him," "I see her" and "them I see", we would increase the count by one for SVO order and for OVS order, because these are the orders in which the verb see has been observed to partici- pate.</p><p>In cases where there are multiple translations into a particular language, information is aggre- gated from all these translations into a single pro- file for the language. This is problematic in some cases, such as when a very long time separates two translations and word order characteristics have evolved, or simply due to different translators or source texts. However, since the typical case is a single translation per language, and WALS only contains one data point per language, we leave inter-language comparison to future research.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Hierarchical clustering based on word order statistics from our algorithm. Language families represented are (G)ermanic, (R)omance, (T)urkic, (P)olynesian and (S)initic. the relative numbers are quite similar within each pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results and Discussion</head><p>As a way of visualizing our data, we also tried performing hierarchical clustering of lan- guages, by normalizing the word order count vec- tors and treating them (together) as a single 14- dimensional vector. The result confirmed that lan- guages can be grouped remarkably well on basis of these five automatically extracted word order features. A subset of the clustering containing all languages from five language families repre- sented in the New Testament corpus can be found in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. While the clustering mostly follows traditional genealogical boundaries, it is perhaps more interesting to look at the cases where it does not. The most glaring case is the wide split be- tween the West Germanic and the North Germanic languages, which in spite of their shared ances- try have widely different word order characteris- tics. Interestingly, English is not grouped with the West Germanic languages, but rather with the North Germanic languages which it has been in close contact with. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> One can also note that the Sinitic languages, with respect to word order, are quite close to the North Germanic languages. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the agreement between the algo- rithm's output and the corresponding WALS chap- 2 One reviewer pointed us to the controversial claim of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Emonds (2011)</ref>, that modern English in fact is a North Ger- manic language, albeit with strong influence from the extinct West Germanic language of Old English.</p><p>ter for each feature. The level of agreement is high, even though the sample consists mainly of languages unrelated to English, from which the dependency structure and PoS annotations were transferred. The most common column gives the ratio of the most common ordering for each fea- ture (according to WALS), which can serve as a naive baseline.</p><p>As expected, the lowest level of agreement is observed for WALS chapter 81A, which has a lower baseline since it allows six permutations of the verb, subject and object, whereas all the other features are binary. In addition, this feature re- quires that two dependency relations (subject-verb and object-verb) have been correctly transferred, which substantially reduces the number of rela- tions available for comparison.</p><p>The fact that sources sometimes differ as to the basic word order of a given language makes it evident that the disagreement reported in Ta- ble 2 is not necessarily due to errors made by our algorithm. Another example of this can be found when looking at the order of adjective and noun in some Romance languages (Spanish, Cata- lan, Portuguese, French and Italian), which are all classified as having noun-adjective order <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dryer, 2013a)</ref>. It turns out that adjective-noun order in fact dominates in all of these languages, narrowly when using type counts and by a fairly large mar- gin when using token counts. This result was confirmed by manual inspection, which leads us <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Agreement between WALS and our results, on languages present in both datasets. The relative frequency of the most common ordering is given for comparison. Types is the agreement using type- based counts (see text for details), whereas Tokens uses token-based counts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature</head><p>Languages Portuguese. In all of these, noun-adjective or- der is dominant, which casts further doubts on our result. The key difference turns out to be the genre: whereas the modern texts used for the Uni- versal Dependency Treebank have mainly noun- adjective order, we used our supervised annota- tion pipeline to confirm that the French transla- tions of the New Testament indeed are dominated by adjective-noun order. This should serve as a warning about extrapolating too far from results obtained in one very specific genre, let alone in a single text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and future directions</head><p>The promising results from this study show that high-precision annotation transfer is a realistic way of exploring word order features in very large language samples, when a suitable parallel text is available. Although the WALS features on word order already use very large samples (over a thou- sand languages), using our method with the New Testament corpus contributes about 600 additional data points per feature, and adds quantitative data for all of the 986 languages contained in the cor- pus. There are many other structural properties of languages that could be investigated with high- precision annotation transfer in massively paral- lel corpora, not just regarding word order but also within in domains such as negation, comparison and tense/aspect systems. While there are lim- its to the quality and types of answers obtainable, our work demonstrates that for some problems it is possible to obtain quick, quantitative answers that</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>18</head><label>18</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Sinitic (Mandarin, Hakka)

On the technical side, the alignment model used is based on a non-symmetrized IBM model 1, and more elaborate methods for alignment and annotation projection could potentially lead to more accurate results. Preliminary results however indicate that adding a HMM-based word order model akin to Vogel et al. (1996) actually leads to somewhat reduced agreement with the WALS classification, because the projections become biased towards the word order characteristics of the source language(s), in our case English. This indicates that using the less accurate but also less biased IBM model 1 is in fact an advantage, when aggressive high-precision filtering is used.</note>
