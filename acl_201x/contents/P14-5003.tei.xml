				<p>We present two recently released open-source taggers: NameTag is a free software for named entity recognition (NER) which achieves state-of-the-art performance on Czech; MorphoDiTa (Morpho-logical Dictionary and Tagger) performs morphological analysis (with lemmatiza-tion), morphological generation, tagging and tokenization with state-of-the-art results for Czech and a throughput around 10-200K words per second. The taggers can be trained for any language for which annotated data exist, but they are specifically designed to be efficient for inflective languages, Both tools are free software under LGPL license and are distributed along with trained linguistic models which are free for non-commercial use under the CC BY-NC-SA license. The releases include standalone tools, C++ libraries with Java, Python and Perl bindings and web services.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition are one of the most important components of computational linguistic applications. They usually represent initial steps of language processing. It is no wonder then that they have received a great deal of attention in the computational linguistics community and in some respect, these tasks can even be considered very close to being "solved".</p><p>However, despite the fact that there is a consid- erable number of POS taggers available for En- glish and other languages with a large number of active users, we lacked a POS tagger and NE rec- ognizer which would</p><p>• be well suited and trainable for languages with very rich morphology and thus a large tagset of possibly several thousand plausible combinations of morphologically related at- tribute values,</p><p>• provide excellent, preferably state-of-the-art results for Czech,</p><p>• be distributed along with trained linguistic models for Czech,</p><p>• allow the user to train custom models for any language,</p><p>• be extremely efficient in terms of RAM and disc usage to be used commercially,</p><p>• offer a full end-to-end solution for users with little computational linguistics background,</p><p>• be distributed as a library without additional dependencies,</p><p>• offer API in many programming languages,</p><p>• be open-source, free software. Following these requirements, we have devel- oped a morphological dictionary and tagger soft- ware, which is described and evaluated in Sec- tion 3; and a named entity recognizer, which is de- scribed and evaluated in Section 4. The software performance and resource usage are described in Section 5 and the release and licensing condition information is given in Section 6. We conclude the paper in Section 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">POS Tagging</head><p>In English, the task of POS tagging has been in the center of computational linguists' attention for decades ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kucera and Francis, 1967)</ref>, with renewed interest after significant improvements achieved by <ref type="bibr">(Collins, 2002</ref>). The recent state-of-the-art for English POS supervised tagging without external data for training is by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Shen et al., 2007</ref>) and there are many available taggers, such as well-known Brill tagger <ref type="bibr">(Brill, 1992)</ref>, TnT tagger <ref type="bibr">(Brants, 2000</ref>) and many others.</p><p>In Czech, the POS tagging research has been carried out mostly by Czech speaking linguistic community and the current state-of-the-art was re- ported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Spoustová et al., 2009</ref>) in Morče re- search project <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Based on this project, two taggers were released: Morče tagger (released as part of COMPOST 2 containing morphological analyzer, tagger and trained models, available to registered users only) and Featurama 3 (source code only, no trained models publicly available).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Named Entity Recognition</head><p>For English, many NE datasets and shared tasks exist, e.g. <ref type="bibr">CoNLL-2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">De Meulder, 2003</ref>), MUC7 <ref type="bibr">(Chinchor, 1998)</ref>. These shared tasks and the associated freely avail- able NE annotated corpora allowed wide and suc- cessful research in NE recognition in English. For example, the systems which published high scores on the CoNLL-2003 task include <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ando and Zhang, 2005</ref>) and to our knowledge, the best currently known results on this dataset were published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009)</ref>. One should also mention a well-known and widely used Stanford parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>In Czech, the referential corpus for NE recog- nition is called the Czech Named Entity Corpus 4 <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Sevčíková et al., 2007</ref>) and we describe its' prop- erties further in Section 4.2. The development of the Czech NE recognition research is easy to fol- low: started by a pilot project by <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Sevčíková et al., 2007)</ref>, the results were improved by (Kravalová andŽabokrtsk´yandˇandŽabokrtsk´andŽabokrtsk´y, 2009), ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Konkol and Konopík, 2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Konkol and Konopík, 2013)</ref>. The cur- rent state-of-the-art results for CNEC are reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Straková et al., 2013)</ref>. So far, there was no freely available Czech NE recognizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MorphoDiTa: Morphological</head><p>Dictionary and Tagger</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Morphological Dictionary Methodology</head><p>The morphological dictionary is specially de- signed for inflective languages with large number of suffixes (endings) and we propose an effective method for handling rich morphology. In inflective languages, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> words take endings (suffixes) to mark linguistic cases, grammatical number, gender etc. Therefore, many forms may be related to one lemma. For example, the lemma "zelen´yzelen´y" ("green" in Czech) can appear as "ze- len´ylen´y", "zelenější", "zelenému" etc. -there are several tens of forms for this type of adjective. Corpus-wise, there are 168K unique forms and 72K lemmas in a corpus of 2M words (Prague De- pendency Treebank 2. <ref type="bibr">5 (Bejček et al., 2012)</ref>) in Czech. It is therefore crucial to handle the end- ings effectively and to reduce the processing costs where regularities are found. Given a resource with forms, lemmas and tags, 6 MorphoDiTa estimates regular patterns based on common form endings and automatically clusters them into morphological "templates" without linguistic knowledge about the language. We now describe the method for template set creation.</p><p>During template set creation, MorphoDiTa takes lemmas one by one. For each lemma, it collects all corresponding forms and builds a trie <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(De La Briandais, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Knuth, 1997)</ref>. Trie is a tree structure in which one character corresponds to a node and all descendants of a node share the same prefix. The procedure then finds a suitable common ancestor in the trie (common prefix or stem). The heuristics is "such a node whose sub- tree has depth at most N and at the same time has the maximal number of ancestors with one child". Intuitively, this means we want to select a long prefix (stem) -hence "maximal number of ances- tors" but at the same time, the linguistic endings are not too long (at most N ). Having selected a common prefix, all the endings (including their corresponding tags) in its subtree define a tem- plate. A rich trie with many subtrees may be split into multiple templates. For example, a simple trie for noun "hrad" ("castle" in Czech) with one tem- plate, and also two lemmas sharing two templates are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. When processing the next lemma and its corresponding forms, either new template is created, or the templates are reused if the set of endings is the same. Larger N leads to longer endings and larger number of classes, and smaller N leads to short endings and less classes. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Sometimes, the word "inflective" is used also for agglutina- tive languages such as Turkish, Hungarian or Finnish; we be- lieve our tools are suitable for these, too, but we have not tested them on this group yet. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In Czech, the resource used was Morfflex CZ by Jan Hajič: http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morfflex. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Our morphological dictionary representation cannot be replaced with a minimized finite state automaton with marked The number of templates determines the effi- ciency of dictionary encoding. When too few tem- plates are used, many are needed to represent a lemma. When too many are used, the representa- tion of the templates themselves is large.</p><p>The morphological dictionary is then saved in binary form and the software offers a higher level access: given a form, morphological analysis lists all possible lemma-tag pairs; given a lemma-tag pair, MorphoDiTa generates the respective form. The analysis function is then used in tagging, which we describe in the next section.</p><p>The heuristics described above does not require linguistic knowledge about the language and han- dles linguistic regularities very well. The major advantage is a significant data compression lead- ing to efficient resource usage: in our setting, the original morphology dictionary, the Czech Morf- flex, contains 120M form-tag pairs derived from 1M unique lemmas, using 3 922 different tags, of total size 6.7GB. 8 Using the proposed heuristics with N = 8, there are 7 080 templates created, such that the whole dictionary is encoded using 3M template instances. The resulting binary form of the dictionary uses 2MB, which is 3 000 times smaller than the original dictionary.</p><p>In order to look up a word form in the dictio- nary, we split it into a prefix and an ending for all ending lengths from 1 to N . We then find templates associated with both the prefix and the ending. For each such template, we return the lemma corresponding to the prefix and the tag cor- responding to the ending. The result is a set of lemma-tag pairs found during this procedure. This algorithm can be implemented efficiently -our implementation performs 500k word form lookups per second in the Czech morphological dictionary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">POS Tagger Methodology</head><p>The POS tagger is an offspring of Morče and Fea- turama research projects based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Spoustová et al., 2009</ref>). For each form in the text, the mor- phological dictionary suggests all possible lemma- tag candidates and these lemma-tag pairs are dis- ambiguated by the tagger. The tagger is imple- mented as supervised, rich feature averaged per- ceptron <ref type="bibr">(Collins, 2002</ref>) and the classification fea- tures are adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Spoustová et al., 2009</ref>). lemmas, because the process of minimization cannot capture templates containing word forms (or their prefixes) of multi- ple lemmas.</p><p>8 Which compresses to 454MB using gzip -9.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Marcus et al., 1993</ref>). In both cases, the system was tuned on the development set (Sections 19-21 in PTB/WSJ in English) and tested on the testing section (Sections 22-24 in PTB/WSJ in English).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">POS Tagger Evaluation</head><p>An evaluation of POS taggers, which do not use external data, is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> for Czech and in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> for English. MorphoDiTa reaches state-of- the-art results for Czech and nearly state-of-the- art results for English. The results are very simi- lar for the three Czech systems, Morče, Featurama and MorphoDiTa, because in all three cases, they are implementations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Spoustová et al., 2009)</ref>. However, MorphoDiTa is the first end-to-end ap- plication released under a free license.</p><p>Due to rich morphosyntactic complexity of the Czech language and the positional tagging scheme proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hajič, 2004</ref>), there are 3 922 plausi- ble tags in Czech (although only 1 571 unique tags actually appear in training data).</p><p>However, in many applications, only the first two tagging positions, which correspond to POS and sub-POS, <ref type="bibr">9</ref> are actually needed for further pro- cessing, which greatly reduces the complexity of the task, leaving only 67 possible tags (64 in train- ing data), although some morphological informa- tion, such as case, is lost.   An example of a full 15-position tag and the re- stricted 2-position tag for an adjective "zelen´yzelen´y" is "AAIS1----1A----" and "AA", respectively. The first two positions are in fact quite similar to what the Penn-style tags encode (for English). MorphoDiTa therefore also offers models trained on such a restricted tagging scheme. The tag- ger evaluation for the 2-position, restricted tags is given in the last row of Table 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">NameTag: Named Entity Recognizer</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">NER Methodology</head><p>The NE recognizer is an implementation of a re- search project by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Straková et al., 2013</ref>). The rec- ognizer is based on a Maximum Entropy Markov Model. First, maximum entropy model predicts, for each word in a sentence, the full probabil- ity distribution of its classes and positions with respect to an entity. Consequently, a global op- timization via dynamic programming determines the optimal combination of classes and named en- tities chunks (lengths). The classification features utilize morphological analysis, two-stage predic- tion, word clustering and gazetteers and are de- scribed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Straková et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The recognizer is available either as a run-time implementation with trained linguistic models for Czech, or as a package which allows custom mod- els to be trained using any NE-annotated data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Czech Named Entity Corpus</head><p>For training the recognizer, Czech Named Entity Corpus <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Sevčíková et al., 2007</ref>) was used. In this corpus, Czech entities are classified into a two- level hierarchy classification: a fine-grained set of 42 classes or a more coarse classification of 7 System F-measure F-measure (42 classes) (7 classes) <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Sevčíková et al., 2007)</ref> 62.00 68.00 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kravalová et al., 2009)</ref> 68.00 71.00 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Konkol and Konopík, 2013)</ref> NA 79.00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Straková et al., 2013)</ref> 79   super-classes. Like other authors, we report the evaluation on both hierarchy levels. Czech Named Entity Corpus annotation allows ambiguous labels, that is, one entity can be labeled with two classes; however, NameTag predicts ex- actly one label per named entity, just like the pre- vious work does <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Straková et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, CNEC also allows embedded entities, which is also somewhat problematic. NameTag always predicts only the outer-most en- tity (the embedding entity), although it is penal- ized by the evaluation score which includes cor- rect prediction of the nested entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">NER Evaluation</head><p>For comparison with previous work, we report re- sults for the first version of the Czech Named En- tity Corpus (CNEC 1.1). The linguistic models released with NameTag are trained on the most current version of the Czech Named Entity Cor- pus (CNEC 2.0), which has been recently released. We report our results for both CNEC 1.1 and CNEC 2.0 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Software Performance</head><p>We designed MorphoDiTa and NameTag as light- weight, efficient software with low resource usage.</p><p>Depending on the morphosyntactic complexity of the language and the selected tagging scheme, the MorphoDiTa tagger has a throughput around 10-200K words per second on 2.9GHz Pentium computer with 4GB RAM. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows the sys- tem word throughput, allocated RAM and model size on such a machine for NameTag and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> shows these parameters for MorphoDiTa.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We released two efficient, light-weight POS-and NE taggers (especially efficient for inflective lan- guages), which are available to a wide audience as an open-source, free software with rich API and also as an end-to-end application. The tag- gers reach state-of-the-art results for Czech and are distributed with the models. We are currently working on more language releases (Slovak, Pol- ish and Arabic). We are also aware that the cre- ation of the dictionary relies on the existence of a resource annotated with forms, lemmas and tags, which may not be readily available. Therefore, our future work includes developing a guesser for analyzing previously unseen but valid word forms in inflective languages, using only data annotated with disambiguated POS tags. We hope the release for Czech will prove useful for broad audience, for example for shared tasks which include Czech lan- guage data. <ref type="bibr">Martin Kay and Christian Boitet, editors, Proceedings</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A simple trie for noun "hrad" (castle in Czech), and two lemmas sharing templates.</figDesc></figure>
