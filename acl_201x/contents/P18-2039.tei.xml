				<p>In this work, we discuss the importance of external knowledge for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER). We present a novel modular framework that divides the knowledge into four categories according to the depth of knowledge they convey. Each category consists of a set of features automatically generated from different information sources, such as a knowledge-base, a list of names, or document-specific semantic annotations. Further, we show the effects on performance when incre-mentally adding deeper knowledge and discuss effectiveness/efficiency trade-offs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of detecting named entity mentions in text and as- signing them to their corresponding type. It is a crucial component in a wide range of natural lan- guage understanding tasks, such as named entity disambiguation (NED), question answering, etc.</p><p>Previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009</ref>) ar- gued that NER is a knowledge-intensive task and used prior knowledge with outstanding results. In this work, we attempt to quantify to which extent external knowledge influences NER performance. Even though recent approaches have excelled in end-to-end neural methods, this paper aims to give transparency and user-comprehensible ex- plainability. This is especially significant for in- dustrial sectors (e.g., those heavily regulated) that require the use of transparent methods for which a particular decision is explainable.</p><p>We perform the study by devising a simple modular framework to exploit different sources of external knowledge. We divide the information sources into four different categories according to the depth of knowledge they convey, each one car- rying more information than the previous. Each category is composed of a set of features that re- flect the degree of knowledge contained in each source. Then, we feed a linear chain CRF, a trans- parent, widely used method used for NER.</p><p>We perform our experiments on two standard datasets by testing various combinations of knowl- edge categories. Our results indicate that the amount of knowledge is highly correlated with NER performance. The configurations with more external knowledge systematically outperform the more agnostic ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Knowledge Augmented NER</head><p>In the following section, we describe the four knowledge categories in detail. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gives an overview of the features on the categories that use external knowledge. The features were used to train a linear chain CRF, a simple and explain- able method, proven to work well for NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Finkel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jun'ichi and Torisawa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Passos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Radford et al., 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Knowledge Agnostic (A)</head><p>This category contains the "local" features, which can be extracted directly from text without any ex- ternal knowledge. They are mostly of a lexical, syntactic or linguistic nature and have been well- studied in literature. We implement most of the features described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>):</p><p>(1) The current word and words in a window of size 2; (2) Word shapes of the current word and words in a window of size 2; (3) POS tags in a window of size 2; (4) Prefixes (length three and four) and Suffixes (length one to four); (5) Pres- ence of the current word in a window of size 4; (6)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cat. Feature Description Example</head><p>Name Mention tokens Some tokens are strongly associated to NEs county,john,school,station,. . . Beginning of sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POS-tag Multi-word NEs tend to share POS patterns Organization of American States</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Name-Based Knowledge (Name)</head><p>Here, the knowledge is extracted from a list of named entity names. These features attempt to identify patterns in names and exploit the fact that the set of distinct names is limited. We ex- tracted a total of more than 20 million names from YAGO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Suchanek et al., 2007)</ref> and derived the fol- lowing features: Frequent mention tokens. Reflects the fre- quency of a given token in a list of entity names. We tokenized the list and computed frequencies. The feature assigns a weight to each token in the text corresponding to their normalized frequency. High weights should be assigned to tokens that in- dicate named entities. For instance, the top-5 to- kens we found in English were "county", "john", "school", "station" and "district". All tokens with- out occurrences are assigned 0 weight.</p><p>Frequent POS Tag Sequences. Intends to iden- tify POS sequences common to named entities. For example, person names tend to be described as a series of proper nouns, while organizations may have richer patterns. Both "Organization of American States" and "Union for Ethical Bio- trade" share the pattern NNP-IN-NNP-NNP. We ranked the name POS tag sequences and kept the top 100. The feature is implemented by finding the longest matching sequences in the input text and marking whether the current token belongs to a frequent sequence or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Knowledge-Base-Based Knowledge (KB)</head><p>This category groups features extracted from a KB or an entity annotated corpus. They encode knowl- edge about named entities themselves or their us- ages. We implemented three features:</p><p>Type-infused Gazetteer Match. Finds the longest occurring token sequence in a type- specific gazetteer. It adds a binary indicator to each token, depending on whether the token is part of a sequence. We use 30 dictionaries dis- tributed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009</ref>) containing type-name information for English. These dictio- naries can also be created automatically by map- ping each dictionary to a set of KB types and ex- tracting the corresponding names. This automatic generation is useful in multilingual settings, which we discuss in Section 3.5.</p><p>Wikipedia Link Probability. This feature mea- sures the likelihood of a token being linked to a named entity Wikipedia page. The intuition is that tokens linked to named entity pages tend to be in- dicative of named entities. For instance, the to- ken "Obama" is usually linked while "box" is not. The list of pages referring to named entities is ex- tracted from YAGO. Given a token in the text, it is assigned the probability of being linked according to Eq. 1, where link d (t) equals 1, if token t in doc- ument d is linked to another Wikipedia document. present d equals 1 if t occurs in d.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P W iki (t) = P d2D link d (t) P d2D present d (t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Type Probability. Encodes the likelihood of a token belonging to a given type. It captures the idea that, for instance, the token "Obama" is more likely a person than a location. Given a set of enti- ties E in YAGO with mentions M e and tokens T em we calculate the probability of a class c 2 C given a token t as in Eq. 2, where c(e) = 1 if entity e belongs to class c and c(e) = 0 otherwise. For each token in the text, we create one feature per type with the respective probability as its value.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (c|t) = P E e P Me me P Tem tem c(e) P E e P Me me P Tem tem P C c i c i (e)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Token Type Position. Reflects that tokens may appear in different positions according to the en- tity type. For instance, "Supreme Court of the United States", is an organization and "United" occurs at the end. In "United States", a location, it occurs at the beginning. This helps with nested named entities. This is implemented using the BILOU (Begin, Inside, Last, Outside, Unit) encoding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ratinov and Roth, 2009)</ref>, which tags each token with re- spect to the position in which it occurs. The num- ber of features depends on the number of types in the dataset (4 BILU positions times n classes + O position). For each token, each feature receives the probability of a class given the token and po- sition. The class probabilities are calculated as in Equation 2, incorporating also the token position.</p><p>As a result, for each token we now have a proba- bility distribution over 4n + 1 classes. Take for in- stance the token "Obama". We would expect it to have high probability for classes "B-Person" (i.e., last name in combination with first name) and "U- Person" (i.e., last name without first name). The probabilities for all other classes would be close to zero. In comparison, the word "box" should have high probability for class "O" and close to zero for all others, since we would not expect it to occur in many named entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Entity-Based Knowledge (Entity)</head><p>This category encodes document-specific knowl- edge about the entities found in text to exploit the association between NER and NED. Previous work showed that the flow of information between these generates significant performance improve- ments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Radford et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Luo et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Comparatively, this module needs significantly more computational resources. It requires a first run of NED to generate document specific fea- tures, based on the disambiguated named entities. These features are used in a second run of NER.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Radford et al., 2015)</ref>, after the first run of NED, we create a set of document-specific gazetteers derived from the disambiguated enti- ties. This information helps in the second round to find new named entities that were previously missed. Take the sentence "Some citizens of the European Union working in the United Kingdom do not meet visa requirements for non-EU work- ers after the uk leaves the bloc". We can imagine that in the first round of NED European Union and United Kingdom can be easily identified but "EU" or the wrongly capitalized "uk" might be missed. After the disambiguation, we know that both enti- ties are organizations and have the aliases EU and UK respectively. Then, in a second round it may be easier to spot mentions "EU" and "uk".</p><p>After a first run of NER+NED, we extract all surface forms of the identified entities from YAGO. These are tokenized and assigned the type of the corresponding entity plus its BILOU po- sition. For example, the surface form "Barack Obama" results in "Barack" and "Obama", as- signed to "B-Person" and "L-Person". There are 17 binary features (BILU tags multiplied by four coarse-grained types + O tag), which fire when a token is part of a list that contains the mappings from tokens to type-BILOU pairs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>System Setup. To perform our study we use a lin- ear chain CRF( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>). CRFs are transparent and widely used for NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Finkel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jun'ichi and Torisawa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Passos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Radford et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Luo et al., 2015</ref>). The entity-based com- ponent was implemented using the AIDA (Hoffart et al., 2011) entity disambiguation system.</p><p>Datasets. We evaluate on two standard NER datasets CoNLL2003. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sang and Meulder, 2003)</ref>, a collection of English newswires covering enti- ties with four types (PER, ORG, LOC, MISC) and MUC-7, a set of New York Times articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chinchor and Robinson, 1997</ref>) with annotations on three types of entities (PER, ORG, LOC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Incremental knowledge</head><p>Here we analyze the impact of incrementally adding external knowledge. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a</ref> shows four variants. Each contains the features correspond- ing to a given category plus all those from the lighter categories to the left. In all cases adding knowledge boosts F 1 performance. The effect is particularly strong for MUC-7-test which regis- tered an overall increment of almost 10 points. In both datasets, the biggest boost is registered when the KB-based features are added. As a reference point, one of the best systems to date (Chiu and Nichols, 2016) (neural-based) achieves F 1 91.62 on CoNLL2013-test, while our full-knowledge CRF reaches F 1 91.12. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref> shows the performance for each entity type on CoNLL2003. Again, there is a boost in all cases, especially organizations. Persons also im- prove significantly: At first they perform similar to  locations, but the successive increment is sharper. F 1 for persons achieves F 1 96.03 and locations F 1 92.13. The positive effect is quite significant for organizations (F 1 80.86 to F 1 89.32), while it is moderate for miscellaneous. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1d</ref> shows results by type for MUC-7-test. The positive effect is par- ticularly strong for persons, improving more than 15 F 1 points (78.70 to 94.28). Interestingly, lo- cations register a slight decline between KB and Entity (0.56 F 1 points). Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b</ref> shows the performance over span detection, which is the span where the named entity occurs without taking type information into account. This is especially important for appli- cations such as named entity disambiguation. It drops slightly for the name-based category, but it increases again as more knowledge is added. The effect is similar on both datasets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows different combinations of knowl- edge categories. The relatively small improvement from KB to Entity suggests that KB features are subsumed by the later. This is somehow expected as the entity specific information is extracted from the same KB and both rely on entity types. How- ever, as we will see, this comes at a cost.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Categories</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Timing</head><p>The Entity-based component is by far the most expensive concerning timing performance. We measure 314ms, 494ms, 693ms, and 4139ms for A, Name, KB and Entity based features, respec- tively ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Since KB-based features are comparable in performance to the Entity-based features, but the latter are much more expensive, these findings allow practitioners to carefully de- cide whether the additional computational cost is worth the relatively small performance improve- ments. The modularity of our feature classes al- lows for optimal tuning of a system regarding ef- fectiveness/efficiency trade-offs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Multilingualism</head><p>In order to demonstrate the general applicability of our approach, we implement our NER system for two additional languages, namely German and Spanish. All features for the Name, KB and Entity knowledge classes are derived from the respective language's Wikipedia. Performance is evaluated on CoNLL2003g ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sang and Meulder, 2003</ref>) for German and CoNLL2002 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Tjong Kim Sang, 2002</ref>) for Spanish. Results can be found in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Similar to the performance on English data, we can see that adding more external knowledge im- proves performance. For reference, we found that performance is close to the state-of-the art in both languages. Our system lags only 1.56 F 1 points on ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lample et al., 2016</ref>) in German and 1.98 F 1 points on ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Yang et al., 2016</ref>) in Spanish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>NER is a widely studied problem. Most of previ- ous work rely on the use of CRFs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Finkel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jun'ichi and Torisawa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Passos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Radford et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Luo et al., 2015</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: NER F 1 for German on CoNLL2003g dataset and Spanish on CoNLL2002 dataset. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gillick et al., 2016)</ref>. While this constitutes a big step forward, certain applications (e.g., in heavily regulated sectors) require a degree of explainabil- ity that neural approaches cannot yet provide. Previous work has already regarded NER as a knowledge intensive task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Florian et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhang and Johnson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jun'ichi and Torisawa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lin and Wu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Passos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Radford et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Luo et al., 2015</ref>). Most of these works incorporate background knowledge in the form of entity-type gazetteers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Florian et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhang and Johnson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jun'ichi and Torisawa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Passos et al., 2014</ref>). Others, used external knowledge by exploiting the association between NER and NED ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Durrett and Klein, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Radford et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Luo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>. In this study, we attempt to bring more light on the issue by quantifying the effect of different degrees of external knowledge. Our modular framework allows to test this intuition via novel feature sets that reflect the degree of knowl- edge contained in available knowledge sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We investigated the importance of external knowl- edge for performing Named Entity Recognition by defining four feature categories, each of which conveys a different amount of knowledge. In addi- tion to commonly used features in existing litera- ture, we defined four novel features that we incor- porated into our category scheme. We experimen- tally showed that although more external knowl- edge leads to performance improvements, it comes at a considerable performance trade-off.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Evaluation results by type CoNLL2003-test and MUC-7-test.</figDesc></figure>
