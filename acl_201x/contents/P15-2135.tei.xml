				<p>In the last few years, there has been a growing number of studies addressing the Text Simplification (TS) task as a mono-lingual machine translation (MT) problem which translates from &apos;original&apos; to &apos;sim-ple&apos; language. Motivated by those results , we investigate the influence of quality vs quantity of the training data on the effectiveness of such a MT approach to text simplification. We conduct 40 experiments on the aligned sentences from English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia, controlling for: (1) the similarity between the original and simplified sentences in the training and development datasets, and (2) the sizes of those datasets. The results suggest that in the standard PB-SMT approach to text simplification the quality of the datasets has a greater impact on the system performance. Additionally, we point out several important differences between cross-lingual MT and monolingual MT used in text simplification , and show that BLEU is not a good measure of system performance in text simplification task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the last few years, a growing number of studies have addressed the text simplification (TS) task as a monolingual machine translation (MT) problem of translating sentences from 'original' to 'sim- ple' language. Several studies reported promising results using standard phrase-based statistical ma- chine translation (PB-SMT) for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Specia, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Coster and Kauchak, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Wubben et al., 2012</ref>), but made no attempt to explain the reasons behind the success of their systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Specia (2010)</ref> obtained reasonably good results (BLEU = 60.75) despite the small size of the datasets used (4,483 original sentences and their corresponding simpli- fications). Her results indicated that in this spe- cific monolingual MT task, we do not need such large datasets (as in cross-lingual MT) in order to achieve good results.</p><p>At the moment, the scarcity and very limited sizes of the available TS datasets (usually only up to 1,000 sentence pairs) are the main factors which impede the use of data-driven approaches to text simplification for all languages except English (for which English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia offer a large comparable TS dataset). Therefore, in this paper, we decided to investigate several important issues in MT-based text simpli- fication:</p><p>1. The impact of the size of the training and de- velopment datasets;</p><p>2. The impact of the similarity between the orig- inal and simplified sentences in the training and development datasets; and 3. The suitability of using the BLEU score for the automatic evaluation of system's perfor- mance.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies which address those important questions. In order to explore the first two issues, we con- duct 40 translation experiments using the aligned sentence pairs from the largest existing TS cor- pus (Wikipedia TS corpus), controlling the train- ing and development datasets for: (1) sentence similarity (in terms of the S-BLEU score), and (2) size. Our results indicate that only the former can influence the MT output significantly. In order to explore the last issue, we test our models on two different test sets and perform human evaluation of the output of several systems.</p><p>823 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Specia (2010)</ref> used the standard PB-SMT model provided by the Moses toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koehn et al., 2007)</ref> to translate from 'original' to 'simple' sentences in Brazilian Portuguese. The dataset contained manual simplifications aimed at people with low literacy levels. The most commonly used sim- plifications (by human editors) were lexical sub- stitutions and splitting sentences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gasperin et al., 2009)</ref>. In terms of the automatic BLEU evalua- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>), the results were rea- sonably good (BLEU = 60.75) despite the small size of the corpora (4,483 original sentences and their corresponding simplifications). However, the TS system was overcautious in performing simpli- fications, i.e. the simplifications produced by the systems were closer to the source than to the ref- erence segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Specia, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Coster and Kauchak (2011a) used the same approach for English. Additionally, they ex- tended the PB-SMT system by adding phrasal deletion to the probabilistic translation model in order to better cover deletion, which is a frequent phenomenon in TS. The system was trained on 124,000 aligned sentences from En- glish Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia. The analysis of the Wikipedia TS corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Coster and Kauchak, 2011b)</ref> reported that rewordings (1-1 lexical substitutions) are the most common simplification operation (65%). The system with added phrasal deletion achieved the BLEU score of 60.46, while the the standard model with- out phrasal deletion achieved the BLEU score of 59.87. However, the baseline (BLEU score when the system does not perform any simplifica- tion on the original sentence) was 59.37, indicat- ing that the systems often leave the original sen- tences unchanged. In order to address that prob- lem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Wubben et al. (2012)</ref> performed post-hoc re- ranking on the Moses' output (simplification hy- potheses) based on their dissimilarity to the input (original sentences), while at the same time con- trolling for its adequacy and fluency. ˇ Stajner (2014) applied the same PB-SMT model to two different TS corpora in Spanish, which con- tained different levels of simplification. The re- sults, which should be regarded only as prelim- inary as both corpora have fewer than 1,000 sen- tence pairs, imply that the level of simplification in the training datasets has a greater impact than the size of the datasets on the system's performance.</p></div>

With each of the eight sets, we train five translation models, vary- ing the number of sentences used for training and tuning (2,000, 4,000, 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 for training and 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 for tuning, respectively). That leads to a total of 40 translation models varying by number of sentence pairs and similarity between original and simpli- fied sentences (in terms of the S-BLEU score) in the datasets used for their training and tuning. Several examples of sentence pairs with various S-BLEU scores are presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>

As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>, none of the 40 experiments have even reached that baseline. We compare S- BLEU scores for each pair of experiments (240 reference sentences in the test set and their corre- sponding automatically simplified sentences) us- ing the paired t-test in SPSS in order to check whether the differences in the obtained results are significant. The only results that are significantly lower than the rest are those obtained for the ex- periments in which the training and development datasets consist only of the sentence pairs with S- BLEU scores between 0 and 0.3. The results sug- The rows represent intervals of the S-BLEU scores on the training and development datasets, while the columns repre- sent the number of the sentence pairs used for training.

There are no statistically sig- nificant differences (measured by the paired t-test on S-BLEU scores on all 601 reference sentences and the corresponding automatic simplifications) among experiments which differ only in the size of the training and development datasets. How- ever, the models trained and tuned on the datasets consisting of the sentence pairs with the high- est and the lowest S-BLEU scores ([0,0.3] and (0.9,1]) perform significantly worse than the mod- els trained and tuned on the sentence pairs with S-BLEU scores belonging to other intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Human Evaluation</head><p>The results presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 3 and 4</ref> indicate that the BLEU score, in MT-based text simplifica- tion, mostly reflects the surface similarity of the original and simplified sentences in the test set and does not give an informative evaluation of the systems. Therefore, we conducted a human as- sessment of the generated sentences. Following the standard procedure for human evaluation of TS systems used in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Coster and Kauchak, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Drndarevi´cDrndarevi´c et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Wubben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Saggion et al., 2015)</ref>, three human evaluators were asked to assess the generated sen- tences on a 1-5 scale (where the higher mark al- ways denotes better output) according to three cri- <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: BLEU scores on the EncBritTest dataset</p></div>

We decided that the same person has to rate all simplified versions of the same original sen- tence (shown always in a random order), in order to make a fairer comparison among the systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>Recently, there have been several attempts at ad- dressing the TS task as a monolingual translation problem, translating from 'original' to 'simple' sentences. However, they did not try to seek rea- sons for the success or the failure of their systems. Our experiments, conducted on 40 different, carefully designed datasets from the largest avail- able sentence-aligned TS corpus (Wikipedia TS corpus), provide valuable insights into how much of an effect the size and the quality of the training data have on the performance of the PB-SMT sys- tem which tries to learn to translate from 'original' to 'simple' sentences. The results indicate that us- ing the sentence pairs with low S-BLEU scores for training and tuning of PB-SMT models for TS tend to cause the fluency to deteriorate and even change the meaning of the output. Furthermore, it seems that the sizes of the training and develop- ment datasets do not play a significant role in how successful the model is. It appears that carefully selected sentence pairs in the training and develop- ment datasets (i.e. sentence pairs with a moderate similarity) lead to best performances of PB-SMT systems regardless of the size of the datasets.</p><p>Our results open up new directions for enhanc- ing the current PB-SMT models for TS, indicat- ing that their performance can be significantly im- proved by carefully filtering sentence pairs used for training and tuning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The WikiTest which contains a total of 240 sentence pairs, with 30 sentence pairs from each of the eight categories with different intervals for the S-BLEU scores ([0,0.3], (0.3,0.4], ... , (0.9,1]); 2.
