<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>An important part of what determines how infor- mation will be interpreted by an audience is how that information is framed. Framing is a phe- nomenon largely studied and debated in the social sciences, where, for example, researchers explore how news media shape debate around policy is- sues by deciding what aspects of an issue to em- phasize, and what to exclude. Theories of fram- ing posit that these decisions give rise to thematic sets of interrelated ideas, imagery, and arguments, which tend to cohere and persist over time.</p><p>Past work on framing includes many examples of issue-specific studies based on manual content analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baumgartner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berinsky and Kinder, 2006</ref>). While such studies reveal much about the range of opinions on an issue, they do not characterize framing at a level of abstraction that allows comparison across social issues.</p><p>More recently, there have also been a handful of papers on the computational analysis of framing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Nguyen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tsur et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baumer et al., 2015)</ref>. While these papers represent impres- sive advances, they are still focused on the prob- lem of automating the analysis of framing along a single dimension, or within a particular domain.</p><p>We propose that framing can be understood as a general aspect of linguistic communication about facts and opinions on any issue. Empirical assess- ment of this hypothesis requires analyzing framing in real-world media coverage. To this end, we con- tribute an initial dataset of annotated news articles, the Media Frames Corpus (version 1). These an- notations are based on 15 general-purpose meta- frames (here called "framing dimensions") out- lined below, which are intended to subsume all specific frames that might be encountered on any issue of public concern.</p><p>Several features of this annotation project dis- tinguish it from linguistic annotation projects fa- miliar to computational linguists:</p><p>• A degree of subjectivity in framing analysis is unavoidable. While some variation in an- notations is due to mistakes and misunder- standings by annotators (and is to be mini- mized), much variation is due to valid differ- ences in interpretation (and is therefore prop- erly preserved in the coding process).</p><p>• Annotator skill appears to improve with prac- tice; our confidence in the quality of the an- notations has grown in later phases of the project, and this attribute is not suppressed in our data release.</p><p>All of the annotations and metadata in this cor- pus are publicly available, along with tools to ac- quire the original news articles usable by those who have an appropriate license to the texts from their source (Lexis-Nexis). 1 This dataset and planned future extensions will enable computa- tional linguists and others to develop and empir- ically test models of framing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">What is Framing?</head><p>Consider a politically contested issue such as same-sex marriage. Conflicting perspectives on this issue compete to attract our attention and in- fluence our opinions; any communications about the issue-whether emanating from political par- ties, activist organizations, or media providers- will be fraught with decisions about how the issue should be defined and presented.</p><p>In a widely cited definition, Entman (1993) ar- gues that "to frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described." Further elaborations have em- phasized how various elements of framing tend to align and cohere, eventually being deployed "packages" which can be evoked through particu- lar phrases, images, or other synecdoches <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gameson and Modigliani, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benford and Snow, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chong and Druckman, 2007)</ref>. These may take the form of simple slogans, such as the war on terror, or more complex, perhaps unstated, as- sumptions, such as the rights of individuals, or the responsibilities of government. The patterns that emerge from these decisions and assumptions are, in essence, what we refer to as framing. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Traditionally, in the social sciences, framing is studied by developing an extensive codebook of frames specific to an issue, reading large num- bers of documents, and manually annotating them for the presence of the frames in the codebook (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baumgartner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Terkildsen and Schnell, 1997</ref>). Computational linguists therefore have much to offer in formalizing and automating the analysis of framing, enabling greater scale and breadth of application across issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Annotation Scheme</head><p>The goal of our annotation process was to pro- duce a corpus of examples demonstrating how the choice of language in a document relates to fram- ing in a non-issue-specific way. To accomplish this task, we annotated news articles with a set of 15 cross-cutting framing dimensions, such as economics, morality, and politics, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boydstun et al. (2014)</ref>. These dimensions, sum- marized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, were informed by the fram- ing literature and developed to be general enough to be applied to any policy issue.</p><p>For each article, annotators were asked to iden- tify any of the 15 framing dimensions present in Economic: costs, benefits, or other financial implications Capacity and resources: availability of physical, human or financial resources, and capacity of current systems Morality: religious or ethical implications Fairness and equality: balance or distribution of rights, responsibilities, and resources Legality, constitutionality and jurisprudence: rights, freedoms, and authority of individuals, corporations, and government Policy prescription and evaluation: discussion of specific policies aimed at addressing problems Crime and punishment: effectiveness and implications of laws and their enforcement Security and defense: threats to welfare of the individual, community, or nation Health and safety: health care, sanitation, public safety Quality of life: threats and opportunities for the individ- ual's wealth, happiness, and well-being Cultural identity: traditions, customs, or values of a social group in relation to a policy issue Public opinion: attitudes and opinions of the general pub- lic, including polling and demographics Political: considerations related to politics and politicians, including lobbying, elections, and attempts to sway voters External regulation and reputation: international reputa- tion or foreign policy of the U.S. Other: any coherent group of frames not covered by the above categories the article and to label spans of text which cued them. Annotators also identified the dominant framing of the article headline (if present), as well as for the entire article, which we refer to as the "primary frame." Finally, newspaper corrections, articles shorter than four lines of text, and articles about foreign countries were marked as irrelevant. There were no constraints on the length or com- position of annotated text spans, and annotations were allowed to overlap. The last framing dimen- sion ("Other") was used to categorize any articles that didn't conform to any of the other options (used in &lt; 10% of cases). An example of two in- dependent annotations of the same article is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>For the initial version of this corpus, three pol- icy issues were chosen for their expected diver- sity of framing and their contemporary political relevance: immigration, smoking, and same-sex marriage. Lexis-Nexis was used to obtain all arti- cles matching a set of keywords published by a set of 13 national U.S. newspapers between the years 1990 and 2012. 3 Duplicate and near-duplicate ar- ticles were removed and randomly selected arti- cles were chosen for annotation for each issue (see supplementary material for additional details).</p><p>Annotation guidelines for the project are docu- mented in a codebook, which was used for training the annotators. The codebook for these issues was refined in an ongoing manner to include examples from each issue, and more carefully delineate the boundaries between the framing dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Annotation Process</head><p>Our annotation process reflects the less-than-ideal circumstances faced by academics requiring con- tent analysis: relatively untrained annotators, high turnover, and evolving guidelines. Our process is delineated into three stages, summarized in Ta- ble 1 and discussed in detail below. Each stage involved 14-20-week-long rounds of coding; in each round, annotators were given approximately 100 articles to annotate, and the combinations of annotators assigned the same articles were rotated between rounds. Our annotators were undergrad- uates students at a U.S. research university, and a total of 19 worked on this project, with 8 be- ing involved in more than one stage. The aver- age number of frames identified in an article varied from 2.0 to 3.7 across annotators, whereas the av- erage number of spans highlighted per article var- ied from 3.4 to 10.0. Additional detail is given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Stage 1</head><p>During the first stage, approximately 4,000 arti- cles on each of immigration and smoking were an- notated, with approximately 500 articles in each group annotated by multiple annotators to mea- sure inter-annotator agreement. Our goals here were high coverage and ensuring that the guide- lines were not too narrowly adapted to any single issue. Annotators received only minimal feedback on their agreement levels during this stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Stage 2</head><p>In the second stage, annotations shifted to same- sex marriage articles, again emphasizing general fit across issues. Beginning in stage 2, each article</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[WHERE THE JOBS ARE] Economic</head><p>[Critics of illegal immigration can make many cogent arguments to support the position that the U.S. Congress and the Colorado legisla- ture must develop effective and well-enforced immigration policies that will restrict the number of people who migrate here legally and illegally.] Policy prescription [It's true that all forms of [immigration ex- ert influence over our economic and cultural make-up.] Cultural identity In some ways, im- migration improves our economy by adding laborers, taxpayers and consumers, and in other ways immigration detracts from our economy by increasing the number of stu- dents, health care recipients and other ben- eficiaries of public services.] Economic [Some economists say that immigrants, le- gal and illegal, produce a net economic gain, while others say that they create a net loss] Economic . There are rational arguments to support both sides of this debate, and it's useful and educational to hear the varying positions.</p><p>[  The annotators agree perfectly about which parts of the article make use of economic framing, but dis- agree about the first paragraph. Moreover, the second an- notator identifies an additional dimension (capacity and re- sources). Although they both identify a reference to cultural identity, they annotated slightly different spans of text.</p><p>was assigned to at least two annotators, in order to track inter-annotator agreement more carefully, and to better capture the subjectivity inherent in this task. Since the guidelines had become more stable by this stage, we also focused on identifying good practices for annotator training. Annotators were informed of their agreement levels with each other, and pairs of framing dimensions on which annotators frequently disagreed were emphasized. This information was presented to annotators in weekly meetings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Stage 3</head><p>The third stage revisited the immigration articles from stage 1 (plus an additional group of articles), with the now well-developed annotation guide- lines. As in the second stage, almost all articles were annotated by two annotators, working inde- pendently. More detailed feedback was provided, including inter-annotator agreement for the use of each framing dimension anywhere in articles. During stage 3, for each article where two an- notators independently disagreed on the primary frame, the pair met to discuss the disagreement and attempt to come to a consensus. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Disagree- ments continue to arise, however, reflecting the re- ality that the same article can cue different frames more strongly for different annotators. We view these disagreements not as a weakness, but as a source of useful information about the diversity of ways in which the same text can be interpreted by different audiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pan and Kosicki, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rees et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>The proportion of articles annotated with each framing dimension (averaged across annotators) is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Inter-annotator Agreement</head><p>Because our annotation task is complex (select- ing potentially overlapping text spans and label- ing them), there is no single comprehensive mea- sure of inter-annotator agreement. The simplest aspect of the annotations to compare is the choice of primary frame, which we measure using Krip- pendorff's α (Krippendorff, 2012). 5 <ref type="bibr">4</ref> A small secondary experiment, described in supplemen- tary material, was used to test the reliability of this process. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Krippendorff's α is similar to Cohen's κ, but calculates expected agreement between annotators based on the com- bined pool of labels provided by all annotators, rather than considering each annotators's frequency of use separately. Moreover, it can be used for more than two annotators and    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> shows the inter-annotator agreement on the primary frame per round. We observe first that difficulty varies by issue, with same-sex mar- riage the most difficult. Annotators do appear to improve with experience. Agreement on immi- gration articles in stage 3 are significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05, permutation test) than agreement on the same articles in stage 1, even though only one annotator worked on both stages. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> These results demonstrate that consistent per- formance can be obtained from different groups of annotators, given sufficient training. Although we never obtain perfect agreement, this is not sur- prising, given that the same sentences can and do cue multiple types of framing, as illustrated by the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><note type="other">Proportion of articles External regulation Other Capacity &amp; resources Security &amp; defense Irrelevant Cultural identity Quality of life Public opinion Morality Crime &amp; punishment Fairness &amp; equality Policy prescription Economic</note><p>Inter-annotator agreement at the level of indi- vidually selected spans of text can be assessed us- ing an extension of Krippendorff's α (α U ) which measures disagreement between two spans as the sum of the squares of the lengths of the parts which do not overlap. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> As with the more common α statistic, α U is a chance-corrected agreement met- ric scaled such that 1 represents perfect agreement and 0 represents the level of chance. This met- accommodates missing values. See Passonneau and Carpen- ter (2014) for additional details. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Note that this is not a controlled experiment on annota- tion procedures, but rather a difference observed between two stages of an evolving process. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> For example, in the example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, the amount of disagreement on the two Cultural identity annota- tions would be the square of the length (in characters) of the non-overlapping part of the annotations ("immigration exert influence over our economic and") which is 50 2 = 2500.  ric has been previously recommended for tasks in computational linguistics that involve unitizing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref>. For a more complete explanation, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Krippendorff (2004)</ref>. The pattern of α U values across rounds is very similar to that shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, but not surpris- ingly, average levels of agreement are much lower. Arguably, this agreement statistic is overly harsh for our purposes. We do not necessarily expect an- notators to agree perfectly about where to start and end each annotated span, or how many spans to annotate per article, and our codebook and guide- lines offer relatively little guidance on these low- level decisions. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that in all cases, average agreement is greater than chance. The α U values for all annotated spans of text (averaged across articles) are 0.16 for immi- gration (stage 1), 0.23 for tobacco, 0.08 for same- sex marriage, and 0.20 for immigration (stage 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Prior Work</head><p>Several previous papers in the computer science literature deal with framing, though usually in a more restricted sense. Perhaps the most com- mon approach is to treat the computational anal- ysis of framing as a variation on sentiment analy- sis, though this often involves reducing framing to a binary variable. Various models have been ap- plied to news and social media datasets with the goal of identifying political ideology, or "perspec- tive" (typically on a liberal to conservative scale) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed and Xing, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lin et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hardisty et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Klebanov et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sim et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iyyer et al., 2014)</ref>, or "stance" (position for or against an is- sue) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Walker et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasan and Ng, 2013)</ref>. A related line of work is the analysis of subjec- tive language or "scientific" language, which has also been posed in terms of framing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wiebe et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Choi et al., 2012)</ref>. While the study of ideol- ogy, sentiment, and subjectivity are interesting in their own right, we believe that they fail to cap- ture the more nuanced nature of framing, which is often more complex than positive or negative sen- timent. In discussions of same-sex marriage, for example, both advocates and opponents may at- tempt to control whether the issue is perceived as primarily about politics, legality, or ethics. More- over, we emphasize that framing is an important feature of even seemingly neutral or objective lan- guage.</p><p>A different but equally relevant line of work has focused on text re-use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Leskovec et al. (2009)</ref> perform clustering of quotations and their vari- ations, uncovering patterns in the temporal dy- namics of how memes spread through the me- dia. On a smaller scale, others have examined text reuse in the development of legislation and the cul- ture of reprinting in nineteenth-century newspa- pers ( . While not the same as framing, identifying this sort of text reuse is an important step towards analyzing the "media packages" that social scientists asso- ciate with framing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>Framing is a complex and difficult aspect of lan- guage to study, but as with so many aspects of modern NLP, there is great potential for progress through the use of statistical methods and public datasets, both labelled and unlabeled. By releas- ing the Media Frames Corpus, we seek to bring the phenomenon to the attention of the computational linguistics community, and provide a framework that others can use to analyze framing for addi- tional policy issues. As technology progresses to- wards ever more nuanced understanding of natural language, it is important to analyze not just what is being said, but how, and with what effects. The Media Frames Corpus enables the next step in that direction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Framing dimensions from Boydstun et al.
