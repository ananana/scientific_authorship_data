				<p>A question may be asked not only to elicit information, but also to make a statement. Questions serving the latter purpose , called rhetorical questions, are often lexically and syntactically indistinguishable from other types of questions. Still, it is desirable to be able to identify rhetorical questions, as it is relevant for many NLP tasks, including information extraction and text summarization. In this paper, we explore the largely understudied problem of rhetorical question identification. Specifically, we present a simple n-gram based language model to classify rhetorical questions in the Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus. We find that a special treatment of rhetorical questions which incorporates contextual information achieves the highest performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Rhetorical questions frequently appear in every- day conversations. A rhetorical question is func- tionally different from other types of questions in that it is expressing a statement, rather than seek- ing information. Thus, rhetorical questions must be identified to fully capture the meaning of an utterance. This is not an easy task; despite their drastic functional differences, rhetorical questions are formulated like regular questions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bhatt (1998)</ref> states that in principle, a given question can be interpreted as either an informa- tion seeking question or as a rhetorical question and that intonation can be used to identify the in- terpretation intended by the speaker. For instance, consider the following example:</p><p>(1) Did I tell you that writing a dissertation was easy?</p><p>Just from reading the text, it is difficult to tell whether the speaker is asking an informational question or whether they are implying that they did not say that writing a dissertation was easy.</p><p>However, according to our observation, which forms the basis of this work, there are two cases in which rhetorical questions can be identified solely based on the text. Firstly, certain linguistic cues make a question obviously rhetorical, which can be seen in examples <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Secondly, the context, or neighboring utterances, often reveal the rhetorical nature of the question, as we can see in example (4).</p><p>(2) Who ever lifted a finger to help George? (3) After all, who has any time during the exam period?</p><p>(4) Who likes winter? It is always cold and windy and gray and everyone feels miser- able all the time.</p><p>There has been substantial work in the area of classifying dialog acts, within which rhetor- ical questions fall. To our knowledge, prior work on dialog act tagging has largely ignored rhetorical questions, and there has not been any previous work specifically addressing rhetorical question identification. Nevertheless, classifica- tion of rhetorical questions is crucial and has nu- merous potential applications, including question- answering, document summarization, author iden- tification, and opinion extraction.</p><p>We provide an overview of related work in Sec- tion 2, discuss linguistic characteristics of rhetor- ical questions in Section 3, describe the experi- mental setup in Section 4, and present and analyze the experiment results in Section 5. We find that, while the majority of the classification relies on features extracted from the question itself, adding in n-gram features from the context improves the performance. An F 1 -score of 53.71% is achieved by adding features extracted from the preceding and subsequent utterances, which is about a 10% improvement from a baseline classifier using only the features from the question itself. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jurafsky et al. (1997a)</ref> and Reithinger and Kle- sen (1997) used n-gram language modeling on the Switchboard and Verbmobil corpora respectively to classify dialog acts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Grau et al. (2004)</ref> uses a Bayesian approach with n-grams to categorize dialog acts. We also employ a similar language model to achieve our results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Samuel et al. (1999)</ref> used transformation-based learning on the Verbmobil corpus over a num- ber of utterance features such as utterance length, speaker turn, and the dialog act tags of adja- cent utterances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Stolcke et al. (2000)</ref> utilized Hidden Markov Models on the Switchboard cor- pus and used word order within utterances and the order of dialog acts over utterances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zechner (2002)</ref> worked on automatic summarization of open-domain spoken dialogues i.e., important pieces of information are found in the back and forth of a dialogue that is absent in a written piece. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Webb et al. (2005)</ref> used intra-utterance features in the Switchboard corpus and calculated n-grams for each utterance of all dialogue acts. For each n- gram, they computed the maximal predictivity i.e., its highest predictivity value within any dialogue act category. We utilized a similar metric for n- gram selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Verbree et al. (2006) constructed their baseline for three different corpora using the performance of the LIT set, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Samuel (2000)</ref>. In this approach, they also chose to use a com- pressed feature set for n-grams and POS n-grams. We chose similar feature sets to classify rhetorical questions.</p><p>Our work extends these approaches to dialog act classification by exploring additional features which are specific to rhetorical question identifi- cation, such as context n-grams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Features for Identifying Rhetorical Questions</head><p>In order to correctly classify rhetorical ques- tions, we theorize that the choice of words in the question itself may be an important indicator of speaker intent. To capture intent in the words themselves, it makes sense to consider a common unigram, while a bigram model will likely capture short phrasal cues. For instance, we might expect the existence of n-grams such as well or you know to be highly predictive features of the rhetorical nature of the question. Additionally, some linguistic cues are helpful in identifying rhetorical questions. Strong nega- tive polarity items (NPIs), also referred to as em- phatic or even-NPIs in the literature, are consid- ered definitive markers. Some examples are budge an inch, in years, give a damn, bat an eye, and lift a finger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Giannakidou 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, van Rooy 2003</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gresillon (1980)</ref> notes that a question containing a modal auxiliary, such as could or would, together with negation tends to be rhetorical. Certain ex- pressions such as yet and after all can only ap- pear in rhetorical questions <ref type="bibr">(Sadock 1971</ref><ref type="bibr">, Sadock 1974</ref>. Again, using common n-grams as features should partially capture the above cues because n- gram segments of strong NPIs should occur more frequently.</p><p>We also wanted to incorporate common gram- matical sequences found in rhetorical questions.</p><p>To that end, we can consider part of speech (POS) n-grams to capture common grammatical relations which are predictive.</p><p>Similarly, for rhetorical questions, we expect context to be highly predictive for correct classi- fication. For instance, the existence of a question mark in the subsequent utterance when spoken by the questioner, will likely be a weak positive cue, since the speaker may not have been expecting a response. However, the existence of a question mark by a different speaker may not be indicative. This suggests a need to decompose the context- based feature space by speaker. Similarly, phrases uttered prior to the question will likely give rise to a different set of predictive n-grams.</p><p>Using these observations, we decided to im- plement a simple n-gram model incorporating contextual cues to identify rhetorical questions. Specifically, we used unigrams, bigrams, POS bi- grams, and POS trigrams of a question and its im- mediately preceding and following context as fea- ture sets. Based on preliminary results, we did not use trigrams or POS unigrams. POS tags did not capture sufficient contextual information and tri- grams were not implemented since the utterances in our dataset were too small to fully utilize them.</p><p>Also, to capture the contextual information, we distinguish three distinct categories -questions, utterances immediately preceding questions, and utterances immediately following questions. In order to capture the effect of a feature if it is used by the same speaker versus a different speaker, we divided the feature space contextual utter- ances into four disjoint groups: precedent-same- speaker, precedent-different-speaker, subsequent- same-speaker, and subsequent-different-speaker. Features in each group are all considered indepen- dently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Setup</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data</head><p>For the experiments, we used the Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Godfrey et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jurafsky et al. 1997b</ref>), which contains labeled utter- ances from phone conversations between differ- ent pairs of people. We preprocessed the data to contain only the utterances marked as questions (rhetorical or otherwise), as well as the utterances immediately preceding and following the ques- tions. Additionally, connectives like and and but were marked as t con, the end of conversation was marked as t empty, and laughter was marked as t laugh.</p><p>After filtering down to questions, we split the data into 5960 questions in the training set and 2555 questions in the test set. We find the dataset to be highly skewed with only <ref type="bibr">128</ref> 2555 or 5% of the test instances labeled as rhetorical. Because of this, a classifier that naively labels all questions as non-rhetorical would achieve a 94.99% accuracy. Thus, we chose precision, recall and F 1 -measure as more appropriate metrics of our classifier per- formance. We should note also that our results as- sume a high level of consistency of the hand anno- tations from the original taggging of the Switch- board Corpus. However, based on our observation and the strict guidelines followed by annotators as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jurafsky et al. (1997a)</ref>, we are rea- sonably confident in the reliability of the rhetori- cal labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Learning Algorithm</head><p>We experimented with both Naive Bayes and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Our Naive Bayes classifier was smoothed with an add- alpha Laplacian kernel, where alpha was selected via cross-validation. For our SVM, to account for the highly skewed nature of our dataset, we set the cost-factor based on the ratio of positive (rhetori- cal) to negative (non-rhetorical) questions in our training set as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Morik et al. (1999)</ref>. We tuned the trade-off between margin and training error via cross validation over the training set.</p><p>In early experiments, Naive Bayes performed comparably to or outperformed SVM because the dimensionality of the feature space was relatively low. However, we found that SVM performed more robustly over the large range and dimension- ality of features we employed in the later experi- ments. Thus, we conducted the main experiments using SVMLite (Joachims 1999).</p><p>As the number of parameters is linear in the number of feature sets, an exhaustive search through the space would be intractable. So as to make this feasible, we employ a greedy approach to model selection. We make a naive assumption that parameters of feature sets are independent or codependent on up to one other feature set in the same group. Each pair of codependent feature sets is considered alone while holding other feature sets fixed. Classifier parameters are also assumed to be independent for tuning purposes.</p><p>In order to optimize search time without sam- pling the parameter space too coarsely, we em- ployed an adaptive refinement variant to a tradi- tional grid search. First, we discretely sampled the Cartesian product of dependent parameters sam- pled at regular geometric or arithmetic intervals between a user-specified minimum and maximum. We then updated minimum and maximum values to center around the highest scoring sample and recursed on the search with the newly downsized span for a fixed recursion depth d. In practice, we choose k = 4 and d = 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Features</head><p>Unigrams, bigrams, POS bigrams, and POS tri- grams were extracted from the questions and neighboring utterances as features, based on the analysis in Section 3. Then, feature selection was performed as follows.</p><p>For all features sets, we considered both uni- gram and bigram features. All unigrams and bi- grams in the training data are considered as po- tential candidates for features. For each feature set above, we estimated the maximal predictivity over both rhetorical and non-rhetorical classes, corre- sponding to using the MLE of P (c|n), where n denotes the n-gram and c is the class. We used these estimates as a score and select the j n-grams with the highest score for each n over each group, regardless of class, where j was selected via 4-fold cross validation.</p><p>Each feature was then encoded as a simple oc- currence count within its respective group for a given exchange. The highest scoring unigrams and bigrams are as follows: "you", "do", "what", "to", "t con", "do you", "you know", "going to", "you have", and "well ,". POS features were computed by running a POS tagger on all exchanges and and then picking the j-best n-grams as described above. For our exper- iments, we used the maximum entropy treebank POS tagger from the NLTK package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bird et al. 2009</ref>) to compute POS bigrams and trigrams.</p><p>Lastly, in order to assess the relative value of question-based and context-based features, we de- signed the following seven feature sets:</p><p>• Question (baseline)</p><p>• Precedent</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Subsequent</head><p>• Question + Precedent</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Question + Subsequent • Precedent + Subsequent • Question + Precedent + Subsequent</formula><p>The question-only feature set serves as our baseline without considering context, whereas the other feature sets serve to test the power of the preceding and following context alone and when paired with features from the question itself.  AC PC Utterance + + X: 'i mean, why not.' -X: 'what are you telling that student?' - + X: 't laugh why don't we do that?' -X: 'who, was in that.' AC PC Utterances + + X: 't con you give them an f on something that doesn't seem that bad to me.' X: 'what are you telling that student?' X: 'you're telling them that, hey, you might as well forget it, you know.' - Y: 't con it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up.' X: 't laugh why don't we do that? Y: 'i, guess so.'  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the performance of the feature sets cross-valided and trained on 5960 questions (with context) in the Switchboard corpus and tested on the 2555 remaining questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results and Analysis</head><p>Our results largely reflect our intuition on the expected utility of our various feature sets. Fea- tures in the question group prove by far the most useful single source, while features within the subsequent prove to be more useful than features in the precedent. Somewhat surprisingly however, an F 1 -score of 30.14% is achieved by training on contextual features alone while ignoring any cues from the question itself, suggesting the power of context in identifying a question as rhetorical. Ad- ditionally, one of the highest scoring bigrams is you know, matching our earlier intuitions. Some examples of the success and failings of our system can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and 3. For instance, in our question-only feature space, the phrase what are you telling that student? was in- correctly classified as non-rhetorical. When the contextual features were added in, the classifier correctly identified it as rhetorical as we might ex- pect. Failure cases of our simple language model based system can be seen for instance in the false positive question is she spayed which is inter-preted as rhetorical, likely due to the unigram yeah in the response.</p><p>Overall, we achieve our best results when in- cluding both precedent and subsequent context along with the question in our feature space. Thus, our results suggest that incorporating contextual cues from both directly before and after the ques- tion itself outperforms classifiers trained on a naive question-only feature space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Feature Dimensionality</head><p>After model selection via cross validation, our to- tal feature space dimensionality varies between 2914 for the precedent only feature set and 16615 for the question + subsequent feature set. Distinct n-gram and POS n-gram features are considered for each of same speaker and different speaker for precedents and subsequents so as to capture the distinction between the two. Examining the rel- ative number of features selected for these sub- feature sets also gives a rough idea of the strength of the various cues. For instance, same speaker feature dimensionality tended to be much lower than different speaker feature dimensionality, sug- gesting that considering context uttered by the re- spondent is a better cue as to whether the question is rhetorical. Additionally, unigrams and bigrams tend to be more useful features than POS n-grams for the task of rhetorical question identification, or at least considering the less common POS n-grams is not as predictive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evenly Split Distribution</head><p>As the highly skewed nature of our data does not allow us to get a good estimate of error rate, we also tested our feature sets on a subsection of the dataset with a 50-50 split between rhetorical and non-rhetorical questions to get a better sense of the accuracy of our classifier. The results can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. Our classifier achieves an accu- racy of 81% when trained on the questions alone and 84% when integrating precedent and subse- quent context. Due to the reduced size of the evenly split dataset, performing a McNemar's test with Edwards' correction (Edwards 1948) does not allow us to reject the null hypothesis that the two experiments do not derive from the same dis- tribution with 95% confidence (χ 2 = 1.49 giv- ing a 2-tailed p value of 0.22). However, over the whole skewed dataset, we find χ 2 = 30.74 giv- ing a 2-tailed p &lt; 0.00001 so we have reason to believe that with a larger evenly-split dataset inte- grating context-based features provides a quantifi- able advantage.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we tackle the largely understud- ied problem of rhetorical question identification. While the majority of the classification relies on features extracted from the question itself, adding in n-gram features from the context improves the performance. We achieve a 53.71% F 1 -score by adding features extracted from the preceding and the subsequent utterances, which is about a 10% improvement from a baseline classifier using only the features from the question itself. For future work, we would like to employ more complicated features like the sentiment of the con- text, and dictionary features based on an NPI lex- icon. Also, if available, prosodic information like focus, pauses, and intonation may be useful.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Feature</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
