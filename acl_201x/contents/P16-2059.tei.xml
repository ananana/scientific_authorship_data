				<p>Bilingual models that capture the semantics of sentences are typically only evaluated on cross-lingual transfer tasks such as cross-lingual document categorization or machine translation. In this work, we evaluate the quality of the monolingual representations learned with a variant of the bilingual compositional model of Her-mann and Blunsom (2014), when viewing translations in a second language as a semantic annotation as the original language text. We show that compositional objectives based on phrase translation pairs out-perform compositional objectives based on bilingual sentences and on monolingual paraphrases.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The effectiveness of new representation learning methods for distributional word representations ( ) has brought renewed interest to the question of how to compose semantic rep- resentations of words to capture the semantics of phrases and sentences. These representations offer the promise of capturing phrasal or sentential se- mantics in a general fashion, and could in principle benefit any NLP applications that analyze text be- yond the word level, and improve their ability to generalize beyond contexts seen in training.</p><p>While most prior work has focused either on composing words into short phrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mitchell and Lapata, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hermann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fyshe et al., 2015)</ref>, or on super- vised task-specific composition functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Iyyer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rocktäschel et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iyyer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tai et al., 2015</ref>, inter alia), <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wieting et al. (2016)</ref> recently showed that a simple composition architecture (vector averag- ing) can yield sentence models that consistently perform well in semantic textual similarity tasks in a wide range of domains, and outperform more complex sequence models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Tai et al., 2015)</ref>. Inter- estingly, these models are trained using PPDB, the paraphrase database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013)</ref>, which was learned from bilingual parallel corpora.</p><p>In bilingual settings, there are also a few ex- amples of bilingual sentence models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermann and Blunsom, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lauly et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gouws et al., 2014</ref>). However, they have only been evaluated in cross-lingual trans- fer settings (e.g., cross-lingual document classifi- cation, or machine translation), which do not di- rectly evaluate the quality of the sentence-level se- mantic representations learned.</p><p>In this work, we directly evaluate the usefulness of modeling semantic equivalence using composi- tional models of translated texts for detecting se- mantic textual similarity in a single language. For instance, in addition to using translated texts to model cross-lingual transfer from English to a for- eign language, we can view English translations as a semantic annotation of the foreign text, and eval- uate the usefulness of the resulting foreign repre- sentations. While learning representations in lan- guages other than English is a pressing practical problem, this paper will focus on evaluating En- glish sentence representations learned on English semantic similarity tasks to facilitate comparison with prior work.</p><p>Our results show that sentence representations learned using a bilingual compositional objective outperform representations learned using mono- lingual evidence, whether compositional or not. In addition, phrasal translations yield better represen- tations than full sentence translations, even when applied to sentence-level tasks. <ref type="table">Table 1: Positive and negative examples for each of the 3 types of supervision considered   Bilingual Sentences +</ref> thus, in fact, we might say that he hurried ahead of the decision by our fellow member.</p><p>as que podramos decir , de hecho, que se adelant a la decisin de nuestro colega.</p><p>- thus, in fact, we might say that he hurried ahead of the decision by our fellow member.</p><p>seor presidente, la votacin sobre sellafield ha sido una novedad en el parlamento europeo .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Models</head><p>Inspired by the bilingual model of ( <ref type="bibr">Hermann and Blunsom, 2014</ref>), and paraphrase model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Wieting et al., 2016)</ref>, representations for multi-word segments are built with a simple bag-of-word ad- ditive combination of word representations, which are trained to minimize the distance between se- mantically equivalent segments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Three Views of Semantic Equivalence</head><p>The different types of semantic equivalence used for training are illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Parallel Sentences occur naturally, and provide training examples that are more consistent with downstream applications. However, they can be noisy due to automatic sentence alignment and one-to-many mappings, and bag-of-word repre- sentations of sentence meaning are likely to be in- creasingly noisier as segments get longer.</p><p>Monolingual Paraphrases are invaluable re- sources, but rarely occur naturally , and creat- ing paraphrase resources therefore requires con- siderable effort. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganitkevitch et al. (2013)</ref> automatically-created paraphrase resources for many languages using parallel corpora.</p><p>Parallel Phrases or phrasal translations might provide a tighter definition of semantic equiva- lence than longer sentence pairs, but phrase pairs have to be extracted automatically based on word alignments, an automatic and noisy process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Models and Learning Objectives</head><p>Our main model is based on the bilingual com- position model of <ref type="bibr">Hermann and Blunsom (2014)</ref>, which learns a word embedding matrix W from a training set X of aligned sentence pairs x 1 , x 2 . Each of x 1 and x 2 is represented as a bag-of- words, i.e. a superset of column indices in W . Each aligned pair x 1 , x 2 is augmented with k randomly selected sentences that are not aligned to x 1 , and another k that are not aligned to x 2 . Given this augmented example</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 1 , x 2 , ¯ x 1 1 , ..., ¯ x k 1 , ¯ x 1 2 , ..., ¯ x k 2</formula><p>, the model training objective is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">J bi (W ) = λ 2 ||W || 2 F + x 1 ,x 2 ,¯ x 1 ,¯ x 2 k i=1 [δ + ||g(x 1 ) − g(x 2 )|| 2 − ||g(x 1 ) − g(¯ x i 2 )|| 2 ] h [δ + ||g(x 1 ) − g(x 2 )|| 2 − ||g(x 2 ) − g(¯ x i 1 )|| 2 ] h (1)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g(x) = i∈x W :i , [.] h is the hinge func- tion (i.e. [v] h = max(0, v)</formula><p>) whose margin is given by δ and λ is a regularization parameter.</p><p>The paraphrase-based model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wieting et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Evaluating Sentence Representations</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wieting et al. (2016)</ref>, the models above are evaluated on the four Semantic Textual Simi- larity (STS) datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agirre et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Agirre et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agirre et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Agirre et al., 2015)</ref>, which provide pairs of English sentences from dif- ferent domains (e.g., Tweets, news, webforums, image captions), annotated with human judgments of similarity on a 1 to 5 scale. Systems have to out- put a similarity score for each pair. Systems are evaluated using the Pearson correlation between gold and predicted rankings.</p><p>The Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK) test set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marelli et al., 2014</ref>) provides a complementary evaluation. It consists of sentence pairs annotated with semantic relat- edness scores. While STS examples were simply drawn from existing NLP datasets, SICK exam- ples were constructed to avoid non-compositional phenomena such as multiword expressions, named entities and world knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Experimental Conditions</head><p>At training time we learn word embeddings for each combination of objective (Section 2.2) and type of training examples <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 2)</ref>, using modi- fied implementations of open-source implementa- tions for J bi ( <ref type="bibr">Hermann and Blunsom, 2014</ref>) and J pa <ref type="figure">(Wieting et al., 2016)</ref>. This results in six model configurations. Each was trained for 10 epochs using tuned hyperparameters.</p><p>At tuning time we use the SMT-europarl sub- set of STS-2012. We consider mini-batch sizes of {25, 50, 100}, δ ∈ {1, 10, 100} with Euclidean distance, δ ∈ {0.4, 0.6, 0.8} with cosine similarly, and λ ∈ {1, 10 −3 , 10 −5 , 10 −7 , 10 −9 }. In J bi , we consider k ∈ {1, 5, 10, 15}, and in J pa we tuned over the sampling strategy ∈ {M IX, M AX} and the distance function used. To speed up tuning for J pa , we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wieting et al. (2016)</ref>, by limiting training to 100k pairs, and tuning to 5 epochs.</p><p>Tuning results confirmed the importance of neg- ative sampling and distance function in our mod- els: in J bi , increasing k consistently helps the bilingual models, whereas the correlation score for monolingual models degrade for k &gt; 10. In J pa , M AX always outperforms M IX. Euclidean dis- tance was consistently chosen for bilingual sen- tences and monolingual phrases, while cosine sim- ilarity was chosen for bilingual phrases.</p><p>At test time we construct sentence-level embed- dings by averaging the representations of words in each sentence, and compute cosine similarity to capture the similarity between sentences. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports the Pearson correlation scores achieved for each approach and dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bilingual phrases yield the best models in controlled settings</head><p>Overall, the best representations are obtained us- ing bilingual phrase pairs and the J bi objective. They outperform all other compositional models for all tasks, except for one subset of STS-2015.</p><p>The best objective for a given type of train- ing example varies: J pa generally yields better <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Pearson correlation scores obtained on the English STS sets (with per year averages) and on semantic-relatedness task (SICK). The left columns report results based on new representations learned in this work, while the 2 rightmost columns report reference results from prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wieting et al., 2016</ref> results with monolingual phrases, while J bi per- forms better with bilingual examples. Bilingual phrases seem to benefit from larger number of ran- domly selected negative samples and from using the Euclidean distance rather than cosine similar- ity. The best bilingual compositional representa- tions are better than non-compositional Glove em- beddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), but worse than compositional Paragram embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wieting et al., 2016)</ref>. However, Paragram initialization re- quires large amounts of text and human word simi- larity judgments for tuning, while our models were initialized randomly. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bilingual sentences vs. bilingual phrases</head><p>Why do bilingual phrases outperform the bilingual sentences they are extracted from? In this section, we verify that this is not explained by systematic biases in the distribution of training examples. First, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> shows that bilingual sentences have the smallest ratios of undertrained words, and are therefore not penalized by rare words more than bilingual phrases 3 .</p><p>Second, we see that the rankings are not bi- ased due to memorization of the phrases seen dur- ing training. Rankings of models does not change when testing on unseen word sequences, as shown by SICK results with models trained using J bi on a filtered training set that contains none of the bi- grams observed at test time <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 5)</ref>.</p><p>Third, the advantage of bilingual phrases over bilingual sentences is not due to the larger number of training examples. 1.9M (and even 1M ) bilin- gual phrase pairs still outperform the 1.9M bilin- gual sentence pairs on all subsets (See <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Taken together, these additional results sup- port our initial intuition that the main advantage of bilingual phrases over bilingual sentences is that phrase pairs have stronger semantic equiva- lence than sentence pairs, since phrase pairs are shorter and are constructed by identifying strongly aligned subsets of sentence pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monolingual vs. bilingual phrases</head><p>Based on the analysis thus far, we hypothesize that paraphrase pairs with overlapping tokens make the compositional training objective less useful. Around 40% of the paraphrase training pairs differ only by one token. With Euclidean distance in the training objective, overlapping tokens cancel each other out of the composition term. For example, the pair healthy and stable, healthy and steady yields the compositional term ||(healthy + and + stable)− (healthy + and + steady)|| 2 = ||stable − steady|| 2</p><p>In contrast, overlap cannot occur in the bilin- gual setting, and all words within bilingual phrases contribute to the compositional objective. Fur- thermore, bilingual pairs provide a more explicit semantic signal as translations can disambiguate polysemous words <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Diab, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carpuat and Wu, 2007</ref>) and help discover synonyms by pivoting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Callison-Burch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yao et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>All these factors might contribute to the ability of training with bilingual phrases of taking advan- tage of larger number of negative samples k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We conducted the first evaluation of compositional representations learned using bilingual supervi- <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Impact of training set size: Average Pear- son correlation per test set with different numbers (in millions) of bilingual phrase pairs, compared to the full set of bilingual sentences and monolin- gually pretrained GloVe. sion on monolingual textual similarity tasks.</p><p>Phrase and sentence representations are con- structed by composing word representations using a simple additive composition function. We con- sidered two training objective that encourage the resulting representations to distinguish English- Spanish segment pairs that are semantically equiv- alent or not. The resulting English sentence repre- sentations consistently outperform compositional models trained to detect monolingual paraphrases on five different English semantic textual similar- ity tasks from SemEval.</p><p>Bilingual phrase pairs are consistently the best evidence of semantic equivalence in our experi- ments. They yield better results than the sentence pairs they are extracted from, despite the noise in- troduced by the automatic extraction process.</p><p>Furthermore the composed representations out- perform non-compositional word representations derived from monolingual co-occurrence statis- tics. While sizes of monolingual vs. bilingual cor- pora are not directly comparable, it is remarkable that representations learned with only 500k bilin- gual phrase pairs outperform GloVe embeddings trained on 840B tokens.</p><p>Since our best models still underperform Para- gram vectors, which require a more sophisticated initialization process, we will turn to improving our initialization strategies in future work. Nev- ertheless, current results provide further evidence of the usefulness of compositional text represen- tations, even with a simple bag-of-word additive composition function, and of bilingual translation pairs as a strong signal of semantic equivalence.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>Table 2 : Training conditions: three types of semantic equivalence for composed representations.</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Condition

			<note place="foot" n="1"> In contrast, Wieting et al. (2016) initialize W with highquality but resource intensive embeddings-they are trained using word-level PPDB paraphrases, tuned on SimLex-999, and regularized to penalize deviations from initial GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014). 2 MAX (use the unaligned phrase of minimum distance) or MIX (use MAX with probability 0.5 and sample randomly otherwise)</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Further, more than 80% of words that appear in both bilingual sentences and bilingual phrases occur in 460 (in average) more bilingual sentences than in bilingual phrases. The remaining 20% were found to be the rare words (e.g. zazvorkova, woldesmayat, yellow-bellies) that hardly occur in test sets.</note>
