			<abstract>
				<p>Over the last two decades, numerous algorithms have been developed that successfully capture something of the semantics of single words by looking at their distribution in text and comparing these distributions in a vector space model. However , it is not straightforward to construct meaning representations beyond the level of individual words-i.e. the combination of words into larger units-using dis-tributional methods. Our contribution is twofold. First of all, we carry out a large-scale evaluation, comparing different composition methods within the distributional framework for the cases of both adjective-noun and noun-noun composition, making use of a newly developed dataset. Secondly , we propose a novel method for composition, which generalises the approach by Baroni and Zamparelli (2010). The performance of our novel method is also evaluated on our new dataset and proves competitive with the best methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the course of the last two decades, there has been a growing interest in distributional meth- ods for lexical semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Landauer and Dumais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Turney and Pantel, 2010)</ref>. These methods are based on the distributional hypothe- sis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Harris, 1954)</ref>, according to which words that appear in the same contexts tend to be similar in meaning. Inspired by Harris' hypothesis, numer- ous researchers have developed algorithms that try to capture the semantics of individual words by looking at their distribution in a large corpus.</p><p>Compared to manual studies common to formal semantics, distributional semantics offers substan- tially larger coverage since it is able to analyze massive amounts of empirical data. However, it is not trivial to combine the algebraic objects created by distributional semantics to get a sensible distri- butional representation for more complex expres- sions, consisting of several words. On the other hand, the formalism of the λ -calculus provides us with general, advanced and efficient methods for composition that can model meaning composition not only of simple phrases, but also more com- plex phenomena such as coercion or composition with fine-grained types <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asher, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Luo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bassac et al., 2010)</ref>. Despite continued efforts to find a general method for composition and various approaches for the composition of specific syntac- tic structures (e.g. adjective-noun composition, or the composition of transitive verbs and direct ob- jects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mitchell and Lapata, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coecke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010)</ref>), the model- ing of compositionality is still an important chal- lenge for distributional semantics. Moreover, the validation of proposed methods for composition has used relatively small datasets of human sim- ilarity judgements <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mitchell and Lapata, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Although such studies comparing similarity judge- ments have their merits, it would be interesting to have studies that evaluate methods for composi- tion on a larger scale, using a larger test set of dif- ferent specific compositions. Such an evaluation would allow us to evaluate more thoroughly the different methods of composition that have been proposed. This is one of the goals of this paper.</p><p>To achieve this goal, we make use of two dif- ferent resources. We have constructed a dataset for French containing a large number of pairs of a compositional expression (adjective-noun) and a single noun that is semantically close or identical to the composed expression. These pairs have been extracted semi-automatically from the French Wiktionary. We have also used the Semeval 2013 dataset of phrasal similarity judgements for English with similar pairs ex- tracted semi-automatically from the English Wik- tionary to construct a dataset for English for both adjective-noun and noun-noun composition. This affords us a cross-linguistic comparison of the methods.</p><p>These data sets provide a substantial evalua- tion of the performance of different compositional methods. We have tested three different methods of composition proposed in the literature, viz. the additive and multiplicative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mitchell and Lapata, 2008)</ref>, as well as the lexical function ap- proach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The two first methods are entirely general, and take as input automatically constructed vectors for adjectives and nouns. The method by Baroni and Zamparelli, on the other hand, requires the acqui- sition of a particular function for each adjective, represented by a matrix. The second goal of our paper is to generalise the functional approach in order to eliminate the need for an individual func- tion for each adjective. To this goal, we automat- ically learn a generalised lexical function, based on Baroni and Zamparelli's approach. This gener- alised function combines with an adjective vector and a noun vector in a generalised way. The per- formance of our novel generalised lexical function approach is evaluated on our test sets and proves competitive with the best, extant methods.</p><p>Our paper is organized as follows. First, we dis- cuss the different compositional models that we have evaluated in our study, briefly revisiting the different existing methods for composition, fol- lowed by a description of our generalisation of the lexical function approach. Next, we report on our evaluation method and its results. The results sec- tion is followed by a section that discusses work related to ours. Lastly, we draw conclusions and lay out some avenues for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Composition methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Simple Models of Composition</head><p>In this section, we describe the composition mod- els for the adjective-noun case. The extension of these models to the noun-noun case is straight- forward; one just needs to replace the adjective by the subordinate noun. Admittedly, choosing which noun is subordinate in noun-noun compo- sition may be an interesting problem but it is out- side the scope of this paper. We tested three sim- ple models of composition: a baseline method that discounts the contribution of the adjective com- pletely, and the additive and multiplicative models of composition. The baseline method is defined as follows:</p><p>Comp baseline (adj, noun) = noun</p><p>The additive model adds the point-wise values of the adjective vector adj and noun vector noun using independent coefficients to provide a result for the composition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Comp additive (adj, noun) = α noun + β adj</formula><p>The multiplicative model consists in a point- wise multiplication of the vectors adj and noun:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Comp multiplicative (adj, noun) = noun ⊗ adj with (noun ⊗ adj) i = noun i × adj i 2.2</formula><p>The lexical function model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Zamparelli's (2010)</ref> lexical func- tion model (LF) is somewhat more complex. Adjective-noun composition is modeled as the functional application of an adjective meaning (represented as a matrix) to a noun meaning (rep- resented as a vector). Thus, the combination of an adjective and noun is the product of the matrix ADJ and the vector noun as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Baroni and Zamparelli propose learning an ad- jective's matrix from examples of the vectors for adj noun obtained directly from the corpus. These vectors adj noun are obtained in the same way as vectors representing a single word: when the adjective-noun combination occurs, we ob- serve its context and construct the vector from those observations. As an illustration, consider the example in 2. The word name appears three times modified by an adjective in the following excerpt from Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. This informs us about the co- occurrence frequencies of three vectors: one for divine name, another for nice name, and one for charming name.</p><p>Once the adj noun vectors have been created for a given adjective, we are able to calculate the ADJ matrix using a least squares regression that minimizes the equation ADJ×adj noun − noun. More formally, the problem is the following:  LF requires a large corpus, because we have to observe a sufficient number of examples of the adjective and noun combined, which are perforce less exemplified than the presence of the noun or adjective in isolation. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, each of the oc- currences of 'name' can contribute to the informa- tion in the vector name but none can contribute to the vector evanescent name. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Zamparelli (2010)</ref> offer an expla- nation of how to cope with the potential sparse data problem for learning matrices for adjectives. Moreover, recent evaluations of LF show that ex- istent corpora have enough data for it to provide a semantics for the most frequent adjectives and ob- tain better results than other methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dinu et al., 2013b)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Find ADJ s.t. ∑ noun (ADJ × noun − adj noun) 2 is minimal × = ADJECTIVE n o u n Composition LF (adjective, noun)</formula><p>Nevertheless, LF has limitations in treating rel- atively rare adjectives. For example, the adjective 'evanescent' appears 359 times in the UKWaC cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2009)</ref>. This is enough to gen- erate a vector for evanescent, but may not be suf- ficient to generate a sufficient number of vectors evanescent noun to build the matrix EVANES- CENT. More importantly, for noun-noun combi- nations, one may need to have a LF for a com- bination. To get the meaning of blood dona- tion campaign in the LF approach, the matrix BLOOD DONATION must be combined to the vec- tor campaign. Learning this matrix would require to build vectors blood donation noun for many nouns. Even if it were possible, the issue would arise again for blood donation campaign plan, then for blood donation campaign plan meeting and so forth.</p><p>In addition, LF's approach to adjectival mean- ing and composition has a theoretical drawback. Like Montague Grammar, it supposes that the ef- fect of an adjective on a noun meaning is specific to the adjective <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kamp, 1975)</ref>. However, recent studies suggest that the Montague approach over- generalises from the worst case, and that the vast majority of adjectives in the world's languages are subsective, suggesting that the modification of nominal meaning that results from their compo- sition with a noun follows general principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Partee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asher, 2011</ref>) that are independent of the presence or absence of examples of association.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Generalised LF</head><p>To solve these problems, we generalise LF and re- place individual matrices for adjectival meanings by a single lexical function: a tensor for adjectival composition A . <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Our proposal is that adjective- noun composition is carried out by multiplying the tensor A with the vector for the adjective adj, fol- lowed by a multiplication with the vector noun, c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>The product of the tensor A and the vector adj yields a matrix dependent of the adjective that is multiplied with the vector noun. This matrix cor- responds to the LF matrix ADJ. As indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, we obtain A with the help of matrices obtained from the LF approach, and from vectors for single words easily obtained in distributional semantics; we perform a least square regression minimizing the norm of the matrices generated by the equations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Formally, the problem is </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= A djective × a d j × n o u n ∀ adjective, noun Composition GLF (adjective, noun)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">∑ adj (A × adj − ADJ) 2</formula><p>is minimal Note that our tensor is not just the compilation of the information found in the LF matrices: the ad- jective mode of our tensor has a limited number of dimensions, whereas the LF approach creates a separate matrix for each individual adjective. This reduction forces the model to generalise, and we hypothesise that this generalisation allows us to make proper noun modifications even in the light of sparse data.</p><p>Our approach requires learning a significant number of matrices ADJ. This is not a problem, since FRWaC and UKWaC provide sufficient data for the LF approach to generate matrices for a sig- nificant number of adjectives. For example, the 2000 th most frequent adjective in FRWaC ('fas- ciste') has more than 4000 occurrences.</p><p>To return to our example of blood donation campaign, once the tensor N for noun-noun composition is learned, our approach requires only the knowledge of the vectors blood, dona- tion and campaign. We would then perform the following computations:</p><p>blood donation = (N × blood) × donation blood donation campaign = (N × blood donation) × campaign and this allows us to avoid the sparse data prob- lem for the LF approach in generating the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">BLOOD DONATION.</formula><p>Once we have obtained the tensor A , we verify experimentally its relevance to composition, in or- der to check whether a tensor optimising the equa- tions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> would be semantically interest- ing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Tasks description</head><p>In order to evaluate the different composition methods, we constructed test sets for French and English, inspired by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zanzotto et al. (2010)</ref> and the SEMEVAL-2013 task evaluating phrasal semantics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Korkontzelos et al., 2013</ref>). The task is to make a judgement about the semantic similarity of a short word sequence (an adjective- noun combination) and a single noun. This is im- portant, as composition models need to be able to treat word sequences of arbitrary length. Formally, the task is presented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">With comp = composition(adj, noun 1 ) Evaluate similarity(comp, noun 2 )</formula><p>where the 'composition' function is carried out by the different composition models. 'Similarity' needs to be a binary function, with return val- ues 'similar' and 'non-similar'. Note, however, that the distributional approach yields a continu- ous similarity value (such as the cosine similar- ity between two vectors). In order to determine which cosine values correspond to 'similar' and which cosine values correspond to 'non-similar', we looked at a number of examples from a de- velopment set. More precisely, we carried out a logistic regression on 50 positive and 50 negative examples (separate from our test set) in order to automatically learn the threshold at which a pair is considered to be similar. Finally, we decided to use balanced test sets containing as many positive instances as negative ones.</p><p>The test set is constructed in a semi-automatic way, making use of the canonical phrasing of dic- tionary definitions. Take for example the defini- tion of bassoon in the English Wiktionary 3 , pre- sented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. It is quite straightforward to extract the pair (musical instrument, bassoon) from this definition. Using a large dictionary (such as Wiktionary), it is then possible to ex- tract a large number of positive -i.e. similar - (adjective noun, noun) pairs.</p><p>For the construction of our test set for French, we downloaded all entries of the French Wik- tionary (Wiktionnaire) and annotated them with Find tensor A by minimizing:  . Next, we ex- tracted all definitions that start with an adjective- noun combination. As a final step, we filtered all instances containing words that appear too infre- quently in our FRWaC corpus. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The automatically extracted instances were then checked manually, and all instances that were con- sidered incorrect were rejected. This gave us a fi- nal test set of 714 positive examples.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A djective × r e d − RED , A djective × s l o w − SLOW . . .</formula><p>We also created an initial set of negative ex- amples, where we combined an existing combi- nation of adjective noun1 (extracted from the French Wiktionary), with a randomly selected noun noun2. Again, we verified manually that the resulting (adjective noun1, noun2) pairs con- stituted actual negative examples. We then cre- ated a second set of negative examples by ran- domly selecting two nouns (noun1, noun2) and one adjective adjective. The resulting pairs (adjective noun1, noun2) were verified man- ually.</p><p>In addition to our new test set for French, we also experimented with the original test set of the SEMEVAL-2013 task evaluation phrasal semantics for English. However, the original test set lacked human oversight as 'manly behavior' was consid- ered similar to 'testosterone' for example. We thus hand-checked the test set ourselves and extracted 652 positive pairs.</p><p>The negative pairs from the original SEMEVAL- 2013 are a combination of a random noun and a random adjective-noun compositon found in the English Wiktionary. We used it as our first set of English negative examples as it is similar in construction to our first set of negative examples in French. In addition, we created a completely random negative test set for English in the same fashion we did for the second negative test set for French.</p><p>Finally, the original test set also contains noun- noun compounds so we also created a test set for that. This gave us 226 positive and negative pairs for the noun-noun composition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Semantic space construction</head><p>In this section, we describe the construction of our semantic space. Our semantic space for French was built using the FRWaC corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2009</ref>) -about 1,6 billion words of web texts - which has been tagged with MElt tagger  and parsed with MaltParser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nivre et al., 2006a</ref>), trained on a dependency-based version of the French treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Candito et al., 2010</ref>). Our semantic space for English has been built using the UKWaC corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2009)</ref>, which consists of about 2 billion words extracted from the web. The corpus has been part of speech tagged and lemmatized with Stanford Part-Of- Speech Tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Toutanova and Manning, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Toutanova et al., 2003)</ref>, and parsed with Malt- Parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nivre et al., 2006b</ref>) trained on sections 2-21 of the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank extended with about 4000 ques-positive examples random negative examples Wiktionary-based negative examples (mot court, abréviation) (importance fortuit, gamme) (jugement favorable, discorde) 'short word', 'abbreviation' 'accidental importance', 'range' 'favorable judgement', 'discord' (ouvrage littéraire, essai) (penchant autoritaire, ile) (circonscription administratif , fumier) 'literary work', 'essay' 'authoritarian slope', isle' 'administrative district', 'manure' (compagnie honorifique, ordre) (auspice aviaire, ponton) (mention honorable, renne) 'honorary company', 'order' 'avian omen', 'pontoon' 'honorable mention', 'reindeer' <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: A number of examples from our test set for French tions from the QuestionBank 5 .</p><p>For both corpora, we extracted the lemmas of all nouns, adjectives and (bag of words) context words. We only kept those lemmas that consist of alphabetic characters. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We then selected the 10K most frequent lemmas for each category (nouns, adjectives, context words), making sure to include all the words from the test set. As a final step, we created our semantic space vectors using ad- jectives and nouns as instances, and bag of words context words as features. The resulting vectors were weighted using positive point-wise mutual information (ppmi, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Church and Hanks, 1990)</ref>), and all vectors were normalized to unit length.</p><p>We then compared the different composition methods on different versions of the same seman- tic space (both for French and English): the full semantic space, a reduced version of the space to 300 dimensions using singular value decomposi- tion (svd, (Golub and Van Loan, 1996)), and a re- duced version of the space to 300 dimensions us- ing non-negative matrix factorization (nmf, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lee and Seung, 2000)</ref>). We did so in order to test each method in its optimal conditions. In fact:</p><p>• A non-reduced space contains more informa- tion. This might be beneficial for methods that are able to take advantage of the full se- mantic space (viz. the additive et multiplica- tive model). On the other hand, to be able to use the non-reduced space for the lexical function approach, one would have to learn matrices of size 10K ×10K for each adjec- tive. This would be problematic in terms of computing time and data sparseness, as we previously noted. The same goes for our gen-eralised approach.</p><p>• Previous research has indicated that the lexi- cal function approach is able to achieve bet- ter results using a reduced space with svd. On the other hand, the negative values that result from svd are detrimental for the multiplica- tive approach.</p><p>• An nmf -reduced semantic space is not detri- mental for the multiplicative approach.</p><p>In order to determine the best parameters for the additive model, we tested this model for different values of α and β where α + β = 1 7 on a develop- ment set and kept the values with the best results: α = 0.4, β = 0.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data used for regression</head><p>The LF approach and its generalisation need data in order to perform the least square regression. We thus created a semantic space for adjective noun and noun noun vectors using the most frequent ones in a similar way to how we created them in 3.2. Then we solved the equations in 2.2 and forth. Even though the regression data were dis- joint from the test sets, for each pair, we removed some of the data that may cause overfitting.</p><p>For the lexical function tests, we remove the adjective noun vector corresponding to the test pair from the regression data. For example, we do not use short word to learn SHORT for the (short word, abbrevation) pair.</p><p>For the generalised lexical function tests, we use the full regression data to learn the lexical func- tions used to train the tensor. However, we re- move the ADJECTIVE matrix corresponding to the test pair from the (tensor) regression data. For ex- ample, we do not use SHORT to learn A for the (short word, abbreviation) pair.   </p><note type="other">: Percentage of correctly classified pairs for (adjective noun1, noun2) for both French and English spaces.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Results</head><p>In this section, we present how the various models perform on our test sets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 2 &amp; 3</ref> give an overview of the results. Note first that the baseline approach, which compares only the two nouns and ignores the subordinate adjective or noun, does relatively well on the task (∼ 80% accuracy). This reflects the fact that the head noun in our pairs extracted from definitions is close to (and usually a super type of) the noun to be defined. In addition, we observe that the multiplicative method performs badly, as expected, on the se- mantic space reduced with svd. This confirms the incompatibility of this method with the negative values generated by svd. Indeed, multiplying two vectors with negative values term by term may yield a third vector very far away from the other two. Such a combination does not support the sub- sectivity of most our test pairs. Apart from that, svd and nmf reductions do not affect the methods much.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">General results</head><p>Moreover, we observe that the multiplicative model performs better than the baseline but is bested by the additive model. We also see that additive and lexical functions often yield similar performance.</p><p>Finally, the generalised lexical function is slightly less accurate than the lexical functions. This is an expected consequence of generalisa- tion. Nevertheless, the generalised lexical function yields sound results confirming our intuition that we can represent adjective-noun (or noun-noun) combinations by one function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Adjective-noun</head><p>With random negative pairs <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 2a)</ref>, we ob- serve that the lexical function model obtains the best results for the svd space. This result is sig- nificantly better than any other method on any of the spaces-e.g.,for French space, χ 2 = 33.49, p &lt; 0.01 when compared to the additive model for the non-reduced space which performs second.</p><p>However, with non-random negative pairs (Ta- ble 2b), LF and the additive model obtain scores that are globally equivalent for their best respec-tive conditions -in French 0.85 for the additive non-reduced model vs. 0.84 for the LF svd model, a difference that is not significant (χ 2 = 0.20, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>This seems to indicate that LF is especially ef- ficient at separating out nonsense combinations. This may be caused by the fact that lexical func- tions learn from actual pairs. Thus, when an adjective noun combination is bizarre, the ADJEC- TIVE matrix has not been optimized to interact with the noun vector and may lead to complete non-sense -Which is a good thing because hu- mans would analyze the combination as such.</p><p>Finally, similar results in French and English confirm the intuition that distributional methods (and its composition models) are independent of the idiosyncrasies of a particular language; in par- ticular they are as efficient for French as for En- glish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Noun-noun</head><p>The noun-noun tests <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 3)</ref> yields similar re- sults to the adjective-noun tests. This is not so surprising since noun noun compounds in English also obey a roughly subsective property: a base- ball field is still a field (though a cricket pitch is perhaps not so obviously a pitch). We can see that the accuracy increase from the baseline is higher compared to adjective-noun test on the same exact spaces <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 2b</ref>, right values). This may be due to the fact that the subordinate noun in noun-noun combinations is more important than the adjective subordinate in adjective-noun combination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related work</head><p>Many researchers have already studied and evalu- ated different composition models within a distri- butional approach. One of the first studies eval- uating compositional phenomena in a systematic way is <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mitchell and Lapata's (2008)</ref> approach. They explore a number of different models for vector composition, of which vector addition (the sum of each feature) and vector multiplication (the element-wise multiplication of each feature) are the most important. They evaluate their models on a noun-verb phrase similarity task. Human an- notators were asked to judge the similarity of two composed pairs (by attributing a certain score). The model's task is then to reproduce the human judgements. Their results show that the multi- plicative model yields the best results, along with a weighted combination of the additive and multi- plicative model. The authors redid their study us- ing a larger test set in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mitchell and Lapata (2010)</ref> (adjective-noun composition was also included), and they confirmed their initial results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Zamparelli (2010)</ref> evaluate their lexical function model within a somewhat dif- ferent context. They evaluated their model by looking at its capacity of reconstructing the adjective noun vectors that have not been seen during training. Their results show that their lexi- cal function model obtains the best results for the reconstruction of the original co-occurrence vec- tors, followed by the additive model. We observe the same tendency in our evaluation results for French, although our results for English show a different picture. We would like to explore this discordance further in future work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grefenstette et al. (2013)</ref> equally propose a gen- eralisation of the lexical function model that uses tensors. Their goal is to model transitive verbs, and the way we acquire our tensor is similar to theirs. In fact, they use the LF approach in or- der to learn VERB OBJECT matrices that may be multiplied by a subject vector to obtain the subject verb object vector. In a second step, they learn a tensor for each individual verb, which is similar to how we learn our adjective tensor A . <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coecke et al. (2010)</ref> present an abstract theo- retical framework in which a sentence vector is a function of the Kronecker product of its word vec- tors, which allows for greater interaction between the different word features. A number of instan- tiations of the framework -where the key idea is that relational words (e.g. adjectives or verbs) have a rich (multi-dimensional) structure that acts as a filter on their arguments -are tested exper- imentally in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011b)</ref>. The au- thors evaluated their models using a similarity task that is similar to the one used by Mitchell &amp; La- pata. However, they use more complex compo- sitional expressions: rather than using composi- tions of two words (such as a verb and an object), they use simple transitive phrases (subject-verb- object). They show that their instantiations of the categorical model reach better results than the ad- ditive and multiplicative models on their transitive similarity task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Socher et al. (2012)</ref> present a compositional model based on a recursive neural network. Each node in a syntactic tree is assigned both a vector and a matrix; the vector captures the actual mean- ing of the constituent, while the matrix models the way it changes the meaning of neighbouring words and phrases. They use an extrinsic evalu- ation, using the model for a sentiment prediction task. They show that their model gets better re- sults than the additive, multiplicative, and lexical function approach. Other researchers, however, have published different results. Blacoe and La- pata (2012) evaluated the additive and multiplica- tive model, as well as <ref type="bibr">Socher et al.'s (2012)</ref> ap- proach on two different tasks: Mitchell &amp; Lapata's (2010) similarity task and a paraphrase detection task. They find that the additive and multiplica- tive models reach better scores than Socher et al.'s model.</p><p>Tensors have been used before to model differ- ent aspects of natural language. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Giesbrecht (2010)</ref> describes a tensor factorization model for the con- struction of a distributional model that is sensitive to word order. And Van de Cruys (2010) uses a tensor factorization model in order to construct a three-way selectional preference model of verbs, subjects, and objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have developed a new method of composition and tested it in comparison with different com- position methods assuming a distributional ap- proach. We developed a test set for French pair- ing nouns with adjective noun combinations very similar in meaning from the French Wiktionary. We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for ad- jective noun combination and noun noun combi- nation. Our tests confirm that the lexical func- tion approach by Baroni and Zamparelli performs well compared to other methods of composition, but only when the negative examples are con- structed randomly. Our generalised lexical func- tion approach fares almost equally well. It also has the advantage of being constructed from au- tomatically acquired adjectival and noun vectors, and offers the additional advantage of countering data sparseness. However, the lexical function approach claims to perform well on more subtle cases -e.g. non-subsective combinations such as stone lion. Our test sets does not contain such cases, and so we cannot draw any conclusion on this claim.</p><p>In future work, we would like to test differ- ent sizes of dimensionality reduction, in order to optimize our generalised lexical function model. Moreover, it is possible that better results may be obtained by proposing multiple generalised lexi- cal functions, rather than a single one. We could, e.g., try to separate the intersective adjectives from non-intersective adjectives. And finally, we would like to further explore the performance of the lex- ical function model and generalised lexical func- tion model on different datasets, which involve more complex compositional phenomena.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Lexical Function Composition Jack: Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care about the name of Ernest. ..
