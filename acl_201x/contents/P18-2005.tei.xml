				<p>Written text often provides sufficient clues to identify the author, their gender, age, and other important attributes. Consequently , the authorship of training and evaluation corpora can have unforeseen impacts, including differing model performance for different user groups, as well as privacy implications. In this paper, we propose an approach to explicitly obscure important author characteristics at training time, such that representations learned are invariant to these attributes. Evaluating on two tasks, we show that this leads to increased privacy in the learned representations , as well as more robust models to varying evaluation conditions, including out-of-domain corpora.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language is highly diverse, and differs accord- ing to author, their background, and personal at- tributes such as gender, age, education and na- tionality. This variation can have a substantial effect on NLP models learned from text ( , leading to significant variation in in- ferences across different types of corpora, such as the author's native language, gender and age. Training corpora are never truly representative, and therefore models fit to these datasets are bi- ased in the sense that they are much more effec- tive for texts from certain groups of user, e.g., middle-aged white men, and considerably poorer for other parts of the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hovy, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, models fit to language corpora often fixate on author attributes which correlate with the target variable, e.g., gender correlating with class skews ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhao et al., 2017)</ref>, or translation choices ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rabinovich et al., 2017)</ref>. This signal, however, is rarely fundamental to the task of modelling lan- guage, and is better considered as a confounding influence. These auxiliary learning signals can mean the models do not adequately capture the core linguistic problem. In such situations, remov- ing these confounds should give better generali- sation, especially for out-of-domain evaluation, a similar motivation to research in domain adapta- tion based on selection biases over text domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blitzer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Daumé III, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Another related problem is privacy: texts con- vey information about their author, often inadver- tently, and many individuals may wish to keep this information private. Consider the case of the AOL search data leak, in which AOL released de- tailed search logs of many of their users in Au- gust 2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pass et al., 2006</ref>). Although they de- identified users in the data, the log itself contained sufficient personally identifiable information that allowed many of these individuals to be identi- fed ( <ref type="bibr">Jones et al., 2007)</ref>. Other sources of user text, such as emails, SMS messages and social me- dia posts, would likely pose similar privacy issues. This raises the question of how the corpora, or models built thereupon, can be distributed without exposing this sensitive data. This is the problem of differential privacy, which is more typically ap- plied to structured data, and often involves data masking, addition or noise, or other forms of cor- ruption, such that formal bounds can be stated in terms of the likelihood of reconstructing the pro- tected components of the dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dwork, 2008)</ref>. This often comes at the cost of an accuracy re- duction for models trained on the corrupted data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Shokri and Shmatikov, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abadi et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Another related setting is where latent repre- sentations of the data are shared, rather than the text itself, which might occur when sending data from a phone to the cloud for processing, or trust- ing a third party with sensitive emails for NLP processing, such as grammar correction or trans- lation. The transfered representations may still contain sensitive information, however, especially if an adversary has preliminary knowledge of the training model, in which case they can readily re- verse engineer the input, for example, by a GAN attack algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hitaj et al., 2017)</ref>. This is true even when differential privacy mechanisms have been applied.</p><p>Inspired by the above works, and recent suc- cesses of adversarial learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Goodfellow et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ganin et al., 2016)</ref>, we propose a novel ap- proach for privacy-preserving learning of unbiased representations. 1 Specially, we employ Ganin et al.'s approach to training deep models with ad- versarial learning, to explicitly obscure individu- als' private information. Thereby the learned (hid- den) representations of the data can be transferred without compromising the authors' privacy, while still supporting high-quality NLP inference. We evaluate on the tasks of POS-tagging and senti- ment analysis, protecting several demographic at- tributes -gender, age, and location -and show empirically that doing so does not hurt accuracy, but instead can lead to substantial gains, most no- tably in out-of-domain evaluation. Compared to differential privacy, we report gains rather than loss in performance, but note that we provide only empirical improvements in privacy, without any formal guarantees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>We consider a standard supervised learning situ- ation, in which inputs x are used to compute a representation h, which then forms the parameter- isation of a generalised linear model, used to pre- dict the target y. Training proceeds by minimising a differentiable loss, e.g., cross entropy, between predictions and the ground truth, in order to learn an estimate of the model parameters, denoted θ M .</p><p>Overfitting is a common problem, particular in deep learning models with large numbers of pa- rameters, whereby h learns to capture specifics of the training instances which do not generalise to unseen data. Some types of overfitting are in- sidious, and cannot be adequately addressed with standard techniques like dropout or regularisation. Consider, for example, the authorship of each sen-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x i Model(θ) h y i θ c Di(θ d i ) b i Dj(θ d j ) b j</formula><p>Figure 1: Proposed model architectures, showing a single training instance (x i , y i ) with two pro- tected attributes, b i and b j . D indicates a discrim- inator, and the red dashed and blue lines denote adversarial and standard loss, respectively.</p><p>tence in the training set in a sentiment prediction task. Knowing the author, and their general dispo- sition, will likely provide strong clues about their sentiment wrt any sentence. Moreover, given the ease of authorship attribution, a powerful learning model might learn to detect the author from their text, and use this to predict the sentiment, rather than basing the decision on the semantics of each sentence. This might be the most efficient use of model capacity if there are many sentences by this individual in the training dataset, yet will lead to poor generalisation to test data authored by unseen individuals. Moreover, this raises privacy issues when h is known by an attacker or malicious adversary. Traditional privacy-preserving methods, such as added noise or masking, applied to the representa- tion will often incur a cost in terms of a reduction in task performance. Differential privacy methods are unable to protect the user privacy of h under adversarial attacks, as described in Section 1.</p><p>Therefore, we consider how to learn an un- biased representations of the data with respect to specific attributes which we expect to behave as confounds in a generalisation setting. To do so, we take inspiration from adversarial learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Goodfellow et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ganin et al., 2016</ref>). The archi- tecture is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Adversarial Learning</head><p>A key idea of adversarial learning, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ganin et al. (2016)</ref>, is to learn a discriminator model D jointly with learning the standard super- vised model. Using gender as an example, a dis- criminator will attempt to predict the gender, b, of each instance from h, such that training involves joint learning of both the model parameters, θ M , and the discriminator parameters θ D . However, the aim of learning for these components are in opposition -we seek a h which leads to a good predictor of the target y, while being a poor rep- resentation for prediction of gender. This leads to the objective (illustrated for a single training in- stance),</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ˆ θ = min θ M max θ D X (ˆ y(x; θ M ), y) − λ · X ( ˆ b(x; θ D ), b) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where X denotes the cross entropy function. The negative sign of the second term, referred to as the adversarial loss, can be implemented by a gradi- ent reversal layer during backpropagation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ganin et al., 2016)</ref>. To elaborate, training is based on standard gradient backpropagation for learning the main task, but for the auxiliary task, we start with standard loss backpropagation, however gradients are reversed in sign when they reach h. Conse- quently the linear output components are trained to be good predictors, but h is trained to be maxi- mally good for the main task and maximally poor for the auxiliary task.</p><p>Furthermore, Equation 1 can be expanded to scenarios with several (N ) protected attributes,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ˆ θ = min θ M max {θ D i } N i=1 X (ˆ y(x; θ M ), y)<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">− N i=1 λ i · X ( ˆ b(x; θ D i ), b i ) .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we report experimental results for our methods with two very different language tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">POS-tagging</head><p>This first task is part-of-speech (POS) tagging, framed as a sequence tagging problem. Recent demographic studies have found that the author's gender, age and race can influence tagger perfor- mance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jørgensen et al., 2016</ref>). Therefore, we use the POS tagging to demonstrate that our model is capable of elimi- nating this type of bias, thereby leading to more robust models of the problem.</p><p>Model Our model is a bi-directional LSTM for POS tag prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>), formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h i = LSTM(x i , h i−1 ; θ h ) h i = LSTM(x i , h i+1 ; θ h ) y i ∼ Categorical(φ( h i ; h i ); θ o ) ,</formula><p>for input sequence x i | n i=1 with terminal hidden states h 0 and h n+1 set to zero, where φ is a linear transformation, and [·; ·] denotes vector concatena- tion.</p><p>For the adversarial learning, we use the train- ing objective from Equation 2 to protect gender and age, both of which are treated as binary val- ues. The adversarial component is parameterised by 1-hidden feedforward nets, applied to the final hidden representation [h n ; h 0 ]. For hyperparame- ters, we fix the size of the word embeddings and h to 300, and set all λ values to 10 −3 . A dropout rate of 0.5 is applied to all hidden layers during training.</p><p>Data We use the TrustPilot English POS tagged dataset ( , which consists of 600 sentences, each labelled with both the sex and age of the author, and manually POS tagged based on the Google Universal POS tagset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Petrov et al., 2012</ref>). For the purposes of this paper, we follow Hovy and Søgaard's setup, categorising SEX into female (F) and male (M), and AGE into over-45 (O45) and under-35 (U35). We train the taggers both with and without the adversarial loss, denoted ADV and BASELINE, respectively.</p><p>For evaluation, we perform a 10-fold cross val- idation, with a train:dev:test split using ratios of 8:1:1. We also follow the evaluation method in , by reporting the tag- ging accuracy for sentences over different slices of the data based on SEX and AGE, and the absolute difference between the two settings.</p><p>Considering the tiny quantity of text in the TrustPilot corpus, we use the Web English Tree- bank (WebEng: <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bies et al. (2012)</ref>), as a means of pre-training the tagging model. WebEng was chosen to be as similar as possible in domain to the TrustPilot data, in that the corpus includes unedited user generated internet content.</p><p>As a second evaluation set, we use a corpus of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) from <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. (2016)</ref>, which is used purely for held-out evaluation.  difference between this corpus and WebEng or TrustPilot, and the lack of any domain adaptation, we expect a substantial drop in performance when transferring models, but also expect a larger im- pact from bias removal using ADV training.</p><p>Results and analysis <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the results for the TrustPilot dataset. Observe that the dispar- ity for the BASELINE tagger accuracy (the ∆ col- umn), for AGE is larger than for SEX, consistent with the results of . Our ADV method leads to a sizeable reduction in the difference in accuracy across both SEX and AGE, showing our model is capturing the bias signal less and more robust to the tagging task. Moreover, our method leads to a substantial improvement in ac- curacy across all the test cases. We speculate that this is a consequence of the regularising effect of the adversarial loss, leading to a better characteri- sation of the tagging problem. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows the results for the AAVE held- out domain. Note that we do not have annotations for SEX or AGE, and thus we only report the over- all accuracy on this dataset. Note that ADV also significantly outperforms the BASELINE across the three heldout domains.</p><p>Combined, these results demonstrate that our model can learn relatively gender and age de- biased representations, while simultaneously im- proving the predictive performance, both for in- domain and out-of-domain evaluation scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sentiment Analysis</head><p>The second task we use is sentiment analysis, which also has broad applications to the online community, as well as privacy implications for the authors whose text is used to train our models. Many user attributes have been shown to be eas- ily detectable from online review data, as used ex- tensively in sentiment analysis results <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Potthast et al., 2017)</ref>. In this paper, we fo-  Model Sentiment is framed as a 5-class text classification problem, which we model using <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kim (2014)</ref>'s convolutional neural net (CNN) ar- chitecture, in which the hidden representation is generated by a series of convolutional filters fol- lowed a maxpooling step, simply denote as h = CNN(x; θ M ). We follow the hyper-parameter set- tings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kim (2014)</ref>, and initialise the model with word2vec embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>). We set the λ values to 10 −3 and apply a dropout rate of 0.5 to h. As the discriminator, we also use a feed-forward model with one hidden layer, to predict the pri- vate attribute(s). We compare models trained with zero, one, or all three private attributes, denoted BASELINE, ADV-*, and ADV-all, respectively.</p><p>Data We again use the TrustPilot dataset de- rived from , however now we consider the RATING score as the target variable, not POS-tag. Each review is associated with three further attributes: gender (SEX), age (AGE), and location (LOC). To ensure that LOC cannot be triv- ially predicted based on the script, we discard all non-English reviews based on LANGID.PY <ref type="bibr">(Lui and Baldwin, 2012)</ref>, by retaining only reviews classified as English with a confidence greater than 0.9. We then subsample 10k reviews for each lo- cation to balance the five location classes (US, UK, Germany, Denmark, and France), which were highly skewed in the original dataset. We use the same binary representation of SEX and AGE as the POS task, following the setup in .</p><p>To evaluate the different models, we perform 10-fold cross validation and report test perfor- mance in terms of the F 1 score for the RATING task, and the accuracy of each discriminator. Note that the discriminator can be applied to test data, where it plays the role of an adversarial attacker, by trying to determine the private attributes of   users based on their hidden representation. That is, lower discriminator performance indicates that the representation conveys better privacy for indi- viduals, and vice versa.</p><p>Results <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows the results of the differ- ent models. Note that all the privacy attributes can be easily detected in BASELINE, with results that are substantially higher than the majority class, al- though AGE and SEX are less well captured than LOC. The ADV trained models all maintain the task performance of the BASELINE method, how- ever they clearly have a substantial effect on the discrimination accuracy. The privacy of SEX and LOC is substantially improved, leading to dis- criminators with performance close to that of the majority class (conveys little information). AGE proves harder, although our technique leads to pri- vacy improvements. Note that AGE appears to be related to the other private attributes, in that pri- vacy is improved when optimising an adversarial loss for the other attributes (SEX and LOC). Overall, these results show that our approach learns hidden representations that hide much of the personal information of users, without affect- ing the sentiment task performance. This is a sur- prising finding, which augurs well for the use of deep learning as a privacy preserving mechanism when handling text corpora.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a novel method for removing model biases by explicitly protecting private author at- tributes as part of model training, which we formu- late as deep learning with adversarial learning. We evaluate our methods with POS tagging and senti- ment classification, demonstrating our method re- sults in increased privacy, while also maintaining, or even improving, task performance, through in- creased model robustness.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
