				<p>Despite being one of the most popular tasks in lexical semantics, word similarity has often been limited to the English language. Other languages, even those that are widely spoken such as Span-ish, do not have a reliable word similarity evaluation framework. We put forward robust methodologies for the extension of existing English datasets to other languages, both at monolingual and cross-lingual levels. We propose an automatic standardization for the construction of cross-lingual similarity datasets, and provide an evaluation, demonstrating its reliability and robustness. Based on our procedure and taking the RG-65 word similarity dataset as a reference, we release two high-quality Spanish and Farsi (Persian) monolingual datasets, and fifteen cross-lingual datasets for six languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Por-tuguese, and Farsi.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Semantic similarity is a field of Natural Lan- guage Processing which measures the extent to which two linguistic items are similar. In par- ticular, word similarity is one of the most pop- ular benchmarks for the evaluation of word or sense representations. Applications of word sim- ilarity range from Word Sense Disambiguation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Patwardhan et al., 2003)</ref> to Machine Translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lavie and Denkowski, 2009)</ref>, Information Re- trieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hliaoutakis et al., 2006</ref>), Question An- swering <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mohler et al., 2011</ref>), Text Summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mohammad and Hirst, 2012)</ref>, Ontology Align- ment , and Lexical Substitution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McCarthy and Navigli, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>However, due to the lack of standard multi- lingual benchmarks, word similarity systems had in the main been limited to the English lan- guage ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agirre and Lopez, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Strube and Ponzetto, 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mihalcea, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pilehvar et al., 2013;</ref>), up until the recent creation of datasets built by translating the English RG- 65 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965)</ref> into French ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Joubarne and Inkpen, 2011</ref>), Ger- man <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gurevych, 2005)</ref>, and Portuguese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Granada et al., 2014</ref>). And what is more, cross-lingual applications have grown in importance over the last few years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hassan and Mihalcea, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Franco-Salvador et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Camacho-Collados et al., 2015b</ref>). Unfor- tunately, very few reliable datasets exist for evalu- ating cross-lingual systems.</p><p>This paper provides two contributions: Firstly, we construct Spanish and Farsi versions of the standard RG-65 dataset scored by twelve annota- tors with high inter-annotator agreements of 0.83 and 0.88, respectively, in terms of Pearson correla- tion, and secondly, we create fifteen cross-lingual word similarity datasets based on RG-65, cover- ing six languages, by proposing an improved ver- sion of the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kennedy and Hirst (2012)</ref> for the automatic construction of cross-lingual datasets from aligned monolingual datasets.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. We first briefly review some of the major monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity datasets in Section 2. We then discuss the details of our procedure for the construction of the Spanish and Farsi word similarity datasets in Section 3. Section 4 provides the details of our algorithm for the automatic con- struction of the cross-lingual datasets. We report the results of the evaluation performed on the gen- erated datasets in Section 5. Finally, we specify the released resources in Section 6, followed by concluding remarks in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>Multiple word similarity datasets have been con- structed for the English language: MC-30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Miller and Charles, 1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002</ref>), MEN ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bruni et al., 2014)</ref>, and Simlex- 999 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hill et al., 2014</ref>). The RG-65 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965</ref>) is one of the old- est and most popular word similarity datasets, and has been used as a standard benchmark for mea- suring the reliability of word and sense represen- tations (Agirre and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">de Lacalle, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pilehvar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Camacho-Collados et al., 2015a</ref>). The original RG-65 dataset was constructed with the aim of evaluating the degree to which contextual infor- mation is correlated with semantic similarity for the English language. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965)</ref> reported an inter-annotator agree- ment of 0.85 for a subset of fifteen judges (no final inter-annotator agreement for the total fifty-one judges was calculated). The original English RG- 65 has also been used as a base for different lan- guages: French (Joubarne and Inkpen, 2011), Ger- man <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gurevych, 2005)</ref>, and Portuguese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Granada et al., 2014)</ref>. No inter-annotator agreement was calculated for the French version, while the Ger- man and Portuguese were reported to have the re- spective inter-annotator agreements of 0.81 and 0.71 in terms of average pairwise Pearson corre- lation. Our Spanish version of the RG-65 dataset reports a high inter-annotator agreement of 0.83, while the Farsi version achieves 0.88.</p><p>A few works have also focused on the con- struction of cross-lingual resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hassan and Mihalcea (2009)</ref> built two sets of cross-lingual datasets by translating the English MC-30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Miller and Charles, 1991)</ref> and the WordSim-353 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Finkelstein et al., 2002</ref>) datasets into three languages. However, these datasets have several issues due to their construction procedure. The main problem arises from keeping the original scores from the English dataset in the translated datasets. For in- stance, the Spanish dataset contains the identical pair mediodia-mediodia with a similarity score of 3.42 (in the 0-4 scale). Furthermore, the datasets contain orthographic errors such as despliege and the previously mentioned mediodia (instead of de- spliegue and mediodía), and nouns translated into words with a different part of speech (e.g., imple- ment from the English noun dataset MC-30 trans- lated to the Spanish verb implementar). Addition- ally, the selection of the datasets was not ideal: MC-30 is a small subset of RG-65 and WordSim- 353 has been criticized for its annotation scheme, which conflates similarity and relatedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hill et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kennedy and Hirst (2012)</ref> proposed an auto- matic procedure for the construction of a French- English version of RG-65. We refine their ap- proach by also dealing with some issues that may arise in the automatic process. Additionally, we provide an evaluation of the automatic procedure on different languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Building Monolingual Word Similarity Datasets</head><p>In this section we explain our methodology for the construction of the Spanish and Farsi versions of the English RG-65 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965</ref>). The methodology is divided into two main steps: First, the original English dataset is translated into the target language (Section 3.1) and then, the newly translated pairs are scored by human annotators (Section 3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Translating from English to Spanish/Farsi</head><p>The translation of RG-65 from English to Span- ish and Farsi was performed by, respectively, three English-Spanish and three English-Farsi annota- tors who were fluent English speakers and native speakers of the target language. The translation procedure was as follows. First, two annotators translated each English pair in the dataset into the target language. Then a third annotator checked for disagreements between the first two transla- tors and picked the more appropriate translation among the two options. Finally, all three translators met and performed a final check, with specific focus on the following two cases: (1) duplicate pairs in the dataset, and (2) pairs with repeated words. Our goal was to re- duce these two cases as much as possible. A final adjudication was performed accordingly. We note that there remain three pairs with identical words in both Spanish and Farsi datasets, as no suitable translation could be found to distinguish the words in the English pair. For instance, the two words in the pair midday-noon translate to the same Span- ish word mediodía.   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Sample word pairs from the English and the newly created Spanish and Farsi RG-65 datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Scoring the dataset</head><p>Twelve native Spanish speakers were asked to evaluate the similarity for the Spanish translations.</p><p>In order to obtain a more global distribution of judges, we included judges both both Spain and Latin America. As far as the Farsi dataset was concerned, twelve Farsi native speakers scored the newly translated pairs. The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent Se- mEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jurgens et al., 2014)</ref>, which provides clear indica- tions in order to distinguish similarity and related- ness. The annotators were allowed to give scores from 0 to 4, with a step size of 0.5. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows example pairs with their corre- sponding scores from the English and the newly created Spanish and Farsi versions of the RG- 65 dataset. As we can see from the table, the scores across languages are not necessarily iden- tical, with small, in a few cases significant, differ- ences between the corresponding scores. This is due to the fact that associated senses with words do not hold one-to-one correspondence across dif- ferent languages. This renders the approach of Hassan and Mihalcea (2009) insufficiently accu- rate for handling these differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets</head><p>In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets. Although being targeted at building semantic similarity datasets, the algorithm is task-independent, so it may also be used for any task which measures any kind of relation between two linguistic items in a numerical way. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kennedy and Hirst (2012)</ref> proposed a method which exploits two aligned monolingual word similarity datasets for the construction of a French-English cross-lingual dataset. We fol- lowed their initial idea and proposed a generaliza- tion of the approach which would be capable of automatically constructing reliable cross-lingual similarity datasets for any pair of languages.</p><p>Algorithm. Algorithm 1 shows our procedure for constructing a cross-lingual dataset starting from two monolingual datasets. Note that the pairs in the two monolingual datasets should be previously aligned. Specifically, we refer to each dataset D as {P D , S D }, where P D is the set of pairs and S D is a function mapping each pair in P D to a value on a similarity scale (0-4 for RG-65). For each two aligned pairs a-b and a'-b' across the two datasets, if the difference in the corresponding scores is greater than a quarter of the similarity scale size (1.0 in RG-65), the pairs are not considered (line 7) and therefore discarded. Otherwise, two new pairs a-b' and a'-b are created with a score equal to the average of the two original pairs' scores (lines 8-11 and 15-18). In the case of repeated pairs, we merge them into a single pair with a similarity equal to their average score (lines 12-14 and lines 19-21).</p><p>By following this procedure we created fifteen cross-lingual datasets based on the RG-65 word similarity datasets for English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Farsi. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1 Automatic construction of cross- lingual similarity datasets</head><p>Input: two aligned datasets D = {PD, SD} and D = {P D , S D }, where PX is the set of pairs in dataset X and SX is the mapping of these pairs to their correspond- ing scores.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21:</head><p>Cnt(a , b) + + 22: return {PC , SC } the number of word pairs for each cross-lingual dataset. Note that there is not a single pair of lan- guages whose total count reaches the maximum number of possible word pairs, i.e., 130. This is due, on the one hand, to language peculiarities re- sulting in some pairs having significant score dif- ference across languages (higher than 1 on the 0-4 scale), and, on the other hand, to the repetition of some pairs occurring as a result of the automatic creation process, a problem which is handled by our algorithm. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows sample pairs with their cor- responding similarity scores from four of the cross-lingual datasets: Spanish-English, Spanish- French, Spanish-German, and English-Farsi. These cross-lingual datasets are constructed on the basis of our newly-generated Spanish and Farsi monolingual datasets (see Section 3). The quality of these four datasets is evaluated in Section 5.2.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Spanish and Farsi Monolingual Datasets</head><p>The inter-annotator agreements according to the average pairwise Pearson correlation among the judges for the newly created Spanish and Farsi datasets are, respectively, 0.83 and 0.88, which may be used as upper bounds for evaluating auto- matic systems. Our further analysis revealed that for both datasets no annotator obtained an aver- age Pearson correlation with the rest of the an- notators lower than 0.80, which attests to the re- liability of our judges and guidelines. The Ger- man ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gurevych, 2005</ref>) and Portuguese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Granada et al., 2014</ref>) versions of the RG-65 dataset re- ported a lower inter-annotator agreement of 0.81 and 0.71, respectively, whereas the original En- glish RG-65 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965)</ref> reported an inter-annotator agreement of 0.85 for a subset of fifteen judges. As also mentioned earlier, the French version (Joubarne and Inkpen, 2011) did not report any inter-annotator agreement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Cross-lingual Datasets</head><p>Along with the monolingual evaluation, we also performed an evaluation on four of the automati- cally created cross-lingual datasets.

The Pearson correlations of the human judges with the automatically generated scores were 0.89 for Spanish-English, 0.94 for Spanish-French, 0.91 for Spanish-German, and 0.92 for English-Farsi, showing the reliability of our cross-lingual dataset creation process and reinforcing the quality of the newly created monolingual datasets.  </p></div>

All these datasets are intended for use as a stan- dard benchmark (as RG-65 already is for the En- glish language) for evaluating word or sense rep- resentations and, more specifically, word similar- ity systems, not only for languages other than En- glish, but also across different languages.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>FR</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
