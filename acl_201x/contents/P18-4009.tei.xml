<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Event Extraction (EE), a challenging task in Na- ture Language Processing (NLP), aims at discov- ering event mentions <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and extracting events which contain event triggers <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and event arguments 5 from texts. For example, in the sentence E1 6 as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, an EE system is expected to dis- cover an Equity Freeze event mention (E1 it- self) triggered by frozen and extract the corre- sponding five arguments with different roles: Na- gafu Ruihua (Role=Shareholder Name), 520,000 shares (Role=Num of Frozen Stock), People's Court of Dalian city (Role=Frozen Institution), May 5,2017 (Role=Freezing Start Date) and 3 years (Role=Freezing End Date). Extracting event instances from texts plays a critical role in build- ing NLP applications such as Information Extrac- tion (IE), Question Answer (QA) and Summariza- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn, 2006)</ref>. Recently, researchers have built some English EE systems, such as EventRegistry <ref type="bibr">7</ref> and Stela <ref type="bibr">8</ref> . However, in financial domain, there is no such effective EE system, especially in Chi- nese.</p><p>Financial events are able to help users obtain competitors' strategies, predict the stock market and make correct investment decisions. For exam- ple, the occurrence of an Equity Freeze event will have a bad effect on the company and the share- holders should make correct decisions quickly to avoid the losses. In business domain, official an- nouncements released by companies represent the occurrence of major events, such as Equity Freeze events, Equity Trading events and so on. So it is valuable to discover event mention and extract events from the announcements. However, there are two challenges in Chinese financial EE.</p><p>Lack of data: most of the EE methods usually adopted supervised learning paradigm which re- lies on elaborate human-annotated data, but there is no labeled corpus for EE in the Chinese finan- cial field.</p><p>Document-level EE: most of the current meth- ods of EE are concentrated on the sentence-level  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Example of an Equity Freeze event triggered by "frozen" and containing five arguments.</p><p>text <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">) (Nguyen et al., 2016</ref>. But an event is usually expressed with multiple sen- tences in a document. In the financial domain da- ta set constructed in this paper, there are 91% of the cases that the event arguments are distributed in the different sentences. For example, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, E1 and E2 describe an Equity Freeze event together.</p><p>To solve the above two problems, we present a framework named DCFEE which can extract document-level events from announcements based on automatically labeled training data. We make use of Distance Supervision (DS) which has been validated to generate labeled data for EE ) to automatically generate large-scaled annotated data. We use a sequence tagging mod- el to automatically extract sentence-level events. And then, we propose a key-event detection mod- el and an arguments-filling strategy to extract the whole event from the document.</p><p>In summary, the contributions of this article are as follows:</p><p>• We propose the DCFEE framework which can automatically generate large amounts of labeled data and extract document-level events from the financial announcements.</p><p>• We introduce an automatic data labeling method for event extraction and give a series of useful tips for constructing Chinese finan- cial event dataset. We propose a document- level EE system mainly based on a neural se- quence tagging model, a key-event detection model, and an arguments-completion strate- gy. The experimental results show the effec- tiveness of it.</p><p>• The DCFEE system has been successful- ly built as an online application which can quickly extract events from the financial an- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>Figure 2 describes the architecture of our proposed DCFEE framework which primarily involves the following two components: (i) Data Genera- tion, which makes use of DS to automatically label event mention from the whole documen- t (document-level data) and annotate triggers and arguments from event mention (sentence-level da- ta); (ii) EE system, which contains Sentence-level Event Extraction (SEE) supported by sentence- level labeled data and Document-level Event Ex- traction (DEE) supported by document-level la- beled data. In the next section, we briefly describe the generation of labeled data and architecture of the EE system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data Generation</head><p>Figure 3 describes the process of labeled data gen- eration based on the method of DS. In this section, we first introduce the data sources (structured data and unstructured data) that we use. And then we describe the method of automatically labeling da- ta. Finally, we will introduce some tips that can be used to improve the quality of the labeled data. The un- structured text data come from official announce- ments released by the companies which are stored in an unstructured form on the web. We obtain these textual data from Sohu securities net <ref type="bibr">10</ref> .</p><p>Method of data generation: annotation data consists of two parts: sentence-level data gener- ated by labeling the event trigger and event argu- ments in the event mention; document-level data generated by labeling the event mention from the document-level announcement. Now the question is, how to find the event triggers. Event arguments and event mention that correspond to the struc- tured event knowledge database are summarized from a mass of announcements. DS has proved its effectiveness in automatically labeling data for Relation Extraction ( ) and Event Extraction ( . Inspired by D- S, we assume that one sentence contains the most event arguments and driven by a specific trigger is likely to be an event mention in an announcement. And arguments occurring in the event mention are <ref type="bibr">10</ref> http://q.stock.sohu.com/cn/000001/gsgg.shtml likely to play the corresponding roles in the even- t. For each type of financial event, we construct a dictionary of event triggers such as frozen in E- quity Freeze event and pledged in Equity Pledge event. So the trigger word can be automatical- ly marked by querying the pre-defined dictionary from the announcements. through these pretreat- ments, structured data can be mapped to the event arguments within the announcements. Therefore, we can automatically identify the event mention and label the event trigger and the event arguments contained in it to generate the sentence-level da- ta, as shown at the bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. Then, the event mention is automatically marked as a pos- itive example and the rest of the sentences in the announcement are marked as negative examples to constitute the document-level data, as shown on the right of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The document-level data and the sentence-level data together form the training data required for the EE system.</p><p>Tips: in reality, there are some challenges in data labeling: the correspondence of financial announcements and event knowledge base; the ambiguity and abbreviation of event arguments. There are some tips we used to solve these problems, examples are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. (i) Decrease the search space: the search space of candidate announcements can be reduced through retrieving key event arguments such as the publish date and the stock code of the announcements.</p><p>(ii) Regular expression: more event arguments can be matched to improve the recall of the labeled data through regular expression. for example, LONCIN CO LTD (Role=Shareholder Name) in the financial event database, but LONCIN in the announcement. We can solve this problem by regular expression and label the LONCIN as an event argument (iii) Rules: some task-driven rules can be used to automatically annotate data. for example, we can mark 12 months (Role=Pledging End Date) by calculating the date difference between 2017-02- 23 (Role=Pledging Start Date) and 2018-02-23 (Role=Pledging End Date). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> depicts the overall architecture of the EE system proposed in this paper which primar- ily involves the following two components: The sentence-level Event Extraction (SEE) purposes to extract event arguments and event triggers from one sentence; The document-level Event Extrac- tion (DEE) aims to extract event arguments from the whole document based on a key event detec- tion model and an arguments-completion strategy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Sentence-level Event Extraction (SEE)</head><p>We formulate SEE as a sequence tagging task and the training data supported by sentence-level la- beled data. Sentences are represented in the BIO format where each character (event triggers, even- t arguments and others) is labeled as B-label if the token is the beginning of an event argumen- t, I-label if it is inside an event argument or O- label if it is otherwise. In recent years, neural networks have been used in most NLP tasks be- cause it can automatically learn features from the text representation. And the Bi-LSTM-CRF mod- el can produce state of the art (or close to) accu- racy on classic NLP tasks such as part of speech (POS), chunking and NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Huang et al., 2015)</ref>. It can effectively use both past and future input fea- tures thanks to a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) component and can also use sentence-level tag information thanks to a Condi- tional Random Field (CRF) layer.</p><p>The specific model implementation of the SEE, as shown on the left of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, is made up of a Bi-LSTM neural network and a CRF layer. Each Chinese character in a sentence is represent- ed by a vector as the input of the Bi-LSTM lay- er 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>). The output of the Bi- LSTM layer is projected to score for each char- acter. And a CRF layer is used to overcome the label-bias problem. The SEE eventually returns the result of the sentence-level EE for each sen- tence in the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Document-level Event Extraction(DEE)</head><p>The DEE is composed of two parts: a key event detection model which aims to discover the even- t mention in the document and an arguments- completion strategy which aims to pad the missing event arguments.</p><p>Key event detection: as shown on the right of <ref type="figure">figure 4</ref>, the input of the event detection is made up of two parts: one is the representation of the event arguments and event trigger come from the output of SEE (blue), and the other is the vector representation of the current sentence(red). The <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Word vectors are trained with a version of word2vec on Chinese WiKi corpus  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: The architecture of event extraction.</p><p>two parts are concatenated as the input feature of the Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) layer. And then the current sentence is classified into two categories: a key event or not.</p><p>Arguments-completion strategy: We have ob- tained the key event which contains most of the event arguments by the DEE, and the event ex- traction results for each sentence in a documen- t by the SEE. For obtaining complete event in- formation, we use arguments-completion strate- gy which can automatically pad the missing even- t arguments from the surrounding sentences. As shown in <ref type="figure">figure 4</ref>, an integrated Pledge event con- tains event arguments in event mention S n and filled event argument 12 months obtained from the sentence S n+1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dataset</head><p>We carry out experiments on four types of fi- nancial events: Equity Freeze (EF) event, Equity Pledge (EP) event, Equity Repurchase (ER) even- t and Equity Overweight (EO) event. A total of 2976 announcements have been labeled by auto- matically generating data. We divided the labeled data into three subsets: the training set (80% of the total number of announcements), developmen- t set (10%) and test set (10%). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the statistics of the dataset. NO.ANN represents the number of announcements can be labeled au- tomatically for each event type. NO.POS repre- sents the total number of positive case sentences (event mentions). On the contrary, NO.NEG rep- resents the number of negative case sentences. The positive and negative case sentences constitute the document-level data as the training data for the DEE. The positive sentences which contain event trigger and a series of event arguments, are labeled as sentence-level training data for the SEE. We randomly select 200 samples (contain 862 event arguments) to manually evaluate the preci- sion of the automatically labeled data. The aver- age precision is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> which demon- strates that our automatically labeled data is of high quality.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Performance of the System</head><p>We use the precision(P ), recall(R) and (F 1 ) to evaluate the DCFEE system. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the performance of the pattern-based method <ref type="bibr">12</ref> and the DCFEE in the extraction of the Equity Freeze event. The experimental results show that the per- formance of the DCFEE is better than that of the pattern-based method in most event arguments ex- traction.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: P , R, F 1 of pattern-based and DCFEE on the Equity Freeze event. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the P , R, F 1 of SEE and DEE on the different event types. It is noteworthy that the golden data used in SEE stage is the automatically generated data and the golden data used in DEE stage comes from the financial event knowledge base. The experimental results show that the effec- tiveness of SEE and DEE, the acceptable precision and expansibility of the DCFEE system presented in this paper.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: P , R, F 1 of SEE, DEE on the different event types.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Method Pattern-based DCFEE Type P (%) R(%) F1(%) P (%) R(%) F1(%)<label>ORG</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">Stage SEE DEE Type P (%) R(%) F1(%) P (%) R(%) F1(%) EF</formula><p>In conclusion, the experiments show that the method based on DS can automatically generate high-quality labeled data to avoid manually label- ing. It also validates the DCFEE proposed in this paper, which can effectively extract events from the document-level view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Application of the DCFEE</head><p>The application of the DCFEE system: an online EE service for Chinese financial texts. It can help financial professionals quickly get the event infor- mation from the financial announcements. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 5</ref> shows a screenshot of the online DCFEE system. Different color words represent differ- ent event arguments' types, underlined sentences represent the event mention in the document. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 5</ref>, we can obtain a complete Equity Freeze event from unstructured text (an announce- ment about Equity Freeze).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>The current EE approaches can be mainly classi- fied into statistical methods, pattern-based method and hybrid method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hogenboom et al., 2016</ref>).</p><p>Statistical method can be divided into two cat- egories: traditional machine learning algorithm based on feature extraction engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn, 2006</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ji and Grishman, 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Liao and Grishman, 2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Reichart and Barzilay, 2012)</ref> and neural network algorithm based on automatic fea- ture extraction , <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>, ( . The pattern method is usually used in industry because it can achieve higher accuracy, but meanwhile a lower recall. In order to improve recall, there are two main re- search directions: build relatively complete pat- tern library and use a semi-automatic method to build trigger dictionary , ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gu et al., 2016)</ref>. Hybrid event-extraction method- s combine statistical methods and pattern-based methods together ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jungermann and Morik, 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bjorne et al., 2010)</ref>. To our best knowledge, there is no system that automatically generates labeled data, and extracts document-level events automat- ically from announcements in Chinese financial field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We present DCFEE, a framework which is able to extract document-level events from Chinese fi- nancial announcements based on automatically la- beled data.
