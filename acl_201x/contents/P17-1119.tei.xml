Both cause a dis- tribution mismatch between training and evaluation, leading to a model that over- fits the flawed training data and performs poorly on the test data. We propose a solu- tion to this mismatch problem by framing it as domain adaptation, treating the flawed training dataset as a source domain and the evaluation dataset as a target domain.</p><p>To this end, we use and build on several recent advances in neural domain adap- tation such as adversarial training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al., 2016</ref>) and domain separation net- work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al., 2016)</ref>, proposing a new effective adversarial training scheme. In both supervised and unsupervised adap- tation scenarios, our approach yields clear improvement over strong baselines. We are interested in addressing two types of data shift common in SLU applications. The first data shift problem happens when we trans- fer from synthetic data to live user data (a deploy- ment shift). This is also known as the "cold-start" problem; a model cannot be trained on the real usage data prior to deployment simply because it does not exist. A common practice is to gener- ate a large quantity of synthetic training data that mimics the expected user behavior. Such synthetic data is crafted using domain-specific knowledge and can be time-consuming. It is also flawed in that it typically does not match the live user data generated by actual users; the real queries submit- ted to these systems are different from what the model designers expect to see.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The second data shift problem happens when we transfer from stale data to current data (a tem- poral shift). In our use case, we have one set of training data from 2013 and wish to handle data from <ref type="bibr">[2014]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2015]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2016]</ref>. This is problematic since the content of the user queries changes over time (e.g., new restaurant or movie names may be added). Consequently, the model performance degrades over time.</p><p>Both shifts cause a distribution mismatch be- tween training and evaluation, leading to a model that overfits the flawed training data and performs poorly on the test data. We propose a solution to this mismatch problem by framing it as domain adaptation, treating the flawed training dataset as a source domain and the evaluation dataset as a target domain. To this end, we use and build on several recent advances in neural domain adap- tation such as adversarial training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al., 2016)</ref> and domain separation network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al., 2016)</ref>, proposing a new adversarial training scheme based on randomized predictions.</p><p>We consider both supervised and unsupervised adaptation scenarios (i.e., absence/presence of la- beled data in the target domain). We find that un- supervised DA can greatly improve performance without requiring additional annotation. Super-vised DA with a small amount of labeled data gives further improvement on top of unsuper- vised DA. In experiments, we show clear gains in both deployment and temporal shifts across 5 test domains, yielding average error reductions of 74.04% and 41.46% for intent classification and 70.33% and 32.0% for slot tagging compared to baselines without adaptation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work 2.1 Domain Adaptation</head><p>Our work builds on the recent success of DA in the neural network framework. Notably, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al. (2016)</ref> propose an adversarial training method for unsupervised DA. They partition the model pa- rameters into two parts: one inducing domain- specific (or private) features and the other domain- invariant (or shared) features.</p><p>The domain- invariant parameters are adversarially trained us- ing a gradient reversal layer to be poor at domain classification; as a consequence, they produce rep- resentations that are domain agnostic. This ap- proach is motivated by a rich literature on the the- ory of DA pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ben-David et al. (2007)</ref>. We describe our use of adversarial training in Sec- tion 3.2.3. A special case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al. (2016)</ref> is developed independently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kim et al. (2016c)</ref> who motivate the method as a generalization of the feature augmentation method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Daumé III (2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al. (2016)</ref> extend the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al. (2016)</ref> by additionally encourag- ing the private and shared features to be mutually exclusive. This is achieved by minimizing the dot product between the two sets of parameters and si- multaneously reconstructing the input (for all do- mains) from the features induced by these param- eters.</p><p>Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al. (2016)</ref> discuss applications in computer vision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref> apply the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al. (2016)</ref> to tackle transfer learning in NLP. They focus on transfer learning between classifi- cation tasks over the same domain ("aspect trans- fer"). They assume a set of keywords associated with each aspect and use these keywords to inform the learner of the relevance of each sentence for that aspect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">BiLSTM Encoder</head><p>We use an LSTM simply as a mapping φ : R d × R d → R d that takes an input vector x and a state vector h to output a new state vector h = φ(x, h). See Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) for a de- tailed description.</p><p>Let C denote the set of character types and W the set of word types. Let ⊕ denote the vec- tor concatenation operation. We encode an utter- ance using the wildly successful architecture given by bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Schuster and Paliwal, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Graves, 2012)</ref>. The model parame- ters Θ associated with this BiLSTM layer are</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Character embedding e c ∈ R 25 for each c ∈ C • Character LSTMs φ C f , φ C b : R 25 × R 25 → R 25</formula><p>• Word embedding e w ∈ R 100 for each w ∈ W</p><p>• Word LSTMs φ W f , φ W b : R 150 ×R 100 → R 100 Let w 1 . . . w n ∈ W denote a word sequence where word w i has character w i (j) ∈ C at position j.

For convenience, we write the entire operation as a mapping BiLSTM Θ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(h 1 . . . h n ) ← BiLSTM Θ (w 1 . . . w n )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Unsupervised DA</head><p>In unsupervised domain adaptation, we assume la- beled data for the source domain but not the target domain. Our approach closely follows the previ- ous work on unsupervised neural domain adapta- tion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al. (2016)</ref>. We have three BiLSTM encoders de- scribed in Section 3.1:</p><p>1. Θ src : induces source-specific features 2. Θ tgt : induces target-specific features 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Reconstruction Loss</head><p>Following previous works, we ground feature learning by reconstructing encoded utterances. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref> use mean squared errors for reconstruc- tion, the former of image pixels and the latter of words in a context window. In contrast, we use an attention-based LSTM that fully re-generates the input utterance and use its log loss. More specifically, let w 1 . . . w n ∈ W be an ut- terance in domain d ∈ {src, tgt}. We first use the relevant encoders as before</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(h d 1 . . . h d n ) ← BiLSTM Θ d (w 1 . . . w n ) (h shd 1 . . . h shd n ) ← BiLSTM Θ shd (w 1 . . . w n ) The concatenated vectors ¯ h i = h d i ⊕ h shd i</formula><p>are fed into the standard attention-based decoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bahdanau et al., 2014</ref>) to define the probability of word w at each position i with state vector µ i−1 (where µ 0 = ¯ h n ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">α j ∝ exp µ i−1 ¯ h j ∀j ∈ {1 . . . n}˜h n}˜ n}˜h i = n j=1 α j ¯ h j µ i = φ R (µ i−1 ⊕ ˜ h i , µ i−1 ) p(w|µ i ) ∝ exp [W 1 rec µ i + b 1 rec ] wwhere Θ rec = {φ R , W 1 rec , b 1 rec } denotes additional parameters.</formula><p>The reconstruction loss is given by the negative log likelihood</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L rec (Θ src , Θ tgt , Θ shd , Θ rec ) = − i log p (w i |µ i )</formula><p>where we iterate over words w i in both the source and target utterances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Adversarial Domain Classification Loss</head><p>Ganin et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(2016)</ref> propose introducing an ad- versarial loss to make shared features domain- invariant. This is motivated by a theoretical result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ben-David et al. (2007)</ref> who show that the gen- eralization error on the target domain depends on how "different" the source and the target domains are. This difference is approximately measured by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">2 1 − 2 inf Θ error(Θ)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where error(Θ) is the domain classification er- ror using model Θ. It is assumed that the source and target domains are balanced so that inf Θ error(Θ) ≤ 1/2 and the difference lies in <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. In other words, we want to make error(Θ) as large as possible in order to generalize well to the target domain. The intuition is that the more domain-invariant our features are, the easier it is to benefit from the source side training when test- ing on the target side. It can also be motivated as a regularization term ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al., 2016)</ref>. Let w 1 . . . w n ∈ W be an utterance in domain d ∈ {src, tgt}. We first use the shared encoder</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(h shd 1 . . . h shd n ) ← BiLSTM Θ shd (w 1 . . . w n )</formula><p>It is important that we only use the shared encoder for this loss. Then we define the probability of domain d for the utterance as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">z i = W 2 adv tanh W 1 adv n i=1 h shd i + b 1 adv + b 2 adv p(d|h i ) ∝ exp ([z i ] d )</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Θ adv = {W 1 adv , W 2 adv , b 1 adv , b 2</formula><p>adv } denotes addi- tional feedfoward parameters. The adversarial do- main classification loss is given by the positive log likelihood</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L adv (Θ shd , Θ adv ) = i log p d (i) |w (i)</formula><p>where we iterate over domain-annotated utter-</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ances (w (i) , d (i) ).</formula><p>Random prediction training While past work only consider using a negative gradient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bousmalis et al., 2016</ref>) or positive log likelihood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhang et al., 2017</ref>) to perform ad- versarial training, it is unclear whether these ap- proaches are optimal for the purpose of "confus- ing" the domain predictor. For instance, mini- mizing log likelihood can lead to a model accu- rately predicting the opposite domain, compromis- ing the goal of inducing domain-invariant repre- sentations. Thus we propose to instead optimize the shared parameters for random domain predic- tions. Specifically, the above loss is replaced with</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">L adv (Θ shd , Θ adv ) = − i log p d (i) |w (i)</formula><p>where d (i) is set to be src with probability 0.5 and tgt with probability 0.5. By optimizing for random predictions, we achieve the desired effect: the shared parameters are trained to induce fea- tures that cannot discriminate between the source and the target domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Non-Adversarial Domain Classification Loss</head><p>In addition to the adversarial loss for domain- invariant parameters, we also introduce a non- adversarial loss for domain-specific parameters.

We compute</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">(h d 1 . . . h d n ) ← BiLSTM Θ d (w 1 . . . w n ) (h shd 1 . . . h shd n ) ← BiLSTM Θ shd (w 1 . . . w n )</formula><p>The orthogonality loss for this utterance is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">L orth (Θ src , Θ tgt , Θ shd ) = i (h d i ) h shd i</formula><p>where we iterate over words i in both the source and target utterances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6">Joint Objective</head><p>For unsupervised DA, we optimize</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">L unsup (Θ src , Θ tgt , Θ shd , Θ tag , Θ rec , Θ adv ) = L tag (Θ src , Θ shd , Θ tag ) + L rec (Θ src , Θ tgt , Θ shd , Θ rec ) + L adv (Θ shd , Θ adv ) + L nadv (Θ src , Θ nadv ) + L nadv (Θ tgt , Θ nadv ) + L orth (Θ src , Θ tgt , Θ shd )</formula><p>with respect to all model parameters.

The slot tagging task is a sequence labeling problem with the goal of identifying entities and chunking of useful information snippets in a user utterance.</p><p>For example, a user could say reserve a table at joeys grill for thursday at seven pm for five people.

For the first DA scenario, we test whether our approach can effectively make a system adapt from experimental, engineered data to real-world, live data. We use synthetic data which domain experts manually create based on a given domain schema 2 before the system goes live as the engineered data. We use transcribed dataset from users' speech input as the live user data. For the second scenario, we test whether our approach can effectively make a system adapt over time. A large number of users will quickly generate a large amount of data, and the usage pattern could also change. We use annotation data over 1 month in 2013 (more precisely August of 2013) as our old dataset, and use the whole data between 2014 and 2016 as our new dataset regardless of whether the data type is engineered or live user. As we describe in the earlier sections, we con- sider both supervised and unsupervised DA. We apply our DA approach with labeled data in the target domain for the supervised setting and with unlabeled data for the unsupervised one. We give details of the baselines and variants of our ap- proach below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results: Unsupervised DA</head><p>We first show our results in the unsupervised DA setting where we have a labeled dataset in the source domain, but only unlabeled data in the tar- get domain. We assume that the amount of data in both datasets is sufficient. Dataset statistics are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The performance of the baselines and our model variants are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. The left side of the table shows the results of the DA scenario of adapting from engineered data to live user data, and the baseline which trained only on the source domain (SRC) show a poor performance, yield- ing on average 48.5% on the intent classification and 42.7% F1-score on the slot tagging. Using our DA approach with a word-level decoder (DA W ) shows a significant increase in performance in all 5 test domains, yielding on average 82.2% intent ac- curacy and 80.5% slot F1-score. The performance increases further using the DA approach with a sentence-level decoder DA S , yielding on average 85.6% intent accuracy and 83.0% slot F1-score.</p><p>The right side of the table shows the results of the DA scenario of adapting from old to new data, and the baseline trained only on SRC also show <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Domain  Train  Train*  Dev  Test  Train  Train*  Dev  Test  calendar  16904  50000  1878 10k  13165  13165 1463 10k  communication  32072  50000  3564 10k  12631  12631 1403 10k  places  23410  50000  2341 10k  21901  21901 2433 10k  reminder  19328  50000  1933 10k  16245  16245 1805 10k  weather  20794  50000  2079 10k  15575  15575 1731 10k  AVG  23590  50000  2359 10k  15903  15903 1767 10k   Table 2</ref>: Data statistics for unsupervised domain adaptation; In the first row, the columns are adaptation of engineered dataset to live user dataset, and and adaptation of old dataset to new dataset.

The results suggest that our DA approach can quickly make a model adapt from synthetic data to real-world data and from old data to new data with the additional use of only 2 to 2.5 more data from the target domain. Aside from the per- formance boost itself, the approach shows even more power since the new data from the target down do not need to be labeled and it only re- quires collecting a little more data from the tar- get domain. We note that the model development sets were created only from the source domain for a fully unsupervised setting. But having the de- velopment set from the target domain shows even more boost in performance although not shown in the results, and labeling only the development set from the target domain is relatively less expensive than labeling the whole dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Results: Supervised DA</head><p>Second, we show our results in the supervised DA setting where we have a sufficient amount of labeled data in the source domain but relatively insufficient amount of labeled data in the target domain. Having more labeled data in the target domain would most likely help with the perfor- mance, but we intentionally made the setting more disadvantageous for our DA approach to better simulate real-world scenarios where there is usu- ally lack of resources and time to label a large amount of new data. For each personal assistant test domain, we only used 1000 training utter- ances to simulate scarcity of newly labeled data, and dataset statistics are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Unlike the unsupervised DA scenario, here we used the development sets created from the target domain shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>The left side of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows the results of the supervised DA approach of adapting from engi- neered data to live user data. The baseline trained only on the source (SRC) shows on average 48.5% intent accuracy and 42.7% slot F1-score. Train- ing only on the target domain (TGT) increases the performance to 71.3% and 65.0%, but training on the union of the source and target domains (Union) again brings the performance down to 48.7% and 42.3%. As shown in the unsupervised setting, us- ing our DA approach (DA) shows significant per- formance increase in all 5 test domains, yielding on average 81.7% intent accuracy and 76.2% slot tagging. The DA approach with adversary domain training (DA A ) shows similar performance com- pared to that of DA, and performance shows more increase when using our DA approach with suf- ficient unlabeled data 5 (DA U ), yielding on aver- age 83.6% and 77.6%. For the second scenario of adapting from old to new dataset, the results show a very similar trend in performance.</p><p>The results show that our supervised DA (DA) approach also achieves a significant performance gain in all 5 test domains, yielding average error reductions of 68.18% and 51.35% for intent clas- sification and 60.90% and 50.09% for slot tagging. The results suggest that an effective domain adap- tation can be done using the supervised DA by having only a handful more data of 1k newly la- beled data points. In addition, having both a small amount of newly labeled data combined with suffi- cient unlabeled data can help the models perform even better. The poor performance of using the union of both source and target domain data might be due to the relatively very small size of the tar- get domain data, overwhelmed by the data in the source domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Results: Adversarial Domain Classification Loss</head><p>Eng.  The impact on the performance of two different adversarial classification losses are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table  6</ref>. RAND represents the unsupervised DA model with sentence-level decoder (DA S ) using random prediction loss. The ADV shows the performance of same model using the adversarial loss of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganin et al. (2016)</ref> as described in 3.2.3. Unfortunately, in the deployment shift scenario, using the adver- sarial loss fails to provide any improvement on intent classification accuracy and slot tagging F1 score, achieving 82.5% intent accuracy and 79.8% slot F1 score. These results align with our hypoth- esis that the adversarial loss using does not con- fuse the classifier sufficiently.</p></div>

The distance between two datasets is computed byˆd byˆ byˆd A = 2(1 − 2 min {ε, 1 − ε})</p><p>where ε is a generalization error in discriminating between the source and target datasets. The range ofˆdofˆ ofˆd A distance is between 0 and 2.0. 0 is the best case where adversary training successfully fake shared encoder to predict do- mains. In other words, thanks to adversary train- ing our model make the domain-invariant features in shared encoder in order to generalize well to the target domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Vocabulary distance between engineered data and live user data</head><p>The results in shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 8</ref> show the discrep- ancy between two datasets. We measure the de- gree of overlap between vocabulary V employed Eng.  by the two datasets. We simply take the Jaccard coefficient between the two sets of such vocabu- lary:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">d V (s, t) = 1 − JC(V s , V t ),</formula><p>where V s is the set of vocabulary in source s do- main, and V t is the corresponding set for target t domain and JC(A, B) = |A∩B| |A∪B| is the Jaccard coefficient, measuring the similarity of two sets. The distance d V is the high it means that they are not shared with many words. Overall, the distance between old and new dataset are still far and the number of overlapped are small, but better than live user case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have addressed two types of data shift common in SLU applications: 1. transferring from synthetic data to live user data (a deployment shift), and 2. transferring from stale data to cur- rent data (a temporal shift). Our method is based on domain adaptation, treating the flawed train- ing dataset as a source domain and the evaluation dataset as a target domain. We use and build on several recent advances in neural domain adapta- tion such as adversarial training and domain sep- aration network, proposing a new effective adver- sarial training scheme based on randomized pre- dictions. In both supervised and unsupervised adaptation scenarios, our approach yields clear im- provement over strong baselines.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="true"><head>Table 1 gives</head><label>1</label><figDesc>a summary of the 5 test domains.
