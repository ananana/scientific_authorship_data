				<p>Central to many sentiment analysis tasks are sentiment lexicons (SLs). SLs exhibit polarity inconsistencies. Previous work studied the problem of checking the consistency of an SL for the case when the entries have categorical labels (positive, negative or neutral) and showed that it is NP-hard. In this paper, we address the more general problem, in which polarity tags take the form of a continuous distribution in the interval [0, 1]. We show that this problem is polynomial. We develop a general framework for addressing the consistency problem using linear programming (LP) theory. LP tools allow us to uncover inconsistencies efficiently, paving the way to building SL debugging tools. We show that previous work corresponds to 0-1 integer programming, a particular case of LP. Our experimental studies show a strong correlation between polarity consistency in SLs and the accuracy of sentiment tagging in practice.</p>

(2) Dictionary-based acquisition relies on a set of seed words to expand its coverage to similar words. There are over thirty dictionary-based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blum et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chen and Skiena, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Choi and Wiebe, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Feng et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hassan and Radev, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kamps et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mohammad et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Takamura et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Turney, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Williams and Anand, 2009</ref>), most of them based on WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>, such as Sen- tiWordNet (SWN)( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baccianella et al., 2010)</ref> and Q-WordNet (QWN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agerri and García-Serrano, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(3)</ref> Corpus-based acquisition expands a set of seed words with the use of a large docu- ment corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Breck et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bross and Ehrig, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Choi and Cardie, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ding et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Du et al., 2010</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jijkoun et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Klebanov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Peng and Park, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wu and Wen, 2010)</ref>. Method (1) generally produces the most reliable annotations, however the considerable ef- fort required to yield substantial lexicons makes it less useful in practice. The appeals of (2) and (3) lie in the formalism of their models and their capability of producing large-sized SLs. SLs are either word or sense/synset oriented. We refer to the former as Sentiment Word Lexicons (SWLs), e.g., GI, OF, and AL, and to the latter as Senti- ment Sense Lexions (SSLs), e.g., SWN, QWN, and Micro-WNOp. Besides the method of compi- lation, SLs may also vary with regard to sentiment annotation.</p><p>Polarity disagreements are noted across SLs that do (SWN, Q-WordNet) and do not (AL, GI) reference WordNet. For instance, the adjectives panicky and terrified, have negative and positive polarities in OF, respectively. They each have only one synset which they share in Word- Net: "thrown into a state of intense fear or des- peration". Assuming that there is an intrinsic re-lationship between the sentiments of a word and its meanings, a single synset polarity assignment to this synset cannot agree with both positive and negative at the word level. If the information given in WordNet is accurate (the Oxford and Cam- bridge dictionaries give only this meaning for both words) then there must be an annotation inconsis- tency in OF, called a polarity inconsistency. While some inconsistencies are easy to detect, manual consistency checking of an entire SL is an imprac- tical endeavor, primarily because of the sheer size (SWN has over 206,000 word-sense pairs). Ad- ditionally, WordNet's complex network structure renders manual checking virtually impossible; an instance of a polarity inconsistency may entail an entire sub-network of words and senses. In this paper we develop a rigorous formal method based on linear programming (LP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Schrijver, 1986)</ref> for polarity consistency checking of SLs with accom- panying methods to unearth mislabeled words and synsets when consistency is not satisfied.</p><p>We translate the polarity consistency problem (PCP) into a form of the LP problem, suitable as the input to a standard LP solver, and utilize the functionality available in modern LP software (e.g., identifying an irreducible infeasible subset) to pinpoint the sources of inconsistencies when they occur. In our experimentation we are able to quickly uncover numerous intra-and inter-lexicon inconsistencies in all of the input SLs tested and to suggest lexicon entries for a linguist to focus on in "debugging" the lexicon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background and Previous Work</head><p>Sentiment resources have taken two basic ap- proaches to polarity annotation: discrete and frac- tional. In the discrete approach, polarity is defined to be one of the discrete values positive, negative, or neutral. A word or a synset takes exactly one of the three values. QWN, AL, GI, and OF follow the discrete polarity annotation. In the fractional approach, polarity is defined as a 3-tuple of non- negative real numbers that sum to 1, correspond- ing to the positive, negative, and neutral values re- spectively. SWN, Micro-WNOp, and Hassan and Radev (2010) employ a fractional polarity anno- tation. For example, the single synset of the ad- jective admissible in WordNet has the senti- ment tags positive in <ref type="bibr">QWN and .25, .625, .125</ref> in SWN, so here SWN gives a primarily negative polarity with some positive and less neutral polar- ity. We denote by PCP-D and PCP-F the polarity laughable :</p><p>positive risible : ? comic : negative s 2 : "of or relating to or characteristic of comedy" s 3 : "arousing or provoking laughter" s 1 : "so unrea- sonable as to invite derision" 0.5 0.5 1 0.6 0.4</p><p>Figure 1: Discrete vs. fractional polarity consis- tency. Example taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al. (2012)</ref>.</p><p>consistency problem for the discrete and fractional polarity annotations, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al. (2012)</ref> introduces the PCP for do- main independent SLs and gives a solution to a particular form of the PCP-D, but that method cannot solve PCP-F. For example, they show that the adjectives laughable, comic, and risible ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) constitute an inconsistency in the discrete case. AL gives positive polarity for laughable and OF gives negative for comic. If s 2 is not positive then laughable is not pos- itive and if s 2 is not negative then comic is not negative, so there is no assignment of s 2 that satis- fies the whole system. Hence there is an incon- sistency. However, the following fractional po- larity tags do satisfy the system: s 1 : 1, 0, 0, s 2 : .66, .34, 0, s 3 : 0, 1, 0, where the meaning of the second tag, for instance, is that s 2 is .66 pos- itive, .34 negative, and 0 neutral. We thus see that the discrete polarity annotation is rigid and leads to more inconsistencies, whereas the fractional an- notation captures more naturally the polarity spec- trum of a word or synset. In this paper we give a solution to the PCP-F. The differences between our solution and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al. (2012)</ref> give some insight into the general differences between the fractional and discrete problems. First, the discrete case is intractable, i.e., computationally NP-complete ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al., 2012)</ref>; we show in this paper (Section 3.2) that the fractional case is tractable (solvable in polynomial time). Second, the PCP-D is solved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al. (2012)</ref> by translation to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Schaefer, 1978)</ref>; here we recast the PCP- F in terms of LP theory. Third, we show that the LP framework is a natural setting for the PCP as a whole, and that the PCP-D corresponds to the 0- 1 integer LP problem (Section 3.2), a classic NP- complete problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karp, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Our experiments (Section 5.4) show that cor- recting even a small number of inconsistencies can greatly improve the accuracy of sentiment annota- tion tasks. We implement our algorithm as a versa- tile tool for debugging SLs, which helps locate the sources of error in SLs. We apply our algorithm to both SWLs and SSLs and demonstrate the useful- ness of our approach to improving SLs.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are:</p><p>• solve the PCP-F;</p><p>• show that the PCP-F is tractable;</p><p>• show that the PCP is an instance of LP;</p><p>• develop a technique for identifying inconsis- tencies in SLs of various types; • implement our algorithm as a prototype SL debugger; • show that there is a strong correlation be- tween polarity inconsistency in SLs and the performance of sentiment tagging tools de- veloped on them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Problem Definition</head><p>In this section we give a formal characterization of the polarity assignment of words and synsets in SLs using WordNet. We use −, +, 0 to denote negative, positive, and neutral polarities, respec- tively, throughout the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Polarity Representation</head><p>We define the polarity of a synset or word r in WordNet to be a discrete probabil- ity distribution, called a polarity distribution: P + (r), P − (r), P 0 (r) ≥ 0 with P + (r) + P − (r) + P 0 (r) = 1. P + (r), P − (r) and P 0 (r) represent the "likelihoods" that r is positive, negative or neutral, respectively. For instance, the WordNet synset "worthy of reliance or trust" of the adjec- tive reliable is given the polarity distribution P + = .375, P − = .0 and P 0 = .625 in Senti- WordNet. We may drop r from the notation if the meaning is clear from context. The use of a polar- ity distribution to describe the polarity of a word or synset is shared with many previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baccianella et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kim and Hovy, 2006</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">WordNet</head><p>A word-synset network N is a 4-tuple (W, S, E, f ) where W is a finite set of words, S is a finite set of synsets, E ⊆ W × S and f is a function assigning a positive integer to each element in E. For any word w and synset s, s is a synset of w if (w, s) ∈ E. For a pair (w, s) ∈ E, f (w, s) is called the frequency of use of w in the sense given by s. For a word w, we let f req(w) denote the sum of all f (w, s) such that (w, s) ∈ E. We define the relative frequency of w with s by rf (w,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s) = f (w,s)</formula><p>f req(w) . If f (w, s) = 0, the frequency of each synset of w is increased by a small constant . We use = .1 in our prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Word Polarities</head><p>We contend that there exists a relation between the sentiment orientation of a word and the polarities of its related senses (synsets), and we make the as- sumption that this relation takes the form of a lin- ear function. Thus, for w ∈ W and p ∈ {+, −, 0}, the polarity distribution of w is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P p (w) = s∈Sw g(w, s) · P p (s),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P p (s) is the polarity value of synset s with polarity p and g(w, s) is a rational num- ber. For example, g can be the relative frequency of s with respect to w in WordNet: g(w, s) = rf (w, s); ∀w ∈ W, s ∈ S. Alternatively, for each word w we can draw g(w, ·) from a Zipfian dis- tribution, following the observation that the distri- bution of word senses roughly follows a Zipfian power-law <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kilgarriff, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sanderson, 1999)</ref>. In this paper, we will assume g(w, s) = rf (w, s).</p><p>For example, the three synsets of the adjec- tive reliable with relative frequencies 9 11 , 1 11 , and 1 11 , respectively, are given the distributions .375, 0, .625, .5, 0, .5, and .625, 0, .375 in SentiWordNet. So for reliable we have P + = 9 11 0.375 + 1 11 0.5 + 1 11 0.625 ≈ 0.41, P − = 0, and P 0 = 9 11 0.625 + 1 11 0.5 + 1 11 0.375 ≈ 0.59.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Modeling Sentiment Orientation in SLs</head><p>Words and synsets have unique polarities in some SLs, e.g., AL and OF. For instance, reliable has positive polarity in AL, GI, and OF. The question is: what does a discrete annotation of reliable tell us about its polarity distribution? One might take it to mean that the polarity distri- bution is simply 1, 0, 0. This contradicts the in- formation in SWN, which gives some neutral po- larity for all of the synsets of reliable. So a better polarity distribution would allow P 0 &gt; 0. Furthermore, given that .41, 0, .59, .40, 0, .60, and .45, 0, .55 give virtually identical informa- tion to a sentiment analyst, it seems unreasonable to expect exactly one to be the correct polarity tag for reliable and the other two incorrect. Therefore, instead of claiming to pinpoint an ex- act polarity distribution for a word, we propose to set a boundary on its variation. This establishes a range of values, instead of a single point, in which SLs can be said to agree. Thus, for a word w, we can define</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">polarity(w) = + if P + &gt; P − − if P − &gt; P +<label>(2)</label></formula><p>which we refer to as MAX POL. This model is adopted either explicitly or implicitly by numer- ous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hassan and Radev, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kim and Hovy, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kim and Hovy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Qiu et al., 2009)</ref>. Another model is the majority sense model, called MAJORITY, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al., 2012)</ref>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">polarity(w) = + if P + &gt; P − + P 0 − if P − &gt; P + + P 0<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Another polarity model, MAX, is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">polarity(w) = + if P + &gt; P − &amp; P + &gt; P 0 − if P − &gt; P + &amp; P − &gt; P 0<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For instance, reliable conveys positive po- larity according to MAX POL, since P + &gt; P − , but neutral according to MAJORITY. When the condition of being neither positive nor negative can be phrased as a conjunction of linear in- equalities, as is the case with MAJORITY and MAX POL, then we define neutral as not positive and not negative. These model definitions can be applied to synsets as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Polarity Consistency Definition</head><p>Instead of defining consistency for SLs dependent on a choice of model, we develop a generic defi- nition applicable to a wide variety of models, in- cluding all of those discussed above. We require that the polarity of a word or synset in the network N be characterized by a set of linear inequalities (constraints) with rational coefficients. Formally, for each word w ∈ W, the knowledge that w has a discrete polarity p ∈ {+, −, 0} is characterized by a set of linear inequalities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ψ(w, p) = {a i,0 P + + a i,1 P − + a i,2 P 0 b i }, (5)</formula><p>where ∈ {≤, &lt;} and a i,0 , a i,1 , a i,2 , b i ∈ Q, i = 0, 1, . . . , m. For instance, if the MAX model is used, for w = worship whose polarity is pos- itive in OF, we get the following set of inequali- ties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ψ(w, +) = {P + −P − &gt; 0, P + −P 0 &gt; 0} = {(−1)P + +1P − +0P 0 &lt; 0, (−1)P + +0P − +1P 0 &lt; 0}.</formula><p>Let L be an SL. We denote the system of in- equalities introduced by all words and synsets in L with known polarities in the network N by Ψ (N , L). The variables in Ψ (N , L) are perseverance w 1 : + persistence w 2 : 0 pertinacity w 3 : − tenacity w 4 : + s 1 : "persistent determination" s 3 : "the property of a continuous period of time" s 2 : "the act of persisting or persevering"</p><p>0.5 0.29 1 1 0.5 0.7 0.01</p><p>Figure 2: A network of 4 words and 3 synsets P + (r), P − (r) and P 0 (r), r ∈ W ∪ S.

Let w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , and w 4 be the nouns perseverance, persistence, pertinacity, and tenacity, respectively, which are in OF with polarities +, 0, −, and +, respectively <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. Assuming the MAJORITY model,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ψ(w 1 , +) = {P + (w 1 ) &gt; P − (w 1 ) + P 0 (w 1 )} = {P + (w 1 ) &gt; 1 − P + (w 1 )} = {−P + (w 1 ) &lt; − 1 2 }, and ψ(w 2 , 0) = {P + (w 2 ) ≤ P − (w 2 ) + P 0 (w 2 ), P − (w 2 ) ≤ P + (w 2 ) + P 0 (w 2 )} = {P + (w 2 ) ≤ 1 2 , P − (w 2 ) ≤ 1 2 }. Similarly, ψ(w 3 , −) = {−P − (w 3 ) &lt; − 1 2 } and ψ(w 4 , −) = {−P + (w 4 ) &lt; − 1 2 }. Definition 1. A sentiment lexicon L is consistent if the system Φ (N, L) is feasible, i.e., has a solution.</formula><p>The PCP is then the problem of deciding if a given SL L is consistent. In general, PCP can be stated as follows: Given an assignment of polar- ities to the words, does there exist an assignment of polarities to the synsets that agrees with that of the words? If the polarity annotation is discrete, we have the PCP-D; if the polarity is fractional, we have PCP-F. Our focus is PCP-F in this paper.</p><p>The benefits of a generic problem model are at least two-fold. First, different linguists may have different views about the kinds of inequalities one should use to express the probability distribution of a word with a unique polarity in some SL. The new model can accommodate divergent views as long as they are expressed as linear constraints. Second, the results proven for the generic model will hold for any particular instance of the model.</p></div>

LP problems are ex- pressed in standard form as follows: minimize c T x subject to Ax ≤ b (6) and x ≥ 0 x represents the vector of variables (to be determined), c and b are vec- tors of (known) co- efficients, A is a (known) matrix of coefficients, and (·) T is the matrix transpose. An LP algorithm finds a point in the feasible region where c T x has the smallest value, if such a point exists.

Equality. The system Φ (N , L) contains con- straints of the form P + (s)+P − (s)+P 0 (s) = 1 for each s ∈ S, but observe that there are no equal- ity constraints in the standard LP form (Equation 6). The usual conversion procedure is to replace a given equality constraint: a T x = b, with: a T x ≤ b and −a T x ≤ −b. However, this procedure in- creases the number of constraints in Φ (N , L) lin- early. This can have a significant computation im- pact since Φ (N , L) may have thousands of con- straints (see discussion in Section 5.3). Instead, we can show that the system F obtained by per- forming the following two-step transformation is equivalent to Φ (N , L), in the sense that F is fea- sible iff Φ (N , L) is feasible. For every s ∈ S, (Step 1) we convert each P + (s)+P − (s)+P 0 (s) = 1 to P + (s)+P − (s) ≤ 1, and (Step 2) we replace ev- ery P 0 (s) in Φ (N , L) with 1 −P + (s) −P − (s).</p><p>Strict Inequalities. Strict inequalities are not allowed in LP and their presence in inequality sys- tems in general poses difficulties to inequality sys- tem solvers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goberna et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goberna and Rodriguez, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ghaoui et al., 1994)</ref>. Fortu- nately results developed by the LP community al- low us to overcome this obstacle and maintain the flexibility of our proposed model. We introduce a new variable y ≥ 0, and for every strict con- straint of the form a T x &lt; b, we rewrite the in- equality as a T x + y ≤ b. Let Φ (N , L) be this new system of constraints. We modify the objec- tive function (previously null) to maximize y (i.e., minimize −y). Denote by F the LP that maxi- mizes y subject to Φ (N , L). We can show that Φ (N , L) is feasible iff F is feasible and y = 0. A sketch of the proof is as follows: if y &gt; 0 then a T x + y ≤ b implies a T x &lt; b. Conversely, if a T x &lt; b then ∃y &gt; 0 such that a T x + y ≤ b, and maximizing for y will yield a y &gt; 0 iff one is feasible. This step is omitted if we have no strict constraints in Φ (N , L).</p><p>Example (continued). The formulations of ψ(w 1 , +), ψ(w 3 , −), and ψ(w 4 , +) involve strict inequalities, so they are rewritten in Φ (N , L), e.g., ψ (w 4 , +) = {−P + (s 1 ) + y ≤ − 1 2 }. We denote by Φ(N , L) the standard form of Φ (N , L) obtained by applying the above steps. This is the input to an LP solver. Theorem 1. Sentiment lexicon L is polarity con- sistent iff Φ(N , L) is feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Time Complexity</head><p>For the network N and an SL L, the above trans- lation algorithm converts the PCP into an LP problem on the order of O(|E|), a polynomial time conversion. The general class of linear pro- gramming problems includes subclasses that are NP-hard, such as the integer linear programming (ILP) problems, as well as polynomial solvable subclasses. We observe that our problem is rep- resented by a system of rational linear inequali- ties. This class of LP problems is solvable in poly- nomial time <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Khachiyan, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gács and Lovász, 1981)</ref>. This (informally) proves that the PCP-F is solvable in polynomial time. PCP is NP-complete in the discrete case <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dragut et al., 2012</ref>). This is not surprising since in our LP formulation of the PCP, the discrete case corresponds to the 0-1 in- teger programming (BIP) subclass. (Recall that in the discrete case each synset has a unique polar- ity.) BIP is the special case of integer program- ming where variables are required to be 0 or 1. BIP is a classic NP-hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Garey and Johnson, 1990)</ref>. We summarize these statements in the fol- lowing theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2. The PCP-F problem is P and the PCP-D is NP-complete.</p><p>We proved a more general and more compre- hensive result than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al. (2012)</ref>. The PCP solved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al. (2012)</ref> is a particular case of PCP-D: it can be obtained by instantiating our framework with the MAJORITY model (Equation 3) and requiring each synset to take a unique polar- ity. We believe that the ability to encompass both fractional and discrete cases within one frame- work, that of LP, is an important contribution, be- cause it helps to give structure to the general prob- lem of polarity consistency and to contextualize the difference between the approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Towards Debugging SLs</head><p>Simply stating that an SL is inconsistent is of lit- tle practical use unless accompanying assistance in diagnosing and repairing inconsistencies is pro- vided. Automated assistance is necessary in the face of the scale and complexity of modern SLs: e.g., AL has close to 7,000 entries, SWN annotates the entirety of WordNet, over 206,000 word-sense pairs. There are unique and interesting problems associated with inconsistent SLs, among them: (1) isolate a (small) subset of words/synsets that is po- larity inconsistent, but becomes consistent if one of them is removed; we call this an Irreducible Polarity Inconsistent Subset (IPIS); (2) return an IPIS with smallest cardinality (intuitively, such a set is easiest to repair); (3) find all IPISs, and (4) find the largest polarity consistent subset of an in- consistent SL. In the framework of linear systems of constraints, the problems (1) -(4) correspond to (i) the identification of an Irreducible Infeasi- ble Subset (IIS) of constraints within Φ(N , L), (ii) finding IIS of minimum cardinality, (iii) finding all IISs and (iv) finding the largest set of constraints in Φ(N , L) that is feasible, respectively. An IIS is an infeasible subset of constraints that becomes feasible if any single constraint is removed. Prob- lems (ii) -(iv) are NP-hard and some may even be difficult to approximate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amaldi and Kann, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chinneck, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chakravarti, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tamiz et al., 1996)</ref>. We focus on problem (1) in this paper, which we solve via IIS discovery. We keep a bi- jective mapping from words and synsets to con- straints such that for any given constraint, we can uniquely identify the word or synset in Φ(N , L) from which it was introduced. Hence, once an IIS is isolated, we know the corresponding words or synsets. Modern LP solvers typically can give an IIS when a system is found to be infeasible, but none give all IISs or the IIS of minimum size. Example (continued). The polarity assignments of w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , and w 4 , are consistent iff there exist polarity distributions P + (s i ), P − (s i ), P 0 (s i ) for i = 1, 2, 3, such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">y &gt; 0 ψ(w 1 , +) : −.5P + (s 1 ) + .5P + (s 2 ) + y ≤ − 1 2 , ψ(w 2 ,0):.29P + (s 1 ) + .01P + (s 2 ) + .7P + (s 3 ) ≤ 1 2 AND .29P − (s 1 ) + .01P − (s 2 ) + .7P − (s 3 ) ≤ 1 2 , ψ(w 3 , −) : −P − (s 1 ) + y ≤ − 1 2 , ψ(w 4 , +) : −P + (s 1 ) + y ≤ − 1 2 , υ(s 1 ): P + (s 1 )+P − (s 1 ) ≤ 1AND P + (s 1 ), P − (s 1 ) ≥ 0, υ(s 2 ): P + (s 2 )+P − (s 2 ) ≤ 1AND P + (s 2 ), P − (s 2 ) ≥ 0, υ(s 3 ): P + (s 3 )+P − (s 3 ) ≤ 1AND P + (s 3 ), P − (s 3 ) ≥ 0. Upon examination, if y &gt; 0, then ψ(w 3 , −) im- plies P − (s 1 ) &gt; 1 2 and ψ(w 4 , +) implies P + (s 1 ) &gt; 1 2 . Then P + (s 1 ) + P − (s 1 ) &gt; 1, contradicting υ(s 1 ).</formula><p>Hence, this LP system is infeasible. More- over {ψ(w 3 , −), ψ(w 4 , +), υ(s 1 )} is an IIS. Trac- ing back we get that the set of words {w 3 , w 4 } is inconsistent. Therefore it is an IPIS. Isolating IPISs helps focus SL diagnosis and re- pair efforts. Fixing SLs via IIS isolation proceeds iteratively: (1) isolate an IIS, (2) determine a re- pair for this IIS, (3) if the model is still infeasi- ble, go to step (1). This approach is well sum- marized by Greenberg's aphorism: "diagnosis = isolation + explanation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Greenberg, 1993)</ref>. The proposed use requires human interaction to effect the changes to the lexicon. One might ask if this involvement is strictly necessary; in response we draw a parallel between our SL debugger and a software debugger. A software debugger can iden- tify a known programming error, say the use of an undefined variable. It informs the program- mer, but it does not assign a value to the vari- able itself. It requires the user to make the de- sired assignment. Similarly, our debugger can deterministically identify an inconsistent compo- nent, but it cannot deterministically decide which elements to adjust. In most cases, this is simply not an objective decision. To illustrate this point, from our example, we know that minimally one  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1,486  377  2  0  1,865  GI  1,337  121  1,474  1,050  3,982  SWLs   OF  2,608  775  1,907  1,501  6,791  SWN 18,156 3,621 82,115 13,767 117,659  QWN 4,060  40  7,404  4,006 15,510  SSLs   MWN  255  30  487  283  1,055   Table 1</ref>: Counts of words/synsets in each SL of pertinacity(−) and tenacity(+) must be adjusted, but the determination as to which re- quires the subjective analysis of a domain expert.</p><note type="other">. adv. noun verb total UN 3,084 940 2,340 1,812 8,176 AL</note><p>In this paper, we do not repair any of the dis- covered inconsistencies.

We find no inconsisten- cies in AL, only 2 in GI, and 35 in both UN and OF <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>). (Recall that an inconsistency is a set of words whose polarities cannot be concomi- tantly satisfied.) These numbers do not represent all possible inconsistencies (See discussion in Sec- tion 4). In general, the number of IISs for an infea- sible system can be exponential in the size of the system Φ(N , L) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chakravarti, 1994)</ref>, however our results suggest that in practice this does not occur.</p><p>Compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dragut et al.

These incon- sistencies are obtained in the first iteration of their SAT-Solver. This shows that about 86% of incon- sistent words in a discrete framework can be made consistent in a fractional system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Inconsistencies in SSLs</head><p>In this set of experiments we check the polarity inconsistencies between SWLs and SSLs. We pair each SSL with each of the SWLs. SentiWordNet. SWN is an automatically gen- erated SL with a fractional polarity annotation of every synset in WordNet. Since SWN annotates every synset in WordNet, there are no free vari- ables in this trial. Each variable P p∈{+,−,0} (s) for s ∈ S is fully determined by SWN, so this amounts to a constant on the left hand side of each inequality. Our task is to simply check whether the inequality holds between the constant on the left and that on the right. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> gives the proportion of words from each SWL that is inconsistent with SWN. We see there is substantial disagreement be- tween SWN and all of the SWLs, in most cases more than 70% disagreement. For example, 5,260 of the 6,921 words in OF do not agree with the polarities assigned to their senses in SWN. This outcome is deeply surprising given that all these SLs are domain independent -no step in their construction processes hints to a specific domain knowledge. This opens up the door to future anal- ysis of SL acquisition. For instance, examining the impact that model choice (e.g., MAJORITY vs. MAX) has on inter-lexicon agreement.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> gives the inconsis- tencies per user in each group. For Groups 2 and 3, we give the average number of inconsistencies among the users (Avg. Incons. in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>) as well as the inconsistencies of the averaged annotations (Avg. User in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>).</p><p>Micro-WNOp gives us an opportunity to an- alyze the robustness of our method by compar- ing the number of inconsistencies of the individ- ual users to that of the averaged annotation. Intu- itively, we expect that the average number of in- consistencies in a group of users to be close to the number of inconsistencies for the user averaged annotations. This is clearly apparent from <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table  5</ref>, when comparing Lines 4 and 5 in Group 2 and Lines 3 and 4 in Group 3. For example, Group 2 has an average of 68 inconsistencies for OF, which is very close to the number of inconsistencies, 63, obtained for the group averaged annotations. This study suggests a potential application of our al- gorithm: to estimate the confidence weight (trust) of a user's polarity annotation. A user with good polarity consistency receives a higher weight than one with poor polarity consistency. This can be applied in a multi-annotator SL scenario.</p></div>

We use a third-party sentiment anno- tation tool that utilizes SLs, Opinion Parser (Liu, 2012). We give the instantiations of D below. In (1), we use the dataset aclImdb (Maas et al., 2011), which consists of 50,000 reviews, and the SLs UN and SWN. Let UN and SWN be the sub- sets of UN and SWN, respectively, with the prop- erty that they have the same set of (word, pos) pair entries and word appears in aclImdb. UN and SWN have 6,003 entries. We select from aclImdb the reviews with the property that they contain at least 50 words in SWN and UN . This gives 516 negative and 567 positive reviews, a to- tal of 1,083 reviews containing a total of 31,701 sentences. Opinion Parser is run on these sen- tences using SWN and UN . We obtain that 16,741 (52.8%) sentences acquire different polar- ities between the two SLs.</p><p>In (2), we use 110 randomly selected sentences from aclImdb, which we manually tagged with their overall polarities. We use OF and OF , where OF is the version of OF after just six inconsisten- cies are manually fixed. We run Opinion Parser on these sentences using OF and OF . We obtain an accuracy of 42% with OF and 47% with OF , an improvement of 8.5% for just a small fraction of corrected inconsistencies.</p><p>These two experiments show a strong correla- tion between polarity inconsistency in SLs and its effect on sentiment tagging in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>Resolving polarity inconsistencies helps to im- prove the accuracy of sentiment analysis tasks. We show that LP theory provides a natural framework for the polarity consistency problem. We give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether an SL is polarity consistent. If an SL is found to be inconsistent, we provide an efficient method to uncover sets of words or word senses that are in- consistent and require linguists' attention. Effec- tive SL debugging tools such as this will help in the development of improved SLs for use in senti- ment analysis tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="true"><head>Table 2 : SWL-Internal Inconsistencies</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Inconsistency Ratios
