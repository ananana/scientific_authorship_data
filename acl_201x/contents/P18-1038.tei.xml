				<p>We demonstrate that an SHRG-based parser can produce semantic graphs much more accurately than previously shown, by relating synchronous production rules to the syntacto-semantic composition process. Our parser achieves an accuracy of 90.35 for EDS (89.51 for DMRS) in terms of ELEMENTARY DEPENDENCY MATCH, which is a 4.87 (5.45) point improvement over the best existing data-driven model, indicating, in our view, the importance of linguistically-informed derivation for data-driven semantic parsing. This accuracy is equivalent to that of English Resource Grammar guided models, suggesting that (recurrent) neural network models are able to effectively learn deep linguistic knowledge from annotations.</p>

Parsing to semantic graphs has been extensively studied re- cently.</p><p>At the risk of oversimplifying, work in this area can be divided into three types, according to how much structural information of a target graph is ex- plicitly modeled. Parsers of the first type throw an input sentence into a sequence-to-sequence model and leverage the power of deep learning technolo- gies to obtain auxiliary symbols to transform the output sequence into a graph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Peng et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Konstas et al., 2017)</ref>. The strategy of the second type is to gradually generate a graph in a greedy search fashion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Buys and Blunsom, 2017</ref>). Usually, a transition system is de- fined to handle graph construction. The last so- lution explicitly associates each basic part with a target graph score, and casts parsing as the search for the graphs with highest sum of partial scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Flanigan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cao et al., 2017)</ref>. Although many parsers achieve encouraging results, they are very hard for linguists to interpret and understand, partially because they do not explicitly model the syntacto-semantic composition process which is a significant characteristic of natural languages.</p><p>In theory, Synchronous Hyperedge Replace- ment Grammar (SHRG; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Drewes et al., 1997</ref>) pro- vides a mathematically sound framework to con- struct semantic graphs. In practice, however, ini- tial results on the utility of SHRG for seman- tic parsing were somewhat disappointing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Peng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Peng and Gildea, 2016)</ref>. In this pa- per, we show that the performance that can be achieved by an SHRG-based parser is far higher than what has previously been demonstrated. We focus here on relating SHRG rules to the syntacto- semantic composition process because we feel that information about syntax-semantics interface has been underexploited in the data-driven pars- ing architecture. We demonstrate the feasibility of inducing a high-quality, linguistically-informed SHRG from compositional semantic annotations licensed by English Resource Grammar <ref type="bibr">(ERG;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Flickinger, 2000</ref>), dubbed English Resource Se- mantics 1 (ERS).

Our parser achieves an accuracy of 90.35 for EDS and 89.51 for DMRS in terms of EL- EMENTARY DEPENDENCY MATCH (EDM) which outperforms the best existing grammar-free model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Buys and Blunsom, 2017</ref>) by a significant mar- gin (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). This marked result affirms the value of modeling the syntacto-semantic compo- sition process for semantic parsing. On sentences that can be parsed by ERG-guided parsers, e.g. PET <ref type="bibr">2</ref> or ACE 3 , significant accuracy gaps between ERG-guided parsers and data-driven parsers are repeatedly reported (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The main challenge for ERG-guided parsing is lim- ited coverage. Even for treebanking on WSJ sen- tences from PTB, such a parser lacks analyses for c.a. 11% of sentences ( ). Our parser yields equivalent accuracy to ERG-guided parsers and equivalent coverage, full-coverage in fact, to data-driven parsers. We see this investi- gation as striking a balance between data-driven and grammar-driven parsing. It is not our goal to argue against the use of unification grammar in high-performance deep linguistic processing. Nevertheless, we do take it as a reflection of two points: (1) (recurrent) neural network models are able to effectively learn deep linguistic knowledge from annotations; (2) practical parsing may bene- fit from transforming a model-theoretic grammar into a generative-enumerative grammar.</p><p>The architecture of our parser has potential uses beyond establishing a strong string-to-graph parser. Our grammar extraction algorithm has some freedom to induce different SHRGs fol- lowing different linguistic hypothesis, and allows some issues in theoretical linguistics to be empir- ically investigated. In this paper, we examine the 2 http://pet.opendfki.de/ 3 http://sweaglesw.org/linguistics/ace/  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: A partial rewriting process of HRG on the semantic graph associated with "Some boys want to go."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Graph Representations for ERS</head><p>ERS are richly detailed semantic representa- tions produced by the ERG, a hand-crafted, linguistically-motivated HPSG grammar for En- glish. Beyond basic predicate-argument struc- tures, ERS also includes other information about various complex phenomena such as the distinc- tion between scopal and non-scopal arguments, conditionals, comparatives, and many others. ERS are in the formalism of Minimal Recursion Se- mantics (MRS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Copestake et al., 2005</ref>), but can be expressed in different ways. Semantic graphs, including EDS and DMRS, can be reduced from the standard feature structure encoded representa- tions, with or without a loss of information. In this paper, we conduct experiments on ERS data, but our grammar extraction algorithm and the parser are not limited to ERS.</p><p>One distinguished characteristic of ERS is that the construction of ERS strictly follows the prin- ciple of compositionality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bender et al., 2015)</ref>. A precise syntax-semantics interface is introduced to guarantee compositionality and therefore all meaning units can be traced back to linguistic signals, including both lexical and constructional ones. Take <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> for example. Every con- cept, e.g. the existence quantifier some q, is associated with a surface string. We favor such correspondence not because it eases extraction of SHRGs, but because we emphasize sentence meanings that are from forms. The connection be- tween syntax (sentence form) and semantics (word and sentence meaning) is fundamental to the study of language.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N(1,2) bv D(0,1) arg1 V(4,5) arg1 arg2 V(2,3) _boy_n_1(1,2) bv _some_q(0,1) arg1 _go_v_1(4,5) arg1 arg2 _want_v_1(2,3) SP-HD(0,2) arg1 V(4,5)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Algorithm</head><p>We introduce a novel SHRG extraction algorithm, which requires and only requires alignments be- tween conceptual edges and surface strings. A tree is also required, but this tree does not have to be a gold-standard syntactic tree. All trees that are compatible with an alignment can be used. The syntactic part of DeepBank is a phrase structure which describes HPSG derivation. The vast ma- jority of syntactic rules in DeepBank are binary, and the rest are unary. In §5, we report evaluation results based on DeepBank trees.</p><p>A conceptual graph is composed by two kinds of edges: 1) conceptual edges that carry semantic concept information and are connected with only one node, and 2) structural edges that build re- lationships among concepts by connecting nodes. The grammar extraction process repeatedly re- places a subgraph with a nonterminal hyperedge, defining the nonterminal symbol as LHS and the subgraph as RHS. The key problem is to identify an appropriate subgraph in each step. To this end, we take advantage of DeepBank's accurate and fine-grained alignments between the surface string in syntactic tree and concepts in semantic graphs.</p><p>To extract the HRG rule synchronized with the syntactic rewriting rule A → B + C, we assume that conceptual edges sharing common spans with A, B or C are in the same subgraph. This sub- graph acts as the RHS of the HRG rule. We make the extraction process go in the direction of pos- torder traversal of the syntactic tree, to ensure that all sub-spans of A, B or C are already replaced with hyperedges. We then add the structural edges that connect the above conceptual edges to RHS. After the subgraph is identified, it is easy to distin- guish between internal nodes and external nodes.</p><p>If all edges connected to a node are in the sub- graph, this node is an internal node. Otherwise, it is external node. Finally, the subgraph is replaced with a nonterminal edge. Algorithm 1 presents a precise demonstration and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> illustrates an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">A Neural SHRG Parser</head><p>Under the SHRG formalism, semantic parsing can be divided into two steps: syntactic parsing and semantic interpretation. Syntactic parsing utilizes the CFG part to get a derivation that is shared by the HRG part. At one derivation step, there may be more than one HRG rule applicable. In this case, we need a semantic disambiguation model to choose a good one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Syntactic Parsing</head><p>Following the LSTM-Minus approach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cross and Huang (2016)</ref>, we build a constituent parser with a CKY decoder. We denote the output vectors of forward and backward LSTM as f i and b i . The feature s i,j of a span (i, j) can be calcu- lated from the differences of LSTM encodings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s i,j = (f j − f i ) ⊕ (b i − b j )</formula><p>The operator ⊕ indicates the concatenation of two vectors. Constituency parsing can be regarded as predicting scores for spans and labels, and get- ting the best syntactic tree with dynamic program- ming. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stern et al. (2017)</ref>'s approach, We calculate the span scores SCORE span (i, j) and labels scores SCORE label (i, j, l) from s i,j with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">SCORE span (i, j) = MLP span (s i,j ) SCORE label (i, j, l) = MLP label (s i,j )[l]</formula><p>x[i] indicates the ith element of a vector x. We condense the unary chains into one label to ensure that only one rule is corresponds with a specific span. Because the construction rules from Deep- Bank are either unary or binary, we do not deal with binarization.</p><p>Because the SHRG synchronizes at rule level, we need to restrict the parser to ensure that the out- put agrees with the known rules. The restriction can be directly added into the CKY decoder. To simplify the semantic interpretation process, we add extra label information to enrich the nontermi- nals in CFG rules. In particular, we consider the count of external nodes of a corresponding HRG rule. For example, the LHS of rule { in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> will be labeled as "HD-CMP#2", since the RHS of its HRG counterpart has two external nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Semantic Interpretation</head><p>When a phrase structure tree, i.e., a derivation tree, T is available, semantic interpretation can be regarded as translating T to the derivation of graph construction by assigning a corresponding HRG rule to each syntactic counterpart. Our ap- proach to finding the optimal HRG rule combina- tionˆRtionˆ tionˆR = {r 1 , r 2 , ...} from the search space R(T ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ˆ R = argmax R∈R(T ) SCORE(R|T )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>To solve this optimization problem, we implement a greedy search decoder and a bottom-up beam search decoder. The final semantic graph G is read off fromˆRfromˆ fromˆR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Greedy Search Model</head><p>In this model, we assume that each HRG rule is selected independently of the others. The score of G is defined as the sum of all rule scores:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SCORE(R = {r 1 , r 2 , ...}|T ) = r∈R SCORE(r|T )</formula><p>The maximization of the graph score can be decomposed into the maximization of each rule score. SCORE(r|T ) can be calculated in many ways. Count-based approach is the simplest one, where the rule score is estimated by its frequency in the training data. We also evaluate a sophis- ticated scoring method, i.e., training a classifier based on rule embedding:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">SCORE(r|T ) = MLP(s i,j ⊕ r)</formula><p>Inspired by the bag-of-words model, we represent the rule as bag of edge labels. The i-th position in r indicates the number of times the i-th label appears in the rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Bottom-Up Beam Search Model</head><p>We can also leverage structured prediction to ap- proximate SCORE(R|T ) and employ principled decoding algorithms to solve the optimization problem (1). We propose a factorization model to assign scores to the graph and subgraphs in the in- termediate state. The score of a certain graph can be seen as the sum of each factor score.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">SCORE(R|T ) = i∈PART(R,T ) SCOREPART(i)</formula><p>We use predicates and arguments as factors for scoring. There are two kinds of factors: 1) A con- ceptual edge aligned with span (i, j) taking pred- icate name p. We use the span embedding s i,j as features, and scoring with non-linear transforma- tion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">SCOREPART pred (i, j, p) = MLP pred (s i,j )[p]</formula><p>2) A structural edge with label L connects with predicates p a and p b , which are aligned with spans (i 1 , j 1 ) and (i 2 , j 2 ) respectively. We use the span embedding s i 1 ,j 1 , s i 2 ,j 2 and random initialized predicate embedding p a , p b as features, and scor- ing with non-linear transformation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">SCOREPART arg (i 1 , j 1 , i 2 , j 2 , p a , p b , L) = MLP arg (s i 1 ,j 1 ⊕ s i 2 ,j 2 ⊕ p a ⊕ p b )[L]</formula><p>We assign a beam to each node in the syntac- tic tree. To ensure that we always get a subgraph which does not contain any nonterminal edges during the search process, we perform the beam search in the bottom-up direction. We only reserve top k subgraphs in each beam. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Training</head><p>The objective of training is to make the score of the correct graph higher than incorrect graphs. We use the score difference between the correct graph R g and the highest scoring incorrect graph as the loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">loss = maxˆRmaxˆ maxˆR =Rg SCORE( ˆ R|T )−SCORE(R g |T )</formula><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016)</ref>'s experience of loss augmented inference, in order to update graphs which have high model scores but are very wrong, we augment each factor belonging to the gold graph by adding a penalty term c to its score. Finally the loss term is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">loss = SCORE(R g |T ) − i∈PART(Rg,T ) c− max(SCORE( ˆ R|T ) − i∈PART( ˆ R,T )∩PART(Rg,T ) c)</formula><p>Some boys want to go . </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Results of Semantic Interpretation</head><p>Dridan and Oepen (2011) proposed the EDM met- ric to evaluate the performance the ERS-based graphs. EDM uses the alignment between the nodes in a graph and the spans in a string to de- tect the common parts between two graphs. It con- verts the predicate and predicate-argument rela- tionship to comparable triples and calculates the correctness in these triples. A predicate of label L and span S is denoted as triple (S, NAME, L) and a relationship R between the predicate labelled P and argument labelled A is denoted as triple (P, R, A). We calculate the F 1 value of the total triples as EDM score. Similarity, we compute the F 1 score of only predicate triples and only the rela- tion triples as EDM P and EDM A . We reuse the word embeddings and bidirec- tional LSTM in the trained syntactic parsing model to extract span embedding s i,j . The results of the count-based model, rule embedding model and structured model with beam decoder are sum- marized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>. We report the standard EDM metrics. The count-based model can achieve con- siderably good results, showing the correctness of our grammar extraction method. We also try dif- ferent labels for the syntactic trees. The results   <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Accuracy on the development data under different labels of syntactic tree and beam search.</p><p>are shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. Models based on coarse- grained labels achieve optimal performance. The results on test set of EDS data are shown in <ref type="table">Table  8</ref>. We achieve state-of-the-art performance with a remarkable improvement over <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Buys and Blunsom (2017)</ref>'s neural parser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">On Syntax-Semantics Interface</head><p>In this paper, we empirically study the lexical- ist/constructivist hypothesis, a divide across a va- riety of theoretical frameworks, taking semantic parsing as a case study. Although the original grammar that guides the annotation of ERS data, namely ERG, is highly lexicalized in that the ma- jority of information is encoded in lexical entries (or lexical rules) as opposed to being represented in constructions (i.e., rules operating on phrases), our grammar extraction algorithm has some free- dom to induce different SHRGs that choose be- tween the lexicalist and constructivist approaches. We modify algorithm 1 to follow the key insights of the lexicalist approach. This is done by con- sidering all outgoing edges when finding the sub- graph of the lexical rules. The differences between two kinds of grammars is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 9</ref>. Different grammars allow the lexical- ist/constructivist issue in theoretical linguistics to be empirically examined. The comparison of the counts of rules in each grammar is summarized in  <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>: Accuracy on the test set. We use syntactic trees of coarse-grained labels and beam search.</p><p>in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 10</ref>. A construction grammar works much better than a lexicalized grammar under the architecture of our neural parser. We take this comparison as informative since lexicalist approaches are more widely accepted by various computational grammar formalisms, including CCG, LFG, HPSG and LTAG. We think that the success of applying SHRG to resolve semantic parsing highly relies on the com- positionality nature of ERS' sentence-level se- mantic annotation. This is the property that makes sure the extracted rules are consistent and regu- lar. Previous investigation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Peng et al. (2015)</ref> on SHRG-based semantic parsing utilizes AMR- Bank which lacks this property to some extent (see Bender et al.'s argument). We think this may be one reason for the disappointing parsing perfor- mance. Think about the AMR graph associated "John wants Bob to believe that he saw him." The AMR's annotation for co-reference is a kind of non-compositional, speaker meaning, and results in grammar sparseness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">On Deep Linguistic Knowledge</head><p>Semantic annotations have a tremendous impact on semantic parsing. In parallel with develop- ing new semantic annotations, e.g. AMRBank, there is a resurgence of interest in exploring ex- isting annotations grounded under deep grammar formalisms, such as semantic analysis provided by ERS <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Flickinger, 2000</ref>). In stark contrast, it seems that only the annotation results gain interests, but not the core annotation engine-knowledge- extensive grammar.</p><p>The tendency to continually ignore the positive impact of precision grammar on semantic parsing is somewhat strange. For sentences that can be parsed by an ERG-guided parser, there is a signif- icant accuracy gap which is repeatedly reported. See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">SP-HD → D + N N bv D N D want _want_1 _want_1 arg1 arg2 HD-CMP → V + HD-CMP HD-CMP arg2 V HD-CMP V go _go_1 _go_1 arg1</formula><p>S↓SP-HD → SP-HD + HD-CMP arg1 HD-CMP SP-HD arg1 HD-CMP SP-HD   isfactory coverage and efficiency that limit their uses in NLP applications. Even for treebanking on newswire data, i.e., Wall Street Journal data from Penn TreeBank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Marcus et al., 1993)</ref>, ERG lacks analyses for c.a. 11% of sentences ). For text data from the web, e.g. tweets, this problem is even more serious. More- over, checking all possible linguistic constraints makes a grammar-guided parser too slow for many realistic NLP applications. Robustness and effi- ciency, thus, are two major problems for practical NLP applications. Recent encouraging progress achieved with purely data-driven models helps resolve the above two problems. Nevertheless, it seems too rad- ical to remove all explicit linguistic knowledge about the syntacto-semantic composition process, the key characteristics of natural languages. In this paper, we introduce a neural SHRG-based se- mantic parser that strikes a balance between data- driven and grammar-guided parsing. We encode deep linguistic knowledge partially in a symbolic way and partially in a statistical way. It is worth noting that the symbolic system is a derivational, generative-enumerative grammar, while the origin of the data source is grounded under a representa- tional, model-theoretic grammar. While grammar writers may favor the convenience provided by a unification grammar formalism, a practical parser may re-use algorithms by another formalism by translating grammars through data. Experiments also suggest that (recurrent) neural network mod- els are able to effectively gain some deep linguistic knowledge from annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>The advantages of using graph grammars to re- solve semantic parsing is clear in concept but un- derexploited in practice. Here, we have shown ways to improve SHRG-based string-to-semantic- graph parsing. Especially, we emphasize the im- portance of modeling syntax-semantic interface and the compositional property of semantic an- notations. Just like recent explorations on many other NLP tasks, we also show that neural net- work models are very powerful to advance deep language understanding.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>SPANS</head><label></label><figDesc>← {SPAN-A, SPAN-B, SPAN-C} 4: C-EDGES ← {e|e ∈ EDGES(g) ∧ SPAN(e) ∈ SPANS} 5: ALL-NODES ← {s|s ∈ NODES(g) ∧ ∃e ∈ C-EDGES s.t. s ∈ NODES(e)} 6: S-EDGES ← {e|e ∈ EDGES(g) ∧ e is structual edge ∧ ∀s ∈ NODES(e) =⇒ s ∈ C-EDGES} 7: ALL-EDGES = C-EDGES ∪ S-EDGES 8: INTERNAL-NODES ← {} 9: EXTERNAL-NODES ← {} 10:</figDesc></figure>
