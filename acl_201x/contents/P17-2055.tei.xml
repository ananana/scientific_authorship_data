			<abstract>
				<p>Information extraction (IE) from text has largely focused on relations between individual entities, such as who has won which award. However, some facts are never fully mentioned, and no IE method has perfect recall. Thus, it is beneficial to also tap contents about the cardinalities of these relations, for example, how many awards someone has won. We introduce this novel problem of extracting cardinali-ties and discuss specific challenges that set it apart from standard IE. We present a distant supervision method using conditional random fields. A preliminary evaluation results in precision between 3% and 55%, depending on the difficulty of relations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Motivation Information extraction (IE) can in- fer relations between named entities from text (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mitchell et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mausam et al., 2012)</ref>), yield- ing for example which awards an athlete has won, or instances of family relations like spouses, children, etc. These methods can be harnessed for summarization, question answering (QA), and more. For populating knowledge bases (KBs), the IE output is usually cast into subject-predicate- object (SPO) triples, such as BarackObama, hasChild, Malia, or sometimes n-ary tuples such as <ref type="bibr">MichaelPhelps, hasWon, OlympicGold, 200mButterfly, 2016.</ref> IE has focused on capturing full SPO triples (or n-ary facts) with all arguments bound to entities for relation P. However, news, biographies or dis- cussion forums often contain numeric expressions that reveal cardinalities of relations. Phrases such as "her two children" or "his 28th medal" are valu- able cues for quantifying the hasChild and hasWon relations. This can be harnessed in QA for cases like "Who won the most Olympic medals?"</p><p>An important application of relation cardinali- ties is KB curation. KBs are notoriously incom- plete, contain erroneous triples, and are limited in keeping up with the pace of real-world changes. For example, a KB may contain only 10 of the 28 Olympic medals that Phelps has won, or may in- correctly list 3 children for Obama. Extracting the cardinalities of relations for given subject entities can address all of these issues.</p><p>Relation cardinalities are disregarded by virtu- ally all IE methods. Open IE methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Mausam et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013</ref>) cap- ture triples (or quadruples) such as Obama, has, two children. However, there is no way to in- terpret the numeric expression in the O slot of this triple. While IE methods that hinge on pre- specified relations for KB population (e.g., NELL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mitchell et al., 2015)</ref>) can already capture nu- meric values for explicitly stated attributes such as Berlin2016attack, hasNumOfVictims, 32, they are currently not able to learn them. This paper addresses the novel task of extracting relation cardinalities. For a given subject entity s and predicate p, we aim to infer the cardinality |{{S, P, O | S = s, P = p}| directly from text, without having to observe any O entities. This task poses several challenges:</p><p>• IE Training. Most IE methods build on seed- based distant supervision. However, if the un- derlying KB is not complete, taking the counts of SPO triples for a given SP pair may result in wrong seeds, which can lead to poor patterns.</p><p>• Compositionality. The cardinality of an SP pair for a relation may depend on several cardinality mentions. For example, when observing "An- gelina has two sons and three daughters", one could infer the children cardinality by summing.</p><p>• Linguistic Variance. In addition to cardinal numbers, cardinality IE should also pay atten- tion to number-related terms, e.g., "Angelina gives birth to twins", or ordinal information, e.g., "Angelina's fourth child", which can reveal lower bounds on relation cardinalities.</p><p>Approach and Contribution Our method learns patterns of phrases that contain cardinal numbers, relying on the distant supervision approach by counting facts for given SP pairs. Our technical contributions are as follows: (i) we provide a statistical analysis of numeric information in Wikipedia articles; (ii) we develop a CRF-based extraction method for relation cardinalities that achieves precision scores of up to 55%; (iii) we analyze further challenges in this research and outline possible solutions.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Craven and Kumlien, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mintz et al., 2009)</ref>. Despite all efforts, KBs are immensely incom- plete. For instance, the average number of children per person in Wikidata <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Vrandeči´Vrandeči´c and Krötzsch, 2014</ref>) is just 0.02 ( ).</p><p>Numbers and Relation Cardinalities Numbers in text are an important source of information. Much work has been done on understanding num- bers that express temporal information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ling and Weld, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Strötgen and Gertz, 2010)</ref>, and more recently, on numbers that express physical quan- tities or measures, either mentioned in text <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chaganty and Liang, 2016)</ref> or in the context of web ta- bles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ibrahim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Neumaier et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, numbers that express relation cardi- nalities have received little attention so far. State- of-the-art Open-IE systems either hardly extract cardinality information or fail to extract cardinal-  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: NE-tags of numbers in Wikipedia.</p><p>ities at all. While NELL, for instance, knows 13 relations about the number of casualties and in- juries in disasters, they all contain only seed facts and no learned facts. The only prior work we are aware of is of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mirza et al. (2016)</ref>, who use manu- ally created patterns to mine children cardinalities from Wikipedia. It is shown that with 30 manually crafted patterns and simple filters it is possible to extract 86,227 children-cardinality-assertions with a precision of 94.3%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Relation Cardinalities</head><p>Definition We define a mention that expresses relation cardinalities as the following: "A cardi- nal number that states the number of objects that stand in a specific relation with a certain subject." Using this definition, we analyzed how often relation cardinalities occur in Wikipedia. Rely- ing on the part-of-speech (PoS) tagger of Stan- ford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Manning et al., 2014</ref>), we ex- tracted numbers-i.e., words tagged as CD (cardi- nal number)-from 10,000 random Wikipedia arti- cles. The distribution of their named-entity (NE) tags, according to Stanford NE-tagger, is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. While temporal-related numbers are the most frequent, around 40% are classified only as unspecific NUMBER. By manually checking 100 random NUMBERs, we observed that 47 are rela- tion cardinalities, 1 i.e., approximately 18.86% of all numbers in Wikipedia are relation cardinalities.</p><p>We also analyzed the nouns frequently modified by NUMBERs, based on their dependency paths, finding people, games, children, times, members and seasons among the top nouns. Coarse topic- grouping of the nouns shows that most NUMBERs are about sport (games, goals), followed by art- work (seasons, books), politics and organization (members, countries), and family (children).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Relation Cardinality Extraction</head><p>Ideally, we would like to make sense of all car- dinality statements found in text. However, this would require us to resolve the meaning of a large set of vague predicates, which is in general a dif- ficult task. We thus turn the problem around:</p><note type="other">given a well defined relation/predicate p, a sub- ject s and a corresponding text about s, we now try to estimate the relation cardinality (i.e., the count of s, p, * * triples), based on cardinality as- sertions found in the text. We chose four Wikidata predicates that span various domains, child (P40), spouse (P26), has part (P527) of a series of cre- ative works (restricted to novel, book and film se- ries), and contains administrative territorial entity (P150). As the text source for subjects of each predicate, we consider sentences containing num- bers taken from their respective English Wikipedia articles.</note><p>Methodology We approach the problem via se- quence labelling, i.e., given a sentence containing at least one number, we aim to determine whether each number in the sentence corresponds to the cardinality of a certain relation. We build a Con- ditional Random Field (CRF) based model with CRF++ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kudo, 2005</ref>) for each relation, taking as features the context lemmas (window size of 5) around the observed token t, along with bigrams and trigrams containing t.</p><p>To generate the training data, we rely on dis- tant supervision, annotating candidate numbers 2 in the text as correct cardinalities whenever they correspond to the exact triple count (count &gt; 0) found in the knowledge base. Otherwise, they are labelled as O (for Others), like the rest of non- number tokens. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> contains for each consid- ered relation (p), the number of subjects (#s) in Wikidata, which have links to English Wikipedia pages and have at least one s, p, * * triple.</p><p>We predict the relation cardinality of a given s, p pair by selecting the number positively an- notated with marginal probability-resulting from forward-backward inference-higher than 0.1, and choosing the one with the highest probability if there are several.</p><p>Experiments Two experimental settings are considered: vanilla refers to the distant supervi- sion approach explained above, while for only-nummod, we only annotate a candidate number as correct cardinality if it modifies a noun, i.e., there is an incoming dependency relation of label num- mod according to the Stanford Dependency Parser. This is to exclude numbers as in "one of the rea- sons..." from training examples. We also con- sidered a naive baseline, which chooses a random number from a pool of numbers existing in each text about a certain subject.</p><p>Furthermore, to estimate how well KB counts are suited as ground truth, we compare them on the the child relation with the manually-created num- ber of children (P1971) property from Wikidata.</p><p>Evaluation Results We manually annotated the evaluation data with the true relation counts, since the knowledge base is highly incomplete, and thus, the triple counts are often incorrect. Whenever the cardinality matches the true count, we also manu- ally inspected how relevant the textual evidence- the context surrounding the cardinal number-is for the observed relation. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the perfor- mance of our CRF-based method in finding the correct relation cardinality, evaluated on manually annotated 20 (has part), 100 (admin. terr. entity) and 200 (child and spouse) randomly selected sub- jects that have at least one object.</p><p>The random-number baseline achieves a preci- sion of 5% (has part), 3.5% (admin. territ. entity), 0% (spouse) and 11.2% (child). Compared to that, especially using only-nummod, our method gives encouraging results for has part, admin. territ. en- tity and child, with 30-50% precision and around 30% F1-score. For spouse, the performance is significantly lower, reasons are discussed below. Furthermore, we can observe that using manual ground truth as training data for the child rela- tion can boost performance considerably. Still, the performance is significantly below the state- of-the-art in fact extraction, where child triples can be extracted from Wikipedia text with 96% preci- sion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Palomares et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analysis</head><p>A qualitative analysis of the training data and eval- uation results revealed three aspects that make ex- tracting relation cardinalities difficult.</p><p>Quality of Training Data Unlike training data for normal fact extraction, which is generally highly correct (e.g., YAGO claims 95% preci- sion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Suchanek et al., 2007</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Number of Wikidata entities as subjects (#s) of each predicate (p), and evaluation results on manually annotated randomly selected subjects that have at least an object.</p><p>found in knowledge bases as ground truth gener- ally gives wrong results. For example, our manual evaluation of child shows that the triple count from Wikidata is 46% lower than what the texts assert. As shown by the last row of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, higher quality of training data can considerably boost the performance of cardinality extraction. Unfortu- nately, manually curated data is generally difficult to obtain. We see two avenues to tackle training data quality: 1. Filtering ground truth. Instead of taking the counts of all entities as ground truth, one might trade size for quality, e.g., using popular enti- ties only, as for these there are chances that KBs are more complete. 2. Incompleteness-resilient distant supervision.</p><p>Triple counts in KBs are often lower than what is correct, but rarely too high. Thus, an avenue might be to label all numbers equal or higher than the KB count as correct, instead of only considering the equal ones. Given that differ- ent cardinalities could then be labelled as cor- rect, this would require a postprocessing step in which conflicting counts are consolidated.</p><p>Compositionality Around 16% of false posi- tives in extracting child cardinalities can be at- tributed to failures in identifying the correct count for, e.g., "They have two sons and one daughter together; he has four children from an earlier re- lationship." This was also observed for other rela- tions, e.g., "The Qidong county has 4 subdistricts, 17 towns and 3 townships under its juridiction." We see two avenues to tackle this problem: 1. Aggregating numbers. In training data genera- tion, one could label a sequence of number as correct cardinalities if the sum of the numbers is equal to the relation count. In the prediction step, one might sum up all consecutive cardi- nalities that are labelled with sufficient confi- dence.</p><p>2. Learning composition rules. One may try to learn the composition of counts, for instance, that children are composed of sons and daugh- ters, then try to extract the composing cardinal- ities.</p><p>Linguistic Variance We observe that for the spouse relation, expressing the count with car- dinal numbers ("He has married four times") is only found for 4% of subjects. It is more com- mon to express the count with ordinal numbers, e.g., "John's first wife, Mary, ...", which allows us to conclude that the spouse-count for John is at least-and most probably more than-one. An ap- proach to such relations might be to identify or- dinals numbers that express lower bounds of rela- tions. Subsequently, one could reason over these bounds and try to infer relation counts.</p><p>Our initial motivation was to make sense of the so far ignored large fraction of numbers that ex- press relation cardinalities. However, we noticed quickly that relation cardinalities are frequently also expressed without numbers at all. This is es- pecially true for the case of count zero, which is mostly expressed using negation ("He never mar- ried"), and the count one, which is expressed us- ing indefinite articles ("They have a child") or the signal-word only ("Their only child, James"). Terms such as twins or trilogy are also ways to express domain-specific relation cardinalities. We see two avenues to approach this variance:</p><p>1. Translation to numbers. For the 0's and 1's, a possible approach is to translate certain kinds of negation and indefinite articles into explicit numbers (e.g., "do not have any children" → "have 0 children"). 2. Word similarity with cardinals. If a word bears high similarity with cardinal numbers, possibly also in other languages such as Latin or Greek, one might consider it as a candidate number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have introduced the problem of relation cardinality extraction. We believe that re- lation cardinalities can be useful in a variety of tasks. Our next goal is to make distant supervision incompleteness-resilient and to deal with compo- sitionality, hoping that these can improve the pre- cision of our approach. We also aim to take ordi- nals into account and to experiment with linguistic transformation for the cases of cardinalities 0 and 1, hoping that these could boost the recall. A limitation of our work is also that we only focus on Wikipedia articles, assume that all state- ments are about the article's subject, and just take the statement with the highest confidence. In fu- ture work we aim to include a larger article base in combination with named entity recognition, coref- erence resolution and a truth consolidation step.</p></div>
