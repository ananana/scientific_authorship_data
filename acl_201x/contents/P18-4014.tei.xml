				<p>We present a new web-based interface, TALEN, designed for named entity annotation in low-resource settings where the annotators do not speak the language. To address this non-traditional scenario, TALEN includes such features as in-place lexicon integration, TF-IDF token statistics , Internet search, and entity propagation , all implemented so as to make this difficult task efficient and frictionless. We conduct a small user study to compare against a popular annotation tool, showing that TALEN achieves higher precision and recall against ground-truth annotations , and that users strongly prefer it over the alternative. TALEN is available at: github.com/CogComp/talen.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Named entity recognition (NER), the task of find- ing and classifying named entities in text, has been well-studied in English, and a select few other lan- guages, resulting in a wealth of resources, par- ticularly annotated training data. But for most languages, no training data exists, and annotators who speak the language can be hard or impossible to find. This low-resource scenario calls for new methods for gathering training data. Several works address this with automatic techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Tsai et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Zhang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Mayhew et al., 2017</ref>), but often a good starting point is to elicit manual annotations from annotators who do not speak the target language.</p><p>Language annotation strategies and software have historically assumed that annotators speak the language in question. Although there has been work on non-expert annotators for natural lan- guage tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Snow et al., 2008)</ref>, where the anno- tators lack specific skills related to the task, there has been little to no work on situations where an- notators, expert or not, do not speak the language. To this end, we present a web-based interface de- signed for users to annotate text quickly and easily in a language they do not speak.</p><p>TALEN aids non-speaker annotators 1 with sev- eral different helps and nudges that would be un- necessary in cases of a native speaker. The main features, described in detail in Section 2, are a Named Entity (NE) specific interface, entity prop- agation, lexicon integration, token statistics infor- mation, and Internet search.</p><p>The tool operates in two separate modes, each with all the helps described above. The first mode displays atomic documents in a manner analogous to nearly all prior annotation software. The second mode operates on the sentence level, patterned on bootstrapping with a human in the loop, and de- signed for efficient discovery and annotation.</p><p>In addition to being useful for non-speaker an- notations, TALEN can be used as a lightweight in- spection and annotation tool for within-language named entity annotation. TALEN is agnostic to la- belset, which means that it can also be used for a wide variety of sequence tagging tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Main Features</head><p>In this section, we describe the main features indi- vidually in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Named Entity-Specific Interface</head><p>The interface is designed specifically for Named Entity (NE) annotation, where entities are rela- <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Document-based annotation screen. A romanized document from an Amharic corpus is shown. The user has selected "nagaso gidadane" (Negasso Gidada) for tagging, indicated by the thin gray border, and by the popover component. The lexicon (dictionary) is active, and is displaying the definition (in italics) for "doctor" immediately prior to "nagaso". (URL and document title are obscured).</p><p>tively rare in the document. The text is intention- ally displayed organically, in a way that is familiar and compact, so that the annotator can see as much as possible on any given screen. This makes it easy for an annotator to make document-level de- cisions, for example, if an unusual-looking phrase appears several times. To add an annotation, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the annotator clicks (and drags) on a word (or phrase), and a popover appears with buttons corresponding to label choices as de- fined in the configuration file. Most words are not names, so a default label of non-name (O) is as- signed to all untouched tokens, keeping the num- ber of clicks to a minimum. In contrast, a part-of- speech (POS) annotation system, SAWT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Samih et al., 2016)</ref>, for example, is designed so that ev- ery token requires a decision and a click.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entity Propagation</head><p>In a low-resource scenario, it can be difficult to discover and notice names because all words look unfamiliar. To ease this burden, and to save on clicks, the interface propagates all annotation de- cisions to every matching surface in the document. For example, if 'iteyop'eya (Ethiopia) shows up many times in a document, then a single click will annotate all of them.</p><p>In the future, we plan to make this entity prop- agation smarter by allowing propagation to near surface forms (in cases where a suffix or prefix differs from the target phrase) or to cancel prop- agation on incorrect phrases, such as stopwords.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lexicon Integration</head><p>The main difficulty for non-speakers is that they do not understand the text they are annotating. An important feature of TALEN is in-place lexicon in- tegration, which replaces words in the annotation screen with their translation from the lexicon. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the English word doctor is displayed in line (translations are marked by ital- ics). As before, this is built on the notion that an- notation is easiest when text looks organic, with translations seamlessly integrated. Users can click on a token and add a definition, which is immedi- ately saved to disk. The next time the annotator encounters this word, the definition will be dis- played. If available, a bilingual lexicon (perhaps from PanLex ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kamholz et al., 2014)</ref>), can kickstart the process. A side effect of the definition addition feature is a new or updated lexicon, which can be shared with other users, or used for other tasks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Token Statistics</head><p>When one has no knowledge of a language, it may be useful to know various statistics about tokens, such as document count, corpus count, or TF-IDF. For example, if a token appears many times in ev- ery document, it is likely not a name. Our an- notation screen shows a table with statistics over tokens, including document count, percentage of documents containing it, and TF-IDF. At first, it shows the top 10 tokens by TF-IDF, but the user can click on any token to get individual statistics. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, nagaso appears 4 times in this document, appears in 10% of the total doc- uments, and has a TF-IDF score of 9.21. In prac- tice, we have found that this helps to give an idea of the topic of the document, and often names will have high TF-IDF in a document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internet Search</head><p>Upon selection of any token or phrase, the popover includes an external link to search the Internet for that phrase. This can be helpful in deciding if a phrase is a name or not, as search results may re- turn images, or even autocorrect the phrase to an English standard spelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Annotation Modes</head><p>There are two annotation modes: a document- based mode, and a sentence-based mode. Each has all the helps described above, but they display doc- uments and sentences to users in different ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Document-based Annotation</head><p>The document-based annotation is identical to the common paradigm of document annotation: the administrator provides a group of documents, and creates a configuration file for that set. The anno- tator views one document at a time, and moves on to the next when they are satisfied with the anno- tations. Annotation proceeds in a linear fashion, although annotators may revisit old documents to fix earlier mistakes. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of usage in the document-based annotation mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sentence-based Annotation</head><p>The sentence-based annotation mode is modeled after bootstrapping methods. In this mode, the configuration file is given a path to a corpus of documents (usually a very large corpus) and a small number (less than 10) seed entities, which <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Sentence-based annotation screen showing 4 seed terms available for annotation. Notice the Unannotated and Annotated tabs. These terms are in the active Unannotated tab because each term has some sentences that have not yet been labeled with that seed term. For example, of the 5 sentences found for ba'iteyop'eya, only 1 has this seed term labeled (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). can be easily acquired from Wikipedia. This cor- pus is indexed at the sentence level, and for each seed entity, k sentences are retrieved. These are presented to the annotator, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, who will mark all names in the sentences, starting with the entity used to gather the sentence, and hopefully discover other names in the process. As names are discovered, they are added to the list of seed enti- ties, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. New sentences are then retrieved, and the process continues until a pre- defined number of sentences has been retrieved. At this point, the data set is frozen, no new sen- tences are added, and the annotator is expected to thoroughly examine each sentence to discover all named entities.</p><p>In practice, we found that the size of k, which is the number of sentences retrieved per seed term, affects the overall corpus diversity. If k is large relative to the desired number of sentences, then the annotation is fast (because entity propagation can annotate all sentences with one click), but the method produces a smaller number of unique en- tities. However, if k is small, annotation may be slower, but return more diverse entities. In prac- tice, we use a default value of k = 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>There are several tools designed for similar pur- poses, although to our knowledge none are de- signed specifically for non-speaker annotations. Many of the following tools are powerful and flex- ible, but would require significant refactoring to accommodate non-speakers.</p><p>The most prominent and popular is brat: rapid annotation tool (brat) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Stenetorp et al., 2012</ref>), a web-based general purpose annotation tool capa- ble of a handling a wide variety of annotation tasks, including span annotations, and relations between spans. brat is open source, reliable, and available to download and run.</p><p>There are a number of tools with similar func- tionality. Sapient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Liakata et al., 2009</ref>) is a web- based system for annotating sentences in scientific documents. <ref type="bibr">WebAnno (de Castilho et al., 2016)</ref> uses the frontend visualization from brat with a new backend designed to make large-scale project management easier. EasyTree ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Little and Tratz, 2016</ref>) is a simple web-based tool for annotating dependency trees. Callisto 2 is a desktop tool for rich linguistic annotation. SAWT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Samih et al., 2016</ref>) is a sequence an- notation tool with a focus on being simple and lightweight, which is also a focus of ours. One key difference is that this expects that annotators will want to provide a tag for every word. This is inefficient for NER, where many tokens should take the default non-name label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiment: Compare to brat</head><p>The brat rapid annotation tool (brat) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Stenetorp et al., 2012</ref>) is a popular and well-featured anno- tation tool, which makes for a natural comparison to TALEN. In this experiment, we compare tools qualitatively and quantitatively by hiring a group of annotators. We can compare performance be- tween TALEN and brat by measuring the results after having annotators use both tools.</p><p>We chose to annotate Amharic, a language from Ethiopia. We have gold training and test data for this language from the Linguistic Data Consor- tium (LDC2016E87). The corpus is composed of several different genres, including newswire, dis- cussion forums, web blogs, and social network (Twitter). In the interest of controlling for the domain, we chose only 125 newswire documents (NW) from the gold data, and removed all annota- tions before distribution. Since Amharic is written in Ge'ez script, we romanized it, so it can be read by English speakers. We partitioned the newswire documents into 12 (roughly even) groups of docu- ments, and assigned each annotator 2 groups: one to be annotated in brat, the other with TALEN. This way, every annotator will use both interfaces, and every document will be annotated by both inter- faces. We chose one fully annotated gold docu- ment and copied it into each group, so that the an- notators have an annotation example.</p><p>We employed 12 annotators chosen from our NLP research group. Before the annotation pe- riod, all participants were given a survey about tool usage and language fluency. No users had fa- miliarity with TALEN, and only one had any fa- miliarity with brat. Of the annotators, none spoke Amharic or any related language, although one an- notator had some familiarity with Hebrew, which shares a common ancestry with Amharic, and one annotator was from West Africa. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Immediately prior to the annotation period, we gave a 15 minute presentation with instructions on tool usage, annotation guidelines, and annotation <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Ethiopia is in East Africa.  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Performance results. The precision, re- call, and F1 are measured against the gold standard Amharic training data. When counting Unique Names, each unique surface form is counted once. We emphasize that these results are calculated over a very small amount of data annotated over a half-hour period by annotators with no experience with TALEN or Amharic. These only show a quick and dirty comparison to brat, and are not intended to demonstrate high-quality performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATASET PRECISION RECALL</head><p>strategies. The tags used were Person, Organiza- tion, Location, and Geo-Political Entity. As for strategy, we instructed them to move quickly, an- notating names only if they are confident (e.g. if they know the English version of that name), and to prioritize diversity of discovered surface forms over exhaustiveness of annotation. When using TALEN, we encouraged them to make heavy use of the lexicon. We provided a short list (less than 20 names) of English names that are likely to be found in documents from Ethiopia: local politi- cians, cities in the region, etc. The annotation period lasted 1 hour, and con- sisted of two half hour sessions. For the first session, we randomly assigned half the annota- tors to use brat, and the other half to use TALEN. When this 30 minute period was over, all annota- tors switched tools. Those who had used brat use ours, and vice versa. We did this because users are likely to get better at annotating over time, so the second tool presented should give better results. Our switching procedure mitigates this effect.</p><p>At the end of the second session, each document group had been annotated twice: once by some annotator using brat, and once by some annotator using TALEN. These annotations were separate, so each tool started with a fresh copy of the data.</p><p>We report results in two ways: first, annotation quality as measured against a gold standard, and second, annotator feedback. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows ba- sic statistics on the datasets. Since the documents we gave to the annotators came from a gold an- notated set, we calculated precision, recall, and F1 with respect to the gold labels. First, we see that TALEN gives a 5.8 point F1 improvement over brat. This comes mostly from the recall, which im- proves by 3.9 points. This may be due to the auto- matic propagation, or it may be that having a lexi- con helped users discover more names by proxim- ity to known translations like president. In a less time-constrained environment, users of brat might be more likely select and annotate all surfaces of a name, but the reality is that all annotation projects are time-constrained, and any help is valuable.</p><p>The bottom part of the table shows the anno- tation statistics from TALEN compared with brat. TALEN yielded more name spans than brat, but fewer unique names, meaning that many of the names from TALEN are copies. This is also likely a product of the name propagation feature.</p><p>We gathered qualitative results from a feedback form filled out by each annotator after the eval- uation. All but one of the annotators preferred TALEN for this task. In another question, they were asked to select an option for 3 qualities of each tool: efficiency, ease of use, and presentation. Each quality could take the options Bad, Neutral, or Good. On each of these qualities, brat had a majority of Neutral, and TALEN had a majority of Good. For TALEN, Efficiency was the highest rated quality, with 10 respondents choosing Good.</p><p>We also presented respondents with the 4 ma- jor features of TALEN (TF-IDF box, lexicon, en- tity propagation, Internet search), and asked them to rate them as Useful or Not useful in their ex- perience. Only 4 people found the TF-IDF box useful; 10 people found the lexicon useful; all 12 people found the entity propagation useful; 7 peo- ple found the Internet search useful. These results are also reflected in the free text feedback. Most respondents were favorable towards the lexicon, and some respondents wrote that the TF-IDF box would be useful with more exposure, or with bet- ter integration (e.g. highlight on hover).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Technical Details</head><p>The interface is web-based, with a Java backend server. The frontend is built using Twitter boot- strap framework, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and a custom javascript library called annotate.js. The backend is built with the Spring Framework, written in Java, using the 4 https://getbootstrap.com/ TextAnnotation data structure from the CogComp NLP library ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Khashabi et al., 2018</ref>) to represent and process text.</p><p>In cases where it is not practical to run a backend server (for example, Amazon Mechani- cal Turk <ref type="bibr">5</ref> ), we include a version written entirely in javascript, called annotate-local.js.</p><p>We allow a number of standard input file for- mats, and attempt to automatically discover the format. The formats we allow are: column, in which each (word, tag) pair is on a single line, serialized TextAnnotation format (from CogComp NLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Khashabi et al., 2018)</ref>) in both Java serial- ization and JSON, and CoNLL column format, in which the tag and word are in columns 0 and 5, respectively.</p><p>When a user logs in and chooses a dataset to an- notate, a new folder is created automatically with the username in the path. When that user logs in again, the user folder is reloaded on top of the orig- inal data folder. This means that multiple users can annotate the same corpus, and their annotations are saved in separate folders. This is in contrast to brat, where each dataset is modified in place.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Sentence-based annotation screen, with sentences corresponding to seed term ba'iteyop'eya (annotated in the first sentence, not in the second).
