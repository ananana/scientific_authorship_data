			<abstract>
				<p>We present a novel solution to improve the performance of Chinese word seg-mentation (CWS) using a synthetic word parser. The parser analyses the internal structure of words, and attempts to convert out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs) into in-vocabulary fine-grained sub-words. We propose a pipeline CWS system that first predicts this fine-grained segmenta-tion, then chunks the output to reconstruct the original word segmentation standard. We achieve competitive results on the PKU and MSR datasets, with substantial improvements in OOV recall.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Since Chinese has no spaces between words to in- dicate word boundaries, Chinese word segmenta- tion is a task to determine word boundaries be- tween characters. In recent years, research in Chi- nese word segmentation has progressed signifi- cantly, with state-of-the-art performing at around 96% in precision and recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Xue, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Zhang and Clark, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Li and Sun, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>However, frequent OOVs are still a crucial issue that causes low accuracy in word segmentation. Li and Zhou (2012) defined those words that are OOVs but consisting of frequent internal parts as pseudo-OOV words and estimated that over 60% of OOVs are pseudo-OOVs in five common Chi- nese corpora. For instance, PKU corpus does not contain the word 陈列室 (exhibition room), even though the word 陈列 (exhibit) and 室 (room) ap- pear hundreds of times. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Goh et al. (2006)</ref> also claimed that most OOVs are proper nouns taking the form of Chinese synthetic words.</p><p>These previous works suggest that by analysing the internal structure of the synthetic words, we can transform pseudo-OOVs into in-vocabulary words <ref type="bibr">(IVs)</ref>. By running a synthetic word parser on each of the words in a CWS training set, we can generate a fine-grained segmentation standard that contains more IVs. Since the current conditional random field (CRF) word segmenters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Tseng et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Sun and Xu, 2011</ref>) perform well on IVs, this transforming process can conceivably improve the handling of pseudo-OOV words, as long as we can recover the original word segmentation standard from the fine-grained sub-word segmentation.</p><p>In recent years, some related works about im- proving OOV problem in CWS have been ongo- ing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Sun et al. (2012)</ref> presented a joint model for Chinese word segmentation and OOVs detection. Their models achieved fast training speed, high ac- curacies and increase on OOV recall. Sun (2011) proposed a similar sub-word structure which is generated by merging the segmentations provided by different segmenters (a word-based segmenter, a character-based segmenter and a local character classifier). However, her models does not predict the sub-words of all the synthetic words, but those words with different segmented results of the three segmenters. Her work maximizes the agreement of different models to improve CWS performance. Different from her work, we aim to provide an uni- fied way to incorporate morphological information of the synthetic words into the CWS task.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a pipeline word seg- mentation system to address the pseudo-OOV problem. Our word segmentation system first con- verts the original training data into a fine-grained standard by parsing all words with a synthetic word parser (Section 2.1), then trains a CRF- based sub-word segmenter (Section 2.2). A sec- ond CRF chunker is trained to recover the origi- nal word segmentation given the fine-grained re- sults of the first CRF. The intuition is that fine- grained sub-word segmentations resolve pseudo- OOVs into IVs, which are easier to predict cor- rectly by the first CRF. Secondly, by training an-other CRF that predicts the original word segmen- tation given the fine-grained segmentation as in- put, we can recover the fine-grained output into original word segmentation standard (Section 2.3). The flow chart of our word segmentation system is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Synthetic Word Parser</head><p>Intuitively, Chinese synthetic words contain inter- nal morphological information that is helpful to recognize OOVs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cheng et al. (2014)</ref> proposed a character-based parser to parse the internal tree structure of words. For instance, the tree and flat segmented result of the word 市 政 府 (munici- pal government) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. In this work, we train a graph-based parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(McDonald, 2006</ref>) on the data released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cheng et al. (2014)</ref> and include the dictionary (NAIST Chinese Dic- tionary 1 ) features and Brown clustering features extracted from a large unlabeled corpus (Chinese Gigaword Second Edition 2 ) as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cheng et al. (2014</ref> smallest units. In this work, we parse all the words in the PKU and MSR training data with character length greater than two. By replacing the words with the flat segmented results, we convert the training data into a fine-grained word segmenta- tion standard as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Original In this work, we adopt 4-tag set for word segmentation. "B" denotes the beginning character of a word. "I" denotes the middle char- acter of a word. "E" denotes the end character of a word. "S" denotes a single character word.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">市政府 / 办公厅 / 等 / 单位 CWS tags B I E / B I E / S / B E Fine-grained 市 / 政府 / 办公 / 厅 / 等 / 单位 CWS tags S / B E / B E / S / S / B E</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">CRF-based Chunking Model</head><p>In order to obtain the word segmentation result with original word segmentation standard, we train a CRF-based chunking model on the original and fine-grained training data. We show a sam- ple sentence of labeling chunking tags in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Comparing two sentences, we label all common units with the tag "S". The words 市 and 政府 are tagged as "B" and "E", since 市 is the beginning part of the synthetic word 市政府 and 政府 is the ending part. In the chunking process, the frequent prefix 市 is coordinated with neighbouring units to compose the synthetic word 市政府.</p><p>For each labeling, we include previous, current and next word as the features for the chunking model. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: A Sample Sentence of Labeling Chunk- ing Tags.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Settings</head><p>Cheng et al. (2014) released a dictionary of 31,849 synthetic words with internal structure an- notated. Since transliteration words (e.g. 贝克 汉 姆 Becham) exist in Chinese, our synthetic word parser should perform well not only on syn- thetic words but also on transliteration words. We extracted 6,574 transliteration words from the NAIST Chinese Dictionary and automatically as- signed flat structures for these words. As a result, we obtained 38,423 words as the training data for our parser. The second international Chinese word seg- mentation bakeoff-2005 provided two annotated simplified Chinese corpora: PKU and MSR. We conducted all word segmentation experiments on these two corpora.</p><p>We used CRF++ 3 (version 0.58) as the imple- mentation of CRFs in our experiments with the de- fault regularization algorithm L2. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the word segmentation re- sults on PKU and MSR corpora. For compari- son, we give a baseline result by training a CRF word segmenter on the original PKU and MSR data sets with the same features. Our proposed system is expected to improve the word segmen- tation performance on pseudo-OOVs. Compared to the baseline, there are significant increases on OOV recall from 0.792 to 0.822 on PKU and 0.682 to 0.717 on MSR. We also evaluated the pseudo- OOV recall and observed 4% increases from the baseline to the proposed system. Our proposed system achieves higher F-score with 0.961 on PKU and 0.971 on MSR. Comparing to other sys- tems, our proposed method obtains the state-of- the-art F-score as the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Zhang et al. (2013)</ref> who extracted dynamic statistical features from both in-domain and out-domain corpus and our OOV recall significantly outperforms theirs with a 9% lead. In MSR, we obtain very close OOV recall and slightly lower F-score than the state-of- the-art system ( , which adopted a latent variable CRF model. However, our system significantly outperforms their system in PKU. In both corpora, our proposed system outperforms the best " <ref type="bibr">Bakeoff-2005</ref>" results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Word Segmentation Results</head><p>We also test the statistical significance of the results by using the criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Sproat and Emerson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Emerson, 2005</ref>). The 95% confidence interval is given as ±2 p(1 − p)/n, where n is the number of words in the test data. They treat two systems as significantly different (at the 95% confidence level), if at least one of their precision- based confidences "C p " or recall-based "C r " are different. As the results shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, the baseline and proposed method are significantly different on precision and recall in both PKU and MSR corpus. In conclusion, our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Additional Experiments</head><p>We conducted additional experiments to evaluate the performance of the synthetic word parser and CRF-based chunking model. First, we are interested in how much parsing ac- curacy is needed for good results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> dis- plays the OOV recall results of our word segmen- tation system when the synthetic word parser is trained with amounts of labeled synthetic words data. As the data size increases, our word segmen-  tation system obtains consistent gains on OOV re- call on both corpora. On the whole 38K words training data, our system reaches the highest OOV recall. An interesting observation is that the OOV recall on MSR is more sensitive on data size changing. The main reason is the different anno- tation standard of the two corpus. PKU is a cor- respondingly fine-grained annotated corpus with shorter average word length than MSR. Our syn- thetic word parser reaches high parsing accuracy on short length words (three-character and four- character words) even with a small training data size. With the increase of word length, the parser needs more training data. These factors cause that our system reaches high OOV recall on PKU start- ing from a small training data size and obtains more OOV recall gains on MSR when increasing the training data size.</p><p>Our pipeline system adopts a chunking model to recover the original standard from the fine- grained standard. One question is how difficult is this task. Unfortunately, we do not have the gold fine-grained input to evaluate the perfor- mance of our chunking model directly; i.e. it is not clear whether a segmentation error is due to mis-predictions in the first or second CRF. There- fore, we use the synthetic word parser to parse all the words in the gold testing data and generate an artificial gold fine-grained input for the chunking model. This data keeps the original word bound-  aries and can be used to observe the chunking per- formance. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows that the chunking model on the artificial data obtains a 0.822 to 0.847 im- provement in OOV recall. We can interpret this to mean that 0.025 improvement is possible if the first CRF was perfect; on the other hand, the gap between 0.847 and 1.0 shows that potentially the second CRF is a harder task. However, the real gap is less for the lose of the parsing step and the existence of non-pseudo OOVs.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The Word Segmentation evaluation of the Chunking Model. "Artificial gold" denotes the word segmentation result when the chunking model runs on the artificial gold input.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Analysis</head><p>As we expected, the proposed method obtains sig- nificant improvement on OOV recall. In both cor- pora, we observed a number of OOVs are seg- mented correctly. For instance, 管理法 (manage- ment law) is an OOV word in PKU corpus. In this word, 管理 (management) appears frequently and 法 (law) is a common suffix in Chinese synthetic words, such as 行政法 (administrative law) or 国 际 法 (international law). This type of pseudo- OOVs share a major contribution to upgrade the system performance. We also observed that some polysemous words bring ambiguities to the chunk- ing step. The character 会 carries the meanings "will" as an auxiliary verb or "meeting" in a syn- thetic word 运动会 (sports meeting).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented a series processes to reduce OOV rate and extract morphological infor- mation inside Chinese synthetic words on a fine- grained word segmentation standard. As a result, we can improve the Chinese word segmentation performance (especially on pseudo-OOVs) with- out introducing any new feature types. Our pro- posed method achieved the state-of-the-art F-score and OOV recall on two common corpus PKU and MSR. However, note that we only exploited the flat segmented results of internal word structure here. As future work, we plan to exploit the full tree structure of synthetic words to improve not only CWS but also additional downstream tasks such as sentence parsing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The Flow Chart of the Chinese Word Segmentation System.</figDesc></figure>
