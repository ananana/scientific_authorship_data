				<p>Natural languages change over time because they evolve to the needs of their users and the socio-technological environment. This study investigates the di-achronic accuracy of pre-trained language models for downstream tasks in machine learning and user profiling. It asks the question: given that the social media platform and its users remain the same, how is language changing over time? How can these differences be used to track the changes in the affect around a particular topic? To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that it is possible to measure diachronic semantic drifts within social media and within the span of a few years.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Natural languages are dynamic-they are con- stantly evolving and adapting to the needs of their users and the environment of their use ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Frermann and Lapata, 2016)</ref>. The arrival of large-scale col- lections of historic texts and online libraries and Google Books have greatly facilitated computa- tional investigations of language change over the span of decades. Diachronic differences measure semantic drift specifically for languages over time. For instance, the meaning of the word 'follow' has changed from a reference, then to surveil- lance, and finally to the act of subscribing to a social media user's feed. In a quantitative anal- ysis, diachronic differences may explain why pre- dictive models go 'stale'. For instance, a sentiment model trained on Victorian-era language would la- bel 'aweful' as positive sentiment; however, in contemporary usage, 'awful' is considered a nega- tive word ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011</ref>). Thus mo- tivated, we raise the following research questions:</p><p>• How do language models trained at one point in time, perform at predicting age and gender on language from a subsequent time?</p><p>• What is the practical benefit of measuring di- achronic differences on Twitter?</p><p>To our knowledge, there is no existing work which has investigated whether, and how, language mod- els degrade over time, i.e. why predictive models trained on an older sample of language, may fail to work on contemporary language. While pre- vious studies have explored the change in word meanings spanning decades or hundreds of years, we address a research gap by exploring finer tem- poral granularity and using a more accessible lan- guage corpus. Twitter's 1 discourse is rather differ- ent from traditional English writing. So far, word embeddings trained on Twitter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kulkarni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) have considered it a static corpus, and have not used it to study short term changes in word connotations. It contributes with the following observations:</p><p>• Diachronic differences are greater (hence, language change is faster) for younger social media users than older social media users.</p><p>• Diachronic language differences enable the measurement of the change in social attitudes (captured by word embeddings).</p><p>In order to study this phenomenon, we define the notion of temporal cohorts as a set of social me- dia users who have posted on Twitter during the same time period, e.g., in the year 2011. In this study, we evaluate the linguistic differences be- tween temporal cohorts, e.g. 20-year-olds in 2011 vs. 20-year-olds in 2015.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>A number of studies have built language models to predict users' age and gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Sap et al., 2014</ref>), personality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Schwartz et al., 2013</ref>) and other traits (Jaidka et al., 2018a) with high accuracy from a sample of their social media posts. We offer the explanation that these language models may have 'degraded' due to the diachronic changes in lan- guage over the past few years, as compared to the predictions on their posts in 2011, which is closer to the time period for which their model was actu- ally trained (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>The work by <ref type="bibr">Frerman and Lapata (2016)</ref> quan- tified meaning change in terms of emerging mean- ings over many time periods, on a corpus collating documents spanning the years 1700-2010. Studies measuring semantic drift using word embedding models trained on Twitter corpora, such as Twit- ter <ref type="bibr">GloVe and Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kulkarni et al., 2015)</ref>, have considered microblog posts a static resource, reflective of modern lan- guage usage at a single point in time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Szymanski (2017)</ref> highlights the need to explore it in contem- porary language e.g. social media. We illustrate that it is possible to measure diachronic semantic drifts within social media and within the span of a few years. Furthermore, we are arguing that year- related change affects different cohorts differently.</p><p>We use part-of-speech information about word embeddings to better understand semantic drift in terms of the adjective and affective words used to connotate everyday concepts. In doing so, we follow the approach outlined in previous work by <ref type="bibr">Gart et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hamilton et al. (2016a)</ref> to consider different kinds of contexts (e.g., adjec- tives, verbs and emotion words) to learn and com- pare distributional representations of target words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>We first establish the diachronic validity of language-based models through predictive evalu- ations. We then use topic models and word em- beddings as the quantitative lens through which to study the diachronic differences in the language of social media users, and linear methods to eas- ily interpret the differences between standardized coefficients as diachronic differences in user trait prediction from language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Predictive validity</head><p>We test the predictive performance of language models trained on a year's worth of social media posts from a subset of users who have provided their age and gender information.</p><p>• We train language models on the age-and gender-labeled primary dataset and evalu- ate their diachronic validity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hamilton et al., 2016b</ref>), i.e. their predictive performance on subsequently collected language samples.</p><p>• We identify age groups which drift faster than others by reporting predictive performance on users, stratified by year of birth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Language insights about diachronic differences</head><p>We use language for the following insights into di- achronic drift:</p><p>• Important changes: For each temporal co- hort, we identify the language features which have the most drift in terms of recalibrated coefficients, in regression models trained in 2011 vs. 2015. In doing so, we follow the approach described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rieman et al. (2017)</ref> to compare the standardized coefficients of the age and gender models trained on the lan- guage samples from 2011 and 2015.</p><p>• High drift concepts: We use word embed- dings to identify the semantic differences in the connotations around common concepts, for two sets of users who are a generation apart. Following the framework proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Garg et al. (2017)</ref>, we calculate semantic drift as the changes in the relative normalized dis- tance for the context words describing a set of target concepts. Target concepts comprise a group of words rep- resenting a single idea ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Garg et al., 2017)</ref>, for in- stance, positive emotion, derived from the LIWC psycholinguistic dictionary <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Pennebaker et al., 2007)</ref>, and sexual orientation and gender expres- sion (LGBTQ issues), based on a glossary on LGBTQ terms provided by the Human Rights Campaign 2 . We use the relative norm distance to identify the contextual words (mainly adjectives, adverbs and sentiment words) that are most differ- ent across the two word embedding models. Reg- ular expression matching for part-of-speech, sen- timent and emotion words was based on LIWC and the NRC emotion lexicon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mohammad et al., 2013</ref>). Among a variety of distance metrics, eu- clidean distances provided the most interpretable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Datasets and Pre-processing</head><p>Primary data: Our primary dataset consists of the Twitter posts of adults in the United States of America who were recruited by Qualtrics (a crowdsourcing platform similar to Amazon Me- chanical Turk) for an online survey, and consented to share access to their Twitter posts. This data was collected in a previous study by Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc- Pietro et al. <ref type="formula">(2017)</ref> and is available online <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . We restrict our analysis to tweets posted between Jan- uary 2011 and December 2015, by those users who indicated English as a primary language, have written at least 10 posts in their posts in each year, and have reported age and binary gender as a part of the survey. This resulted in a dataset of N = 554 users, who wrote a mean of 265 and a median of 156 posts per year and over 13.5 million words collectively. The mean age of the popula- tion was 33.54 years. 59% of them self-identified as male. Decahose (Twitter 10%) dataset: For insights based on word embeddings, we used the decahose samples for the years 2011 and 2014 collected by the TrendMiner project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2012)</ref>, which comprises a 10% random sample of the real-time Twitter firehose using a realtime sampling algorithm. To match with our primary data, we used bounding boxes to consider only those tweets with geolocation information which were posted in the United States. In this manner, we obtained 130 and 179 million Twitter posts for 2011 and 2014 respectively. Pre-processing: In a dataset of 554 users, the ab- solute vocabulary overlap may be low. By convert- ing each users string of words into their probabilis- tic usage of 2000 topics, we expected to get more stable estimates than using word-based language models. We represent the language of each user as a probabilistic distribution of 2000 topics derived using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with α set to 0.30 to favor fewer topics per document. These topics are modeled as open-ended clusters of words from actual distributions in social media over approximately 18 million Facebook updates, and are provided as an open-sourced resource in the DLATK python toolkit (  <ref type="bibr">et al., 2016)</ref> to optimize the prediction of co- occurrence relationships using an approximate ob- jective known as skip-gram with negative sam- pling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) with incremental ini- tialization and optimizing our embeddings with a stochastic gradient descent. Embeddings were trained using the top-50000 words by their average frequency over the entire time period. A similar threshold has also been applied in previous papers <ref type="bibr">(Hamilton et al., 2016a,b)</ref>. We experimented with different window sizes and parameter settings, fi- nally choosing a window size of 4, embeddings with 1000 dimensions, and the negative sample prior α set to log(5) and the number of negative samples set to 500. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> </p><note type="other">). Predictive evaluation: We use Python's sklearn library to conduct a ten-fold cross-validation and train weighted linear regression models for age, and binary logistic regression models for gender, on the LDA-derived features for users in nine folds, and test on the users in the held out fold. We use feature selection, elastic-net regulariza- tion, and randomized PCA to avoid over-fitting. Although we tested other linguistic features such as n-grams, the best predictive performance was for models trained on the topic features. Word embeddings: We separately train word embeddings on the language of the Twitter 10% sample from 2011, and the sample from 2014. We use Google's Tensorflow framework (Abadi</note></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Predictive performance</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we report performance error in pre- dicting age as the mean of (actual−predicted) in order to better understand the model bias towards predicting younger or older ages.</p><p>We observe that the age-and gender-predic- tive models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sap et al. (2014)</ref> degrade in per- formance on language samples from more re- cent years. They have a lower mean error in age prediction and higher accuracy in gender predic- tion on the a language sample from 2011 as com- pared to 2015; yet, our test sets are ostensibly drawn from the same corpus as the original train- ing data. This shows that even models trained on large datasets show performance degradation if they are tested against newer language samples for the same set of users. We observe the same trends on in-sample models trained and tested on our primary data (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Age and gender models perform the best when tested on a sam- ple from the same year, but age models degrade in performance over time, with older models tending to over-predict the age on subsequent samples. Newer models tend to under-predict the age on older samples of language. Taken together, these insights suggest that the rate of change in age (1 unit per year) is less than the rate of change in lan- guage use. Gender models demonstrate an approx- imately 7-12% drop in accuracy for subsequent or older years. In the next step, we attempt to understand the rate of change of language for social media users of different ages, which show larger variance as com- pared to gender. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> provides the results for a language model trained on the language sample of 2011 and tested to predict age from a language sample from 2011 and the subsequent years. The columns depict the birth year for users in the test set. This figure provides some important insights:</p><p>1. The first row has the smallest mean errors, which is expected since it is an in-sample pre- diction of a 2011-trained language model on itself. 2. The largest mean errors are seen at the bottom left, where the model is consistently under- predicting the age of older social media users whose language usage has little change over 5 years. 3. In the bottom-right, social media users born between 1992-1997 observe the highest over- estimation errors as they 'sound' older than they are. Despite their annual increment in age, the model still overpredicts their age by approximately twice as many years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Insights about Diachronic Differences</head><p>We want to understand performance degradation in terms of the change in the associations of lin- guistic features associated with higher age or with one of the genders. The age range in 2011 were <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">41]</ref> years and in 2015 were <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">45]</ref> years respectively. To explore diachronic differences in topic usage across two age-matched popula- tions, we subset the population to the subjects to the age range of <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">41]</ref> years during 2011- 2015 (N=429). Important changes: In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, we compare the standardized coefficients (p &lt; .001) of the predic- tors in models trained on the language of the year 2011 against those of 2015. We observe that a lot of the topics typically associated with older social media users in the 2011 model, 5 such as swearing, tiredness and sleep, changed their age bias. On the other hand, topics popular among younger social media users -for instance, topics mentioning em- ployable skills and meetings, percolated upward as the early adopters of social media grew older. In the case of gender, topics related to business meet- ings, the government, computers, and money were no longer predictive of males, while topics associ- ated with proms, relationships, and hairstyles were no longer predictive of females.  High drift concepts: We now illustrate di- achronic differences in terms of the changing con- text around the same concept, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. We have identified the words which show the largest drift between 2011-2014, in terms of their association with LGBTQ issues and positive emotion. We ob- serve that this method of comparing the relative differences in distances, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Garg et al. (2017)</ref>, is able to capture social attitudes towards gender issues, as well as the emerging trends in netspeak. Specifically, in the discussions around LGBTQ issues in 2014, the words that emerge are closer to the actual experiences of the group, with words referring to 'passing' (a reference to trans- sexuals) and 'coping', as well as more positive emotion words ('yayy', 'harmony').</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>To summarize, our findings show that diachronic differences in language can be observed on so- cial media and their effect differs for social me- dia users of varying ages. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, consider again the users of the same age at different points of time. For instance, compare the errors for 22- year old users in 2011 (born in 1989) against those for 22-year-old users in 2012 (born in 1990), and so on. The variance in error along these diagonals, are high in the right side of the table. This suggests that in every subsequent year, the language of late- teens and early-twenties is more different from the language of their contemporaries from the year be- fore. On the other hand, compare the errors for 37-year-olds in 2011 (born in 1974) against those for 37-year-olds in <ref type="bibr">2012 (born in 1975)</ref>. The er- rors have a low variance along the diagonals in the left of the <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref> Among social media users in their late thirties, the language of each cohort of 35-year-olds changes little over the previous year. Next, consider the quantitative insights from Ta- ble 1. The results suggest that over time, young users from 2011 continued to use certain topics, while older users adopted newer trends. We found that if we do not use age-matched samples in this experiment, the coefficients for other topics are also flipped, but this effect is noticeably dimin- ished with an age-matched subset. This suggests that indeed, a part of the language drift appeared because 1/5th of the population was shifting along the temporal axis, which also associates their dis- tinct topical preferences with an older age group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</head><p>This study offers an empirical study of how gender and age classifiers degrade over time, a qualitative study of the features whose coefficients change the most, and concepts that drift in meaning over time. The language of social media posts can be used to study semantic drift over short periods of time, even from a dataset of 554 social media users. These methods can also find application in the study of other linguistic phenomena such as pol- ysemy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hamilton et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Szymanski, 2017)</ref>. However, there is a need to disentangle which dif- ferences are due to the changing use of language from the ones due to changes in topics and trends on social media.</p><p>Language models degrade over time, but it not always feasible to retrain models with new data. In future work, we plan to explore whether domain adaptation techniques can resolve diachronic per- formance differences, in addition to generalizing language models to other platforms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jaidka et al., 2018b</ref>) or scaling to measure communities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rieman et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Cross-year performance for predicting (a) age (reported as M eanError = Age actual −Age predicted ) and (b) gender (reported as Accuracy).
