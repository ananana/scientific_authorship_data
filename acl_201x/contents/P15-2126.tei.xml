				<p>Humans are idiosyncratic and variable: towards the same topic, they might hold different opinions or express the same opinion in various ways. It is hence important to model opinions at the level of individual users; however it is impractical to estimate independent sentiment classification models for each user with limited data. In this paper, we adopt a model-based transfer learning solution-using linear transformations over the parameters of a generic model-for personalized opinion analysis. Extensive experimental results on a large collection of Amazon reviews confirm our method significantly outperformed a user-independent generic opinion model as well as several state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The proliferation of user-generated opinionated text data has fueled great interest in opinion analy- sis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pang and Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liu, 2012)</ref>. Understand- ing opinions expressed by a population of users has value in a wide spectrum of areas, including social network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bodendorf and Kaiser, 2009)</ref>, business intelligence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gamon et al., 2005</ref>), marketing analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jansen et al., 2009)</ref>, person- alized recommendation ( ) and many more.</p><p>Most of the existing opinion analysis research focuses on population-level analyses, i.e., predict- ing opinions based on models estimated from a collection of users. The underlying assumption is that users are homogeneous in the way they ex- press opinions. Nevertheless, different users may use the same words to express distinct opinions. For example, the word "expensive" tends to be associated with negative sentiment in general, al- though some users may use it to describe their sat- isfaction with a product's quality. Failure to rec- ognize this difference across users will inevitably lead to inaccurate understanding of opinions.</p><p>However, due to the limited availability of user- specific opinionated data, it is impractical to es- timate independent models for each user. In this work, we propose a transfer learning based solu- tion, named LinAdapt, to address this challenge. Instead of estimating independent classifiers for each user, we start from a generic model and adapt it toward individual users based on their own opin- ionated text data. In particular, our key assump- tion is that the adaptation can be achieved via a set of linear transformations over the generic model's parameters. When we have sufficient observations for a particular user, the transformations will push the adapted model towards the user's personalized model; otherwise, it will back off to the generic model. Empirical evaluations on a large collection of Amazon reviews verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution: it significantly outperformed a user-independent generic model as well as several state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</p><p>Our contribution is two-fold: 1) we enable ef- ficient personalization of opinion analysis via a transfer learning approach, and 2) the proposed so- lution is general and applicable to any linear model for user opinion analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Sentiment Analysis refers to the process of iden- tifying subjective information in source materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pang and Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liu, 2012)</ref>. Typical tasks in- clude: 1) classifying textual documents into posi- tive and negative polarity categories, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dave et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kim and Hovy, 2004</ref>); 2) identifying textual topics and their associated opinions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang et al., 2010</ref>; Jo and Oh, 2011); and 3) opinion summa- rization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hu and Liu, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ku et al., 2006</ref>). Ap- proaches for these tasks focus on population-level opinion analyses, in which one model is shared across all users. Little effort has been devoted to personalized opinion analyses, where each user has a particular model, due to the absence of user-specific opinion data for model estimation.</p><p>Transfer Learning aims to help improve pre- dictive models by using knowledge from different but related problems ). In the opinion mining community, transfer learning is used primarily for domain adaptation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Blitzer et al. (2006)</ref> proposed structural correspondence learning to identify the correspondences among features between different domains via the concept of pivot features.  propose a spec- tral feature alignment algorithm to align domain- specific sentiment words from different domains for sentiment categorization.

(2011)</ref> ap- plied instance-based transfer learning for real time sentiment analysis.</p><p>Our method is inspired by a personalized rank- ing model adaptation method developed by . To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to estimate user-level classifiers for opinion analysis. By adapting a generic opin- ion classification model for each user, heterogene- ity among their expressions of opinions can be captured and it help us understand users' opinions at a finer granularity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Linear Transformation Based Model Adaptation</head><p>Given a generic sentiment classification model y = f s (x), we aim at finding an optimal adapted model y = f u (x) for user u, such that f u (x) best cap- tures u's opinion in his/her generated textual doc- uments</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D u = {x d , y d } |D| d=1</formula><p>, where x d is the feature vector for document d, y d is the sentiment class label (e.g., positive v.s., negative). To achieve so, we assume that such adaptation can be performed via a series of linear transformations on f s (x)'s model parameter w s . This assumption is general and can be applied to a wide variety of sentiment classifiers, e.g., logistic regression and linear sup- port vector machines, as long as they have a linear core function. Therefore, we name our proposed method as LinAdapt. In this paper, we focus on logistic regression ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Pang et al., 2002</ref>); but the pro- posed procedures can be easily adopted for many other classifiers ( ).</p><p>Our global model y = f s (x) can be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P s (y d = 1|x d ) = 1 1 + e −w s T x d (1)</formula><p>where w s are the linear coefficients for the corre- sponding document features. Standard linear transformations, i.e., scaling, shifting and rotation, can be encoded via a V × (V + 1) matrix A u for each user u as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">        a u g(1) c u g(1),12 c u g(1),13 0 0 b u g(1) c u g(2),21 a u g(2) c u g(2),23 . . . 0 b u g(2) c u g(3),31 c u g(3),32 a u g(3)</formula><p>. . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">. . . b u g(3) 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0 . . . . . . a u g(V ) b u g(V )        </formula><p>where V is the total number of features. However, the above transformation introduces O(V 2 ) free parameters, which are even more than the number of free parameters required to estimate a new logistic regression model. Following the so- lution proposed by , we further assume the transformations can be performed in a group-wise manner to reduce the size of param- eters in adaptation. The intuition behind this as- sumption is that features that share similar contri- butions to the classification model are more likely to be adapted in the same way. Another advantage of feature grouping is that the feedback informa- tion will be propagated through the features in the same group while adaptation; hence the features that are not observed in the adaptation data can also be updated properly.</p><p>We denote g(·) as the feature grouping function, which maps V original features to K groups, and a u k , b u k and c u k as the scaling, shifting and rotation operations over w s in group k for user u. In addi- tion, rotation is only performed for the features in the same group, and it is assumed to be symmetric, i.e., c u k,ij = c u k,ji , where g(i) = k and g(j) = k. As a result, the personalized classification model f u (x) after adaptation can be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P u (y d = 1|x d ) = 1 1 + e −(A u ˜ w s ) T x d (2)</formula><p>where˜wwhere˜ where˜w s = (w s , 1) to accommodate the shifting operation.</p><p>The optimal transformation matrix A u for user u can be estimated by maximum likelihood esti- mation based on user u's own opinionated docu- ment collection D u . To avoid overfitting, we pe- nalize the transformation which increases the dis- crepancy between the adapted model and global model by the following regularization term,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R(A u ) = − η 2 K k=1 (a u k − 1) 2 − σ 2 K k=1 b u k 2 − 2 K k=1 i,g(i)=k j =i,g(j)=k c u k,ij</formula><p>Combining the newly introduced regularization term for A u and log-likelihood function for logis- tic regression, we get the following optimization problem to estimate the adaptation parameters,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">max A u L(A u ) = LLR(D u ; P u ) + R(A u )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where L LR (D u ; P u ) is the log-likelihood of logis- tic regression on collection D u , and P u is defined in Eq (2). Gradient-based method is used to optimize Eq (4), in which the gradient for a u k , b u k and c u k can be calculated as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∂L(A u ) ∂a k = D u d=1 {y d [1 − p(y d |x d )] i,g(i)=k w s i x di }−η(a k − 1) ∂L(A u ) ∂b k = D u d=1 {y d [1 − p(y d |x d )] i,g(i)=k x di }−σb k ∂L(A u ) ∂c k,ij = D u d=1 {y d [1 − p(y d |x d )]w s j x di }−c k,ij</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and Discussion</head><p>We performed empirical evaluations of the pro- posed LinAdapt algorithm on a large collection of product review documents. We compared our ap- proach with several state-of-the-art transfer learn- ing algorithms. In the following, we will first in- troduce the evaluation corpus and baselines, and then discuss our experimental findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Collection and Baselines</head><p>We used a corpus of Amazon reviews provided on Stanford SNAP website by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">McAuley and Leskovec. (2013)</ref>. We performed simple data pre- processing: 1) annotated the reviews with ratings greater than 3 stars (out of total 5 stars) as positive, and others as negative; 2) removed duplicate re- views; 3) removed reviewers who have more than 1,000 reviews or more than 90% positive or neg- ative reviews; 4) chronologically ordered the re- views in each user. We extracted unigrams and bi- grams to construct bag-of-words feature represen- tations for the review documents. Standard stop- word removal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lewis et al., 2004</ref>) and Porter stem- ming <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Willett, 2006</ref>) were applied. Chi-square and information gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Yang and Pedersen, 1997)</ref> were used for feature selection and the union of the resulting selected features are used in the fi- nal controlled vocabulary. The resulting evalua- tion data set contains 32,930 users, 281,813 posi- tive reviews, and 81,522 negative reviews, where each review is represented with 5,000 text features with TF-IDF as the feature value.</p><p>Our first baseline is an instance-based adapta- tion method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brighton and Mellish, 2002</ref>). The k- nearest neighbors of each testing review document are found from the shared training set for person- alized model training. As a result, for each test- ing case, we are estimating an independent clas- sification model. We denote this method as "Re- Train." The second baseline builds on the model- based adaptation method developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Geng et al. (2012)</ref>. For each user, it enforces the adapted model to be close to the global model via an ad- ditional L2 regularization when training the per- sonalized model. But the full set of parameters in logistic regression need to estimated during adap- tation. We denote this method as "Reg-LR."</p><p>In our experiments, all model adaptation is per- formed in an online fashion: we first applied the up-to-date classification model on the given test- ing document; evaluated the model's performance with ground-truth; and used the feedback to up- date the model. Because the class distribution of our evaluation data set is highly skewed (77.5% positive), it is important to evaluate the adapted models' performance on both classes. In the fol- lowing comparisons, we report the average F-1 measure of both positive and negative classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparison of Adaptation Performance</head><p>First we need to estimate a global model for adap- tation. A typical approach is to collect a portion of historical reviews from each user to construct a shared training corpus ( . How- ever, this setting is problematic: it already exploits information from every user and does not reflect the reality that some (new) users might not exist when training the global model. In our experi- ment, we isolated a group of random users for global model training. In addition, since there are multiple categories in this review collection, such as book, movies, electronics, etc, and each user might discuss various categories, it is infeasible to balance the coverage of different categories in global model training by only selecting the users. As a result, we vary the number of reviews in each domain from the selected training users to estimate the global model. We started with 1000 reviews from the top 5 categories (Movies &amp; TV, Books, Music, Home &amp; Kitchen, and Video Games), then evaluated the global model on 10,000 testing users which consist of three groups: light users with 2 to 10 reviews, medium users with 11 to 50 reviews, and heavy users with 51 to 200 reviews. After each evaluation run, we added an extra 1000 reviews and repeated the training and evaluation.  To understand the effect of global model train- ing in model adaptation, we also included the per- formance of LinAdapt, which only used shifting and scaling operations and Cross feature group- ing method with k = 400 (detailed feature group- ing method will be discussed in the next exper- iment). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the performance of the global model and LinAdapt with respect to differ- ent training corpus size. We found that the global model converged very quickly with around 5,000 reviews, and this gives the best compromise for both positive and negative classes in both global and adaptaed model. Therefore, we will use this global model for later adaptation experiments.</p><p>We then investigated the effect of feature group- ing in LinAdapt. We employed the feature group- ing methods of SV D and Cross developed by . A random feature grouping method is included to validate the necessity of proper feature grouping. We varied the number of feature groups from 100 to 1000, and evaluated the adapted models using the same 10,000 testing users from the previous experiment. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, Cross provided the best adaptation per- formance and random is the worse; a moderate group size balances performance between positive and negative classes. For the remaining experi- ments, we use the Cross grouping with k = 400 in LinAdapt. In this group setting, we found that the average number of features per group is 12.47 while the median is 12, which means that features are normally distributed across different groups.</p><p>Next, we investigated the effect of differ- ent linear operations in LinAdapt, and com- pared LinAdapt against the baselines. We started LinAdapt with only the shifting operation, and then included scaling and rotation. To validate the necessity of personalizing sentiment classifica- tion models, we also included the global model's performance in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. In particular, to under- stand the longitudinal effect of personalized model adaptation, we only used the heavy users (4,021 users) in this experiment. The results indicate that the adapted models outperformed the global model in identifying the negative class; while the global model performs the best in recognizing pos- itive reviews. This is due to the heavily biased class distribution in our collection: global model puts great emphasis on the positive reviews; while the adaptation methods give equal weights to both positive and negative reviews. In particular, in LinAdapt, scaling and shifting operations lead to satisfactory adaptation performance for the nega- tive class with only 15 reviews; while rotation is essential for recognizing the positive class.</p><p>To better understand the improvement of model adaptation against the global model in different types of users, we decomposed the performance gain of different adaptation methods. For this ex- periment, we used all the 10,000 testing users: we used the first 50% of the reviews from each user for adaptation and the rest for testing. Ta- ble 3 shows the performance gain of different al- gorithms under light, medium and heavy users. For the heavy and medium users, which only consist 0.1% and 35% of the total population in our data set, our adaptation model achieved the best improvement against the global model com- pared with Reg-LR and ReTrain. For the light users, who cover 64.9% of the total population, LinAdapt was able to improve the performance against the global model for the negative class, but Reg-LR and ReTrain had attained higher perfor- mance. For the positive class, none of those adap- tation methods can improve over the global model although they provide a very close performance (in LinAdapt, the differences are not significant). The significant improvement in negative class predic- tion from model adaptation is encouraging con- sidering the biased distribution of classes, which results in poor performance in the global model.    word that is not used by many users; second, a word is being used frequently, yet, with the same polarity. We are only interested in the second case. Therefore, for each word, we compute its user fre- quency (UF), i.e., how many unique users used this word in their reviews. Then, we selected 1000 most popular features by UF, and ranked them ac- cording to the variance of learned sentiment polar- ities. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the top ten features with the highest and lowest polarity variance. We inspected the learned weights in the adapted models in each user from LinAdapt, and found the words like waste, poor, and good share the same sentiment polarity as in the global model but different magnitudes; while words like money, instead, and return are almost neutral in global model, but vary across the personalized models. On the other hand, words such as care, sex, evil, pure, and correct constantly carry the same sen- timent across users. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows the detailed range of learned polarity for three typical opin- ion words in 10,000 users. This result indicates LinAdapt well captures the fact that users express opinions differently even with the same words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we developed a transfer learning based solution for personalized opinion mining. Linear transformations of scaling, shifting and ro- tation are exploited to adapt a global sentiment classification model for each user. Empirical evaluations based on a large collection of opin- ionated review documents confirm that the pro- posed method effectively models personal opin- ions. By analyzing the variance of the learned feature weights, we are able to discover words that hold different polarities across users, which indicates our model captures the fact that users express opinions differently even with the same words. In the future, we plan to further explore this linear transformation based adaptation from different perspectives, e.g., sharing adaptation op- erations across users or review categories.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Online adaptation performance comparisons.</figDesc></figure>
