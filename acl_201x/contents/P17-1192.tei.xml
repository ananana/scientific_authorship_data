				<p>We present a method for populating fine-grained classes (e.g., &quot;1950s Amer-ican jazz musicians&quot;) with instances (e.g., Charles Mingus). While state-of-the-art methods tend to treat class labels as single lexical units, the proposed method considers each of the individual modifiers in the class label relative to the head. An evaluation on the task of reconstructing Wikipedia category pages demonstrates a &gt;10 point increase in AUC, over a strong baseline relying on widely-used Hearst patterns.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The majority of approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Snow et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shwartz et al., 2016</ref>) for extracting IsA rela- tions from text rely on lexical patterns as the primary signal of whether an instance belongs to a class. For example, observing a pattern like "X such as Y" is a strong indication that Y (e.g., "Charles Mingus") is an instance of class X (e.g., "musician") <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hearst, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Methods based on these "Hearst patterns" assume that class labels can be treated as atomic lexicalized units. This assumption has several significant weakness. First, in order to recognize an instance of a class, these pattern- based methods require that the entire class la- bel be observed verbatim in text. The require- ment is reasonable for class labels containing a single word, but in practice, there are many possible fine-grained classes: not only "mu- sicians" but also "1950s American jazz mu- sicians". The probability that a given label will appear in its entirety within one of the expected patterns is very low, even in large * Contributed during an internship at Google.  amounts of text. Second, when class labels are treated as though they cannot be decom- posed, every class label must be modeled inde- pendently, even those containing overlapping words ("American jazz musician", "French jazz musician"). As a result, the number of meaning representations to be learned is ex- ponential in the length of the class label, and quickly becomes intractable. Thus, composi- tional models of taxonomic relations are nec- essary for better language understanding.</p><p>We introduce a compositional approach for reasoning about fine-grained class labels. Our approach is based on the notion from formal semantics, in which modifiers ("1950s") corre- spond to properties that differentiate instances of a subclass ("1950s musicians") from in- stances of the superclass ("musicians") <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Heim and Kratzer, 1998)</ref>. Our method consists of two stages: interpreting each modifier rela- tive to the head ("musicians active during 1950s"), and using the interpretations to iden- tify instances of the class from text ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  1</ref>). Our main contributions are: 1) a compo- sitional method for IsA extraction, which in-volves a novel application of noun-phrase para- phrasing methods to the task of semantic tax- onomy induction and 2) the operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics that are often kept separate in NLP: assigning intrinsic "mean- ing" to a phrase, and reasoning about that phrase in a truth-theoretic context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Noun Phrase Interpretation. Compound noun phrases ("jazz musician") communicate implicit semantic relations between modifiers and the head. Many efforts to provide se- mantic interpretations of such phrases rely on matching the compound to pre-defined pat- terns or semantic ontologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fares et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">´ O Séaghdha and Copestake, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tratz and Hovy, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Surtani and Paul, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Choi et al., 2015)</ref>. Recently, interpretations may take the form of arbitrary natural language predicates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hendrickx et al., 2013</ref>). Most approaches are supervised, comparing un- seen noun compounds to the most similar phrase seen in training <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wijaya and Gianfortoni, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nulty and Costello, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Van de Cruys et al., 2013</ref>). Other unsupervised ap- proaches apply information extraction tech- niques to paraphrase noun compounds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kim and Nakov, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xavier and Strube de Lima, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pa¸scaPa¸sca, 2015)</ref>. They focus exclusively on providing good paraphrases for an input noun compound. To our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to use these interpretations for the downstream task of IsA relation extraction.</p><p>IsA Relation Extraction. Most efforts to acquire taxonomic relations from text build on the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hearst (1992)</ref>, which ob- serves that certain textual patterns-e.g., "X and other Y"-are high-precision indicators of whether X is a member of class Y. Recent work focuses on learning such patterns au- tomatically from corpora ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Snow et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shwartz et al., 2016)</ref>. These IsA extraction techniques provide a key step for the more gen- eral task of knowledge base population. The "universal schema" approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Riedel et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kirschnick et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Verga et al., 2017)</ref>, which infers relations using matrix fac- torization, often includes Hearst patterns as input features. Graphical ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bansal et al., 2014)</ref> and joint inference models <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Movshovitz-Attias and Cohen, 2015)</ref> typically require Hearst pat- terns to define an inventory of possible classes. A separate line of work avoids Hearst pat- terns by instead exploiting semi-structured data from HTML markup ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wang and Cohen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dalvi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pasupat and Liang, 2014</ref>). These approaches all share the limita- tion that, in practice, in order for a class to be populated with instances, the entire class label has to have been observed verbatim in text. This requirement limits the ability to handle arbitrarily fine-grained classes. Our work addresses this limitation by modeling fine-grained class labels compositionally. Thus the proposed method can combine evidence from multiple sentences, and can perform IsA extraction without requiring any example in- stances of a given class. 1</p><p>Taxonomy Construction. Previous work on the construction of a taxonomy of IsA rela- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Flati et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">de Melo and Weikum, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kozareva and Hovy, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ponzetto and Strube, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009</ref>) con- siders that task to be different than extracting a flat set of IsA relations from text in prac- tice. Challenges specific to taxonomy con- struction include overall concept positioning and how to discover whether concepts are un- related, subordinated or parallel to each other ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kozareva and Hovy, 2010)</ref>; the need to re- fine and enrich the taxonomy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Flati et al., 2014)</ref>; the difficulty in adding relevant IsA relations towards the top of the taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009)</ref>; eliminating cy- cles and inconsistencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kozareva and Hovy, 2010)</ref>. For prac- tical purposes, these challenges are irrelevant when extracting flat IsA relations. Whereas  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2013)</ref> contain not just a taxonomy of IsA relations, but also relation types other than IsA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Modifiers as Functions</head><p>Formalization. In formal semantics, mod- ification is modeled as function application. Specifically, let M H be a class label consisting of a head H, which we assume to be a com- mon noun, preceded by a modifier M . We use · to represent the "interpretation function" that maps a linguistic expression to its deno- tation in the world. The interpretation of a common noun is the set of entities 2 in the uni- verse U. They are denoted by the noun <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Heim and Kratzer, 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H = {e ∈ U | e is a H} (1)</formula><p>The interpretation of a modifier M is a func- tion that maps between sets of entities. That is, modifiers select a subset 3 of the input set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M (H) = {e ∈ H | e satisfies M }<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This formalization leaves open how one de- cides whether or not "e satisfies M ". This non- trivial, as the meaning of a modifier can vary depending on the class it is modifying: if e is a "good student", e is not necessarily a "good person", making it difficult to model whether "e satisfies good " in general. We therefore re- frame the above equation, so that the decision of whether "e satisfies M " is made by calling a binary function φ M , parameterized by the class H within which e is being considered:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M (H) = {e ∈ H | φ M (H, e)}<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Conceptually, φ M captures the core "mean- ing" of the modifier M , which is the set of properties that differentiate members of the output class M H from members of the more general input class H. This formal semantics framework has two important consequences. First, the modifier has an intrinsic "mean- ing". The properties entailed by the modi- fier are independent of the particular state of the world. This makes it possible to make in- ferences about "1950s musician" even if no 1950s musician have been observed. Second, the modifier is a function that can be applied in a truth-theoretic setting. That is, apply- ing "1950s" to the set of "musicians" returns exactly the set of "1950s musicians".</p><p>Computational Approaches. While the notion of modifiers as functions has been in- corporated into computational models previ- ously, prior work focuses on either assigning an intrinsic meaning to M or on operationalizing M in a truth-theoretic sense, but not on do- ing both simultaneously. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Young et al. (2014)</ref> focuses exclusively on the subset selection aspect of modification. That is, given a set of instances H and a modifier M , their method could return the subset M H. How- ever, their method does not model the mean- ing of the modifier itself, so that, e.g., if there were no red cars in their model of the world, the phrase "red cars" would have no mean- ing. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Zamparelli (2010)</ref> models the meaning of modifiers explicitly as functions that map between vector-space rep- resentations of nouns. However, their model focuses on similarity between class labels-e.g., to say that "important routes" is similar to "major roads"-and it is not obvious how the method could be operationalized in order to identify instances of those classes. A contri- bution of our work is to model the semantics of M intrinsically, but in a way that permits application in the model theoretic setting. We learn an explicit model of the "meaning" of a modifier M relative to a head H, represented as a distribution over properties that differen- tiate the members of the class M H from those of the class H. We then use this representa- tion to identify the subset of instances of H, which constitute the subclass M H.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2007</head><p>). We therefore model the semantic re- lation between M and H as a distribution over properties that could potentially define the subclass M H ⊆ H. We will refer to this distribution as a "property profile" for M relative to H. We make the assumption that relations between M and H that are dis- cussed more often are more likely to capture the important properties of the subclass M H. This assumption is not perfect (Section 4.4) but has given good results for paraphrasing noun phrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nakov and Hearst, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pa¸scaPa¸sca, 2015)</ref>. Our method for learning property pro- files is based on the unsupervised method pro- posed by Pa¸scaPa¸sca (2015), which uses query logs as a source of common sense knowledge, and rewrites noun compounds by matching M H ("American musicians") to queries of the form "H(. * )M " ("musicians from America").</p></div>

Classes are rep- resented as (non-disambiguated) natural lan- guage strings. We instantiate D with a large repository of facts extracted using in-house im- plementations of <ref type="bibr">ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011</ref>) and OLLIE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mausam et al., 2012</ref>). The predicates are extracted as natural language strings. Subjects and objects may be either disambiguated entity references or natural lan- guage strings. Every tuple is included in both the forward and the reverse direction. E.g. jazz, perform at, venue also appears as venue, ←perform at, jazz, where ← is a spe-cial character signifying inverted predicates. These inverted predicates simplify the follow- ing definitions. In total, O contains 1.1M tu- ples and D contains 30M tuples.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">O, containing e, C tuples</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Building Property Profiles</head><p>Properties. Let I be a function that takes as input a noun phrase M H and returns a property profile for M relative to H. We de- fine a "property" to be a tuple of a subject, predicate and object in which the subject posi- tion 5 is a wildcard, e.g. * , born in, America. Any instance that fills the wildcard slot then "has" the property. We expand adjectival modifiers to encompass nominalized forms us- ing a nominalization dictionary extracted from WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Miller, 1995)</ref>. If M H is "Ameri- can musician" and we require a tuple to have the form H, p, M, w, we will include tuples in which the third element is either "American" or "America".</p><p>Relating M to H Directly. We first build property profiles by taking the predicate and object from any tuple in D in which the sub- ject is the head and the object is the modifier:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I 1 (M H) = {{{p, M , w | H, p, M, w ∈ D}<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Relating M to an Instance of H. We also consider an extension in which, rather than requiring the subject to be the class label H, we require the subject to be an instance of H.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I 2 (M H) = {{{p, M , w | e, H ∈ O ∧∧e, p, M, w ∈ D}<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Modifier Expansion. In practice, when building property profiles, we do not require that the object of the fact tuple match the modifier exactly, as suggested in Eq. 4 and 5. Instead, we follow Pa¸scaPa¸sca (2015) and take ad- vantage of facts involving distributionally sim- ilar modifiers. Specifically, rather than look- ing only at tuples in D in which the object matches M , we consider all tuples, but dis- count the weight proportionally to the simi- larity between M and the object of the tuple.</p></div>

I 2 is computed analogously. We compute sim using a vector space built from Web documents following Lin and Wu (2009); <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pantel et al. (2009)</ref>. We retain the 100 most similar phrases for each of ∼10M phrases, and consider all other similarities to be 0. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides examples of good and bad property profiles for several M Hs. In general, frequent relations between M and H capture relevant properties of M H, but it is not always the case. To illustrate, the most frequently dis- cussed relation between "child" and "actor" is that actors have children, but this property is not indicative of the meaning of "child ac- tor". Qualitatively, the top-ranked interpreta- tions learned by using the head noun directly (I 1 , Eq. 4) are very similar to those learned using instances of the head (I 2 , Eq. 5). How- ever, I 2 returns many more properties (10 on average per M H) than I 1 (just over 1 on av- erage). Anecdotally, we see that I 2 captures more specific relations than does I 1 . For exam- ple, for "jazz musicians", both methods return "* write jazz" and "* compose jazz", but I 2 additionally returns properties like "* be ma- jor creative influence in jazz". We compare I 1 and I 2 quantitatively in Section 6. Impor- tantly, we do see that both I 1 and I 2 are capa- ble of learning head-specific property profiles for a modifier.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>: Head-specific property profiles learned by relating instances of H to the mod- ifier M (I 2 ).

In practice, rather than being a binary func- tion that decides whether or not e is in class M H, our instantiation, ˆ φ M , will return a real- valued score expressing the confidence that e is a member of M H. For notational conve- nience, let D(s, p, o) = w, if s, p, o, w ∈ D and 0 otherwise.

Given a class label C = M 1 . . . M k H that contains a head H preceded by modifiers M 1 . . .

From here on, we use Mods to refer to our method that generates lists of instances for a class using Eq. 8 and 9.

When it is implemented using I 2 , we use the name Mods I (for "instances").</p><p>Weakly Supervised Reranking. Eq. 8 uses a naive ranking in which the weight for e ∈ M H is the product of how often e has been observed with some property and the weight of that property for the class M H. Thus, in- stances of H with overall higher counts in D receive high weights for every M H. We there- fore train a simple logistic regression model to predict the likelihood that e belongs to M H. We use a small set of features 7 , including the raw weight as computed in Eq. 7. For train- ing, we sample e, C pairs from our IsA repos- itory O as positive examples and random pairs that were not extracted by any Hearst pattern as negative examples. We frame the task as a binary prediction of whether e ∈ C, and use the model's confidence as the value ofˆφofˆ ofˆφ M in place of the function in Eq. 7.</p></div>

As a source of evalu- ation data, we use Wikipedia category pages (e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category: Pakistani film actresses). These are pages in which the title is the name of the category ("pakistani film actresses") and the body is a manually curated list of links to other pages that fall under the category.

This is to favor fine-grained classes ("pak- istani film actresses") over coarse-grained ones ("film actresses"). We perform heuristic mod- ifier chunking in order to group together mul- tiword modifiers (e.g., "puerto rican"); for de- tails, see supplementary material. From the resulting list of class labels, we draw two sam- ples of 100 labels each, enforcing that no H appear as the head of more than three class labels per sample. The first sample is cho- sen uniformly at random (denoted Uniform- Set). The second (WeightedSet) is weighted so that the probability of drawing M 1 . . . M k H is proportional to the total number of class la- bels in which H appears as the head. These different evaluation sets 8 are intended to eval- uate performance on the head versus the tail of class label distribution, since information retrieval methods often perform differently on different parts of the distribution. On average, there are 17 instances per category in Uniform- Set and 19 in WeightedSet. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> gives ex- amples of class labels.</p><p>Baselines. We implement two baselines us- ing our IsA repository (O as defined in Section 4.1). Our simplest baseline ignores modifiers altogether, and simply assumes that any in- stance of H is an instance of M H, regardless of M . In this case the confidence value for e, M H is equivalent to that for e, H. We refer to this baseline simply as Baseline. Our second, stronger baseline uses the IsA reposi- tory directly to identify instances of the fine- grained class C = M 1 . . . M k H. That is, we consider e to be an instance of the class if e, C ∈ O, meaning the entire class label ap- peared in a source sentence matching some Hearst pattern. We refer to this baseline as Hearst. The weight used to rank the candi- date instances is the confidence value assigned by the Hearst pattern extraction <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Section 4.2)</ref>.</p><p>Compositional Models. As a baseline compositional model, we augment the Hearst baseline via set intersection. Specifically, for a class C = M 1 . . . M k H, if each of the M i H appears in O independently, we take the in- stances of C to be the intersection of the in- stances of each of the M i H. We assign the weight of an instance e to be the sum of the weights associated with each independent modifier. We refer to this method as Hearst∩. It is roughly equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pa¸scaPa¸sca, 2014</ref>). We contrast it with our proposed model, which recognizes instances of a fine-grained class by 1) assigning a meaning to each modifier in the form of a property profile and 2) checking whether a candidate instance exhibits these properties. We refer to the versions of our method as Mods H and Mods I , as described in Section 5. When relevant, we use "raw" to refer to the version in which instances are ranked using raw weights and "RR" to refer to the version in which instances are ranked us- ing logistic regression (Section 5). We also try using the proposed methods to extend rather than replace the Hearst baseline. We com- bine predictions by merging the ranked lists produced by each system: i.e. the score of an instance is the inverse of the sum of its ranks in each of the input lists. If an in- stance does not appear at all in an input list, its rank in that list is set to a large constant value. We refer to these combination systems as Hearst+Mods H and Hearst+Mods I .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Results</head><p>Precision and Coverage. We first com- pare the methods in terms of their cover- age, the number of class labels for which the method is able to find some instance, and their precision, to what extent the method is able to correctly rank true instances of the class above non-instances. We report total coverage, the number of labels for which the method returns any instance, and correct coverage, the num- ber of labels for which the method returns a correct instance. For precision, we compute the average precision (AP) for each class la- bel. AP ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that all positive instances were ranked above all negative instances. We report mean av- erage precision (MAP), which is the mean of the APs across all the class labels. MAP is only computed over class labels for which the method returns something, meaning methods are not punished for returning empty lists. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> gives examples of instances returned for several class labels and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref> shows the precision and coverage for each of the meth- ods. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> illustrates how the single mean AP score (as reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref>) can misrep- resent the relative precision of different meth- ods. In combination, <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> demonstrate that the proposed methods ex- tract instances about as well as the baseline, whenever the baseline can extract anything at all; i.e. the proposed method does not cause a precision drop on classes covered by the base- line. In addition, there are many classes for which the baseline is not able to extract any instances, but the proposed method is. None of the methods can extract some of the gold instances, such as "Dictator perpetuo" and "Furor Teutonicus" of the gold class "latin po- litical phrases". <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref> also reveals that the reranking model (RR) consistently increases MAP for the proposed methods. Therefore, going for- ward, we only report results using the rerank- ing model (i.e. Mods H and Mods I will refer to Mods H RR and Mods I RR, respectively).</p><p>Manual Re-Annotation. It possible that true instances of a class are missing from our Wikipedia reference set, and thus that our precision scores underestimate the actual pre- cision of the systems. We therefore man- ually verify the top 10 predictions of each of the systems for a random sample of 25 class labels. We choose class labels for which Hearst was able to return at least one in- stance, in order to ensure reliable precision Flemish still life painters: Clara Peeters · Willem Kalf · Jan Davidsz de Heem · Pieter Claesz · Peter Paul Rubens · Frans Snyders · Jan Brueghel the Elder · Hans Memling · Pieter Bruegel the Elder · Caravaggio · Abraham Brueghel Pakistani cricket captains:  "Coverage" is the number of class labels (out of 100) for which at least one instance was returned, followed by the number for which at least one correct instance was returned. "MAP" is mean average precision. MAP does not punish methods for returning empty lists, thus favoring the baseline (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>). estimates. For each of these labels, we man- ually check the top 10 instances proposed by each method to determine whether each be- longs to the class. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> shows the precision scores for each method computed against the original Wikipedia list of instances and against our manually-augmented list of gold instances. The overall ordering of the systems does not change, but the precision scores increase no- tably after re-annotation. We continue to eval- uate against the Wikipedia lists, but acknowl- edge that reported precision is likely an under- estimate of true precision.   <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Recall of instances on Wikipedia cat- egory pages, measured against the full set of instances from all pages in sample. AUC cap- tures tradeoff between true and false positives.  Precision-Recall Analysis. We next look at the precision-recall tradeoff in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) when each method attempts to rank the complete list of candidate instances. We take the union of all of the instances proposed by all of the methods (including the Baseline method which, given a class label M 0 . . . M k H, proposes every in- stance of the head H as a candidate). Then, for each method, we rank this full set of candi- dates such that any instance returned by the method is given the score the method assigns, and every other instance is scored as 0. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> reports the AUC and recall. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> plots the full ROC curves. The requirement by Hearst that class labels appear in full in a single sen- tence results in very low recall, which trans- lates into very low AUC when considering the full set of candidate instances. In comparison, the proposed compositional methods make use of a larger set of sentences, and provide non- zero scores for many more candidates, result- ing in a &gt;10 point increase in AUC on both UniformSet and WeightedSet <ref type="table">(Table 7)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Salman Butt · Shahid Afridi · Javed Miandad · Azhar Ali · Greg Chappell · Younis Khan · Wasim Akram · Imran Khan · Mohammad Hafeez · Rameez Raja · Abdul Hafeez Kardar · Waqar Younis · Sarfraz Ahmed Thai buddhist temples: Wat Buddhapadipa · Wat Chayamangkalaram · Wat Mongkol- ratanaram · Angkor Wat · Preah Vihear Temple · Wat Phra Kaew · Wat Rong Khun · Wat Mahathat Yuwaratrangsarit · Vat Phou · Tiger Temple · Sanctuary of Truth · Wat Chalong · Swayambhunath · Mahabodhi Temple · Tiger Cave Temple · Harmandir Sahib</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented an approach to IsA extrac- tion that takes advantage of the composition- ality of natural language. Existing approaches often treat class labels as atomic units that must be observed in full in order to be pop- ulated with instances. As a result, current methods are not able to handle the infinite number of classes describable in natural lan- guage, most of which never appear in text. Our method reasons about each modifier in the label individually, in terms of the proper- ties that it implies about the instances. This approach allows us to harness information that is spread across multiple sentences, signifi- cantly increasing the number of fine-grained classes that we are able to populate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>seminal musicians such as Charles Mingus and George Russell. . . . . .

Doing so makes it possible, given H and an instance e ∈ H, to decide whether e has the properties required to be an instance of M H. In general, there is no systematic way to determine the implied relation between M and H, as modifiers can arguably express any semantic relation, given the right context (Weiskopf,</note>
