				<p>Many corpora span broad periods of time. Language processing models trained during one time period may not work well in future time periods, and the best model may depend on specific times of year (e.g., people might describe hotels differently in reviews during the winter versus the summer). This study investigates how document classifiers trained on documents from certain time intervals perform on documents from other time intervals, considering both seasonal intervals (inter-vals that repeat across years, e.g., winter) and non-seasonal intervals (e.g., specific years). We show experimentally that classification performance varies over time, and that performance can be improved by using a standard domain adaptation approach to adjust for changes in time.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language, and therefore data derived from lan- guage, changes over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ullmann, 1962)</ref>. Word senses can shift over long periods of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Wilkins, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hamilton et al., 2016)</ref>, and written language can change rapidly in online platforms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Eisenstein et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Goel et al., 2016)</ref>. However, little is known about how shifts in text over time affect the performance of language processing systems.</p><p>This paper focuses on a standard text process- ing task, document classification, to provide in- sight into how classification performance varies with time. We consider both long-term variations in text over time and seasonal variations which change throughout a year but repeat across years. Our empirical study considers corpora contain- ing formal text spanning decades as well as user- generated content spanning only a few years.</p><p>After describing the datasets and experiment design, this paper has two main sections, respec- tively addressing the following research questions:</p><p>1. In what ways does document classification depend on the timestamps of the documents?</p><p>2. Can document classifiers be adapted to per- form better in time-varying corpora?</p><p>To address question 1, we train and test on data from different time periods, to understand how performance varies with time. To address ques- tion 2, we apply a domain adaptation approach, treating time intervals as domains. We show that in most cases this approach can lead to improve- ments in classification performance, even on fu- ture time intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>Time is implicitly embedded in the classification process: classifiers are often built to be applied to future data that doesn't yet exist, and performance on held-out data is measured to estimate perfor- mance on future data whose distribution may have changed. Methods exist to adjust for changes in the data distribution (covariate shift) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Shimodaira, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bickel et al., 2009</ref>), but time is not typically incorporated into such methods explicitly.</p><p>One line of work that explicitly studies the rela- tionship between time and the distribution of data is work on classifying the time period in which a document was written (document dating) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kanhabua and Nørvåg, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chambers, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kotsakos et al., 2014</ref>). However, this task is directed differently from our work: predicting timestamps given documents, rather than predicting informa- tion about documents given timestamps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Datasets and Experimental Setup</head><p>Our study experiments with six corpora:</p><p>• Reviews: Three corpora containing reviews la- beled with sentiment: music reviews from Ama- zon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">He and McAuley, 2016)</ref>, and hotel reviews and restaurant reviews from Yelp. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We dis- carded reviews that had fewer than 10 tokens or a helpfulness/usefulness score of zero. The reviews with neutral scores were removed.</p><p>• Politics: Sentences from the American party platforms of Republicans and Democrats from 1948 to 2016, available every four years. 2</p><p>• News: Newspaper articles from 1950-2014, la- beled with whether the article is relevant to the US economy. 3</p><p>• Twitter: Tweets labeled with whether they in- dicate that the user received an influenza vacci- nation (i.e., a flu shot) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Huang et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Our experiments require documents to be grouped into time intervals. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the in- tervals for each corpus. Documents that fall out- side of these time intervals were removed. We grouped documents into two types of intervals:</p><p>• Seasonal: Time intervals within a year (e.g., January through March) that may be repeated across years.</p><p>• Non-seasonal: Time intervals that do not repeat (e.g., 1997-1999).</p><p>For each dataset, we performed binary clas- sification, implemented in sklearn ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>). We built logistic regression classi- fiers with TF-IDF weighted n-gram features (n ∈ {1, 2, 3}), removing features that appeared in less than 2 documents. Except when otherwise speci- fied, we held out a random 10% of documents as validation data for each dataset. We used Elas- tic Net (combined 1 and 2 ) regularization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zou and Hastie, 2005)</ref>, and tuned the regularization parameters to maximize performance on the val- idation data. We evaluated the performance using weighted F1 scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">How Does Classification Performance</head><p>Vary with Time?</p><p>We first conduct an analysis of how classifier per- formance depends on the time intervals in which it is trained and applied. For each corpus, we train the classifier on each time interval and test on each time interval. We downsampled the training data within each time interval to match the number of documents in the smallest interval, so that differ- ences in performance are not due to the size of the training data.</p><p>In all experiments, we train a classifier on a par- tition of 80% of the documents in the time inter- val, and repeat this five times on different parti- tions, averaging the five F1 scores to produce the final estimate. When training and testing on the same interval, we test on the held-out 20% of doc- uments in that interval (standard cross-validation). When testing on different time intervals, we test on all documents, since they are all held-out from the training interval; however, we still train on five subsets of 80% of documents, so that the training data is identical across all experiments.</p><p>Finally, to understand why performance varies, we also qualitatively examined how the dis- tribution of content changes across time inter- vals. To measure the distribution of content, we trained a topic model with 20 topics using gensim <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Rehůřek and Sojka, 2010</ref>) with default parameters. We associated each document with one topic (the most probable topic in the docu- ment), and then calculated the proportion of each topic within a time period as the proportion of doc- uments in that time period assigned to that topic. We can then visualize the extent to which the dis- tribution of 20 topics varies by time.  Twitter data -vaccine News data -economy <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Document classification performance when training and testing on different times of year (top) and different years (bottom). Some corpora are omitted for space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Seasonal Variability</head><p>The top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the test scores from training and testing on each pair of seasonal time intervals for four of the datasets. We observe very strong seasonal variations in the economic news corpus, with a drop in F1 score on the order of 10 when there is a mismatch in the season between training and testing. There is a similar, but weaker, effect on performance in the music reviews from Amazon and the vaccine tweets. There was vir- tually no difference in performance in any of the pairs in both review corpora from Yelp (restau- rants, not pictured, and hotels).</p><p>To help understand why the performance varies, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> (left) shows the distribution of topics in each seasonal interval for two corpora: Amazon music reviews and Twitter. We observe very lit- tle variation in the topic distribution across sea- sons in the Amazon corpus, but some variation in the Twitter corpus, which may explain the large performance differences when testing on held-out seasons in the Twitter data as compared to the Amazon corpus.</p><p>For space, we do not show the descriptions of the topics, but instead only the shape of the dis- tributions to show the degree of variability. We did qualitatively examine the differences in word features across the time periods, but had diffi- culty interpreting the observations and were un- able to draw clear conclusions. Thus, characteriz- ing the ways in which content distributions vary over time, and why this affects performance, is still an open question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Non-seasonal Variability</head><p>The bottom row of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the test scores from training and testing on each pair of non- seasonal time intervals. A strong pattern emerges in the political parties corpus: F1 scores can drop by as much as 40 points when testing on differ- ent time intervals. This is perhaps unsurprising, as this collection spans decades, and US party posi- tions have substantially changed over time. The performance declines more when testing on time intervals that are further away in time from the training interval, suggesting that changes in party platforms shift gradually over time. In contrast, while there was a performance drop when testing outside the training interval in the economic news corpus, the drop was not gradual. In the Twitter dataset (not pictured), F1 dropped by an average of 4.9 points outside the training interval.</p><p>We observe an intriguing non-seasonal pattern that is consistent in both of the review corpora from Yelp, but not in the music review corpus from Amazon (not pictured), which is that the classi- fication performance fairly consistently increases over time. Since we sampled the dataset so that the time intervals have the same number of re- views, this suggests something else changed over time about the way reviews are written that makes the sentiment easier to detect.</p><p>The right side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows the topic distri- bution in the Amazon and Twitter datasets across non-seasonal intervals. We observe higher levels of variability across time in the non-seasonal in- tervals as compared to the seasonal intervals.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion</head><p>Overall, it is clear that classifiers generally per- form best when applied to the same time interval they were trained. Performance diminishes when applied to different time intervals, although differ- ent corpora exhibit differ patterns in the way in which the performance diminishes. This kind of analysis can be applied to any corpus and could provide insights into characteristics of the corpus that may be helpful when designing a classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Making Classification Robust to Temporality</head><p>We now consider how to improve classifiers when working with datasets that span different time in- tervals. We propose to treat this as a domain adap- tation problem. In domain adaptation, any par- tition of data that is expected to have a differ- ent distribution of features can be treated as a do- main ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Joshi et al., 2013)</ref>. Traditionally, domain adaptation is used to adapt models to a common task across rather different sets of data, e.g., a sentiment classifier for different types of products ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blitzer et al., 2007)</ref>. Recent work has also applied domain adaptation to adjust for potentially more subtle differences in data, such as adapting for dif- ferences in the demographics of authors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Volkova et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lynn et al., 2017</ref>). We follow the same approach, treating time intervals as domains.</p><p>In our experiments, we use the feature augmen- tation approach of Daumé III <ref type="formula">(2007)</ref> to perform domain adaptation. Each feature is duplicated to have a specific version of the feature for ev- ery domain, as well as a domain-independent ver- sion of the feature. In each instance, the domain- independent feature and the domain-specific fea- ture for that instance's domain have the same fea- ture value, while the value is zeroed out for the domain-specific features for the other domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data (Seasonal) Baseline Adaptation</head><note type="other">Reviews (music) .901 .919 Reviews (hotels) .867 .881 Reviews (restaurants) .874 .898 News (economy) .782 .782 Twitter (vaccines)</note><p>.881 .880 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: F1 scores when treating each seasonal time interval as a domain and applying domain adaptation compared to using no adaptation.</p><p>This is equivalent to a model where the feature weights are domain specific but share a Gaus- sian prior across domains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Finkel and Manning, 2009)</ref>. This approach is widely used due to its simplicity, and derivatives of this approach have been used in similar work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lynn et al., 2017)</ref>). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Finkel and Manning (2009)</ref>, we separately adjust the regularization strength for the domain-independent feature weights and the domain-specific feature weights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Seasonal Adaptation</head><p>We first examine classification performance on the datasets when grouping the seasonal time in- tervals (January-March, April-June, July-August, September-December) as domains and applying the feature augmentation approach for domain adaptation. As a baseline comparison, we apply the same classifier, but without domain adaptation.</p><p>Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. We see that ap- plying domain adaptation provides a small boost in three of the datasets, and has no effect on two of the datasets. If this pattern holds in other corpora, then this suggests that it does not hurt performance to apply domain adaptation across different times of year, and in some cases can lead to a small per- formance boost.</p><p>Data (Non-seasonal) Baseline Adaptation Adapt.+seasons <ref type="bibr">Reviews (music)</ref> . <ref type="bibr">895 .924 .910 Reviews (hotels)</ref> .886 .892 .920 Reviews (restaurants) . <ref type="bibr">831</ref> . <ref type="bibr">879 .889 News (economy)</ref> . <ref type="bibr">763 .780 .859 Politics (platforms)</ref> .661 .665 n/a Twitter <ref type="bibr">(vaccines)</ref> .910 .903 .920 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: F1 scores when testing on the final time interval after training on all previous intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Non-seasonal Adaptation</head><p>We now consider the non-seasonal time intervals (spans of years). In particular, we consider the sce- nario when one wants to apply a classifier trained on older data to future data. This requires a mod- ification to the domain adaptation approach, be- cause future data includes domains that did not ex- ist in the training data, and thus we cannot learn domain-specific feature weights. To solve this, we train in the usual way, but when testing on future data, we only include the domain-independent fea- tures. The intuition is that the domain-independent parameters should be applicable to all domains, and so using only these features should lead to bet- ter generalizability to new domains. We test this hypothesis by training the classifiers on all but the last time interval, and testing on the final interval. For hyperparameter tuning, we used the final time interval of the training data (i.e., the penultimate interval) as the validation set. The intuition is that the penultimate interval is the closest to the test data and thus is expected to be most similar to it. Results are shown in the first three columns of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We see that this approach leads to a small performance boost in all cases except the Twitter dataset. This means that this simple feature aug- mentation approach has the potential to make clas- sifiers more robust to future changes in data.</p><p>How to apply the feature augmentation tech- nique to unseen domains is not well understood. By removing the domain-specific features, as we did here, the prediction model has changed, and so its behavior may be hard to predict. Nonethe- less, this appears to be a successful approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Adding Seasonal Features</head><p>We also experimented with including the seasonal features when performing non-seasonal adapta- tion. In this setting, we train the models with two domain-specific features in addition to the domain-independent features: one for the season, and one for the non-seasonal interval. As above, we remove the non-seasonal features at test time; however, we retain the season-specific features in addition to the domain-independent features, as they can be reused in future years.</p><p>The results of this approach are shown in the last column of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. We find that combining seasonal and non-seasonal features together leads to an additional performance gain in most cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Our experiments suggest that time can substan- tially affect the performance of document classi- fication, and practitioners should be cognizant of this variable when developing classifiers. A sim- ple analysis comparing pairs of time intervals can provide insights into how performance varies with time, which could be a good practice to do when initially working with a corpus. Our experiments also suggest that simple domain adaptation tech- niques can help account for this variation. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We make two practical recommendations fol- lowing the insights from this work. First, evalua- tion will be most accurate if the test data is as sim- ilar as possible to whatever future data the classi- fier will be applied to, and one way to achieve this is to select test data from the chronological end of the corpus, rather than randomly sampling data without regard to time. Second, we observed that performance on future data tends to increase when hyperparameter tuning is conducted on later data; thus, we also recommend sampling validation data from the chronological end of the corpus.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Topic distributions in each time of year (left) and each span of years (right).
