				<p>We propose that entity queries are generated via a two-step process: users first select entity facts that can distinguish target entities from the others; and then choose words to describe each selected fact. Based on this query generation paradigm, we propose a new entity representation model named as entity fac-toid hierarchy. An entity factoid hierarchy is a tree structure composed of fac-toid nodes. A factoid node describes one or more facts about the entity in different information granularities. The entity fac-toid hierarchy is constructed via a factor graph model, and the inference on the factor graph is achieved by a modified variant of Multiple-try Metropolis algorithm. Entity retrieval is performed by decomposing entity queries and computing the query likelihood on the entity factoid hierarchy. Using an array of benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves the retrieval performance over existing models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Entity retrieval, which aims at returning specific entities to directly answer a user's query, has drawn much attention these years. Various entity retrieval tasks have been proposed, such as TREC Entity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wang et al., 2011</ref>) and INEX-LD ( ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wang and Kang, 2012</ref>). Many existing entity retrieval models fol- low the document retrieval assumption: when is- suing queries, users choose the words that may * The work described in this paper is substantially sup- ported by grants from the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project Codes: 413510 and 14203414) and the Direct Grant of the Faculty of Engineering, CUHK <ref type="bibr">(Project Code: 4055034).</ref> appear in the "entity pseudo-document". Based on the assumption, these models construct in- ternal entity representations by combining vari- ous entity descriptions, and use these representa- tions to compute the rank of the candidate enti- ties for a given entity query. These models in- clude fielded versions of BM25 and Mixture of Language Models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Neumayer et al., 2012</ref>), Entity Language Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Raghavan et al., 2004</ref>), Hierar- chical Expert Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Petkova and Croft, 2006</ref>), Structured Positional Entity Language Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lu et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>However, a closer examination of entity queries reveals that most of them are not simple uniform word samples from the "entity pseudo-document". Instead, they can be decomposed into multiple parts, where each part describes a fact about target entities. For example, the query "National capitals situated on islands" describes two facts regarding a target entity: it is a national capital; it is lo- cated on an island. Compared to the assumption in document retrieval models, where query terms are assumed to be generated from a single docu- ment, these query terms can be regarded to be in- dependently generated from two underlying docu- ments. According to this observation, we propose that an entity query is generated via a two-step process: users first select facts that can distinguish target entities from the others; and then choose words that describe the selected facts. Based on the proposed query generation paradigm, we de- sign a new entity retrieval framework. On one hand, an entity is modeled to have multiple in- ternal representations, each regarding one or more closely related facts. On the other hand, an entity query is decomposed into one or more subqueries, each describing a fact about target entities. In this way, entity retrieval can be performed by combin- ing the probabilities of subqueries being satisfied for each candidate entity.</p><p>One of the central components of our proposed  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: An example of entity factoid hierarchy containing two factoids about Barack Obama retrieval framework is a novel entity representa- tion known as entity factoid hierarchy. An entity factoid hierarchy is a tree structure composed of factoid nodes, which is automatically constructed from a collection of entity descriptions. We abuse the term "factoid" to denote a single piece of infor- mation regarding an entity. A factoid node in the hierarchy describes one or more factoids. Factoid nodes in different levels capture the information of different levels of detail (referred to as information granularities hereafter), where lower level nodes contain more detailed information and higher level nodes abstract the details away. The entity factoid hierarchy is constructed via a factor graph model, and the inference on the factor graph is achieved by a modified variant of Multiple-try Metropolis algorithm. Each factoid node is indexed sepa- rately as a pseudo-document. During retrieval, the query likelihood for a candidate entity are com- puted by transversing the factoid hierarchy. Com- pared to exiting entity retrieval models, our pro- posed framework exhibits two advantages:</p><p>• By organizing entity descriptions in a hier- archical structure, detailed entity information is preserved and we can return finer confi- dence value. Suppose that the entity "Barack Obama" is only described by one sentence: "born in 1961". Traditional entity models, which model an entity as a pseudo-document, would return high confidence value for the query "who is born in 1961". However, as we add more and more sentences to describe "Barack Obama", the confidence value re- turned for the query decreases due to the longer entity pseudo-document. This result is not desirable for entity retrieval, since adding more descriptions about other facts should not affect the confidence of existing facts. Our factoid hierarchy avoids this problem by preserving all the entity descriptions in a hi- erarchical structure. When performing re- trieval, entity factoid hierarchy can be tra- versed to locate the best supporting descrip- tion for the query.</p><p>• By separating entity facts in different factoid nodes, our model prevent ambiguity caused by mixing terms describing different facts. Suppose "Barack Obama" is described by two sentences: "Barack Obama is a presi- dent of United States" and "Barack Obama is a graduate of Harvard Law School", and our query is "Who is a president of Har- vard Law School". A traditional docu- ment retrieval model with a bag-of-word en- tity pseudo-document would return "Barack Obama" with high confidence, since all the query terms appear in the entity descriptions. But obviously, this result is not correct. In our factoid hierarchy, these two facts are sep- arated in lower level factoid nodes. While higher level nodes are still mixed with terms from child nodes, they are penalized to avoid giving high confidence value.</p><p>2 Factoid Hierarchy</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Hierarchy Representation</head><p>As mentioned in the previous section, all the infor- mation regarding an entity is organized in a partic- ular factoid hierarchy. We denote the term "fac- toid" as a single piece of information regarding an entity, such as the birth date of Barack Obama. A factoid node in the hierarchy describes one or more factoids. Each factoid node is associated with a bag-of-words vector to represent the fac- toid description. Factoid nodes in different depth encode information in different granularities. An example of an entity factoid hierarchy, re- garding two factoids (birth date and birth place) about Barack Obama, is given in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The example hierarchy is constructed from three sen- tences about Barack Obama: he was born in 1961; he was born in August 1961; he was born in Hon- olulu Hawaii. These three sentences correspond to the leaf nodes A, B, and C respectively in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref>. In general, a leaf node in the factoid hi- erarchy comes directly from a sentence or a RDF triple describing the entity. Since it is extracted either from human written texts or from manu- ally crafted structured databases, a leaf node repre- sents the most exact representation regarding one or more factoids. During the construction of the hierarchy, intermediate nodes are formed as par- ents for nodes that contain closely related factoids. The factoid description for an intermediate node is the sum of bag-of-words vectors of its child nodes. In this way, intermediate nodes capture the words that are used more frequently with higher weights to describe the underlying factoids in a more gen- eral form. As we merge more nodes and move up in the hierarchy, intermediate nodes become blended with more different factoids. Node D in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> is an intermediate factoid node, as a par- ent node for nodes A and B both describing the birth date. The root node in an entity factoid hi- erarchy summarizes all the descriptions regarding an entity, which is similar to the "entity pseudo- document" used in some existing entity retrieval models. Each entity factoid hierarchy has only one root node. For example, node E in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> is the root node, and it contains words from all the three sentences.</p><p>Note that the depth of a leaf node varies with the number of descriptions associated with the fac- toids. Some factoids may be associated with lots of detailed information and are expressed in many sentences, while others are only expressed in one or two sentences. For example, the factoid that Obama is elected president in 2008 may be de- scribed in many sentences and in different con- texts; while the factoid that Obama is born in Kapiolani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital is only mentioned in a few sentences. In this case, factoid nodes associated with more details may have deeper hierarchical structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Factor Graph Model</head><p>To construct the entity factoid hierarchy, we make use of a hierarchical discriminative factor graph model. A similar factor graph model has been pro- posed to solve the coreference resolution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Singh et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wick et al., 2012</ref>). Here we design a factor graph model corresponding to the entity fac- toid hierarchy, together with new factor types and inference mechanism.</p><p>Generally speaking, a factor graph is composed of two parts: a set of random variables and a set of factors that model the dependencies between ran- dom variables. An example of the factor graph construction corresponding to the factoid hierar- chy involved in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> is given in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In our factor graph approach, each factoid is repre- sented as a random variable f i , corresponding to a rounded square node in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The pairwise bi- nary decision variable y ij , denotes whether a fac- toid f i is a child of another factoid f j correspond- ing to a circle node in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The set of fac- toids F plus the set of decision variables y are the random variables in our factor graph model. To model the dependency between factoids, we con- sider two types of factors. Ψ p is the set of factors that consider the compatibility between two fac- toid nodes, i.e., to indicate whether two nodes have parent-child relationship. Ψ u is the set of factors that measure the compatibility of the factoid node itself. Such factor is used to check whether a new intermediate node should be created. Factors are represented as square nodes in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Given a factor graph model m, our target is to find the best assignments for the decision variable y that maxi- mizes the objective function in Equation (1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (y, F |m) = f ∈F Ψ p (f, f p )Ψ u (f ) (1)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Factors Design</head><p>The pairwise factors Ψ p and unit-wise factors Ψ u compute the compatibility scores among factoid nodes. Each factor type is associated with a weight w to indicate the importance of the factor during inference. For the notation, the bag-of-words rep- resentation for a factoid node is denoted as d. We use superscripts p and c to denote the variables of parent nodes and child nodes. To capture the in- terrelations between factoid nodes, the following factors are used in our factor graph model.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Generation of an factoid hierarchy via factor graph inference. Factoid nodes are initialized as singletons in (a). During one step of sampling in (b), two factoid nodes are selected and one proposal is to add a common parent. If we accept the proposal, we end up with the factoid hierarchy in (c).</p><p>tion lost when Q is used to approximate P. It is a non-symmetric measure and fits in our problem nicely, i.e., measuring whether a parent node is a more abstract representation of its child node. The compatibility score is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">− w 1 · D KL (d p ||d q ) = − w 1 · m i=1 d p i × log d p i d c i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where d p i is the smoothed term frequency of the factoid description for the parent node; d c i is for the child node; w 1 is a global weighting parame- ter among different factors. In fact, we have also explored other popular text similarity metrics sum- marized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Huang, 2008)</ref>, and find that KL diver- gence performs the best.</p><p>Entropy penalty We penalize the entropy of the factoid description to encourage a smaller vocab- ulary of words describing the underlying factoids:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">−w 2 · H(d) log ||d|| 0 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where H(d) denotes the Shannon entropy for the bag-of-words representation of the factoid de- scription d; ||d|| 0 is the number of unique terms in the factoid description.</p><p>Structure penalty The depth of a factoid node indicates the level of information granularity. However, we also need to control the depth of the factoid hierarchy. A factoid node should not have too many levels. We define the depth penalty as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">−w 3 · |n d − ||d|| 0 s |,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where n d is the depth of a factoid node and s is the parameter that controls the average depth of factoid nodes per term. In this way, we can con- trol the average depth of factoid nodes in the entity factoid hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Inference</head><p>Exact inference is impossible for our factor graph model due to the large state space. Here we adopt a modified variant of Multiple-try Metropolis algo- rithm to conduct maximum probability estimation for inference, following the work in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wick et al., 2013)</ref>. At each sampling step, multiple changes to the current setting are proposed. The accep- tance probability for a given proposal is equal to the likelihood ratio of the proposed hypothesis to the current hypothesis. In our case, we initialize the MCMC procedure to the singleton configura- tion, where each entity description, such as a sen- tence or a RDF triple, forms its own factoid hierar- chy initially. At each sampling step, we randomly select two nodes and propose several alternative local modifications. If f i and f j are not connected, i.e., sharing no common child nodes, the following changes are proposed:</p><p>• Add factoid f i as the parent of f j , if f j has no parent node;</p><p>• Remove f j from its current parent, if f j has a parent;</p><p>• Create a new common parent for f i and f j , if both f i and f j have no parent.</p><p>Otherwise, if f i and f j are in the same cluster, the following changes are proposed:</p><p>• Remove f j from its current parent;</p><p>• Move f j 's children to f j 's parent and delete f j , if f j is an intermediate node.</p><p>A sampling step of the inference process is il- lustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Initially, all the decision vari- ables y are set to zero. That is, each factoid node is regarded as forming its own factoid hierarchy, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2(a)</ref>. During the inference, local modifications are proposed to the current fac- tor graph hypothesis. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 2(b)</ref>, the two factoid nodes at the bottom are selected and proposed to add a new intermediate factoid as their common parent. If we accept the proposal, we get an intermediate factoid hierarchy as illus- trated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2(c)</ref>.</p><p>The sampling process is iterated until no pro- posal has been accepted in a certain number of successive steps, or a maximum number of steps has been reached. Each entity factoid hierarchy is inferred separately, allowing us to parallelize the inference across multiple machines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Entity Retrieval</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Retrieval Model</head><p>After we preprocess available information sources and construct the entity factoid hierarchy, we are ready to answer entity queries. Our retrieval model is based on the query likelihood model. Us- ing Bayes' rule, the probability that an entity e is a target entity for a query q can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p(e|q) = p(q|e)p(e) p(q) .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The probability of the query p(q) is the same for all entities and can be ignored. Furthermore, we assume that the prior probability of an entity being a target entity is uniform. Thus, p(e) can also be ignored. The task is to rank an entity e in response to a query q by estimating the query generation probability p(q|e).</p><p>To compute p(q|e), recall that our two-step query generation process assumes that users gen- erate queries by first selecting facts and then choosing query words for each fact. Based on the query generation process, we first decompose the query q into m subqueries q i (discussed in Sec- tion 3.2). Then the probability p(q|e) can be com- puted as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p(q|e) = m i=1 p(q i |e)<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">= m i=1 n k=1 p(q i |f k )p(f k |e) (7) m i=1 max k p(q i |f k ).<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref> decomposes the query into sub- queries, assuming that all the subqueries are inde- pendent. Equation <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> iterates through all the fac- toid nodes f k in the factoid hierarchy of an entity e. Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(8)</ref> simplifies the computation by as- suming that the underlying factoid generating sub- query q i is the factoid f k with the highest query generation probability. To compute p(q i |f k ), the probability of the fac- toid f k generating the subquery q i , we use the multinomial unigram language model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p(q i |f k ) = e(f k ) j p(t j i |f k ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where t j i is the term j in the subquery q i . e(f k ) is the penalty term for factoids containing many children:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">e(f k ) = w · 1 c(f k ) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where c(f k ) is the number of child nodes for f k . To understand why we add this penalty term, consider a query "who is born in 2008". Sup- pose "Barack Obama" is described by two sen- tences: "born in 1961" and "elected president in 2008". When computing p(q i |f k ) for the root node, although it contains both the terms "born" and "2008", it should be penalized since the terms come from two different child nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Query analysis</head><p>As mentioned earlier, we decompose the original query q into multiple factoid subqueries q i . For long queries issued in a verbose sentence, such as "which presidents were born in 1945", depen- dency parsing is performed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Klein and Manning, 2003)</ref> and the resulting dependency tree is used to split the original query. For short queries issued in keywords, such as "vietnam war movies", we decompose it based on possible key concepts ex- pressed in the query. Usually a short query only contains a single entity, which is used to segment the original query into subqueries. Furthermore, stop structures in verbose queries is removed, following the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Huston and Croft, 2010)</ref>. Here a stop structure is defined as a phrase which provides no informa- tion regarding the information needs, such as "tell me the". We also inject target entity type informa- tion by replacing the leading "who " as "person", and "where" as "place" for all the queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Retrieval Process</head><p>For the purpose of retrieval, each node in the entity factoid hierarchy is regarded as a pseudo- document describing one or more factoids about the entity, and is indexed as a bag-of-words doc- ument during the preprocessing. The retrieval is performed in a two-step process. First, for each in- dividual subquery, we retrieve top 1000 candidate entities by performing retrieval on all root nodes. This gives us an initial pool of candidate entities by merging the returned entities for subqueries. After that, for each candidate entity, we traverse its factoid hierarchy and compute the query gen- eration probability p(q|e) using Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(8)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. Top ranked entities are returned as retrieval results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset</head><p>We perform entity retrieval experiments using the DBpedia-Entity dataset used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Balog and Neumayer, 2013</ref>). The dataset is a mixture of multiple entity retrieval datasets, covering entity queries of various styles such as keyword queries like "viet- nam war movies" and verbose queries like "What is the capital of Canada". Some query statistics are shown in  The data corpus we use are DBpedia 3.9 and the corresponding English Wikipedia data dump on April 4, 2013. It should be noted that the origi- nal DBpedia-Entity benchmark only uses DBpedia for entity modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Balog and Neumayer, 2013)</ref>. In our experiments, we also conducted another set of experiments which include full-text Wikipedia articles as additional entity descriptions, to eval- uate the capacity of different models on handling free texts as information sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparison models and variants of our model</head><p>For comparison, we have implemented the follow- ing two existing models:</p><p>• BM25. BM25 is a popular document re- trieval method and also used to perform en- tity retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Balog and Neumayer, 2013</ref>).</p><p>All the descriptions about an entity are ag- gregated into an entity pseudo-document. We use k 1 = 1.2, b = 0.8 for the model parame- ter, similar to the original papers.</p><p>• MLM-tc. The Mixture of Language Model represents an entity as a document with multiple fields, where each field is given a different weight for generating the query terms. MLM is often adopted to do entity retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Neumayer et al., 2012</ref>). Here we adopt the MLM-tc model used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Balog and Neumayer, 2013)</ref>, where two fields are con- sidered: title and content fields (described in Section 4.3). The parameters used are 0.8 for the title field and 0.2 for the content field.</p><p>Note that both MLM-tc and BM25 are also compared in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Balog and Neumayer, 2013)</ref>, and have shown the best MAP performances among all the compared models.</p><p>For our models, the following two variants are implemented and compared.</p><p>• Factoid Retrieval Model with Hierarchy (FRMwH). Our full model uses entity fac- toid graph as entity representation. Each fac- toid node is indexed as a bag-of-words docu- ment. The retrieval model described in Sec- tion 3 is employed.</p><p>• Factoid Retrieval Model (FRM). This model does not use entity factoid hierarchy as entity representation. Instead, K-Means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the sen- tences into text clusters. Each text cluster is then indexed as a document. Compared to the FRMwH model, an entity only has a flat clus- ter of factoid descriptions. The same retrieval model is used.</p><p>All the four models use the same query prepro- cessing techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Setup</head><p>The entity descriptions come from texts in Wikipedia articles and structured information from DBpedia. For DBpedia information, we con- sider top 1000 most frequent predicates as fields.

For Wikipedia texts, we first remove all markup text such as images, categories.

Each Wikipedia article is then segmented to a list of sentences, which are consid- ered as factoid descriptions regarding the entity.

For the MLMtc model, the title field is constructed by combining DBpedia properties whose property names are ending with "title", "name" or "label", such as "fullName" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Neumayer et al., 2012)</ref>, and the content field is the same as the entity pseudo-document used in the BM25 model.</p><p>The inference algorithm for the entity factoid hierarchy is implemented based on the factorie package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">McCallum et al., 2009</ref>). The parame- ters used in the inference are manually tuned on a small set of entities. The retrieval algorithms, including BM25 and Language Modeling, are im- plemented based on Apache Lucene 1 . For lan- guage models, Bayesian smoothing with Dirich- let priors is used, with parameter µ = 2000. For FRM, to cluster the entity descriptions, we use the K-Means clustering algorithm implemented in Carrot2 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Results</head><p>We report two standard retrieval measures: mean average precision (MAP) and precision at 10 (P@10). Top 100 ranked entities are evaluated for each query. Two set of experiments are conducted: experiments with only DBpedia information; ex- periments with both DBpedia and Wikipedia in- formation. The experiment result is shown in Ta- ble 1. To conduct the statistical significance anal- ysis, we use two-tailed paired t-test at the 0.05 level. The symbols underline and ::::: wave ::::::::: underline are used to indicate significant improvement of our model compared with the BM25 and MLM- tc models respectively.</p><p>The first set of rows in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> show the per- formance of four models using only DBpedia in- formation. Both of our models have better overall performance. On datasets with verbose queries, such as INEX-XER and TREC Entity, both our models outperform the baseline models. One rea- son is that our retrieval model relies on the as- sumption that verbose queries can be decomposed into multiple subqueries. The second set of rows show the performance of four models using both DBpedia and Wikipedia information. After adding the additional information from Wikipedia arti- cles, MLM-tc attains much worse performance, while BM25 performs roughly the same. One possible reason is that Wikipedia articles con- tain much irrelevant information regarding enti- ties, and these two existing models cannot eas- ily make use of additional information. In con- trast, with Wikipedia full-text available, both of our proposed models achieve obviously better per- formances.</p><p>Our full model, FRMwH, has shown consis- tently better overall performance compared with the FRM model. It demonstrates that it is worth- while to employ our proposed entity hierarchical structure for entity representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Analysis</head><p>For the retrieval performance, we also perform a topic-level analysis between our model FRMwH and the baseline model BM25, shown in queries are affected by using FRMwH model. On the datasets with verbose queries, such as INEX- XER and TREC Entity, we can see most of the query are improved. FRMwH performs slightly worse for datasets like SemSearch ES which is mostly composed of keyword queries. For the queries that show little or no performance differ- ences, manual inspection shows that both models fail to find any relevant results, due to the lack of supporting descriptions in Wikipedia and DBpe- dia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Besides the entity retrieval models reviewed in Section 1, there are models that do not maintain an explicit entity representation. Instead, they compute the entity relevance score based on the co-occurance between entities and query terms in the documents directly. Most of these mod- els are originally proposed for expertise retrieval, where the appearance of a person name indicates the association with the expertise mentioned in the same document. Typical models include vot- ing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Macdonald and Ounis, 2006</ref>), graph model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Serdyukov et al., 2008)</ref>, etc. However, it is not easy to generalize these models for open do- main entity retrieval.</p><p>Entity models are also used in other fields be- sides entity retrieval. For example, entity topic models are used to perform entity prediction, clas- sification of entity pairs, construction of entity- entity network <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Newman et al., 2006</ref>), as well as entity linking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Han and Sun, 2012</ref>). These models are not suitable for our retrieval framework.</p><p>The decomposing of entity queries into fac- toid queries is related to query segmentation. Query segmentation has been used by search en- gines to support inverse lookup of words and phrases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Risvik et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bergsma and Wang, 2007)</ref>. Our use of query decomposition is quite different compared to query segmentation. Be- sides query segmentation, query decomposition has also been used to facilitate the acquisition and optimization of high-order contextual term associ- ations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Song et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Our work is also related to the information ex- traction and knowledge representation field since our framework involves extraction and aggrega- tion of knowledge from free texts. However, most existing approaches takes two extreme ways: ei- ther extract relations based on pre-defined ontol- ogy, such as DBpedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lehmann et al., 2014</ref>); or cluster relation without referring to some ontol- ogy, such as OpenIE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Etzioni et al., 2011</ref>). Though our main goal is not on constructing a complete knowledge base, we do leverage both existing knowledge bases as well as free text data.</p><p>Semantic search also targets on returning an- swers directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pound et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blanco et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Tonon et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kahng and Lee, 2012)</ref>. However, they are mainly based on structured linked data, as well as structured query language like SPARQL. While this is an effective approach if we have a powerful thorough knowledge base, in practice many facts cannot be effectively repre- sented as linked data. Only a small set of relations (thousands in DBpedia) have been defined in the ontology, such as "birthPlace". Furthermore, even if we can define a formal representation of human knowledge, retrieve them effectively is still a prob- lem due to the difficulty of transforming the hu- man query into a structured query on a knowledge base.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We propose that an entity query is generated in a two-step process: users first select the facts that can distinguish target entities from the others; then choose words to express those facts. Following this motivation, we propose a retrieval framework by decomposing the original query into factoid queries. We also propose to construct an entity factoid hierarchy as the entity model for the pur- pose of entity retrieval. Our entity factoid hier- archy can integrate information of different gran- ularities from both free text and structured data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effective- ness of our framework.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig- ure 3 .Figure 3 :</head><label>33</label><figDesc>Figure 3: Topic-level differences between FRMwH and BM25.
