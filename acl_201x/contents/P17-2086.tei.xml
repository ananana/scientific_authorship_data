				<p>In this paper, we explore spelling errors as a source of information for detecting the native language of a writer, a previously under-explored area. We note that character n-grams from misspelled words are very indicative of the native language of the author. In combination with other lexical features, spelling error features lead to 1.2% improvement in accuracy on classifying texts in the TOEFL11 corpus by the author&apos;s native language, compared to systems participating in the NLI shared task 1 .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Native Language Identification (NLI) aims to de- termine the native language (L1) of a writer based on his or her writings in a second language (L2). Though initially motivated by the study of cross- linguistics influence, the value of NLI is not lim- ited to education. Potentially, it is also very valu- able in academic, marketing, security and law en- forcement fields. Identifying the native language is based on the assumption that the L1 of an indi- vidual impacts his or her writing in L2 due to the language transfer effect.</p><p>We focus here on the influences from L1 that surface as spelling errors in L2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Crossley and McNamara (2011)</ref> showed that syntactic patterns and lexical preferences from L1 appear in L2 system- atically, and are very informative for identifying the writer's native language. Texts written by au- thors with the same L1 also exhibit similarities with respect to the errors within.</p><p>In terms of spelling, in particular, both the sound of the words in different languages and the mapping from sounds to letters in L2 vs. L1, as well as the particular conventions of writing can <ref type="bibr">1</ref> https://sites.google.com/site/nlisharedtask2013/home have a visible impact. In Italian, for example, each vowel has only one pronunciation, so it is very common for Italian writers to confuse the use of vowels in English: the English e can correspond to the sounds written either as i or e in Italian. In Arabic, on the other hand, vowels are rarely writ- ten, and this could cause writers to miss vowels when writing in English. In Chinese, since it uses a completely different writing system compared to English, there might be a higher probability for authors to make spelling errors when it comes to complicated words, because the mapping from En- glish sounds to letters of the Roman alphabet is not one-to-one. We test whether we are able to cap- ture some of these phenomena by going below the word level to character level and testing their use- fulness as features for identifying the native lan- guage of the author.</p><p>Spelling errors have been used as features for NLI since <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Koppel et al. (2005)</ref>. They considered syntax errors and eight types of spelling errors such as repeated letters, missing letters, and inver- sion of letters. The relative frequency of each error type with regard to the length of the document is used as feature values. By combining these with common features such as function words, they ob- tained a classification accuracy of 80.2% on a sub- corpora of ICLEv1 that consists of five languages. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nicolai et al. (2013)</ref> focused on the misspelled part of a word rather than the type of spelling errors. They used pairs of correct and misspelled parts in a word as features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lavergne et al. (2013)</ref> adopted a similar approach to rep- resent the spelling errors by the inner-most mis- spelled substring compared to the correct word. Combined with other features, they obtained a test accuracy of 75.29% on the TOEFL11 dataset.</p><p>Character n-grams have been explored, but not particularly for representing spelling errors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brooke and Hirst (2012)</ref> showed that using char-acter unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, the test ac- curacy can reach 37.4% for 7-class NLI on a sub- set of ICLEv2 corpus. For the NLI 2013 shared task, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lahiri and Mihalcea (2013)</ref> used as features character trigrams represented by their raw fre- quencies. It leads to a test accuracy of 57.77%, which shows that how often character combina- tions are used is indicative of the L1 of an author.</p><p>Using complete words to represent spelling er- rors would not capture regularities that go beyond a single misspelled instance -like the preference of using i instead of e by Italian writers. We inves- tigate the representation of spelling errors through character n-grams with size up to 3. We assess the effectiveness of using such feature representa- tion for NLI and its contribution when combined with word and lemma n-grams, whose effective- ness has already been established ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gyawali et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jarvis et al., 2013</ref>). We report high classifi- cation results when using only spelling errors, and an improvement of 1.2 percentage points in accu- racy, compared to the best results obtained in NLI shared task, when using spelling errors in combi- nation with word and lemma features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>The experiments are performed on the TOEFL11 corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Blanchard et al., 2013)</ref> of English es- says written by non-native English learners as part of the Test of English as a Foreign Lan- guage (TOEFL). We also use the ICLEv2 cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Granger et al., 2009</ref>) for extracting additional spelling errors. The TOEFL11 corpus is not the most recent corpus for the NLI task, but is by far one of the largest learner corpora that is balanced in terms of both topics and L1 languages.</p><p>The TOEFL11 corpus contains 4 million to- kens in 12,100 essays written by authors whose native language (L1) is one of: Arabic (ARA), Chinese (ZHO), French (FRA), German (DEU), Hindi (HIN), Italian (ITA), Japanese (JPN), Ko- rean (KOR), Spanish (SPA), Telugu (TEL) or Turkish (TUR). For each target L1, the number of essays is equal (900 in the train set, 100 in the de- velopment set and 100 in the test set). The dis- tribution of the number of essays per topic is not perfectly balanced across different L1s, but they are rather close: the average number of essays per topic is 1,513 and the standard deviation is 229.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>We aim to analyze the impact of spelling errors on identifying the native language of the author. We will analyze them separately and in combination with commonly used features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Features</head><p>Word n-grams Previous work on NLI avoided lexical features due to the topic bias in the dataset. This is not an issue with the TOEFL11 corpus, since the topic distribution over the different L1s is quite balanced, as described in the previous sec- tion. Hence we can use as features the word uni- grams, bigrams and trigrams. We filter out those that do not appear in at least two texts in the cor- pus. In the extraction of word n-grams, we ig- nore the use of all punctuations. Word n-gram features have as value their weighted frequencies using the Log-Entropy weighting technique. (Du- mais, 1991) Lemma n-grams This feature represents the lex- ical choice of a writer, regardless of the inflected form of a word. We use the n-grams of lemma produced by the TreeTagger tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Schmid, 1994)</ref> with size up to 3. The feature extraction rule and the feature weighting scheme is the same as for word n-grams. Character n-grams The frequency of character or character sequence usage captures information about the preference of an author in using certain sounds, combinations of sounds, prefixes or suf- fixes. We represent texts using character n-grams and assign them the value v i -their relative fre- quency with respect to the set of n-grams (uni- gram, bigram, trigram) that they belong to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v i = count(i) j∈S i count(j)</formula><p>where S i is the collection of n-grams that have the same gram size as n-gram i. Spelling errors The errors made by a writer while writing in their L2 may result from sound-to- character mappings in L1, writing preferences or other biases. These could be strong indicators for an author's L1. We extract spelling errors us- ing the spell shell command. There are 34,233 unique spelling errors in the TOEFL11 corpus. We looked for additional sources of spelling er- rors, and extracted a list of 12,488 unique mis- spelled words from the ICLEv2 corpus that are produced by writers with the common L1 as in the TOEFL11 corpus (namely Spanish, French, Italian, German, Turkish, Chinese and Japanese). They are referred to here as Spelling error ICLE and Spelling error TOEFL in the later part of this paper. Spelling errors are binary features. Spelling errors as character n-grams Every mis- spelled word in a text will be represented as char- acter n-grams, where n = 1..3. Special characters marking the start and end of a word will be part of the n-grams. The value of these features is their relative frequencies, as for character n-grams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Classifiers</head><p>Following the proven effectiveness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) by numerous experiments on text classification tasks, we adopt the use of linear SVM for NLI. In particular, we use linear SVM implemented by scikit-learn package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>) to perform the multi-class classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Experiment Setup</head><p>The data is pre-processed by lower casing the to- kenized version of the corpus. Each text is rep- resented through the sets of features described above. The feature size of word n-grams up to size 3 are over 500,000 and that of lemma n-grams up to size 3 are over 400,000. The combination of the two is over 600,000. The hyper-parameter C of the linear SVM is set to 100, an optimal set- ting obtained by cross-validation on the train set. The performance is evaluated by classification ac- curacy, as was done in the NLI shared task. We test the performance of the used feature sets through a 10-fold cross-validation on the train+development set before the final run on the test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The classification accuracies obtained by us- ing different features and feature combina- tions are presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The feature sets include the word, lemma, character n- grams up to size 3 (denoted as word ngrams, lemma ngrams, char ngrams respectively), the misspelled words in Spelling error ICLE or in Spelling error TOEFL (denoted as word error icle or word error toefl), and the character n-grams up to size 3 extracted from Spelling error ICLE or Spelling error TOEFL (denoted as char error icle or char error toefl).</p><p>In terms of classifying by a single type of fea- ture, word n-grams are the most indicative one,  <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> 83.91 (±1.50) 84.32 (1) + (2) + <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> 83.82 (±1.53) 84.27 (1) + <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> + <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> 83.90 (±1.49) 84.73 (1) + (2) + <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> 83.92 (±1.31) 84.64 (1) + (2) + <ref type="formula">(6)</ref> 83.85 (±1.26) 84.82 (1) + (2) + <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> 83.81 (±1.26) 84.82 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jarvis et al. (2013)</ref> 84.50 83.60 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nicolai et al. (2013)</ref> 58.50 81.70 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Classification accuracy of using dif- ferent features by 10-fold cross-validation on the train+development set and test on the test set, the accuracy scores are in %. The values in bracket are the standard deviation of accuracy scores in 10-fold cross-validation.</p><p>which is consistent with the results reported by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jarvis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nicolai et al., 2013)</ref>. Using the combination of word n-grams and lemma n-grams improves the performance of using only word n-grams by less than 0.2%. It is not a significant improvement, mainly because there is a big overlap in the features in these two categories. Word-level spelling errors when used on their own do not perform well, with one of the causes being sparseness. When combin- ing them with other features (word n-grams and lemma n-grams), word error toefl does not seem to provide any additional information for improv- ing classification accuracy. By combining the word error icle with lemma n-grams and word n- grams, however, we observe a small increase in classification accuracy of 0.4%. Main reason for this is that by using word error icle, we incor- porate errors that are more common (since they occurred in two different corpora -ICLEv2 and TOEFL11 corpus).</p><p>From the classification results obtained by us- ing feature (5), (6) and <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>, it is also worth noting that by using only the character n-grams extracted from the spelling errors in Spelling error TOEFL (feature size: 5797), or even filtered by those that also appear in Spelling error ICLE (feature size: 3907), the accuracy is almost as the same as the one obtained by using all character n-grams (fea- ture size: 12601). It shows that the character n- grams in the spelling errors are a most indicative part in all the character n-grams when it comes to identifying the L1 of an author.</p><p>Using character n-grams extracted from spelling errors works better than directly using misspelled words. It further implies that while the misspelled words might differ from one another in the text, the misspelled parts share similarities. The classifier trained by combining word n-grams, lemma n-grams and character n-grams extracted from Spelling error ICLE or from Spelling error TOEFL both reach the best test accuracy in our experiments -84.82%, which is 1.2% better than the best result reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jarvis et al. (2013)</ref> in the NLI 2013 shared task. We note that including only the character n-grams extracted from the spelling errors ((1)+(2)+(6) or (1)+(2)+ <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>) leads to better results than including all the character n-grams ((1)+(2)+ <ref type="formula">(5)</ref>). It sup- ports the hypothesis that spelling errors capture relevant information about the writer's native language at a character level. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> includes some of the most informative spelling errors made by writers with different L1s. They were selected based on their weights after training the SVM with word n-grams, lemma n- grams and spelling errors (as word). They seem to confirm our starting hypothesis regarding the vari- ous phenomena of language -and script -transfer that can influence spelling errors.</p><p>As shown in the table, the informative errors for each target language are quite different. French writers tend to double the character in the word, for example, they misspell "personally" as "per- sonnaly" and "developed" as "developped". It is also apparent that Japanese writers and Italian writers tend to misspell the vowels in a word. This may be the result of rules of word pronunciations in their own languages, and sound to letter map- pings in their L1. Arabic writers tend to omit vow- els. It could be due to the fact that vowels are rarely written in Arabic language and the writers carry this habit in their writing in English.</p><p>The results confirm the usefulness of features representing spelling errors, particularly at a sub- word level. On their own, they perform on a par with character level representation of the docu- ment. They also bring improvement in perfor-  mance when combined with word and lemma n- grams, indicating that they provide at least partly complementary information to the frequently used word n-grams or lemma n-grams, which on their own have high performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we investigate the usefulness of spelling errors for the native language identifica- tion task. The experiments show that represent- ing spelling errors through character n-grams cap- tures interesting phenomena of language transfer. Both on their own and combined with customarily used word n-grams, they have high performance in terms of accuracy, when tested on the TOEFL11 corpus and compared to participating systems in the NLI shared task. In future work, it would be interesting to characterize the spelling errors with respect to similarity to specific L1s, and further explore the hints that they provide with respect to the author's native language.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>L1 Word ARA evry, experince, diffrent, advertisment, statment DEU knowlegde, advertisment, successfull, freetime, neccessary FRA generaly, personnaly, litterature, independant, developped HIN theoritical, sucess, enviornment, sucessful,</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table>gandhi
