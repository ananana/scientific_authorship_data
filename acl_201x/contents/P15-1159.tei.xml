				<p>Interpersonal relations are fickle, with close friendships often dissolving into enmity. In this work, we explore linguistic cues that presage such transitions by studying dyadic interactions in an on-line strategy game where players form alliances and break those alliances through betrayal. We characterize friendships that are unlikely to last and examine temporal patterns that foretell betrayal. We reveal that subtle signs of imminent betrayal are encoded in the conversational patterns of the dyad, even if the victim is not aware of the relationship&apos;s fate. In particular, we find that lasting friend-ships exhibit a form of balance that manifests itself through language. In contrast, sudden changes in the balance of certain conversational attributes-such as positive sentiment, politeness, or focus on future planning-signal impending betrayal.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A major focus in computational social science has been the study of interpersonal relations through data. However, social interactions are compli- cated, and we rarely have access all of the data that define the relationship between friends or enemies. As an alternative, thought experiments like the prisoner's dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Axelrod and Dion, 1988)</ref> are used to explain behavior. Two prisoners-denied communication-must decide whether to cooper- ate with each other or defect. Such simple and elegant tools initially helped understand many real world scenarios from pricing products <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Rosenthal, 1981)</ref> to athletes doping ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Buechel et al., 2013)</ref>. Despite its power, the prisoner's dilemma remains woefully unrealistic. Cooperation and betrayal do not happen in a cell cut off from the rest of the world. Instead, real interactions are mediated by communication: promises are made, then broken, and met with recriminations.</p><p>To study the complex social phenomenon of be- trayal, we turn to data and observe the players of <ref type="bibr">Diplomacy (Sharp, 1978)</ref>, a war-themed strategy game where friendships and betrayals are orches- trated primarily through language. Diplomacy, like the prisoner's dilemma, is a repeated game where players choose to either cooperate or betray other players. Diplomacy is so engaging that it is played around the world, not only casually as a board game but also over the Internet and in formal settings such as world championships. 1 Players converse throughout the game and victory hinges on enlisting others' support through persuasive- ness and cunning duplicity. To illustrate the social relations that carry out throughout the game, con- sider the following exchange between two Diplo- macy allies:</p><p>Germany: Can I suggest you move your armies east and then I will support you? Then next year you move <ref type="bibr">[there]</ref> and dismantle Turkey. I will deal with England and France, you take out Italy.</p><p>Austria: Sounds like a perfect plan! Happy to follow through. And-thank you Bruder! Austria is very polite and positive in its reply, and appreciates Germany's support and generos- ity. They have been good allies for the better part of the game. However, immediately after this ex- change, Austria suddenly invades German terri- tory. The intention to do so was so well concealed that Germany did not see the betrayal coming; oth- erwise it would have taken advantage first. Indeed, if we follow their conversation after the attack, we find Germany surprised:</p><p>Germany: Not really sure what to say, except that I regret you did what you did. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> A recent episode of This American Life describes the Diplomacy game in a competitive offline setting: http:// www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/ episode/531/got-your-back?act=1</p><p>Such scenarios suggest an important research challenge: is the forthcoming betrayal signaled by linguistic cues appearing in the (ostensibly friendly) conversation between the betrayer and the eventual victim? A positive answer would sug- gest not only that the betrayer unknowingly re- veals their future treachery, but also that the even- tual victim fails to notice these signals. Captur- ing these signals computationally would therefore mean outperforming the human players.</p><p>In this work, we provide a framework for ana- lyzing a dyad's evolving communication patterns and provide evidence of subtle but consistent con- versational patterns that foretell the unilateral dis- solution of a friendship. In particular, imminent betrayal is signaled by sudden changes in the bal- ance of conversational attributes such as positive sentiment, politeness, and structured discourse. Furthermore, we show that by exploiting these cues in a prediction setting we can anticipate im- minent betrayal better than the human players.</p><p>After briefly describing the game (Section 2), we focus on how the structure of the game pro- vides convenient, reliable indicators of whether pairs of participants are friends or foes (Section 3). Given these labels, we explore linguistic features that are predictive of whether friendships will end in betrayal (Section 4) and, if so, when the betrayal will happen (Section 5).</p><p>While our focus is on a single popular game, we choose methods that generalize to other do- mains, revealing dynamics present in other social interactions (Section 6). We discuss how automat- ically predicting stable relationships and betrayal can more broadly help advance the study of trust and relationships using computational linguistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Communication and Conflict in Diplomacy</head><p>A game of Diplomacy begins in 1901 with play- ers casting themselves as the European powers at the eve of the first world war: England, Germany, France, Russia, Austria, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire. The goal of the game (like other war games such as Risk or Axis &amp; Allies) is to cap- ture all of the territories on the game board <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig- ure 1)</ref>. The games are divided into years start- ing from 1901 and each year is divided into two seasons-Spring and Fall. Each season consists of two alternating phases: diplomacy-the players communicate to form strategies-and orders-the players submit their moves for the season. Seasons are therefore the main unit of game time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Movement, Orders, and Battles</head><p>On the board, each player can operate a unit for each city they control. During each turn, these pieces have the option of moving to an adjacent territory. What makes Diplomacy unique is that all players submit their written (or electronic) or- ders; these orders are executed simultaneously; and there is no randomness (e.g., dice). Thus, the outcome of the game depends only on the commu- nication, cooperation, and movements of players.</p><p>When two units end their turn in the same terri- tory, it implies a battle. Who wins the battle is de- cided purely based on numerical superiority (ties go to defenders). Instead of moving, a unit can support another unit; large armies can be created through intricate networks of support. The side with the largest army wins the battle.</p><p>The process of supporting a unit is thus critical for both a successful offensive move and a suc- cessful defense. Often, a lone player lacks the units to provide enough support to his attacks and thus needs the help of others. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Because these or- ders (both movement and support) are machine readable, we have a clear indication of when play- ers are working together (supporting each other) or working against each other (attacking each other); we will use this to define relationships between players (Section 3). However, coordinating these actions between players requires cooperation and diplomacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Communication</head><p>In the diplomacy phase of the game, players talk to each other. These conversations are either public or-more typically-one-on-one. Conversations include greetings, extra-game discussions (e.g., "did you see Game of Thrones?"), low-level tac- tics ("if you attack Armenia, I'll support you"), and high-level strategy ("we need to control Cen- tral Europe"). The content of these messages forms the object of our study.</p><p>Because of the centrality of language to Diplo- macy, we can learn the rhetorical and social de- vices players use to build and break trust. Because this language is embedded in every game, it has convenient properties: similar situations are re- peated, the goals are clear, and machine-readable orders confirm which players are enemies and which are friends. In the next section, we explore the Diplomacy data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Preprocessing</head><p>We use games from two popular online platforms for playing Diplomacy. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The average season of an online Diplomacy game lasts nine days. We re- move non-standard games caused by differences between the two platforms, as well as games that are still in progress. Moreover, in each game, we filter out setup messages, regulatory messages to and from the administrator of the game and mes- sages declaring the state of the game, keeping only messages between the players. This leaves 249 games with 145.000 total messages. The dataset confirms that communication is an essential part of Diplomacy: half of the games have over 515 messages exchanged between the players, while the top quartile has over 750 mes- sages per game. Also, non-trivial messages (with at least one sentence) tend to be complex: over half of them have at least five sentences, and the top quartile consists of messages with eight or more sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Relationships and Their Stability</head><p>In this section, we explore how interactions within the game of Diplomacy define the relationships <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Anonymized transcripts and more information available at http://vene.ro/betrayal/ Event Time What happened 4 B supports V's army in Vienna F2</p><p>3 V supports B's attack from Warsaw to Silesia F3 3 B again supports V in Vienna F4</p><p>1 V supports B's move from Venice to Tyrolia H5 0 B attacks V in Vienna H6 -1 V retaliates, attacking B in Warsaw</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">4 3 2 1 0 (betrayal) Game season Betrayer Victim F 1 F 3 F 2 F 4 H 5 H 6</formula><p>Figure 2: A friendship between Player B (eventual betrayer) and Player V (eventual victim) unravels. For the first four events, the players exchange Friendly acts (in green). Even- tually B's unilateral hostile act betrays V's trust, leading to hostility (in red). The dissolution takes place at the time of the first hostile act (t = 0) and we index game seasons going back from the betrayal, such that lower indices mean betrayal is nearer.</p><p>between players. While such dyadic relationships can be undefined (e.g., England and Turkey are in opposite corners of the map), specific interactions between players indicate whether they are friendly or hostile to each other.</p><p>Friendships and hostilities. Alliances are a natu- ral part of the game of Diplomacy. While the best outcome for a player is a solo victory against all other players, this is rare and difficult to achieve without any cooperation and assistance. Instead, the game's structure encourages players to form long-term alliances. Allies often settle for (less prestigious) team victories, but these coalitions can also crumble as players seek a (more presti- gious) solo victory for themselves. This game dy- namic naturally leads to the formation of friendly and hostile dyads, which are relatively easy to identify through post-hoc analysis of the game, as explained next.</p><p>Acts of friendship. Diplomacy provides a support option for players to help each other: this game mechanism (discussed in Section 2) provides un- equivocal evidence of friendship. When two play- ers engage in a series of such friendly acts, we will say that the two are in a relation of friendship.</p><p>Acts of hostility. Unlike support, hostile actions are not explicitly marked in Diplomacy. We con- sider two players to be hostile if they get involved in any unambiguous belligerent action, such as in- vading one another's territory, or if one supports an enemy of the other. 4</p><p>Betrayal. As in real life, friendships can be broken unilaterally: an individual can betray his friend by engaging in a hostile act towards her. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows two players who started out as friends (green) but became hostile (red) after a be- trayal. Importantly, until the last act of friendship (game season t = 1), the victim is unaware that she will be betrayed (otherwise she would not have engaged in an act of friendship) and the betrayer has no interest in signaling his planned duplicity to his partner. This setting poses the following research chal- lenge: are there linguistic cues that appear during the friendly conversations and portend the upcom- ing betrayal? A positive answer would have two implications: the betrayer unknowingly hints at his future treachery, and the victim could have no- ticed it, but did not. We will explore this question in the following sections.</p><p>Relationship stability. Before venturing into the linguistic analysis of betrayals, we briefly ex- plore the dynamics underlying these state transi- tions. We find that, as in real life, friendships are much more likely to collapse into hostilities than the reverse: in Diplomacy, the probability of a friendship to dissolve into enmity is about five times greater than that of hostile players be- coming friends. The history of the relationship also matters. A friendship built on the founda- tion of many cooperative acts is more likely to en- dure than friendship with a short history, and long- lasting conflict is less likely to become a friend- ship. In numbers, the probability that a two season long friendship ends is 35%, while for pairs who have helped each other for ten or more seasons, the probability of betrayal is only 23%. Similarly, the probability that a two season long conflict resolves is 7%, while players at war for over ten seasons have only a 5% chance to make up. These num- bers aren't particularly shocking-the idea that the passage of time has an effect on the strength of a relationship is intuitive. For the purposes of this study, we control for such effects in order to cap- ture purely linguistic hints of betrayal.</p><p>Starting from the relationship definitions dis- cussed in this section, in what follows we show how subtle linguistic patterns of in-game player pair's interactions. Our definition of hostility intentionally discards such ambiguous evidence. For instance, if two play- ers attempt to move into the same unoccupied territory, this is not necessarily aggressive: allies sometimes use this tactic ("bouncing") to ensure that a territory remains unoccupied. conversations can reveal whether or not a friend- ship will turn hostile or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Language Foretelling Betrayal</head><p>In this section, we examine whether the conver- sations between two Diplomacy allies contain lin- guistic cues foretelling if their friendship will last or end in betrayal. We expect these cues to be sub- tle, since we only consider messages exchanged when the two individuals are being ostensibly friendly; when at least one of them-the eventual victim-is unaware of the relationship's fate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">What Constitutes a Betrayal</head><p>To find betrayals, we must first find friendships. Building on the discussion from Section 3, we consider a friendship to be stable if it is ongo- ing, established, and reciprocal. Thus, we focus on relationships that contain at least two consecu- tive and reciprocated acts of friendships that span at last at least three seasons in game time. We also check that no more than five seasons pass between two acts of friendships, as friendships can fade.</p><p>Betrayals are established and reciprocal friend- ships that end with at least two hostile acts. The person initiating the first of these hostile acts is the betrayer, while the other person is the victim. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> For each betrayal instance, we find the most similar stable friendship that was never dissolved by betrayal. Using a greedy heuristic, we se- lect friendships that match the betrayals on two statistics: the length of the friendship and num- ber of seasons since the start of the game. Af- ter this matching process, we find no significant difference in either of the two variables (Mann- Whitney p &gt; 0.3). Matching betrayals with last- ing friendships in this fashion removes historical and relationship-type effects such as those dis- cussed in Section 3, and focuses the comparison on the variable of interest: whether a given stable friendship will end in a betrayal or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Linguistic Harbingers of Betrayal</head><p>Now we switch to exploring linguistic features that correlate with future betrayal in the controlled setting described above. We start from the intu- ition that a stable relationship should be balanced ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jung et al., 2012</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Friendships that will end in betrayal are imbalanced. The eventual betrayer is more positive, more polite, but plans less than the victim. The white bars correspond to matched lasting friendships, where the roles of potential betrayer and victim are arbitrarily assigned; in these cases, the imbalances disappear. Error bars mark bootstrapped standard errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Efron, 1979).</ref> while enemies will fight each other. A precarious friendship might feel one-sided, while a conflict may turn to friendship through a magnanimous olive branch. Therefore, we focus our attention on linguistic features that have the potential to signal an imbalance in the communication patterns of the dyad.</p><p>To ensure that we are studying conversational patterns that occur only when the two individuals in the dyad are ostensibly being friends, we only extract features from the messages exchanged be- fore the last act of friendship, that is, before the season labeled 1 in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Considering the na- ture of this setting, we can only hope for subtle linguistic cues: if there were salient linguistic sig- nals, then the victim would notice and preempt the betrayal. Instead, they are taken by surprise; the following is a typical reaction of a player after hav- ing been betrayed by a friend:</p><p>Well that move was sour. I'm guessing France put you up to it, citing my large growth. This was a pity, as I was willing to give you the lion's share of centers in the west. [...] If you voiced your concerns I would have supported you in most of the western centers. Unfortunately now you have jumped out of the pan into the fire.</p><p>Sentiment. Changes in the sentiment expressed in conversation can reflect emotional responses, so- cial affect, as well as the status of the relationship as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gottman and Levenson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wang and Cardie, 2014</ref>). We quantify the proportion of exchanged sentences that transmit positive, neutral and negative sentiment using the Stanford Senti- ment Analyzer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Socher et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Example sentences with these features, as well as all other features we consider, can be found in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We collapse the few examples classified as extreme posi- tive and extreme negative examples into positive and negative, respectively.</p><p>We find that an imbalance in the amount of pos- itive sentiment expressed by the two individuals is a subtle sign that the relation will end in betrayal <ref type="figure">(Figure 3a</ref>, left; one-sample t-test on the imbal- ance, p = 0.008). When looking closer at who is the source of this imbalance <ref type="figure">(Figure 3a, right)</ref>, we find that that it is the eventual betrayer that uses significantly more positive sentiment than the con- trol counterpart in the matched friendship (two- sample t-test, p = 0.001). This is somewhat sur- prising, and we speculate that this is the betrayer overcompensating for his forthcoming actions.</p><p>Argumentation and Discourse. Structured dis- course and well-made arguments are essential in persuasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cialdini, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anand et al., 2011</ref>). To capture discourse complexity, we measure the average number of explicit discourse connectors per sentence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Prasad et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> These markers belong to four coarse classes: comparison, contin- gency, expansive, and temporal. To capture plan- ning, we group temporal markers that refer to the future (e.g.,"next", "thereafter") in a separate cat- egory. To quantify the level of argumentation, we calculate average number of claim and premise markers per sentence, as identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Stab and Gurevych (2014)</ref>. We also measure the number of request sentences in each message, as identified by the heuristics in the Stanford Politeness classifier (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013).</p><p>The structure of the discourse offers clues to whether the friendship will last. For example, <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 3b</ref> shows that in friendships doomed to end in betrayal, the victim uses planning discourse mark- ers significantly more often than the betrayer (one- sample t-test on the imbalance, p = 0.03), who is  likely to be aware that the cooperation has no fu- ture. (More argumentation and discourse features will be discussed in the following sections.)</p><p>Politeness. Pragmatic information can also be in- formative of the relation between two individu- als; for example Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Mizil et al. (2013)</ref> show that differences in levels of polite- ness can echo differences in status and power. We measure the politeness of each message using the Stanford Politeness classifier and find that friend- ships that end in betrayal show a slight imbalance between the level of politeness used by the two individuals (one-sample t-test on the imbalance, p = 0.09) and that in those cases the future vic- tim is the one that is less polite.</p><p>Subjectivity. We explored phrases expressing opinion, accusation, suspicion, and speculation taken from an automatically collected lexicon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Riloff and Wiebe, 2003</ref>), but did not find sig- nificant differences between betrayals and control friendships.</p><p>Talkativeness. Another conversational aspect is the amount of communication flowing between the players, in each direction. To quantify this, we simply use the number of messages sent, the av- erage number of sentences per message, and the average number of words per sentence. Abnor- mal communication patterns can indicate a rela- tionship breakdown. For example, friendships that dissolve are characterized by an imbalance in the number of messages exchanged between the two players (one-sample t-test, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>These results show that there are indeed subtle linguistic imbalance signals that are indicative of an forthcoming betrayal, even in a setting in which the victim is not aware of the impending betrayal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Predictive Power</head><p>To test whether these linguistic cues have any pre- dictive power and to explore how they interact, we turn to a binary classification setting in which we try to detect whether a player V will be betrayed by a player B. (We will call player V the poten- tial victim and player B the potential betrayer.) Expert humans-the actual victims-performed poorly on this task and were not able to tell that they will be betrayed: by virtue of how the dataset is constructed, the performance of the human play- ers is at chance level.</p><p>We use the same balanced dataset of matched betrayals and lasting friendships as before and consider as classification instances all the seasons coming from each of the two classes (663 betrayal seasons and 712 from lasting friendships). As fea- tures, we use the cues described above and sum- marized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, differentiated by source: V or B. We use logistic regression after univariate feature selection. The best setting for the model parameters 8 is selected via 5-fold cross valida- tion, ensuring that instances from the same game are never found in both train and validation folds.</p><p>The resulting model achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 57% and a Matthews correlation co- efficient of 0.14, significantly above chance (52% accuracy and 0 Matthews correlation coefficient), with 95% bootstrapped confidence. This indicates     that, unlike the actual players, the classifier is able to exploit subtle linguistic signals that surface in the conversation. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The selected features and their coefficients are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. On top of the observations we previously made, the feature ranking reveals that writing more sentences per message is more common when one will betray. Discourse features also prove relevant: more complex discourse in- dicates a lower likelihood of the player betraying (e.g., <ref type="figure">Figure 3b)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the selected linguistic features capture a consistent signal that characterizes people's lan- guage when they are about to betray: they tend to plan less than their victims, use less structure in their communication, and are overly positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Sudden yet Inevitable Betrayal</head><p>The results from Section 4 suggest that language cues can be subtle signs of future relationship dis- ruption. Even though people are aware that most relationships eventually end, one would still prefer to reap their benefits as long as possible. In Diplo- macy, despite the common knowledge that every- one prefers to win alone, players still take chances on long-lasting alliances. This leads to an alter- nate research question: assuming that a relation- ship will be disrupted, how soon can one expect to be betrayed? This is still just as challenging for the expert human players, as they were not able to anticipate and thereby avoid betrayal.</p><p>Next we investigate if the variation of the linguistic cues over time can predict imminent change in the relationship. We consider only the subset of betrayals used in Section 4, and label each individual game season with its distance from the end of the friendship (as in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). We pre- vent short alliances of circumstance from distort- ing the features close to betrayal by keeping only friendships lasting at least four seasons.</p><p>We consider the same cues described in <ref type="table">Ta- ble 1</ref>, and train a classifier to discriminate between the season preceding the last friendly interaction and all the older seasons. This learning task is imbalanced, with only 14% of the seasons being immediately before the betrayal. Thus, we op- timize F 1 score and also measure the Matthews correlation coefficient, which takes a value of 0 for uninformative predictions (random or major- ity). The best model achieves an F 1 score of 0.31 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.17, significantly better than chance with 95% boot- strapped confidence. This shows that we can cap- ture signs of imminent betrayal, something that even the skilled human players have failed to do. Furthermore, 39% of the predicted false positives are within two seasons of the last friendly act. This suggests that sometimes the warning signs can ap- pear slightly earlier.</p><p>The selected features, displayed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, re- flect some of the effects identified in Section 4, such as the importance of positive sentiment and planning discourse markers. Betrayers have a ten- dency to use more positive sentiment during the last moment of purported friendliness <ref type="figure">(Figure 4a</ref>). Also, expressing more opinions through claims is a sign that one will not betray right away. Three of the discourse features (comparison, contingency and expansion) are selected as imbalance features (they have near-opposite coefficients for the be- trayer and for the victim), indicating that as be- trayal approaches, victims are less eloquent than betrayers. Interestingly, some predictive signals come only from the victim: a partner using in- creasingly more planning words is at higher risk of being betrayed <ref type="figure">(Figure 4b</ref>). This could be ex- plained by the pressure that making plans for the future can put on a relationship. A similar reason- ing applies for making many requests.</p><p>We also find that a decrease in a partner's polite- ness presages their imminent betrayal. The change in politeness over time <ref type="figure">(Figure 4c</ref>) reveals a rever- sal in the politeness imbalance of the pair. This explains why politeness is not a good enough fea- ture in detecting long-term betrayal. The behav-  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Changes in balance can mark imminent betrayal. As the breakdown approaches, the betrayer becomes more positive but less polite, and the victim tends to make more requests and become more polite.

On one hand, if the betrayer has planned the act in ad- vance, politeness can be a strategy for deception. On the other hand, if the betrayer receives impo- lite requests, the value of the relationship can de- crease, hastening a betrayal. We observe a simi- lar dynamic for the average number of sentences per message sent by the betrayer; the feature is selected in both prediction tasks, but with oppo- site signs: more complex messages suggest that betrayal will happen, but not right away.</p><p>Studying language change as betrayal draws nearer uncovers effects that cannot be seen when looking at an entire friendship on average. For example, while excessively positive and polite partners are potential betrayers, people who have themselves suddenly become more polite are likely to become victims soon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Relevance Beyond the Game</head><p>While discovering betrayal in one online game is a fun and novel task, our work connects with broader research in computational social science. In this section we describe how our work tackles issues that previous research on alliances, negoti- ation, and relationships have faced.</p><p>Cooperation and relationship building are an es- sential part of many activities: completing a group project, opening a business, or forging a new rela- tionship. Each of these has been the subject of ex- tensive research to understand what makes for ef- fective relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jung et al. (2012)</ref> show that a balanced working relationship is more likely to lead to better performance on tasks like pair pro- gramming. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Imai and Gelfand (2010)</ref> show that understanding cultural norms improves negotia- tions. While these data are elicited in the lab, our "found" data are inexpensive because Diplomacy games are fun and inherently anonymized.</p><p>Romance is a popular and more real-world phe- nomenon that helps us understand how relation- ships form and dissolve. The research that tells us how language shapes early dating <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ranganath et al., 2009)</ref> and whether an existing relationship will continue <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Slatcher and Pennebaker, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottman and Levenson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ireland et al., 2011</ref>) is formed from an incomplete sample of a course of a relationship. In contrast, a game of Diplomacy is shorter than almost any marriage and we have a complete account of all interactions throughout the entire relationship. Furthermore, this work fo- cuses on the unilateral and asymmetric act of be- trayal, rather than on the question of whether a re- lation will last.</p><p>Playing Diplomacy online is less tangible than a romantic relationship, but understanding trust and deception in online interactions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Riegelsberger et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Newman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hancock et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ott et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Feng et al., 2012</ref>) is partic- ularly important because the Internet marketplace is a growing driver of economic growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boyd, 2003)</ref>. Diplomacy offers a setting in which decep- tion occurs spontaneously in the context of com- plex relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>Despite people's best effort to hide it, the inten- tion to betray can leak through the language one uses. Detecting it is not a task that we expect to be solvable with high accuracy, as that would en- tail a reliable "recipe" for avoiding betrayal in re- lationships; in this unrealistic scenario, betrayals would be unlikely to exist. While the effects we find are subtle, they bring new insights into the re- lation between linguistic balance and stability in relationships.</p><p>Although we use one game to develop our methodology, the framework developed here can be extended to be applied to a wide range of social interaction. Social dynamics in collaborative set- tings can bear striking similarities to those present in war games. For example, in Wikipedia "edit wars"-where attacks correspond to edit reverts- are common on issues relating to politics, religion, history and nationality, among others ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kittur et al., 2007)</ref>. As in Diplomacy, Wikipedia editors form alliances, argue and negotiate about possible com- promises. A challenge for future work is to find re- liable linguistic cues that generalize well between such settings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The full Diplomacy board representing Europe circa 1914.

			<note place="foot" n="2"> While support can come from a player&apos;s own units, allies often combine resources. For example, if an English army in Belgium is attacking a Germany Army in Ruhr, a French army in Burgundy could strengthen that attack. This is accomplished by the French player submitting a move explicitly stating &quot;I support England&apos;s attack from Belgium to Ruhr&quot;.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> In rare cases, the betrayal can be mutual (i.e., both players start attacking each other in the same season). In such cases, we consider both betrayals.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> We remove the connectors that appear in over 20% of the messages (and, for, but, if, as, or, and so).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> We optimize the number of features selected, the scoring function used (ANOVA or χ 2 ), whether to automatically reweigh the classes, the regularizer (1 or 2), and the value of the regularization parameter C between 10 −12 and 10 12 .</note>

			<note place="foot" n="9"> Since our focus is on understanding linguistic aspects of betrayal, rather than on achieving the best possible performance on this particular Diplomacy task, we do not use game-specific information, such as the players&apos; position on the map, or any information not accessible to both players.</note>
