				<p>We present a novel technique for training translation models for statistical machine translation by aligning source sentences to their oracle-BLEU translations. In contrast to previous approaches which are constrained to phrase training, our method also allows the re-estimation of reordering models along with the translation model. Experiments show an improvement of up to 0.8 BLEU for our approach over a competitive Arabic-English base-line trained directly on the word-aligned bitext using heuristic extraction. As an additional benefit, the phrase table size is reduced dramatically to only 3% of the original size.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In phrase-based SMT, the phrase pairs in the trans- lation model are traditionally trained by applying a heuristic extraction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Och and Ney, 2000</ref>) which extracts phrase pairs based on consistency of word alignments from a word-aligned bilingual training data. The probabilities of the translation model are then calculated based on the relative frequencies of the extracted phrase pairs.</p><p>A notable shortcoming of this approach is that the translation model probabilities thus calculated from the training bitext can be unintuitive and un- reliable ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Marcu and Wong, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Foster et al., 2006</ref>) as they reflect only the distribution over the phrase pairs observed in the training data.</p><p>However, from an SMT perspective it is im- portant that the models reflect probability distri- butions which are preferred by the decoding pro- cess, i.e., phrase translations which are likely to be used frequently to achieve better translations should get higher scores and phrases which are less likely to be used should get low scores. In ad- dition, the heuristic extraction algorithm generates all possible, consistent phrases including overlap- ping phrases. This means that translation proba- bilities are distributed over a very large number of phrase translation candidates most of which never lead to the best possible translation of a sentence.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a novel solution which is to re-estimate the models from the best BLEU translation of each source sentence in the bitext. An important contribution of our approach is that unlike previous approaches such as forced align- ment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wuebker et al., 2010)</ref>, reordering and lan- guage models can also be re-estimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The forced alignment technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wuebker et al. (2010)</ref> forms the main motivation for our work. In forced alignment, given a sentence pair (F, E), a decoder determines the best phrase segmentation and alignment which will result in a translation of F into E. The best segmentation is defined as the one which maximizes the probability of translat- ing the source sentence into the given target sen- tence. At the end, the phrase table is re-estimated using the phrase pair segmentations obtained from forced decoding. Thus forced alignment is a re- estimation technique where translation probabil- ities are calculated based on their frequency in best-scoring hypotheses instead of the frequencies of all possible phrase pairs in the bitext. However, one limitation of forced alignment is that only the phrase translation model can be re-estimated since it is restricted to align the source sentence to the given target reference, thus fixing the choice of re- ordering decisions.</p><p>A similar line of work is proposed by  and  who use a self-enhancing strategy to utilize additional mono- " yese L <ref type="table">Tauffir 40 alif kais dam L alfalsteniin   seeks to provide palestnians with 40000 blood</ref>  lingual source language data by aligning it to its target language translation obtained by using an SMT system to rank sentence translation proba- bilities. However, the main focus of their work is translation model adaptation by augmenting the bitext with additional training data and not the re- estimation of the translation models trained on the parallel data.</p><p>In this work, we propose that aligning source sentences to their oracle BLEU translations pro- vides a more realistic estimate of the models from the decoding perspective instead of aligning them to high quality human translations as in forced de- coding.</p><p>Another relevant line of research relates tun- ing (weight optimisation), where our work lies between forced decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Wuebker et al., 2010)</ref> and the bold updating approach of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liang et al., 2006</ref>). However, our approach specifically pro- poses a novel method for training models using oracle BLEU translations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model Re-estimation</head><p>The idea of our approach is to re-estimate the models with n-best oracle-BLEU translations and sentence alignments resulting from decoding the source sentence. Given a source and its reference translation, the oracle-BLEU translation is defined as the translation output with highest BLEU score. Oracle BLEU translations have been previously used for different analytical purposes in SMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Srivastava et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Dreyer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wisniewski et al., 2010)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows example of word alignment ob- tained from EM training, segmentations and align- ment obtained from forced decoding and oracle- BLEU re-estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Oracle BLEU</head><p>Ideally, one would like to re-estimate translation models directly from the n-best BLEU transla- tions. However there are two problems in calcu- lating BLEU for individual sentence: First, as dis- cussed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chiang et al., 2008</ref>), BLEU is not de- signed to be used for sentences in isolation where it can exhibit rather volatile behavior. Hence, fol- lowing their work and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Watanabe et al., 2007</ref>), we calculate BLEU for a sentence in the context of a exponentially-weighted moving average of previ- ous translations. We briefly discuss the computa- tion from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chiang et al., 2008)</ref> as follows: Given a source sentence f, and its reference translation r, for an n-best translation e * , let c(e) be defined as the vector of target length |e|, source length |f|, reference length |r|, and the number of n-gram matches between e and r, then two pseudo docu- ment parameters O and O f are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O ← 0.9 · (O + c(e * )), O f ← 0.9 · (O f + |f |) (1)</formula><p>O is an exponentially-weighted moving average of the vectors from previous sentences and O f is the correction of source length with respect to the previous sentences. Then the BLEU score for a sentence pairs (f,r) and translation e * is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">B(e; f, r) = (O f + |f |) · BLEU (O + c(e * ; r)) (2)</formula><p>The second problem as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chiang et al. (2008)</ref> is that due to noise in the training data, a high-BLEU translation may contain certain rules which are unlikely to be used by the model. Hence following them, we use a weighted combination of BLEU and model score to select the n-best list:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">e * = argmax e (B(e) − µ · (B(e) − h(e).w)) (3)</formula><p>where B(e) and h(e) are the BLEU and model scores of the candidate translation and w is the optimised weights for the models, µ controls the preference between BLEU and model scores to determine oracle translations. We set µ=0.5 to balance between BLEU scores almost as high as the max-BLEU translations, while staying close to translations preferred by the model. We also conducted a set of experiments with µ=0 (pure or absolute BLEU) in order to verify the necessity for the optimal combination. The lower scores for this setting as compared to the baseline veri- fied that using only the best BLEU translation in- deed degrades the performance of the re-estimated models. This finding for the optimal value of µ has also been established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chiang et al., 2008</ref>) through a series of experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Training</head><p>For obtaining the oracle-BLEU translations, we first train the translation models from the bitext using the standard pipeline of word alignment and heuristic extraction. Along with the phrase translation and language models, we also train a bilingual language model (BiLM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Niehues et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Garmash and Monz, 2014)</ref>, as well as lexicalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tillman, 2004</ref>) and hierarchical re- ordering models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Galley and Manning, 2008)</ref>. We use a BiLM specifically as an instance of a re- ordering model in order to determine the effect of re-estimating re-ordering decisions from oracle- BLEU translations.</p><p>We use the decoder trained on these models to translate the training bitext. Along with the 1- best translation (based on model scores), we also store search graphs or lattices generated during the translations process. Using the target sen- tences, we convert the translation lattice to an isomorphic oracle-BLEU lattice which has the same set of nodes but the edges represent BLEU score differences corresponding to each transition. Finally, we extract n-best candidate translations from the graphs ranked on BLEU score as de- fined in Equation (3). Using the word alignments from the initial phrase table, we extract the align- ments between each source sentence and each of their n-best oracle-BLEU translations. Finally, we re-train the phrase translations, re-ordering and BiLM on these translations and alignments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Avoiding over-fitting</head><p>Re-estimation of the translation models from the n-best translation of the bitext could re-enforce the probabilities of the low frequency phrase pairs in the re-estimated models leading to over-fitting. Within forced decoding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wuebker et al. (2010)</ref> ad- dress this problem by using a leave-one-out ap- proach where they modify the phrase translation probabilities for each sentence pair by remov- ing the counts of all phrases that were extracted from that particular sentence. However, in our ap- proach, we do not impose a constraint to produce the exact translation, instead we use the highest BLEU translations which may be very different from the references. Thus it is not strictly nec- essary to apply leave-one-out in our approach as a solution to over-fitting. Instead, we handle the problem by simply removing all the phrase pairs below a threshold count which in our case is 2,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ init = φ baseline − φ C(e,f )&lt;2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>therefore removing phrase pairs with high proba- bility but low frequency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental set up</head><p>Our experiments are carried out for an Arabic- English parallel corpus of approximately 1 million sentence pairs. We establish a baseline system by training models on this bitext and then compare this to a forced decoding implementation and to oracle-BLEU re-estimation using the same bitext.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Baseline and forced decoding</head><p>The initial training corpus we use is a collection of parallel sentences taken from OpenMT data sources released by the LDC. Phrase table, distortion models and the lexical BiLM are trained with initial alignments obtained using GIZA++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Och and Ney, 2003)</ref>. The En- glish 5-gram target language model is trained with Kneser-Ney smoothing on news data of nearly 1.6B tokens. We use an in-house phrase-based SMT system similar to Moses.

In order to increase the chances of producing the exact reference, we follow Foster and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Kuhn (2012)</ref> and relax the standard decoding parameters as follows: distortion limit=∞, stack size=2000, beam width=10e-30, and no threshold pruning of the translation model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Oracle BLEU re-estimation</head><p>To obtain oracle-BLEU translations, we first train an initial SMT system and use it to decode the bitext. This system is identical to the baseline system except for the removal of low-frequency phrase pairs from the baseline phrase table as de- scribed in Section 3.3. To obtain the n-best oracle- BLUE translations, we experiment with differ- ent values of n, where n ∈ {1, 10, 100}. From these oracle-BLEU translations and alignments all phrases that were used in the derivation of these n- best sentences are extracted and the models are re- estimated by re-calculating the translation proba- bilities. Hierarchical and lexicalized re-ordering models as well as the BiLM are re-trained using the source sentences, oracle-BLEU translations and word alignments. For testing the performance of the re-estimated models, we tune different sys- tems while replacing the baseline models with the corresponding re-estimated models. We also experiment with the interpolation of re-estimated models with the respective baseline models. We evaluate against 4 test sets: MT05, MT06, MT08, and MT09. Case-insensitive 4-gram BLEU <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Papineni et al., 2002</ref>) is used as evaluation metric. Approximate randomization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Noreen., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Riezler and Maxwell, 2005</ref>) is used to detect statisti- cally significant differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>We discuss the experimental results of our oracle- BLEU re-estimation approach for different mod- els and settings and provide a comparison with the baseline (heuristic training) and forced alignment.</p><p>Re-estimated models with three different values of n ∈ {1, 10, 100} were evaluated under three settings: phrase table re-estimation, interpolation, and BiLM re-estimation. The best improvements over the baseline are obtained by using only 1-best (n= 1) alignments as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Surpris- ingly, this is in contrast with forced decoding as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wuebker et al. (2010)</ref>, where the best improvements are obtained for n = 100. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> provides a comparison between BLEU improvements achieved by forced decoding (n = 100 best) and our oracle-BLEU re-estimation ap- proach (n = 1 best) over the baseline for different models. One can see in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> that while phrase table re-estimation drops substantially for forced decoding for all test sets (up to -1.4 for MT09), oracle-BLEU phrase table re-estimation shows ei- ther slight improvements or negligible drops com- pared to the baseline. For the linear interpola- tion of the re-estimated phrase table with the base- line, forced decoding shows only a slight improve- ment for MT06, MT08 and MT09 and still suffers from a substantial drop for MT05. On the other hand, oracle-BLEU re-estimation shows consis- tent improvements for all test sets with a maxi- mum gain of up to +0.7 for MT06. It is impor- tant to note here that although linear interpolation extinguishes the advantage of a smaller phrase ta- ble size obtained by re-estimation, the improve- ment achieved by interpolation for oracle-BLEU re-estimation are significantly higher as compared to forced decoding.</p><p>An important novelty of oracle-BLEU re- estimation is that it also allows for re-training of other models alongside the phrase table. Here we provide the results for the re-estimation of a BiLM. For all test sets, BiLM re-estimation provides additional improvements over simple phrase table interpolation, demonstrating that re- estimation of re-ordering models can further im- prove translation performance. The last row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> shows that the re-estimated BiLM on its own adds BLEU improvement of up to +0.5 (for MT09). The highest BLEU improvement of +0.8 is achieved by using a re-estimated BiLM and an interpolated phrase table. Note that re-estimation of BiLM or re-ordering models is not possible for forced decoding due to the constraint of having to match the exact reference.

How- ever, improvements achieved with this interpola- tion did not surpass the best result obtained for the oracle-BLEU re-estimation. Additionally, we also compare oracle-BLEU re-estimation to forced decoding with leave-one- out ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wuebker et al., 2010)</ref> by evaluating both on a concatenation of 5 test sets (MT03, MT05- MT09). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>, even with leave- one-out, forced decoding performance drops be- low the baseline by -0.3 BLEU. In contrast, phrase tables re-estimated from oracle-BLEU translation achieves the same performance as the baseline. When interpolated with the baseline phrase ta- ble, both approaches show significant improve- ments over the baseline. This implies that only in combination with the original phrase table does forced-decoding with leave-one-out outperform the baseline. On the other hand, oracle-BLEU re-estimation by its own not only performs bet- ter than forced decoding, but also gives a perfor- mance equal to forced decoding with leave-one- out when interpolated with baseline phrase table. In addition to the BLEU improvements, our ap- proach also results in a re-estimated phrase table with a significantly reduced size as compared to the baseline. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, out of all the settings, the minimum phrase table size after oracle-BLEU re-estimation is only 3.28% of base- line (i.e., a reduction of 96.72%) while it is 7.6% for forced decoding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a novel technique for improving the reliability of SMT models by model re-estimation from oracle-BLEU translations of the source sentences in the bitext. Our experimen- tal results show BLEU score improvements of up to +0.8 points for oracle-BLEU re-estimation over a strong baseline along with a substantially re- duced size of the re-estimated phrase table (3.3% of the baseline). An important novelty of our ap- proach is that it also allows for the re-estimation of re-ordering models which can yield further im- provements in SMT performance as demonstrated by the re-estimation of a BiLM.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) : Word alignment from EM training for Arabic (transliterated)-English sentence pair.
