				<p>The disambiguation algorithm presented in this paper is implemented in SemLinker, an entity linking system. First, named entities are linked to candidate Wikipedia pages by a generic annotation engine. Then, the algorithm re-ranks candidate links according to mutual relations between all the named entities found in the document. The evaluation is based on experiments conducted on the test corpus of the TAC-KBP 2012 entity linking task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Entity Linking (EL) task consists in linking name mentions of named entities (NEs) found in a document to their corresponding entities in a ref- erence Knowledge Base (KB). These NEs can be of type person (PER), organization (ORG), etc., and they are usually represented in the KB by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Dealing with ambiguity is one of the key difficulties in this task, since mentions are often highly polysemous, and potentially related to many different KB entries. Various approaches have been proposed to solve the named entity disambiguation (NED) problem. Most of them involve the use of surface forms ex- tracted from Wikipedia. Surface forms consist of a word or a group of words that match lexical units like Paris or New York City. They are used as matching sequences to locate corresponding can- didate entries in the KB, and then to disambiguate those candidates using similarity measures.</p><p>The NED problem is related to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Navigli, 2009)</ref>, and is often more challenging since mentions of NEs can be highly ambiguous. For instance, names of places can be very common as is Paris, which refers to 26 different places in Wikipedia. Hence, systems that attempt to address the NED problem must include disambiguation resources. In the context of the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, such resources can be generic and generative. This generative approach does not ap- ply to the EL task where each entity to be linked to a semantic description has a specific word context, marker of its exact identity.</p><p>One of the classical approach to conduct the disambiguation process in NED applications is to consider the context of the mention to be mapped, and compare this context with contextual informa- tion about the potential target entities (see for in- stance the KIM system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Popov et al., 2003)</ref>). This is usually done using similarity measures (such as cosine similarity, weighted Jaccard distance, KL divergence...) that evaluate the distance between a bag of words related to a candidate annotation, and the words surrounding the entity to annotate in the text.</p><p>In more recent approaches, it is suggested that annotation processes based on similarity distance measures can be improved by making use of other annotations present in the same document. Such techniques are referred to as semantic related- ness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Strube and Ponzetto, 2006</ref>), collective dis- ambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hoffart et al., 2011b</ref>), or joint dis- ambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fahrni et al., 2012</ref>). The idea is to evaluate in a set of candidate links which one is the most likely to be correct by taking the other links contained in the document into account. For example, if a NE describes a city name like Paris, it is more probable that the correct link for this city name designates Paris (France) rather than Paris (Texas) if a neighbor entity offers candidate links semantically related to Paris (France) like the Seine river or the Champs-Elysées. Such tech- niques mostly involve exploration of graphs result- ing of all the candidate annotations proposed for a given document, and try to rank the best candi- dates for each annotation using an ontology. The ontology (like YAGO or DBPedia) provides a pre-existing set of potential relations between the enti- ties to link (like for instance, in our previous exam- ple, Paris (France) has river Seine) that will be used to rank the best candidates according to their mutual presence in the document.</p><p>In this paper we explore the capabilities of a dis- ambiguation algorithm using all the available an- notation layers of NEs to improve their links. The paper makes the following novel propositions: 1) the ontology used to evaluate the relatedness of candidates is replaced by internal links and cate- gories from the Wikipedia corpus; 2) the coher- ence of entities is improved prior to the calcula- tion of semantic relatedness using a co-reference resolution algorithm, and a NE label correction method; 3) the proposed method is robust enough to improve the performance of existing entity link- ing annotation engines, which are capable of pro- viding a set of ranked candidates for each annota- tion in a document.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related works. The proposed method is presented in Section 3 where we explain how our SemLinker system prepares documents that con- tain mentions to disambiguate, then we detail the disambiguation algorithm. The evaluation of the complete system is provided in Section 4. Finally, we discuss the obtained results, and conclude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Entity annotation and linking in natural language text has been extensively studied in NLP research. A strong effort has been conducted recently by the TAC-KBP evaluation task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ji et al., 2010</ref>) to cre- ate standardized corpus, and annotation standards based on Wikipedia for evaluation and comparison of EL systems. In this paper, we consider the TAC- KBP framework. We describe below some recent approaches proposed for solving the EL task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Wikipedia-based Disambiguation Methods</head><p>The use of Wikipedia for explicit disambiguation dates back to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bunescu and Pasca, 2006</ref>) who built a system that compared the context of a mention to the Wikipedia categories of an entity candidate. Lately, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cucerzan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Milne and Witten, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nguyen and Cao, 2008)</ref> extended this framework by using richer features for similarity comparison. Some authors like <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Milne and Witten (2008)</ref> uti- lized machine learning methods rather than a sim- ilarity function to map mentions to entities. They also introduced the notion of semantic relatedness. Alternative propositions were suggested in other works like <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Han and Zhao, 2009</ref>) that considered the relatedness of common noun phrases in a men- tion context with Wikipedia article names. While all these approaches focus on semantic relation be- tween entities, their potential is limited by the sep- arate mapping of candidate links for each mention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Semantic Web Compliant Methods</head><p>More recently, several systems have been launched as web services dedicated to EL tasks. Most of them are compliant with new emergent semantic web standards like LinkedData network. DBPedia Spotlight (Mendes et al., 2011) is a system that finds mentions of <ref type="bibr">DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007</ref>) resources in a textual document. Wikimeta (Charton and Gagnon, 2012) is another system relying on DBpedia. It uses bags of words to disambiguate semantic entities according to a cosine similarity algorithm. Those systems have been compared with commercial ones like AlchemyAPI, Zemanta, or Open Calais in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gangemi, 2013)</ref>. The study showed that they perform differently on various essential aspects of EL tasks (mention detection, linking, disambiguation). This suggests a wide range of potential improvements on many aspects of the EL task. Only some of these systems introduce the semantic relatedness in their methods like the AIDA (Hoffart et al., 2011b) system. It proposes a disambiguation method that combines popularity-based priors, similarity measures, and coherence. It relies on the Wikipedia-derived YAGO2 (Hoffart et al., 2011a) knowledge base.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed Algorithm</head><p>We propose a mutual disambiguation algorithm that improves the accuracy of entity links in a doc- ument by using successive corrections applied to an annotation object representing this document. The annotation object is composed of information extracted from the document along with linguistic and semantic annotations as described hereafter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Annotation Object</head><p>Documents are processed by an annotator capable of producing POS tags for each word, as well as spans, NE surface forms, NE labels and ranked candidate Wikipedia URIs for each candidate NE. For each document D, this knowledge is gathered in an array called annotation object, which has ini- tially one row per document lexical unit. Since the system focuses on NEs, rows with lexical units that do not belong to a NE SF are dropped from the annotation object, and NE SF are refined as de- scribed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Charton et al., 2014</ref>). When NE SF are spanned over several rows, these rows are merged into a single one. Thus, we consider an annotation object A D , which is an array with a row for each NE, and columns storing related knowledge.</p><p>If n NEs were annotated in D, then A D has n rows. If l candidate URIs are provided for each NE, then A D has (l + 4) columns c u,u∈{1,l+4} . Columns c 1 to c l store Wikipedia URIs associated with NEs, ordered by decreasing values of likeli- hood. Column c l+1 stores the offset of the NEs, c l+2 stores their surface forms, c l+3 stores the NE labels (PER, ORG, ...), and c l+4 stores the (vec- tors of) POS tags associated with the NE surface forms. A D contains all the available knowledge about the NEs found in D. Before being processed by the disambiguation module, A D is dynamically updated by correction processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Named Entity Label Correction</head><p>To support the correction process based on co- reference chains, the system tries to correct NE labels for all the NEs listed in the annotation ob- ject. The NE label correction process assigns the same NE label to all the NEs associated with the same first rank URI. For all the rows in A D , sets of rows with identical first rank URIs are considered. Then, for each set, NE labels are counted per type, and all the rows in a same set are updated with the most frequent NE label found in the set, i.e. all the NEs in this set are tagged with this label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Correction Based on Co-reference Chains</head><p>First rank candidate URIs are corrected by a pro- cess that relies on co-reference chains found in the document. The co-reference detection is con- ducted using the information recorded in the anno- tation object. Among the NEs present in the docu- ment, the ones that co-refer are identified and clus- tered by logical rules applied to the content of the annotation object. When a co-reference chain of NEs is detected, the system assigns the same URI to all the members of the chain. This URI is se- lected through a decision process that gives more weight to longer surface forms and frequent URIs. The following example illustrates an application of this correction process: Three sentences are extracted from a document about Paris, the French capital. NEs are indicated in brackets, first rank URIs and surface forms are added below the content of each sentence. - <ref type="bibr">[Paris]</ref> is famous around the world. The three NEs found in these sentences com- pose a co-reference chain. The second NE has a longer surface form than the first one, and its associated first rank URI is the most fre- quent. Hence, the co-reference correction pro- cess will assign the right URI to the first NE (URI1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris), which was wrongly linked to the actress Paris Hilton.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Mutual Disambiguation Process</head><p>The extraction of an accurate link is a process oc- curring after the URI annotation of NEs in the whole document. The system makes use of all the semantic content stored in A D to locally im- prove the precision of each URI annotation in the document. The Mutual Disambiguation Process (MDP) relies on the graph of all the relations (in- ternal links, categories) between Wikipedia con- tent related to the document annotations.</p><p>A basic example of semantic relatedness that should be captured is explained hereafter. Let us consider the mention IBM in a given document. Candidate NE annotations for this mention can be International Business Machine or International Brotherhood of Magicians. But if the IBM men- tion co-occurs with a Thomas Watson, Jr mention in the document, there will probably be more links between the International Business Machine and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages than between the International Brotherhood of Magi- cians and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages. The purpose of the MDP is to capture this semantic relatedness information contained in the graph of links extracted from Wikipedia pages re- lated to each candidate annotation.</p><p>In MDP, for each Wikipedia URI candidate an- notation, all the internal links and categories con- tained in the source Wikipedia document related to this URI are collected. This information will be used to calculate a weight for each of the l can- didate URI annotations of each mention. For a given NE, this weight is expected to measure the mutual relations of a candidate annotation with all the other candidate annotations of NEs in the doc- ument. The input of the MDP is an annotation object A D with n rows, obtained as explained in Section 3.1. For all i ∈ [ <ref type="bibr">[1, n]</ref>], k ∈ [ <ref type="bibr">[1, l]</ref>], we build the set S k i , composed of the Wikipedia URIs and categories contained in the source Wikipedia doc- ument related to the URI stored in A D <ref type="bibr">[i]</ref>[k] that we will refer to as URI k i to ease the reading. Scoring:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">For all i, j ∈ [[1, n]], k ∈ [[1, l]]</formula><p>, we want to cal- culate the weight of mutual relations between the candidate URI k i and all the first rank candidates URI 1 j for j = i. The calculation combines two scores that we called direct semantic relation score (dsr score) and common semantic relation score (csr score):</p><p>-the dsr score for URI k i sums up the number of occurrences of URI k i in S 1 j for all j ∈ [ <ref type="bibr">[1, n]</ref>] − {i}. -the csr score for URI k i sums up the number of common URIs and categories between S k i and S 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">j for all j ∈ [[1, n]] − {i}.</formula><p>We assumed the dsr score was much more semantically significant than the csr score, and translated this assumption in the weight calcula- tion by introducing two correction parameters α and β used in the final scoring calculation. Re-ranking: <ref type="bibr">[1, l]</ref>]}, the re-ranking process is conducted ac- cording to the following steps: For all i ∈ I,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">For all i ∈ [[1, n]], for each set of URIs {URI k i , k ∈ [</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">1. ∀k ∈ [[1, l]], calculate dsr score(URI k i ) 2. ∀k ∈ [[1, l]], calculate csr score(URI k i ) 3. ∀k ∈ [[1, l]], calculate mutual relation score(URI k i ) = α.dsr score(URI k i )+β.csr score(URI k i ) 4. re-order {URI k i , k ∈ [[1, l]</formula><p>]}, by decreasing order of mutual relation score.</p><p>In the following, we detail the MDP in the con- text of a toy example to illustrate how it works. The document contains two sentences, NE men- tions are in bold:</p><p>IBM has 12 research laboratories worldwide. Thomas J. Watson, Jr.</p><p>became president of the company.</p><p>For the first NE mention <ref type="bibr">[IBM]</ref> The candidate URIs for <ref type="bibr">[IBM]</ref> are re-ranked accordingly, and International Business Machines Corporation becomes its first rank candidate.</p></div>

Given a query that consists of a document with a specified name mention of an entity, the task is to determine the correct node in the reference KB for the entity, adding a new node for the entity if it is not already in the reference KB. Entities can be of type person (PER), organization (ORG), or geopolitical entity (GPE). The reference knowledge base is derived from an October 2008 dump of English Wikipedia, which includes 818,741 nodes.  A complete description of these linguistic re- sources can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ellis et al., 2011</ref>). For the sake of reproducibility, we applied the KBP scoring metric (B 3 + F ) described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(TAC-KBP, 2012)</ref>, and we used the KBP scorer 1 .</p><p>The evaluated system makes use of the Wikimeta annotation engine. The maximum num- ber of candidate URIs is l = 15. The MDP correc- tion parameters α and β described in Section 3.4 have been experimentally set to α = 10, β = 2. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the results obtained by the sys- tem in three configurations. In the first column, the system is evaluated without the disambigua- tion module. In the second column, we applied the MDP without correction processes. The sys- tem with the complete disambiguation module ob- tained the results provided in the third column. The three best results and the median from TAC- KBP 2012 systems are shown in the remaining columns for the sake of comparison.</p><p>We observe that the complete algorithm (co- references, named entity labels and MDP) pro- vides the best results on PER NE links. On GPE and ORG entities, the simple application of MDP without prior corrections obtains the best results. A slight loss of accuracy is observed on ORG NEs when the MDP is applied with corrections. For those three categories of entities, we show that the complete system improves the performance of a simple algorithm using distance measures. Results on categories News and Web show that the best performance on the whole KBP corpus (without distinction of NE categories) is obtained with the complete algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>The presented system provides a robust seman- tic disambiguation method, based on mutual re- lation of entities inside a document, using a stan- dard annotation engine. It uses co-reference, NE normalization methods, and Wikipedia internal links as mutual disambiguation resource to im- prove the annotations. We show that our propo- sition improves the performance of a standard an- notation engine applied to the TAC-KBP evalua- tion framework. SemLinker is fully implemented, and publicly released as an open source toolkit (http://code.google.com/p/semlinker).</p><p>It has been deployed in the TAC-KBP 2013 evalu- ation campaign. Our future work will integrate other annotation engines in the system architecture in a collaborative approach.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>URI1 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris Hilton</head><label>URI1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>NE surface form: Paris
