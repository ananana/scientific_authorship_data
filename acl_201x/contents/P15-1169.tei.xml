			<abstract>
				<p>Social media content can be used as a complementary source to the traditional methods for extracting and studying collective social attributes. This study focuses on the prediction of the occupational class for a public user profile. Our analysis is conducted on a new annotated corpus of Twitter users, their respective job titles, posted textual content and platform-related attributes. We frame our task as classification using latent feature representations such as word clusters and embeddings. The employed linear and, especially, non-linear methods can predict a user&apos;s occupational class with strong accuracy for the coarsest level of a standard occupation taxon-omy which includes nine classes. Combined with a qualitative assessment, the derived results confirm the feasibility of our approach in inferring a new user attribute that can be embedded in a multitude of downstream applications.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The growth of online social networks provides the opportunity to analyse user text in a broader context <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tumasjan et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lampos and Cristianini, 2012)</ref>. This includes the social network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sadilek et al., 2012)</ref>, spatio-temporal in- formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lampos and Cristianini, 2010)</ref> and per- sonal attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al Zamal et al., 2012)</ref>. Previous research has analysed language differences in user attributes like location ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cheng et al., 2010</ref>), gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burger et al., 2011</ref>), impact ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lampos et al., 2014</ref>) and age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rao et al., 2010)</ref>, showing that language use is influenced by them. Therefore, user text al- lows us to infer these properties. This user profiling is important not only for sociolinguistic studies, but also for other applications: recommender systems to provide targeted advertising, analysts who study different opinions in each social class or integra- tion in text regression tasks such as voting intention ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lampos et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Social status reflected through a person's occu- pation is a factor which influences language use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bernstein, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bernstein, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Labov, 2006</ref>). Therefore, our hypothesis is that language use in social media can be indicative of a user's occu- pational class. For example, executives may write more frequently about business or financial news, while people in manufacturing positions could re- fer more to their personal interests and less to job related activities. Similarly, we expect some cate- gories of people, like those working in sales and customer services, to be more social or to use more informal language.</p><p>Focusing on the microblogging platform of Twit- ter, we explore our hypothesis by studying the task of predicting a user's occupational class given platform-related attributes and generated content, i.e. tweets. That has direct applicability in a broad range of areas from sociological studies, which analyse the behaviour of different occupations, to recruiting companies that target people for new job opportunities. For this study, we created a publicly available data set of users, including their profile information and historical text content as well as a label to an occupational class from the "Stan- dard Occupational Classification" taxonomy (see Section 2).</p><p>We frame our task as classification, aiming to identify the most likely job class for a given user based on profile and a variety of textual features: general word embeddings and clusters (or 'topics'). Both linear and non-linear classification methods are applied with a focus on those that can assist in- terpretation and offer qualitative insights. We find that text features, especially word clusters, lead to good predictive performance. Accuracy for our best model is well above 50% for 9-way classifi-cation, outperforming competitive methods. The best results are obtained using the Bayesian non- parametric framework of Gaussian Processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rasmussen and Williams, 2006</ref>), which also accom- modates feature interpretation via the Automatic Relevance Determination. This allows us to get in- sight into differences in language use across job classes and, finally, assess our original hypothesis about the thematic divergence across them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Standard Occupational Classification</head><p>To enable the user occupation study, we adopt a standardised job classification taxonomy for map- ping Twitter users to occupations. The Standard Oc- cupational Classification (SOC) 1 is a UK govern- ment system developed by the Office of National Statistics for classifying occupations. Jobs are cate- gorised hierarchically based on skill requirements and content. The SOC scheme includes nine major groups coded with a digit from 1 to 9. Each ma- jor group is divided into sub-major groups coded with 2 digits, where the first digit indicates the ma- jor group. Each sub-major group is further divided into minor groups coded with 3 digits and finally, minor groups are divided into unit groups, coded with 4 digits. The unit groups are the leaves of the hierarchy and represent specific jobs related to the group. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows a part of the SOC hierarchy. In to- tal, there are 9 major groups, 25 sub-major groups, 90 minor groups and 369 unit groups. Although other hierarchies exist, we use the SOC because it has been published recently (in 2010), includes newly introduced jobs, has a balanced hierarchy and offers a wide variety of job titles that were crucial in our data set creation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>To the best of our knowledge there are no pub- licly available data sets suitable for the task we aim to investigate. Thus, we have created a new one consisting of Twitter users mapped to their oc- cupation, together with their profile information and historical tweets. We use the account's profile information to capture users with self-disclosed occupations. The potential self-selection bias is ac- knowledged, but filtering content via self disclosure 1 http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/ guide-method/classifications/ current-standard-classifications/ soc2010/index.html; accessed on 24/02/2015.</p></div>

Similarly to Hecht et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2011)</ref>, we first assess the proportion of Twitter accounts with a clear men- tion to their occupation by annotating the user de- scription field of a random set of 500 users. There were chosen from the random 1% sample, having at least 200 tweets in their history and with a majority of English tweets. There, we can identify the fol- lowing categories: no description (12.2%), random information (22%), user information but not occu- pation related (45.8%), and job related information (20%).</p><p>To create our data set, we thus use the user de- scription field to search for self-disclosed job titles provided by the 4-digit SOC unit groups, since they contain specific job titles. We queried Twit- ter's Search API to retrieve for each job title a max- imum of 200 accounts which best matched occupa- tion keywords. Then, we aggregated the accounts into the 3-digit (minor) categories. To remove po- tential ambiguity in the retrieved set, we manually inspected accounts in each minor category and fil- tered out those that belong to companies, contain no description or the description provided does not indicate that the user has a job corresponding to the minor category. In total, around 50% of the accounts were removed by manual inspection per-formed by the authors. We also removed users in multiple categories and or users that have tweeted less than 50 times in their history. Finally, we elim- inated all 3-digit categories that contained less than 45 user accounts after this filtering. This process produced a total number of 5,191 users from 55 mi- nor groups (22 sub-major groups), spread across all nine major SOC groups. The distribution of users across these nine groups is: 9.7%, 34.5%, 20.6%, 3.8%, 16.7%, 6.1%, 1.4%, 4.2%, and 3% (follow- ing the ordering of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In our data set the most well represented minor occupational groups are 'Functional Managers and Directors' (184 users -code 113), 'Therapy Professionals' (159 users - code 222) and 'Quality and Regulatory Profession- als' (158 users -code 246), whereas the least rep- resented ones are 'Textile and Garment Trades' (45 users -code 541), 'Elementary Security Occupa- tions' (46 users -code 924), 'Elementary Cleaning Occupations' (47 users -code 923). The mean num- ber of users in the minor classes is equal to 94.4 with a standard deviation of 35.6. For these users, we have collected all their tweets, going as far back as the latest 3,200, and their profile information. The final data set consists of 10,796,836 tweets col- lected around 5 August 2014 and is openly avail- able. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> A separate Twitter data set is used as a reference corpus in order to build the feature representations detailed in Section 4. This data set is an extract from the Twitter Gardenhose stream (a 10% repre- sentative sample of the entire Twitter stream) from 2 January to 28 February 2011. Based on this con- tent, we also build the vocabulary for the text fea- tures, containing the most frequent 71,555 words. We tokenise and filter for English using the Trend- miner preprocessing pipeline (Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc-Pietro et al., 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Features</head><p>In this section, we overview the features used in the occupational class prediction task. They are divided into two types: (1) user level features, (2) textual features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">User Level Features (UserLevel)</head><p>The user level features are based on the general user information or aggregated statistics about the tweets. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> introduces the 18 features in this number of followers u2 number of friends u3 number of times listed u4</p><p>follower/friend ratio u5</p><p>proportion of non-duplicate tweets u6</p><p>proportion of retweeted tweets u7 average no. of retweets/tweet u8</p><p>proportion of retweets done u9</p><p>proportion of hashtags u10</p><p>proportion of tweets with hashtags u11 proportion of tweets with @-mentions u12</p><p>proportion of @-replies u13</p><p>no. of unique @-mentions in tweets u14</p><p>proportion of tweets with links u15</p><p>no. of favourites the account made u16</p><p>avg. number of tweets/day u17 total number of tweets u18</p><p>proportion of tweets in English <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: User level attributes for a Twitter user.</p><p>category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Textual Features</head><p>The textual features are derived from the aggre- gated set of user's tweets. We use our reference corpus to represent each user as a distribution over these features. We ignore the bio field from build- ing textual features to avoid introducing biases from our data collection method. While this is a re- striction, our analysis showed that in less than 20% of the cases the information in the bio is directly relevant to the occupation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">SVD Word Embeddings (SVD-E)</head><p>We use a more abstract representation of words than simple unigram counts in order to aid inter- pretability of our analysis. We compute a word to word similarity matrix from our reference cor- pus. Normalised Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bouma, 2009</ref>) is used to compute word to word similarity. NPMI is an information theoretic measure indicating which words co-occur in the same context, where the context is represented by a whole tweet:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">NPMI(x, y) = − log P(x, y) · log P(x, y) P(x) · P(y) .</formula><p>(1) We then perform singular value decomposition (SVD) on the word to word similarity matrix and obtain an embedding of words into a low dimen- sional space. In our experiments we tried the fol- lowing dimensionalities: 30, 50, 100 and 200. The feature representation for each user is obtained summing over each of the embedding dimensions across all words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">NPMI Clusters (SVD-C)</head><p>We use the NPMI matrix described in the previous paragraph to create hard clusters of words. These clusters can be thought as 'topics', i.e. words that are semantically similar. From a variety of cluster- ing techniques we choose spectral clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shi and Malik, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ng et al., 2002</ref>), a hard-clustering approach which deals well with high-dimensional and non-convex data <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(von Luxburg, 2007)</ref>. Spectral clustering is based on applying SVD to the graph Laplacian and aims to perform an optimal graph partitioning on the NPMI similarity matrix. The number of clusters needs to be pre-specified. We use 30, 50, 100 and 200 clusters -numbers were chosen a priori based on previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lampos et al., 2014</ref>). The feature representation is the stan- dardised number of words from each cluster.</p><p>Although there is a loss of information compared to the original representation, the clusters are very useful in the model analysis step. Embeddings are hard to interpret because each dimension is an ab- stract notion, while the clusters can be interpreted by presenting a list of the most frequent or repre- sentative words. The latter are identified using the following centrality metric:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C w = x∈c NPMI(w, x) |c| − 1 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where c denotes the cluster and w the target word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Neural Embeddings (W2V-E)</head><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in neu- ral language models, where the words are projected into a lower dimensional dense vector space via a hidden layer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>). These models showed they can provide a better representation of words compared to traditional language models (Mikolov et al., 2013c) because they capture syntac- tic information rather than just bag-of-context, han- dling non-linear transformations. In this low dimen- sional vector space, words with a small distance are considered semantically similar. We use the skip- gram model with negative sampling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mikolov et al., 2013a</ref>) to learn word embeddings on the Twitter reference corpus. In that case, the skip-gram model is factorising a word-context PMI matrix ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Levy and Goldberg, 2014</ref>). We use a layer size of 50 and the Gensim implementation. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Neural Clusters (W2V-C)</head><p>Similar to the NPMI cluster, we use the neural embeddings in order to obtain clusters of related words, i.e. 'topics'. We derive a word to word simi- larity matrix using cosine similarity on the neural embeddings. We apply spectral clustering on this matrix to obtain 30, 50, 100 and 200 word clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Classification with Gaussian Processes</head><p>In this section, we briefly overview Gaussian Pro- cess (GP) for classification, highlighting our mo- tivation for using this method. GPs formulate a Bayesian non-parametric machine learning frame- work which defines a prior on functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rasmussen and Williams, 2006</ref>). The properties of the functions are given by a kernel which models the covariance in the response values as a function of its inputs. Although GPs form a powerful learn- ing tool, they have only recently been used in NLP research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cohn and Specia, 2013;</ref>) with classification applications limited to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Polajnar et al., 2011</ref>). Formally, GP methods aim to learn a function f : R d → R drawn from a GP prior given the inputs x x x ∈ R d :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (x x x) ∼ GP(m(x x x), k(x x x, x x x )) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where m(·) is the mean function (here 0) and k(·, ·) is the covariance kernel. Usually, the Squared Ex- ponential (SE) kernel (a.k.a. RBF or Gaussian) is used to encourage smooth functions. For the multi- dimensional pair of inputs (x x x, x x x ), this is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">k ard (x x x, x x x ) = σ 2 exp d i − (x i − x i ) 2 2l 2 i ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where l i are lengthscale parameters learnt only using training data by performing gradient as- cent on the type-II marginal likelihood. Intuitively, the lengthscale parameter l i controls the variation along the i input dimension, i.e. a low value makes the output very sensitive to input data, thus mak- ing that input more useful for the prediction. If the lengthscales are learnt separately for each input dimension the kernel is named SE with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Neal, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Binary classification using GPs 'squashes' the real valued latent function f (x) output through a logistic function: π(x x x) P(y = 1|x x x) = σ(f <ref type="figure">(x x x)</ref>) in a similar way to logistic regression classification. The object of the GP inference is the distribution of the latent variable corresponding to a test case x * :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P(f * |x x x, y y y, x * ) = P(f * |x x x, x * , f )P(f |x x x, y y y)df ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where P(f |x x x, y y y) = P(y y y|f )P(f |x x x)/P(y y y|x x x) is the posterior over the latent variables. If the likelihood P(y y y|f ) is Gaussian, the combination with a GP prior P(f |x x x) gives a posterior GP over functions. In binary classification, the distribution over the latent f * is combined with the logistic function to produce the prediction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">¯ π * = σ(f * )P(f * |x x x, y y y, x * )df * .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This results in a non-Gaussian likelihood in the posterior formulation and therefore, exact infer- ence is infeasible for classification models. Multi- ple approximations exist that make the computa- tion tractable <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gibbs and Mackay, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Williams and Barber, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Neal, 1999</ref>). In our experiments we opt to use the Expectation Propagation (EP) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Minka, 2001</ref>) which approximates the non- Gaussian joint posterior with a Gaussian one. EP offers very good empirical results for many differ- ent likelihoods, although it has no proof of con- vergence. The complexity for the inference step is O(n 3 ). Given that our data set is very large and the number of features is high, we conduct inference using the fully independent training conditional (FITC) approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006</ref>) with 500 random inducing points. We refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rasmussen and Williams (2006)</ref> for further information on GP classification. Although we could use multi-class classification methods, in order to provide insight, we perform a separate one-vs-all classification for each class and then determine a label through the occupational class that has the highest likelihood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>This section presents the experimental results for our task. We first compare the accuracy of our clas- sification methods on held out data using each fea- ture set and conduct a standard error analysis. We then use the interpretability of the ARD length- scales from the GP classifier to further analyse the relevant features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Predictive Accuracy</head><p>We assign users to one of nine possible classes (see the 'Major Groups' on <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) using one set of    <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Vapnik, 1998)</ref>. The accuracy of our classifiers is measured on held-out data. Our data set is divided into stratified training (80%), validation (10%) and testing (10%) sets. The val- idation set was used to learn the LR and SVM hyperparameters, while the GP did not use this set at all. We report results using all three methods and all feature sets in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>We first observe that user level features (User- Level; see Section 4.1) are not useful for predicting the job class. This finding indicates that general so- cial behaviour or user impact are likely to be spread evenly across classes. It also highlights the diffi- culty of the task and motivates the use of deeper textual features.</p><p>The textual features (see Section 4.2) improve performance as compared to the most frequent class baseline. We also notice that the embeddings (SVD- E and W2V-E) have lower performance than the clusters (SVD-C and W2V-C) in most of the cases. This is expected, as adding word vectors to rep- resent a user's text may overemphasise common words. The size of the embedding also increases performance. The W2V features show better ac-</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Rank Topic # Label</formula><p>Topic (most central words; most frequent words) MRR µ(l) 1 116 Arts archival, stencil, canvas, minimalist, illustration, paintings, abstract, designs, lettering, steampunk; art, design, print, collection, poster, painting, custom, logo, printing, drawing .43   curacy than the SVD on the NPMI matrix. This is consistent with previous work that showed the efficiency of word2vec and the ability of those em- beddings to capture non-linear relationships and syntactic features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mikolov et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mikolov et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mikolov et al., 2013c</ref>). LR has a lower performance than the non-linear methods, especially when using clusters as features. GPs usually outperform SVMs by a small margin. However, these offer the advantages of not using the validation set and the interpretability properties we highlight in the next section. Although we only draw our focus on major occupational classes, the data set allows the study of finer granularities of oc- cupation classes in future work. For example, pre- diction performance for sub-major groups reaches 33.9% accuracy (15.6% majority class, 22 classes) and 29.2% accuracy for minor groups (3.4% major- ity class, 55 classes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Error Analysis</head><p>To illustrate the errors made by our classifiers, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 1</ref> shows the confusion matrix of the classi- fication results. First, we observe that class 4 is many times classified as class 2 or 3. This can be explained by the fact that classes 2, 3 and 4 con- tain similar types of occupations, e.g. doctors and nurses or accountants and assistant accountants. However, with very few exceptions, we notice that only adjacent classes get misclassified, suggesting that our model captures the general user skill level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Qualitative Analysis</head><p>The word clusters that were built from a reference corpus and then used as features in the GP classi- fier, give us the opportunity to extract some qual- itative derivations from our predictive task. For the rest of the section we use the best performing model of this type (W2V-C-200) in order to anal- yse the results. Our main assumption is that there might be a divergence of language and topic us- age across occupational classes following previous studies in sociology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bernstein, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bernstein, 2003)</ref>. Knowing that the inferred GP lengthscale hyperparameters are inversely proportional to fea- ture (i.e. topic) relevance (see Section 5), we can use them to rank the topic importance and give answers to our hypothesis. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows 10 of the most informative top- ics (represented by the top 10 most central and frequent words) sorted by their ARD lengthscale Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Manning et al., 2008</ref>) across the nine classifiers. Evidently, they cover a broad range of thematic subjects, includ- ing potentially work specific topics in different do- mains such as 'Corporate' (Topic #124), 'Software Engineering' (#158), 'Health' (#105), 'Higher Ed- ucation' (#21) and 'Arts' (#116), as well as topics covering recreational interests such as 'Football' (#186), 'Cooking' (#96) and 'Beauty Care' (#153).</p><p>The highest ranked MRR GP lengthscales only highlight the topics that are the most discrimina- tive of the particular learning task, i.e. which topic used alone would have had the best performance. To examine the difference in topic usage across occupations, we illustrate how six topics are cov- ered by the users of each class. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) across the nine different occupational classes for these six topics. CDFs indicate the fraction of users having at least a certain topic proportion in their tweets. A topic is more prevalent in a class, if the CDF line leans towards the bottom-right corner of the plot.</p><p>'Higher Education' (#21) is more prevalent in classes 1 and 2, but is also discriminative for classes 3 and 4 compared to the rest. This is expected be- cause the vast majority of jobs in these classes require a university degree (holds for all of the jobs in classes 2 and 3) or are actually jobs in higher education. On the other hand, classes 5 to 9 have a similar behaviour, tweeting less on this topic. We also observe that words in 'Corporate' (#124) are used more as the skill required for a job gets higher. This topic is mainly used by people in classes 1 and 2 and with less extent in classes 3 and 4, in- dicating that people in these occupational classes are more likely to use social media for discussions about corporate business.</p><p>There is a clear trend of people with more skilled jobs to talk about 'Politics' (#176). Indeed, highly ranked politicians and political philosophers are parts of classes 1 and 2 respectively. Neverthe- less, this pattern expands to the entire spectrum of the investigated occupational classes, providing further proof-of-concept for our methodology, un- der the assumption that the theme of politics is more attractive to the higher skilled classes rather than the lower skilled occupations. By examining 'Arts' (#116), we see that it clearly separates class 5, which includes artists, from all others. This topic appears to be relevant to most of the classifica- tion tasks and it is ranked first according to the MRR metric. Moreover, we observe that people with higher skilled jobs and education (classes 1-3) post more content about arts. Finally, we examine two topics containing words that can be used in more informal occasions, i.e. 'Elongated Words' (#164) and 'Beauty Care' (#153). We observe a similar pattern in both topics by which users with lower skilled jobs tweet more often. The main conclusion we draw from <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> is that there exists a topic divergence between users in the lower vs. higher skilled occupational classes. To examine this distinction better, we use the Jensen- Shannon divergence (JSD) to quantify the differ- ence between the topic distributions across every  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: CDFs for six of the most important topics; the x-axis is on the log-scale for display purposes. A point on a CDF line indicates the fraction of users (y-axis point) with a topic proportion in their tweets lower or equal to the corresponding x-axis point. The topic is more prevalent in a class, if the CDF line leans closer to the bottom-right corner of the plot. class pair. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> visualises these differences. There, we confirm that adjacent classes use simi- lar topics of discussion. We also notice that JSD increases as the classes are further apart. Two main groups of related classes, with a clear separation from the rest, are identified: classes 1-2 and 6-9. For the users belonging to these two groups, we compute their topic usage distribution (for the top topics listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>). Then, we assess whether the topic usage distributions of those super-classes of occupations have a statistically significant dif- ference by performing a two-sample Kolmogorov- Smirnov test. We enumerate the group topic usage means in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>; all differences were indeed sta- tistically significant (p &lt; 10 −5 ). From this compar- ison, we conclude that users in the higher skilled classes have a higher representation in all top topics but 'Beauty Care' and 'Elongated Words'. Hence, the original hypothesis about the difference in the usage of language between upper and lower occu- pational classes is reconfirmed in this more generic testing. A very noticeable difference occurs for the  'Corporate' topic, whereas 'Football' registers the lowest distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Occupational class prediction has been studied in the past in the areas of psychology and economics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">French (1959)</ref> investigated the relation between var- ious measures on 232 undergraduate students and their future occupations. This study concluded that occupational membership can be predicted from variables such as the ability of subjects in using mathematical and verbal symbols, their family eco- nomic status, body-build and personality compo- nents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schmidt and Strauss (1975)</ref> also studied the relationship between job types (five classes) and certain demographic attributes (gender, race, expe- rience, education, location). Their analysis identi- fied biases or discrimination which possibly exist in different types of jobs. Sociolinguistic and so- ciology studies deduct that social status is an im- portant factor in determining the use of language <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bernstein, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bernstein, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Labov, 2006</ref>). Differences arise either due to language use or due to the topics people discuss as parts of various so- cial domains. However, a large scale investigation of this hypothesis has never been attempted. Relevant to our task is a relation extraction ap- proach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li et al. (2014)</ref> aiming to ex- tract user profile information on Twitter. They used a weakly supervised approach to obtain informa- tion for job, education and spouse. Nonetheless, the information relevant to the job attribute re- gards the employer of a user (i.e. the name of a company) rather than the type of occupation. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al. (2014)</ref> proposed a method to classify Sina Weibo users to twelve predefined occupations using content based and network fea- tures. However, there exist significant differences from our task since this inference is based on a dis- tinct platform, with an ambiguous distribution over occupations (e.g. more than 25% related to me- dia), while the occupational classes are not generic (e.g. media, welfare and electronic are three of the twelve categories). Most importantly, the applied model did not allow for a qualitative interpreta- tion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filho et al. (2014)</ref> inferred the social class of social media users by combining geolocation infor- mation derived from Foursquare and Twitter posts. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sloan et al. (2015)</ref> introduced tools for the automated extraction of demographic data (age, occupation and social class) from the profile de- scriptions of Twitter users using a similar method to our data set extraction approach. They showed that it is feasible to build a data set that matches the real-world UK occupation distribution as given by the SOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>Our paper presents the first large-scale systematic study on language use on social media as a factor for inferring a user's occupational class. To address this problem, we have also introduced an exten- sive labelled data set extracted from Twitter. We have framed prediction as a classification task and, to this end, we used the powerful, non-linear GP framework that combines strong predictive perfor- mance with feature interpretability. Results show that we can achieve a good predictive accuracy, highlighting that the occupation of a user influences text use. Through a qualitative analysis, we have shown that the derived topics capture both occupa- tion specific interests as well as general class-based behaviours. We acknowledge that the derivations of this study, similarly to other studies in the field, are reflecting the Twitter population and may expe- rience a bias introduced by users self-mentioning their occupations. However, the magnitude, occupa- tional diversity and face validity of our conclusions suggest that the presented approach is useful for future downstream applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Feature</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
