				<p>Building multi-turn information-seeking conversation systems is an important and challenging research topic. Although several advanced neural text matching models have been proposed for this task, they are generally not efficient for industrial applications. Furthermore, they rely on a large amount of labeled data, which may not be available in real-world applications. To alleviate these problems, we study transfer learning for multi-turn information seeking conversations in this paper. We first propose an efficient and effective multi-turn conversation model based on convo-lutional neural networks. After that, we extend our model to adapt the knowledge learned from a resource-rich domain to enhance the performance. Finally, we deployed our model in an industrial chatbot called AliMe Assist 1 and observed a significant improvement over the existing on-line model.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the popularity of online shopping, there is an increasing number of customers seeking infor- mation regarding their concerned items. To effi- ciently handle customer questions, a common ap- proach is to build a conversational customer ser- vice system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yang et al., 2018</ref>).</p><p>In the E-commerce environment, the information- seeking conversation system can serve millions of customer questions per day. According to the statistics from a real e-commerce website ( , the majority of customer questions (nearly 90%) are business-related or seeking infor- mation about logistics, coupons etc. Among these conversation sessions, 75% of them are more than one turn 2 . Hence it is important to handle multi- turn conversations or context information in these conversation systems.</p><p>Recent researches in this area have focused on deep learning and reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Shang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2016a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sordoni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wu et al., 2017)</ref>. One of these methods is Sequential Matching Net- work( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wu et al., 2017)</ref>, which matches a response with each utterance in the context at multiple lev- els of granularity and leads to state-of-the-art per- formance on two multi-turn conversation corpora. However, such methods suffer from at least two problems: they may not be efficient enough for industrial applications, and they rely on a large amount of labeled data which may not be available in reality.</p><p>To address the problem of efficiency, we made three major modifications to SMN to boost the efficiency of the model while preserving its ef- fectiveness. First, we remove the RNN layers of inputs from the model; Second, SMN uses a Sentence Interaction based (SI-based) Pyramid model ( ) to model each utterance and response pair. In practice, a Sentence Encod- ing based (SE-based) model like BCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Yin and Schütze, 2015</ref>) is complementary to the SI-based model. Therefore, we extend the component to in- corporate an SE-based BCNN model, resulting in a hybrid CNN (hCNN) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yu et al., 2017)</ref>; Third, instead of using a RNN to model the output rep- resentations, we consider a CNN model followed by a fully-connected layer to further boost the ef- ficiency of our model. As shown in our experi- ments, our final model yields comparable results but with higher efficiency than SMN.</p><p>To address the second problem of insufficient labeled data, we study transfer learning (TL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pan and Yang, 2010)</ref> to utilize a source domain with adequate labeling to help the target domain. A typical TL approach is to use a shared NN ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yang et al., 2017)</ref> and domain-specific NNs to derive shared and domain-specific features respectively. Recent studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ganin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Taigman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017)</ref> consider adversarial networks to learn more robust shared features across domains. Inspired by these studies, we extended our method with a Transfer Learning module to leverage information from a resource-rich domain. Similarly, our TL module consists of a shared NN and two domain- specific NNs for source and target domains. The output of the shared NN is further linked to an adversarial network as used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017)</ref> to help learn domain invariant features. Mean- while, we also use domain discriminators on both source and target features derived by domain- specific NNs to help learn domain-specific fea- tures. Experiments show that our TL method can further improve the model performance on a target domain with limited data.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study transfer learning for context-aware question matching in conversations. Experiments on both benchmark and commercial data sets show that our proposed model outperforms several base- lines including the state-of-the-art SMN model. We have also deployed our model in an industrial bot called AliMe Assist <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and observed a signifi- cant improvement over the existing online model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>Our model is designed to address the following general problem. Given an input sequence of utter- ances {u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u n } and a candidate question r, our task is to identify the matching degree between the utterances and the question. When the num- ber of utterances is one, our problem is identical to paraphrase identification (PI) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yin and Schütze, 2015)</ref> or natural language inference (NLI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bowman et al., 2015</ref>). Furthermore, we consider a transfer learning setting to transfer knowledge from a source domain to help a target domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Multi-Turn hCNN (MT-hCNN)</head><p>We present an overview of our model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. In a nutshell, our model first obtains a representation for each utterance and candidate question pair us- ing hybrid CNN (hCNN), then concatenates all the representations, and feeds them into a CNN and fully-connected layer to obtain our final output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Max$pooling</head><p>Convolu.on </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h 1 = CNN 1 (X 1 ); h 2 = CNN 1 (X 2 ). H b = h 1 ⊕ h 2 ⊕ (h 1 − h 2 ) ⊕ (h 1 · h 2 ).</formula><p>where '−' and '·' refer to element-wise subtrac- tion and multiplication, and '⊕' refers to concate- nation.</p><p>Furthermore, we add a SI-base Pyramid compo- nent to the model, we first produce an interaction matrix M ∈ R m×m , where M i,j denotes the dot- product score between the i th word in X 1 and the j th word in X 2 . Next, we stack two 2-D convolu- tional layers and two 2-D max-pooling layers on it to obtain the hidden representation H p . Finally, we concatenate the hidden representations as out- put for each input sentence pair:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Z X 1 ,X 2 = hCNN(X 1 , X 2 ) = H b ⊕ H p .</formula><p>We now extend hCNN to handle multi-turn conversations, resulting MT-hCNN model. Let {u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , . . . , u n } be the utterances, r is the candidate question.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h u i ,r = hCNN(u i , r). f or i ∈ [1, n] H = [h u 1 ,r ; h u 2 ,r ; · · · ; h un,r ]. P = CNN 3 (H). O = Fully-Connected(P )</formula><p>Note that H is obtained by stacking all the h, CNN 3 is another CNN with a 2-D convolutional layer and a 2-D max-pooling layer, the output of CNN 3 is feed into a fully-connected layer to ob- tain the final representation O.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Transfer with Domain Discriminators</head><p>We further study transfer learning (TL) to learn knowledge from a source-rich domain to help our target domain, in order to reduce the dependency on a large scale labeled training data. As sim- ilar to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017)</ref>, we use a shared MT- hCNN and two domain-specific MT-hCNNs to de- rive shared features O c and domain-specific fea- tures O s and O t . The domain specific output lay- ers are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ˆ y k = σ(W sc O c + W s O s + b s ), if k = s σ(W tc O c + W t O t + b t ), if k = t<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where W sc , W tc , W s , and W t are the weights for shared-source, shared-target, source, and tar- get domains respectively, while b s and b t are the biases for source and target domains respectively. Following ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017)</ref>, we use an adver- sarial loss L a to encourage the shared features learned to be indiscriminate across two domains:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L a = 1 n n i=1 d∈s,t p(d i = d|U, r) log p(d i = d|U, r).</formula><p>where d i is the domain label and p(d i |·) is the do- main probability from a domain discriminator. Differently, to encourage the specific feature space to be discriminable between different do- mains, we consider applying domain discrimina- tion losses on the two specific feature spaces. We further add two negative cross-entropy losses: L s for source and L t for target domain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L s = − 1 n s ns i=1 I d i =s log p(d i = s|U s , r s )</formula><p>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L t = − 1 n t nt i=1 I d i =t log p(d i = t|U t , r t ).</formula><p>where I d i =d is an indicator function set to 1 when the statement (d i = d) holds, or 0 otherwise. Finally, we obtain a combined loss as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L = k∈s,t − 1 n k n k j=1 1 2 (y k j − ˆ y k j ) 2 + λ 1 2 L a + λ 2 2 L s + λ 3 2 L t + λ 4 2 ||Θ|| 2 F .</formula><p>where Θ denotes model parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our base model, the transferability of the model, and the online evaluation in an industrial chatbot.  , in which numbers, urls and paths are replaced by special placeholders. It is also used in several previous re- lated works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wu et al., 2017)</ref>. It consists of 1 mil- lion context-response pairs for training, 0.5 mil- lion pairs for validation and 0.5 million pairs for testing.</p><p>AliMe Data: We collect the chat logs between customers and a chatbot called AliMe from "2017- 10-01" to "2017-10-20" in Alibaba <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . The chatbot is built based on a question-to-question matching system ( , where for each query, it finds the most similar candidate question in a QA database and return its answer as the reply. It in- dexes all the questions in our QA database using Lucence <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . For each given query, it uses TF-IDF ranking algorithm to call back candidates. To form our data set, we concatenated utterances within three turns <ref type="bibr">6</ref> to form a query, and used the chat- bot system to call back top 15 most similar candi- date questions as candidate "responses". <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We then asked a business analyst to annotate the candidate responses, where a "response" is labeled as pos- itive if it matches the query, otherwise negative. In all, we have annotated 63,000 context-response pairs. This dataset is used as our Target data. Furthermore, we build our Source data as fol- lows. In the AliMe chatbot, if the confidence score of answering a given user query is low, i.e. the matching score is below a given threshold 8 , we prompt top three related questions for users to choose. We collected the user click logs as our source data, where we treat the clicked question as positive and the others as negative. We collected 510,000 query-question pairs from the click logs in total as the source. For the source and target datasets, we use 80% for training, 10% for valida- tion, and 10% for testing. Compared Methods: We compared our multi- turn model (MT-hCNN) with two CNN based models ARC-I and ARC-II ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hu et al., 2014)</ref>, and several advanced neural matching models: MV- LSTM (  Settings: We use the same parameter settings of hCNN in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yu et al., 2017</ref>). For the CNN 3 in our model, we set window size of convolution layer as 2, ReLU as the activation function, and the stride <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Around 85% of conversations are within 3 turns. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> A "response" here is a question in our system. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The threshold is determined by a business analyst <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The results are based on the TensorFlow code from au- thors, and with no over sampling of negative training data.</p><p>of max-pooling layer as 2. The hidden node size of the Fully-Connected layer is set as 128. AdaDelta is used to train our model with an initial learning rate of 0.08. We use MAP, Recall@5, Recall@2, and Recall@1 as evaluation metrics. We set λ 1 = λ 2 = λ 3 = 0.05, and λ 4 = 0.005.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Comparison on Base Models</head><p>The comparisons on base models are shown in Ta- ble 1. First, the RNN based methods like MV- LSTM and SMN have clear advantages over the two CNN-based approaches like ARC-I and ARC- II, and are better or comparable with the state-of- the-art CNN-based models like Pyramid and Duet; Second, our MT-hCNN outperforms MT-hCNN- d, which shows the benefits of adding a convolu- tional layer to the output representations of all the utterances; Third, we find SMN does not perform well in AliMeData compared to UDC. One po- tential reason is that UDC has significantly larger data size than AliMeData (1000k vs. 51k), which can help to train a complex model like SMN; Last but not least, our proposed MT-hCNN shows the best results in terms of all the metrics in AliMe- Data, and the best results in terms of R@2 and R@1 in UDC, which shows the effectiveness of MT-hCNN.</p><p>We further evaluate the inference time 10 of these models. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, MT-hCNN has comparable or better results when compared with SMN (the state-of-the-art multi-turn conver- sation model), but is much more efficient than SMN (∼60% time reduction). MT-hCNN also has similar efficiency with CNN-based methods but with better performance. As a result, our MT- hCNN module is able to support a peak QPS 11 of 40 on a cluster of 2 service instances, where each instance reserves 2 cores and 4G memory on an Intel Xeon E5-2430 machine. This shows the model is applicable to industrial bots. In all, our proposed MT-hCNN is shown to be both efficient and effective for question matching in multi-turn conversations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Transferablity of our model</head><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our transfer learn- ing setting, we compare our full model with three baselines: Src-only that uses only source data, Tgt-only that uses only target data, and TL-S that uses both source and target data with the adversar- ial training as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017)</ref>. All the methods are evaluated on the test set of the target data.</p><p>As in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, Src-only performs worse than Tgt-only. This shows the source and target do- mains are related but different. Despite the domain shift, TL-S is able to leverage knowledge from the source domain and boost performance; Last, our model shows better performance than TL-S, this shows the helpfulness of adding domain discrimi- nators on both source and target domains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Online Evaluations</head><p>We deployed our model online in AliMe Assist Bot. For each query, the bot uses the TF-IDF model in Lucene to return a set of candidates, then uses our model to rerank all the candidates and re- turns the top. We set the candidate size as 15 and context length as 3. To accelerate the computation, we bundle the 15 candidates into a mini-batch to feed into our model. We compare our method with the online model -a degenerated version of our model that only uses the current query to retrieve candidate, i.e. context length is 1. We have run 3- day A/B testing on the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) of the models. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, our method consistently outperforms the online model, yield- ing 5% ∼ 10% improvement.</p></div>

Different from SMN, our model is built on CNN based modules, which yields comparable re- sults but with better efficiency. We study transfer learning (TL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pan and Yang, 2010</ref>) to help domains with limited data. TL has been extensively studied in the last decade. With the popularity of deep learning, many Neural Net- work (NN) based methods are proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yosinski et al., 2014)</ref>. A typical framework uses a shared NN to learn shared features for both source and target domains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yang et al., 2017)</ref>. Another approach is to use both a shared NN and domain-specific NNs to derive shared and domain-specific features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017</ref>). This is improved by some studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ganin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Taigman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017</ref>) that consider adversarial networks to learn more robust shared features across domains. Our TL model is based on ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2017)</ref>, with en- hanced source and target specific domain discrim- ination losses.</p></div>
