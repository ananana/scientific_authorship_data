				<p>The task of event trigger labeling is typically addressed in the standard supervised setting: triggers for each target event type are annotated as training data, based on annotation guidelines. We propose an alternative approach, which takes the example trigger terms mentioned in the guidelines as seeds, and then applies an event-independent similarity-based classifier for trigger labeling. This way we can skip manual annotation for new event types, while requiring only minimal annotated training data for few example events at system setup. Our method is evaluated on the ACE-2005 dataset, achieving 5.7% F 1 improvement over a state-of-the-art supervised system which uses the full training data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Event trigger labeling is the task of identifying the main word tokens that express mentions of pre- specified event types in running text. For example, in "20 people were wounded in Tuesday's airport blast", "wounded" is a trigger of an Injure event and "blast" is a trigger of an Attack. The task both detects trigger tokens and classifies them to appropriate event types. While this task is often a component within the broader event extraction task, labeling both triggers and arguments, this pa- per focuses on trigger labeling.</p><p>Most state-of-the-art event trigger labeling ap- proaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ji and Grishman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liao and Grishman, 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hong et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2013)</ref> follow the standard supervised learning paradigm. For each event type, experts first write annotation guidelines. Then, annotators follow them to label event triggers in a large dataset. Finally, a classi- fier is trained over the annotated triggers to label the target events.</p><p>The supervised paradigm requires major human efforts both in producing high-quality guidelines and in dataset annotation for each new event type. Given the rich information embedded in the guide- lines, we raise in this paper the following research question: how well can we perform by leverag- ing only the lexical knowledge already available in quality guidelines for new event types, without requiring annotated training data for them?</p><p>To address this question, we propose a seed- based approach for the trigger labeling task (Sec- tion 2). Given the description for a new event type, which contains some examples of triggers, we first collect these triggers into a list of seeds. Then, at the labeling phase, we consider each text token as a candidate for a trigger and assess its similar- ity to the seed list. In the above example, given seeds such as "explosion" and "fire" for the Attack event type, we identify that the candidate token "blast" is a hyponym of "explosion" and synonym of "fire" and infer that "blast" is a likely Attack trigger.</p><p>In our method, such similarity indicators are en- coded as a small set of event-independent clas- sification features, based on lexical matches and external resources like WordNet. Using event- independent features allows us to train the system only once, at system setup phase, requiring anno- tated triggers in a training set for just a few pre- selected event types. Then, whenever a new event type is introduced for labeling, we only need to collect a seed list for it from its description, and provide it as input to the system.</p><p>We developed a seed-based system (Section 3), based on a state-of-the-art fully-supervised event extraction system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2013)</ref>. When evalu- ated on the ACE-2005 dataset, 1 our system outper- forms the fully-supervised one (Section 4), even though we don't utilize any annotated triggers of the test events during the labeling phase, and only   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Seed-Based Problem Setup</head><p>This section describes our setup, as graphically il- lustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Similarly to the supervised setting, our ap- proach assumes that whenever a new event type is defined as target, an informative event description should be written for it. As a prominent example, we consider Section 5 of the ACE-2005 event an- notation guidelines, 2 which provides a description for each event type. The description includes a short verbal specification plus several illustrating example sentences with marked triggers, spanning on average less than a page per event type.</p><p>As event descriptions specify the intended event scope, they inherently include representative ex- amples for event triggers. For instance, the ACE- 2005 guidelines include: "MEET Events include talks, summits, conferences, meetings, visits,. . . ", followed by an example: "Bush and Putin met this week. . . ". We thus collect triggers mentioned in each event description into a seed list for the event type, which is provided as input to our trigger la- beling method. Triggers from the above quoted sentences are hence included in the Meet seed list, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned in the Introduction, our method (Section 3) is based on event-independent features that identify similarities between a candidate trig- ger and a given seed list. To train such generic fea- tures, our training requires several arbitrary train- ing event types, with a small amount of annotated triggers, from which it learns weights for the fea- tures. In our evaluation (Section 4) we use 5 train- ing event types, with a total of 30 annotated trig- ger mentions (compared to roughly 5000 used by the baseline fully-supervised system). In this set- ting, the training phase is required only once dur- ing system setup, while no further training is re- quired for each new target event type.</p><p>In summary, our setup requires: (1) a seed list per target event type; (2) a small number of anno- tated triggers for few training event types, along with their seed lists (at system setup).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>This section describes the method we designed to implement the seed-based approach. To as- sess our approach, we compare it (Section 4) with the common fully-supervised approach, which re- quires annotated triggers for each target event type. Therefore, we implemented our system by adapting the state-of-the-art fully-supervised event extraction system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al. (2013)</ref>, modifying mechanisms relevant for features and for trigger labels, as described below. Hence the systems are comparable with respect to using the same pre- processing and machine learning infrastructure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Fully-Supervised System</head><p>The event extraction system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al. (2013)</ref> la- bels triggers and their arguments for a set of target event types L, for which annotated training docu- ments are provided. The system utilizes a struc- tured perceptron with beam search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Collins and Roark, 2004;</ref>). To label trig- gers, the system scans each sentence x, and cre- ates candidate assignments y, that for each token x i assign each possible label y i ∈ L ∪ {⊥} (⊥ meaning x i is not a trigger at all). The score of an assignment (x i , y i ) is calculated as w · f , where f is the binary feature vector calculated for (x i , y i ), and w is the learned feature weight vector.</p><p>The classifier's features capture various proper- ties of x i and its context, such as its unigram and its containing bigrams. These features are highly lexicalized, resulting in a very large feature space. Additionally, each feature is replicated and paired with each label y i , allowing the system to learn Do the candidate token and a seed share the same lemma? Synonym Is a seed a WN synonym of the candidate token? Hypernym Is a seed a WN hypernym or instance-hypernym of the candidate token? Similarity Relations Does one of these WN relations hold between a seed and a candidate token? Synonym, Hyper- nym, Instance Hypernym, Part Holonym, Mem- ber Holonym, Substance Meronym, Entailment <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Similarity features using WordNet (WN).</p><p>For the last two features we allow up to 2 levels of transitivity (e.g. hypernym of hypernym), and consider also derivations of candidate tokens.</p><p>different weights for different labels, e.g., feature (Unigram:"visited", Meet) will have a different weight than (Unigram:"visited", Attack).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Seed-Based System</head><p>To implement the seed-based approach for trigger labeling, we adapt only the trigger classification part in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al. (2013)</ref> fully-supervised sys- tem, ignoring arguments. Given a set of new target event types T we classify every test sentence once for each event type t ∈ T . Hence, when classi- fying a sentence for t, the labeling of each token x i is binary, where y i ∈ {{, ⊥} marks whether x i is a trigger of type t () or not (⊥). For in- stance x i ="visited" labeled as when classifying for t=Meet, means x i is labeled as a Meet trigger. To score the binary label assignment (x i , y i ), we use a small set of features that assess the similar- ity between x i and t's given seed list. We implement our approach with a basic set of binary features <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, which are turned on if similarity is found for at least one seed in the list. We use a single knowledge resource <ref type="bibr">(WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998</ref>)) for expansion. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> As in the fully-supervised system, each feature is replicated for each label in {{, ⊥}, learning separately how well a feature can predict a trigger () and a non-trigger (⊥). As labels are event-independent, features are event-independent as well, and their weights can be learned generically <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>Since we label each token independently for each event type t, multiple labels may be assigned to the same token. If a single-label setting is re- quired, standard techniques can be applied, such as choosing a single random label, or the highest scoring one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Setting</head><p>We evaluate our seed-based approach (Section 2) in comparison to the fully-supervised approach implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al. (2013)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Section 3)</ref>. To maintain comparability, we use the ACE-2005 documents with the same split as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ji and Grishman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liao and Grishman, 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2013</ref>) to 40 test documents and 559 training doc- uments. However, some evaluation settings dif- fer: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al. (2013)</ref> train a multi-class model for all 33 ACE-2005 event types, and classify all to- kens in the test documents into these event types. Our approach, on the other hand, trains an event- independent binary classifier, while testing on new event types that are different from those utilized for training. We next describe how this setup is addressed in our evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Per-Event Classification</head><p>To label the test doc- uments to all 33 event types, we classify each to- ken in the test documents once for each test event type. 4</p><p>Training Event Types When we label for a test event type t, we use a model that was trained on different pre-selected training event types. Since we need to label for all event types, we cannot use the same model for testing them all, since then the event types used to train this model could not be tested. Thus, for each t we use a model trained on 5 randomly chosen training event types, differ- ent than t. 5 Additionally, to avoid a bias caused by a particular random choice, we build 10 differ- ent models, each time choosing a different set of 5 training event types. Then, we label the test docu- ments for t 10 times, once by each model. When measuring performance we compute the average of these 10 runs for each t, as well as the variance within these runs.</p><p>Annotated Triggers Training event types re- quire annotated triggers from the training docu- ments. To maintain consistency between differ- ent sets of training event types, we use a fixed to- tal of 30 annotated trigger tokens for each set of</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Micro-Avg.

The amounts of 5 training event types and 30 annotated triggers were chosen to demonstrate that such small amounts, requiring little manual effort at system setup, yield high per- formance (larger training didn't improve results, possibly due to the small number of features).</p><p>Seed Lists To build the seed lists for all event types, we manually extracted all triggers men- tioned in Section 5 of the ACE-2005 guidelines, as described in Section 2. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> This resulted in lists of 4.2 seeds per event type on average, which is fairly small. For comparison, each event type has an av- erage of 46 distinct trigger terms in the training corpus used by the fully-supervised method. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows our system's precision, recall and F 1 , 7 and the average variance of F 1 within the 10 runs of each test event type. The very low variance indicates that the system's performance does not depend much on the choice of training event types. We compare our system's performance to the published trigger classification results of the base- line system of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2013</ref>) (its globally op- timized run, when labeling both triggers and ar- guments). We also compare to the sentence-level system in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ji and Grishman, 2008</ref>) which uses the same dataset split. Our system outperforms the fully-supervised baseline by 5.7% F 1 , which is statistically significant (two-tailed Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.05). This shows that there is no per- formance hit for the seed-based method on this dataset, even though it does not require any anno- tated data for new tested events, thus saving costly annotation efforts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Our work contributes to the broader research di- rection of reducing annotation for information ex- traction. One such IE paradigm, including Pre- emptive IE <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Shinyama and Sekine, 2006</ref>), On- demand IE <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Sekine, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sekine and Oda, 2007)</ref> and Open IE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Etzioni et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banko et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banko et al., 2008)</ref>, focuses on un- supervised relation and event discovery. We, on the other hand, follow the same goal as fully- supervised systems in targeting pre-specified event types, but aim at minimal annotation cost.</p><p>Bootstrapping methods (such as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yangarber et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agichtein and Gravano, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Riloff, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Greenwood and Stevenson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liao and Grishman, 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Huang and Riloff, 2012)</ref>) have been widely applied in IE. Most work started from a small set of seed patterns, and repeatedly expanded them from unlabeled corpora. Relying on unla- beled data, bootstrapping methods are scalable but tend to produce worse results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liao and Grishman, 2010a</ref>) than supervised models due to se- mantic drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Curran et al., 2007)</ref>. Our method can be seen complementary to bootstrapping frame- works, since we exploit manually crafted linguis- tic resources which are more accurate but may not cover all domains and languages.</p><p>Our approach is perhaps closest to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Roth et al., 2009)</ref>. They addressed a different IE task -re- lation extraction, by recognizing entailment be- tween candidate relation mentions and seed pat- terns. While they exploited a supervised recogniz- ing textual entailment (RTE) system, we show that using only simple WordNet-based similarity fea- tures and minimal training yields relatively high performance in event trigger labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we show that by utilizing the in- formation embedded in annotation guidelines and lexical resources, we can skip manual annotation for new event types. As we match performance of a state-of-the-art fully-supervised system over the ACE-2005 benchmark (and even surpass it), we offer our approach as an appealing way of reduc- ing annotation effort while preserving result qual- ity. Future research may explore additional fea- tures and knowledge resources, investigate alter- native approaches for creating effective seed lists, and extend our approach to argument labeling.</p></div>
