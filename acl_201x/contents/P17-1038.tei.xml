				<p>Modern models of event extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised learning of events from small hand-labeled data. However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge , which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Event Extraction (EE), a challenging task in In- formation Extraction, aims at detecting and typ- ing events (Event Detection), and extracting ar- guments with different roles (Argument Identifi- cation) from natural-language texts. For exam- ple, in the sentence shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, an EE system is expected to identify an Attack even- t triggered by threw and extract the correspond- ing five augments with different roles: Yesterday (Role=Time), demonstrators (Role=Attacker), s- tones (Role=Instrument), soldiers (Role=Target), and Israeli (Role=Place).</p><p>To this end, so far most methods (Nguyen et al.,  2016; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hong et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ji and Grishman, 2008</ref>) usually adopted su- pervised learning paradigm which relies on elab- orate human-annotated data, such as ACE 2005 1 , to train extractors. Although this paradigm was widely studied, existing approaches still suffer from high costs for manually labeling training da- ta and low coverage of predefined event types. In ACE 2005, all 33 event types are manually pre- defined and the corresponding event information (including triggers, event types, arguments and their roles) are manually annotated only in 599 English documents since the annotation process is extremely expensive. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shown, n- early 60% of event types in ACE 2005 have less than 100 labeled samples and there are even three event types which have less than ten labeled sam- ples. Moreover, those predefined 33 event types are in low coverage for Natural Language Process- ing (NLP) applications on large-scale data.</p><p>Therefore, for extracting large scale events, e- specially in open domain scenarios, how to auto- matically and efficiently generate sufficient train- ing data is an important problem. This paper aim- s to automatically generate training data for EE, which involves labeling triggers, event types, ar- guments and their roles. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an ex- ample of labeled sentence. Recent improvements of Distant Supervision (DS) have been proven to be effective to label training data for Relation <ref type="bibr">Extraction (RE)</ref>, which aims to predict semantic re- lations between pairs of entities, formulated as (entity 1 , relation, entity 2 ). And DS for RE as- sumes that if two entities have a relationship in a known knowledge base, then all sentences that mention these two entities will express that rela- tionship in some way ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mintz et al., 2009</ref>). How- ever, when we use DS for RE to EE, we meet fol- lowing challenges:</p><p>Triggers are not given out in existing knowl- edge bases. EE aims to detect an event instance of a specific type and extract their arguments and roles, formulated as (event instance, event type; role 1 , argument 1 ; role 2 , argument 2 ; ...; role n , argument n ), which can be regarded as a kind of multiple or complicated relational data. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the right part shows an example of spouse of relation between Barack Obama and M ichelle Obama, where two rectangles repre- sent two entities and the edge connecting them represents their relation. DS for RE uses t- wo entities to automatically label training da- ta; In comparison, the left part in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows a marriage event of Barack Obama and M ichelle Obama, where the dash cir- cle represents the marriage event instance of Barack Obama and M ichelle Obama, rectan- gles represent arguments of the event instance, and each edge connecting an argument and the event instance expresses the role of the argument. For example, Barack Obama plays a Spouse role in this marriage event instance. It seems that we could use an event instance and an argument to automatically generate training data for argumen- t identification just like DS for RE. However, an event instance is a virtual node in existing knowl- edge bases and mentioned implicitly in texts. For example, in Freebase, the aforementioned mar- riage event instance is represented as m.02nqglv (see details in Section 2). Thus we cannot direct- ly use an event instance and an argument, like m.02nqglv and Barack Obama, to label back  in sentences. In ACE event extraction program, an event instance is represented as a trigger word, which is the main word that most clearly repre- sents an event occurrence in sentences, like threw in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Following ACE, we can use trig- ger words to represent event instance, like married for people.marriage event instance. Unfortunate- ly, triggers are not given out in existing knowledge bases.</p><p>To resolve the trigger missing problem men- tioned above, we need to discover trigger words before employing distant supervision to automati- cally label event arguments. Following DS in RE, we could naturally assume that a sentence con- tains all arguments of an event in the knowledge base tend to express that event, and the verbs oc- cur in these sentences tend to evoke this type of events. However, arguments for a specific event instance are usually mentioned in multiple sen- tences. Simply employing all arguments in the knowledge base to label back in sentences will generate few sentences as training samples. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>  To solve above problems, we propose an ap- proach to automatically generate labeled data for large scale EE by jointly using world knowledge (Freebase) and linguistic knowledge (FrameNet). At first, we put forward an approach to prioritize arguments and select key or representative argu- ments (see details in Section 3.1) for each event type by using Freebase; Secondly, we merely use key arguments to label events and figure out trig- ger words; Thirdly, an external linguistic knowl- edge resource, FrameNet, is employed to filter noisy trigger words and expand more triggers; Af- ter that, we propose a Soft Distant Supervision (SDS) for EE to automatically label training da- ta, which assumes that any sentence containing al- l key arguments in Freebase and a corresponding trigger word is likely to express that event in some way, and arguments occurring in that sentence are likely to play the corresponding roles in that event. Finally, we evaluate the quality of the automatical- ly labeled training data by both manual and auto- matic evaluations. In addition, we employ a CNN- based EE approach with multi-instance learning for the automatically labeled data as a baseline for further research on this data. In summary, the con- tributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• To our knowledge, it is the first work to au- tomatically label data for large scale EE via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge. All the labeled data in this paper have been released and can be downloaded freely 2 .</p><p>• We propose an approach to figure out key ar- guments of an event by using Freebase, and use them to automatically detect events and corresponding trigger words. Moreover, we employ FrameNet to filter noisy triggers and expand more triggers.</p><p>• The experimental results show that the qual- ity of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human- annotated data. Also, our automatically la- beled data can augment traditional human- annotated data, which could significantly im- prove the extraction performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>In this paper, we respectively use Freebase as our world knowledge containing event instance and FrameNet as the linguistic knowledge containing trigger information. The articles in Wikipedia are used as unstructured texts to be labeled. To under- stand our method easily, we first introduce them as follows:</p><p>Freebase is a semantic knowledge base <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bollacker et al., 2008)</ref>, which makes use of medi- ators (also called compound value types, CVT- s) to merge multiple values into a single value. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, people.marriage is one type of CVTs. There are many instances of peo- ple.marriage and the marriage of Barack Obama and Michelle Obama is numbered as m.02nqglv. Spouse, from, to and location of ceremony are roles of the people.marriage CVTs. Barack Oba- ma, Michelle Obama, 10/3/1992 and Trinity U- nited Church of Christ are the values of the in- stances. In this paper, we regard these CVTs as events, type of CVTs as event type, CVT instances as event instances, values in CVTs as arguments in events and roles of CVTs as the roles of ar- guments play in the event, respectively. Accord- ing to the statistics of the Freebase released on 23 th April, 2015, there are around 1885 CVTs and around 14 million CVTs instances. After filtering out useless and meaningless CVTs, such as CVT- s about user profiles and website information, we select 21 types of CVTs with around 3.8 million instances for experiments, which mainly involves events about education, military, sports and so on.</p><p>FrameNet 3 is a linguistic resource storing in- formation about lexical and predicate argument se- mantics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker et al., 1998)</ref>. FrameNet contains more than 1, 000 frames and 10, 000 Lexical Unit- s (LUs). Each frame of FrameNet can be taken as a semantic frame of a type of events ( . Each frame has a set of lemmas with part of speech tags that can evoke the frame, which are called LUs. For example, appoint.v is a LU of Ap- pointing frame in FrameNet, which can be mapped to people.appointment events in Freebase. And a LUs of the frame plays a similar role as the trig- ger of an event. Thus we use FrameNet to detect triggers in our automatically data labeling process.</p><p>Wikipedia 4 that we used was released on Jan- uary, 2016. All 6.3 million articles in it are used in our experiments. We use Wikipedia because it is relatively up-to-date, and much of the information in Freebase is derived from Wikipedia. tection, which prioritizes arguments of each even- t type and selects key arguments for each type of event; (ii) Trigger word detection, which uses key arguments to label sentences that may express events preliminarily, and then detect triggers; (iii) Trigger word filtering and expansion, which uses FrameNet to filter noisy triggers and expand trig- gers; (iv) Automatically labeled data generation, which uses a SDS to label events in sentences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Key Argument Detection</head><p>This section illustrates how to detect key argu- ments for each event type via Freebase. Intuitively, arguments of a type of event play different roles. Some arguments play indispensable roles in an event, and serve as vital clues when distinguishing different events. For example, compared with ar- guments like time, location and so on, spouses are key arguments in a marriage event. We call these arguments as key arguments. We propose to use Key Rate (KR) to estimate the importance of an argument to a type of event, which is decided by two factors: Role Saliency and Event Relevance.</p><p>Role Saliency (RS) reflects the saliency of an argument to represent a specific event instance of a given event type. If we tend to use an argumen- t to distinguish one event instance form other in- stances of a given event type, this argument will play a salient role in the given event type. We de- fine RS as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">RS ij = Count(A i , ET j ) Count(ET j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where RS ij is the role saliency of i-th argument to j-th event type, Count(A i , ET j ) is the num- ber of Arguemnt i occurring in all instances of eventT ype j in Freebase and Count(ET j ) is the number of instances of eventT ype j in Freebase. Event Relevance (ER) reflects the ability in which an argument can be used to discriminate d- ifferent event types. If an argument occurs in ev- ery event type, the argument will have a low event relevance. We propose to compute ER as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ER i = log Sum(ET ) 1 + Count(ET Ci)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ER i is the event relevance of i-th argumen- t, Sum (ET ) is the number of all event types in knowledge base and Count(ET C i ) is the number of event types containing i-th argument. Finally, KR is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">KR ij = RS ij * ER i<label>(3)</label></formula><p>We compute KR for all arguments of each even- t type, and sort them according to KR. Then we choose top K arguments as key arguments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Trigger Word Detection</head><p>After detecting key arguments for every even- t types, we use these key arguments to label sen- tences that may express events in Wikipedia. At first, we use Standford CoreNLP tool <ref type="bibr">5</ref> to converts the raw Wikipedia texts into a sequence of sen- tences, attaches NLP annotations (POS tag, NER tag). Finally, we select sentences that contains all key arguments of an event instance in Freebase as sentences expressing corresponding events. Then we use these labeled sentences to detect triggers.</p><p>In a sentence, a verb tend to express an occur- rence of an event. For example, in ACE 2005 En- glish data, there are 60% of events triggered by verbs. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, threw is a trigger of Attack event. Intuitively, if a verb occurs more times than other verbs in the labeled sentences of one event type , the verb tends to trigger this type of event; and if a verb occurs in sentences of ev- ery event types, like is, the verb will have a low probability to trigger events. Thus we propose Trigger Candidate Frequency (TCF) and Trigger Event Type Frequency (TETF) to evaluate above t- wo aspects. Finally we employ Trigger Rate (TR), which is the product of TCF and TETF to estimate the probability of a verb to be a trigger, which is formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T R ij = T CF ij * T ET F i<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">T CF ij = Count(V i , ET S j ) Count(ET S j )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>T ET F i = log</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Sum(ET ) 1 + Count(ET I i )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where T R ij is the trigger rate of i-th verb to j- th event type, Count(V i , ET S j ) is the number of sentences, which express j-th type of even- t and contain i-th verb, Count(ET S j ) is the number of sentences expressing j-th event type, Count(ET I i ) is the number of event types, which have the labeled sentences containing i-th verb. Finally, we choose verbs with high T R values as the trigger words for each event type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Trigger Word Filtering and Expansion</head><p>We can obtain an initial verbal trigger lexicon by above trigger word detection. However, this initial trigger lexicon is noisy and merely contains verbal triggers. The nominal triggers like marriage are missing. Because the number of nouns in one sen- tence is usually larger than that of verbs, it is hard to use TR to find nominal triggers. Thus, we pro- pose to use linguistic resource FrameNet to filter noisy verbal triggers and expand nominal triggers. As the success of word embedding in capturing se- mantics of words (Turian et al., 2010), we employ word embedding to map the events in Freebase to frames in FrameNet. Specifically, we use the aver- age word embedding of all words in i-th Freebase event type name e i and word embedding of k-th lexical units of j-th frame e j,k to compute the se- mantic similarity. Finally, we select the frame con- tains max similarity of e i and e j,k as the mapped frame, which can be formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f rame(i) = arg max j (similarity(e i , e j,k ))<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Then, we filter the verb, which is in initial ver- bal trigger word lexicon and not in the mapping frame. And we use nouns with high confidence in the mapped frame to expand trigger lexicon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Automatically labeled data generation</head><p>Finally, we propose a Soft Distant Supervision and use it to automatically generate training da- ta, which assumes that any sentence containing al- l key arguments in Freebase and a corresponding trigger word is likely to express that event in some way, and arguments occurring in that sentence are likely to play the corresponding roles in that event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Method of Event Extraction</head><p>In this paper, event extraction is formulated as a two-stage, multi-class classification task. The first stage is called Event Classification, which aims to predict whether the key argument can- didates participate in a Freebase event. If the key arguments participate a Freebase event, the second stage is conducted, which aims to assign arguments to the event and identify their corre- sponding roles. We call this stage as argumen- t classification. We employ two similar Dynam- ic Multi-pooling Convolutional Neural Network- s with Multi-instance Learning (DMCNNs-MIL) for above two stages. The Dynamic Multi-pooling Convolutional Neural Networks (DMCNNs) is the best reported CNN-based model for event extrac- tion ( ) by using human-annotated training data. However, our automatically labeled data face a noise problem, which is a intrinsic problem of using DS to construct training data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hoffmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Surdeanu et al., 2012)</ref>. In order to alleviate the wrong label problem, we use Multi-instance Learning (MIL) for two DMCNNs. Because the second stage is more complicated and limited in space, we take the MIL used in argu- ments classification as an example and describes as follows:</p><p>We define all of the parameters for the stage of argument classification to be trained in DM- CNNs as θ. Suppose that there are T bags {M 1 , M 2 , ..., M T } and that the i-th bag contains q i instances (sentences) M i = m 1 i , m 2 i , ..., m q i i , the objective of multi-instance learning is to pre- dict the labels of the unseen bags. In stage of ar- gument classification, we take sentences contain- ing the same argument candidate and triggers with a same event type as a bag and all instances in a bag are considered independently. Given an in- put instance m j i , the network with the parameter θ outputs a vector O, where the r-th component O r corresponds to the score associated with argu- ment role r. To obtain the conditional probability p(r|m j i , θ), we apply a softmax operation over all argument role types:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p(r|m j i , θ) = e or n k=1 e o k (8)</formula><p>where, n is the number of roles. And the objective of multi-instance learning is to discriminate bags rather than instances. Thus, we define the objec- tive function on the bags. Given all (T ) training bags (M i , y i ), we can define the objective function <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">of triggers   people.marriage  152,276  56,837  26,349</ref> spouse, spouse, from, to, location marriage, marry, wed, wedding, couple,..., wife music.group membership 239,813 90,617 20,742 group, member, start, role, end musician, singer, sing, sang, sung, concert,..., play education.education 530,538 26,966 11,849 student, institution, degree,..., minor educate, education, graduate, learn, study,..., student organization.leadership 43,610 5,429 3,416 organization, person, title,..., to CEO, charge, administer, govern, rule, boss,..., chair olympics.olympic medal honor 20,790 4,056 2,605 medalist, olympics, event,..., country win, winner, tie, victor, gold, silver,..., bronze ...</p><note type="other">Event Type Freebase Size Sentences (KA) Sentences (KA+T) Examples of argument roles sorted by KR Examples</note><p>... ... ... .. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">.  ...  sum of 21 selected events  3,870,492  421,602  72,611</ref> argument1, argument2 ,..., argumentN trigger1, trigger2, trigger3, ... , triggerN using cross-entropy at the bag level as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">J (θ) = T i=1 log p(y i |m j i , θ)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where j is constrained as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">j * = arg max j p(r|m j i , θ) 1 ≤ j ≤ q i (10)</formula><p>To compute the network parameter θ, we max- imize the log likelihood J (θ) through stochas- tic gradient descent over mini-batches with the Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) update rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we first manually evaluate our auto- matically labeled data. Then, we conduct automat- ic evaluations for our labeled data based on ACE corpus and analyze effects of different approach- es to automatically label training data. Finally, we shows the performance of DMCNNs-MIL on our automatically labeled data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Our Automatically Labeled Data</head><p>By using the proposed methods, a large set of la- beled data could be generated automatically. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Ta- ble 2</ref> shows the statistics of the five largest auto- matically labeled events among selected 21 Free- base events. Two hyper parameters, the number of key arguments and the value of TR in our au- tomatically data labeling, are set as 2 and 0.8, by grid search respectively. When we merely use t- wo key arguments to label data, we will obtain 421, 602 labeled sentences. However, these sen- tences miss labeling triggers. Thus, we leverage these rough labeled data and FrameNet to find trig- gers and use SDS to generate labeled data. Finally, 72, 611 labeled sentences are generated automat- ically. Compared with nearly 6, 000 human an- notated labeled sentence in ACE, our method can automatically generate large scale labeled training data. We firstly manually evaluate the precision of our automatically generated labeled data. We ran- domly select 500 samples from our automatically labeled data. Each selected sample is a sentence with a highlighted trigger, labeled arguments and corresponding event type and argument roles. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 5</ref> gives some samples. Annotators are asked to assign one of two labels to each sample. "Y": the word highlighted in the given sentence indeed triggers an event of the corresponding type or the word indeed plays the corresponding role in that event. Otherwise "N" is labeled. It is very easy to annotate a sample for annotators, thus the annotat- ed results are expected to be of high quality. Each sample is independently annotated by three anno- tators 6 (including one of the authors and two of our colleagues who are familiar with event extrac- tion task) and the final decision is made by voting.</p></div>

Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nguyen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2013)</ref>, we used the same test set with 40 newswire articles and the same development set with 30 documents and the rest 529 documents are used for ACE train- ing set. And we use the same evaluation metric P, R, F as ACE task defined. We select three base- lines trained with ACE data. (1) Li's structure, which is the best reported structured-based system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> Chen's DMCNN, which is the best reported CNN-based system . (3) Nguyen's JRNN, which is the state-of- the-arts system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Compared with all models, DMCNN trained with ACE+ED achieves the highest performance. This demon- strates that our automatically generated labeled data could expand human annotated training data effectively. Moreover, compared with Chen's DM- CNN trained with ACE, DMCNN trained with ED Only achieves a competitive performance. This demonstrates that our large scale automatically la- beled data is competitive with elaborately human- annotated data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of Key Rate</head><p>In this section, we prove the effectiveness of KR to find key arguments and explore the impact of dif- ferent numbers of key arguments to automatically generate data. We specifically select two methods as baselines for comparison with our KR method: ER and RS, which use the event relevance and role salience to sort arguments of each type of events respectively. Then we choose the same number of key arguments in all methods and use these key arguments to label data. After that we evaluate these methods by using above automatic evalua- tions based on ACE data. Results are shown in Ta- ble 5. ACE+KR achieve the best performance in both stages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our KR methods.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. Then we automatically eval- uate the performance by using automatic evalua- tions proposed above. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the results, when we set k = 2, the method achieves a best <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Effects of the number of key arguments performance in both stages. Then, the F1 value re- duces as k grows. The reason is that the heuristics for data labeling are stricter as k grows. As a re- sult, less training data is generated. For example, if k = 2, we will get 25, 797 sentences labeled as people.marriage events and we will get 534 la- beled sentences, if k = 3. However, when we set k = 1, although more labeled data are generated, the precision could not be guaranteed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of Trigger Rate and FrameNet</head><p>In this section, we prove the effectiveness of TR and FrameNet to find triggers. We specifically s- elect two methods as baselines: TCF and TETF. TCF, TETF and TR respectively use the trigger candidate frequency, trigger event type frequen- cy and trigger rate to sort trigger candidates of each type of events. Then we generate initial trig- ger lexicon by using all trigger candidates with high TCF value, TETF value or TR value. We set these hyper parameters as 0.8, 0.9 and 0.8, re- spectively, which are determined by grid search from (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0). FrameNet was used to filter noisy verbal triggers and expand nominal triggers. Trigger examples generated by TR+Framenet are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. Then we evaluate the performance of these methods by using above automatic evaluations. Results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref>, Compared with ACE+TCF and ACE+TETF, ACE+TR gains a higher performance in both stages. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our TR methods. When we use FrameNet to gen- erate triggers, compared with ACE+TR, we get a 1.0 improvement on trigger classification and a 1.7 improvement on argument classification. Such im- provements are higher than improvements gained by other methods (TCF, IEF, TR), which demon- strates the effectiveness of the usage of FrameNet.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Performance of DMCNN-MIL</head><p>Following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mintz et al., 2009</ref>) in distant supervised RE, we evaluate our method in two ways: held-out and manual evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Held-out Evaluation</head><p>In the held-out evaluation, we hold out part of the Freebase event data during training, and compare newly discovered event instances against this held- out data. We use the following criteria to judge the correctness of each predicted event automati- cally: (1) An event is correct if its key arguments and event type match those of an event instance in Freebase; (2) An argument is correctly classified if its event type and argument role match those of any of the argument instance in the corresponding Freebase event. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref> show the precision-recall (P-R) curves for each method in the two stages of event extraction respectively. We can see that multi-instance learning is effective to alleviate the noise problem in our distant super- vised event extraction.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human Evaluation</head><p>Because the incomplete nature of Freebase, held- out evaluation suffers from false negatives prob- lem. We also perform a manual evaluation to e- liminate these problems. In the manual evaluation, we manually check the newly discovered event in- stances that are not in Freebase. Because the num- ber of these event instances in the test data is un- known, we cannot calculate the recall in this case.</p><p>Instead, we calculate the precision of the top n ex- tracted event instances. The human evaluation re- sults are presented in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. We can see that DMCNNs-MIL achieves the best performance.  <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Precision for top 100, 300, and 500 events</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Most of previous event extraction work focused on supervised learning paradigm and trained even- t extractors on human-annotated data which yield relatively high performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ji and Grishman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hong et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McClosky et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al., , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nguyen and Grishman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>. However, these supervised methods de- pend on the quality of the training data and la- beled training data is expensive to produce. Un- supervised methods can extract large numbers of events without using labeled data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cheung et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Huang et al., 2016</ref>). But extracted events may not be easy to be mapped to events for a particular knowledge base. Distant supervision have been used in relation extraction for automatically labeling training da- ta ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hinton et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krause et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Surdeanu et al., 2012;</ref>. But DS for RE cannot directly use for EE. For the reasons that an event is more com- plicated than a relation and the task of EE is more difficult than RE. The best reported supervised RE and EE system got a F1-score of 88.0% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wang et al., 2016</ref>) and 55. <ref type="bibr">4% (Nguyen et al., 2016</ref>) re- spectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Reschke et al. (2014)</ref> extended the distant supervision approach to fill slots in plane crash. However, the method can only extract ar- guments of one plane crash type and need flight number strings as input. In other words, the ap- proach cannot extract whole event with different types automatically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we present an approach to automati- cally label training data for EE. The experimental results show the quality of our large scale auto- matically labeled data is competitive with elabo- rately human-annotated data. Also, we provide a DMCNN-MIL model for this data as a baseline for further research. In the future, we will use the proposed automatically data labeling method to more event types and explore more models to extract events by using automatically labeled data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: This sentence expresses an Attack event triggered by threw and containing five arguments.</figDesc><graphic url="image-5.png" coords="1,271.00,337.15,288.60,55.09" type="bitmap" /></figure>
