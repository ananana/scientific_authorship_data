			<abstract>
				<p>A defining symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the presence of restricted and repetitive activities and interests , which can surface in language as a perseverative focus on idiosyncratic topics. In this paper, we use semantic similarity measures to identify such idiosyn-cratic topics in narratives produced by children with and without ASD. We find that neurotypical children tend to use the same words and semantic concepts when retelling the same narrative, while children with ASD, even when producing accurate retellings, use different words and concepts relative not only to neurotypical children but also to other children with ASD. Our results indicate that children with ASD not only stray from the target topic but do so in idiosyncratic ways according to their own restricted interests.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurode- velopmental disorder characterized by impaired communication and social behavior. One of the core symptoms is a preoccupation with specific re- stricted interests <ref type="bibr">(American Psychiatric Association, 2013)</ref>, and several commonly used diagnos- tic instruments for ASD instruct examiners to eval- uate the degree to which subjects display this char- acteristic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lord et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rutter et al., 2003)</ref>. In verbal individuals with ASD, such a preoccu- pation can be expressed as a tendency to fixate on a particular idiosyncratic topic.</p><p>Previous research relying on expert annota- tion of spoken language in children with ASD has found that their spoken narratives and con- versations include significantly more instances of irrelevant content and more topic digressions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Loveland et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Losh and Capps, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lam et al., 2012)</ref>. Similar results at the lexical level have been reported using automated anno- tations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Prud'hommeaux and Rouhizadeh, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rouhizadeh et al., 2013)</ref>. There has been little work, however, in characterizing the precise direc- tion of the departure from a target topic, leaving open the question of whether children with ASD are instigating similar, potentially reasonable topic changes or whether they are introducing idiosyn- cratic topics consistent with their own restricted interests.</p><p>In this paper, we attempt to automatically iden- tify topic digressions in the narrative retellings of children with ASD and to determine whether these digressions are influenced by their idiosyn- cratic or restricted interests. From a corpus of spoken retellings of the same brief narrative, we extract several measures designed to capture dif- ferent facets of semantic similarity between a pair of retellings. We find that the retellings of chil- dren with typical development (TD) semantically resemble one another much more than they resem- ble retellings by children with ASD. This indicates that TD children are adhering to a common tar- get topic, while children with ASD are introduc- ing topic changes. More strikingly, the similar- ity between pairs of ASD retellings is even lower, suggesting that children with ASD are straying from the target topic in individual and idiosyn- cratic ways. Although we do not yet have manual annotations to confirm that these topic shifts corre- spond to the particular restricted interests of each study participant, our methods and results show the potential of using automated analysis for re- vealing diagnostically relevant linguistic features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>Thirty-nine children with typical development (TD) and 21 high-functioning children with ASD, ranging in age from 4 to 9 years, participated in this study. ASD was diagnosed via clinical consensus according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria <ref type="bibr">(American Psychiatric Association, 2000</ref>) and the established thresholds on two widely-used diag- nostic instruments: the Autism Diagnostic Obser- vation <ref type="bibr">Schedule (Lord et al., 2002</ref>) and the So- cial Communication Questionnaire ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rutter et al., 2003)</ref>. No children met the criteria for a lan- guage impairment, and there were no significant between-group differences in age or full-scale IQ.</p><p>To elicit retellings, we used the Narrative Mem- ory subtest of the NEPSY ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Korkman et al., 1998</ref>), a large battery of tasks testing neurocognitive functioning in children. In the NEPSY Narrative Memory (NNM) subtest, the subject listens to a brief narrative about a boy and his dog and then must retell the narrative to the examiner. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows two sample retellings from our corpus. The NNM was administered by a trained clinician to each study participant, and each participant's retelling was recorded, transcribed, and evaluated according to the published scoring guidelines.</p><p>Under standard administration of the NNM, a retelling is scored according to how many story elements from a predetermined list it contains. The guidelines for scoring do not require verba- tim recall for most elements and generally allow the use of synonyms and paraphrases. As is typ- ically reported when comparing matched groups ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Diehl et al., 2006</ref>), we observed no significant difference in the standard NNM free recall score between the TD group (mean = 6.25, sd = 3.43) and the ASD group (mean = 4.90, sd = 3.72). It might seem that a low similarity score between two retellings simply indicates that one retelling includes fewer story elements. However, given the equivalent number of story elements recalled by the two groups, we can assume that a low similar- ity score indicates a difference in the quality rather than the quantity of information in the retellings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Semantic similarity measures</head><p>We expect that two different retellings of the same narrative will lie in the same lexico-semantic space and will thus have high similarity scores. In this work we use well-known similarity measures with two modifications. Children with autism tend to use more off-topic and unexpected words. Such words always have high inverse document fre- quency (IDF) scores since they are very specific to a particular retelling. By including IDF weights, a similarity measure would be biased toward off- topic words rather than actual content words in the story elements. Conventional IDF weights are therefore not useful for our particular purpose. In- stead, we remove closed-class function words to avoid their bias in our similarity measures. In ad- dition, we lemmatize our narrative corpus to re- duce the sparsity due to inflectional variation.</p></div>

Because it is a precision metric, the BLEU score for any pair of narratives n and m will depend on which narrative is considered the "reference". To create a single BLEU-based overlap score for each pair of narra- tives, we calculate Sim BLEU (n,m) as the mean of BLEU (m, n) and BLEU (n, m).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Knowledge-based measures</head><p>It is reasonable to expect people to use syn- onyms or semantically similar words in their nar- ratives retellings. It is therefore possible that chil- dren with autism are discussing the appropriate topic but choosing unusual words within that topic space in their retellings. We therefore use a set of measures that consider the semantic overlap of two narratives using WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fellbaum, 1998</ref>) sim- ilarities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Achananuparp et al., 2008)</ref>, in order to distinguish instances of atypical but semantically appropriate language from true examples of poor topic maintenance. Because WordNet-based simi- larity measures only consider word pairs with the same part-of-speech, we POS-tagged the data us- ing a perceptron tagger (Yarmohammadi, 2014).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">WordNet-based vector similarity</head><p>In a modified version ofWordNet-based vector similarity, Sim WV ), ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2006</ref>), we first cre- ate vectors v n and v m for each narrative n and m, where each element corresponds to a word in the type union of n and m. We assign values to each element e in v n using the following formulation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S(e, n) = 1 if e ∈ n max w i ∈n LS(e, w i ) otherwise (4)</formula><p>where LS is Lin's universal similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lin, 1998)</ref>. In other words, if the element e is present in n, S(e, n) will be 1. If not, the most similar word to e will be chosen from words in n using Lin's universal similarity and S(e, n) will be that maxi- mum score. The same procedure is applied to v m , and finally the similarity score between n and m is derived from the cosine score between v n and v m .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">WordNet-based mutual similarity</head><p>In a modified version of WordNet-based mutual similarity (Sim WM ) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mihalcea et al., 2006</ref>), we find the maximum similarity score S(w i , m) for each word w i in narrative n with words in narra- tive m as described in Equation 4. The same pro- cedure is applied to narrative m, and Sim WM is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Sim WM (n, m) = 1 2 ( w i ∈n S(w i , m) |n| + w j ∈m S(w j , n) |m| )<label>(5)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>For each of the semantic similarity measures, we build a similarity matrix comparing every possi- ble pair of children. Because this pairwise simi- larity matrix is diagonally symmetrical, we need only consider the top right section of the matrix above the diagonal in our analyses. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the mean semantic overlap scores between the nar- ratives for each of the three sub-matrices described above. We see that for both the word-overlap and the knowledge-based semantic similarity mea- sures described in Section 3, TD children are most similar to other TD children. ASD children are less similar to TD children than TD children are to one another; and children with ASD are even less similar to other ASD children than to TD children. Our goal is to explore the degree of similar- ity, as measured by the semantic overlap mea- sures, within and across diagnostic groups. With this in mind, we consider the following three sub-matrices for each similarity matrix: one in which each TD child is compared with every other TD.TD TD.ASD ASD.ASD   TD child (the TD.TD sub-matrix); one in which each ASD child is compared with every other ASD child (the ASD.ASD sub-matrix); and one in which each child is compared with the children in the diagnostic group to which he does not belong (the TD.ASD sub-matrix).</p><p>Note that we have no a priori reason to assume that the similarity scores are from any particu- lar distribution. In order to calculate the statis- tical significance of these between-group differ- ences, we therefore apply a Monte Carlo permu- tation method, a non-parametric procedure com- monly used in non-standard significance testing situations. For each pair of sub-matrices (e.g., TD.TD vs ASD.ASD) we calculate two statistics that compare the cells in one sub-matrix with the cells in other sub-matrices: the t-statistic, using the Welch Two Sample t-test; and the w-statistic, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We next take a large random sample with replacement from all possible permutations of the data by shuffling the diagnosis labels of the children 1000 times. We then calculate two above statistics for each shuffle and count the number of times the observed values exceed the values produced by the 1000 shuffles.</p><p>Applying the Monte Carlo permutation method, we calculate the statistical significance of the following comparisons: TD.TD vs ASD.ASD; TD.TD vs TD.ASD; and TD.ASD vs ASD.ASD. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarizes the results of these signifi- cance tests. In all cases, the differences are signif- icant at p &lt; 0.05 except for the first two compar- isons in the t-test permutation of Sim RF , which narrowly eluded significance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and future work</head><p>High-functioning children with ASD have long been described as "little professors", using pedan- tic or overly-adult language <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Asperger, 1944)</ref>. Low lexical overlap similarity measures by them- selves might indicate that children with ASD are using semantically appropriate but infrequent or sophisticated words that were not used by other children. We note, however, that the knowledge- based overlap measures follow the same pattern as the purely lexical overlap measures. This sug- gests that it not the case that children with ASD are simply using rare synonyms of the more com- mon words used by TD children. Instead, it seems that the children with ASD are moving away from the target topic and following their own individual and idiosyncratic semantic paths. These findings provide additional quantitative evidence not only for the common qualitative observation that young children with ASD have difficulty with topic main- tenance but also for the more general behavioral symptom of idiosyncratic and restricted interests. The overlap measures presented in this paper could be used as features for machine learning classification of ASD in combination with other linguistic features we have explored, including the use of off-topic lexical items ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rouhizadeh et al., 2013)</ref>, features associated with poor pragmatic competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Prud'hommeaux et al., 2014)</ref>, and repetitive language measures . Recall, however, that a clinician must con- sider a wide range of social, communication, and behavioral criteria when making a diagnosis of ASD, making it unlikely that language features alone could perfectly predict a diagnosis of ASD. The more significant potential in our approaches is more likely to lie in the area of language deficit detection and remediation.</p><p>A focus of our future work will be to manually annotate the data to determine the frequency and nature of the topic excursions. It is our expecta- tion that children with ASD do not only veer from the target topic more frequently than typically de- veloping children but also pursue topics of their own individual specific interests. We also plan to apply our methods to ASR output rather than man- ual transcripts. Despite the high word error rates typically observed with this sort of audio data, we anticipate that our methods, which rely primarily on content words, will be relatively robust.</p><p>The work presented here demonstrates the util- ity of applying automated analysis methods to spo- ken language collected in a clinical settings for diagnostic and remedial purposes. Carefully de- signed tools using such methods could provide helpful information not only to clinicians and ther- apists working with children with ASD but also to researchers exploring the specific linguistic and behavioral deficits associated with ASD.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>SimJac</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
