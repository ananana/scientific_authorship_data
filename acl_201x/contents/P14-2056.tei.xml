<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Computationally analyzing the social context in which language is used has gathered great interest within the NLP community recently. One of the areas that has generated substantial research is the study of how social power relations between peo- ple affect and/or are revealed in their interactions with one another. Researchers have proposed sys- tems to detect social power relations between par- ticipants of organizational email threads <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bramsen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gilbert, 2012;</ref>, online forums (Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Mizil et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Biran et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2013</ref>), chats <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Strzalkowski et al., 2012)</ref>, and off-line interactions such as pres- idential debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Nguyen et al., 2013)</ref>. Automatically identifying power and influence from interactions can have many prac- tical applications ranging from law enforcement and intelligence to online marketing. A significant number of these studies are per- formed in the domain of organizational email where there is a well defined notion of power (or- ganizational hierarchy). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bramsen et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gilbert (2012)</ref> predict hierarchical power relations between people in the Enron email corpus using lexical features extracted from all the messages exchanged between them. However, their ap- proaches primarily apply to situations where large collections of messages exchanged between pairs of people are available. In , we introduced the problem of detect- ing whether a participant of an email thread has power over someone else in the thread and estab- lished the importance of dialog structure in that task. However, in that work we did not detect over whom that person has power.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a new problem for- mulation. We predict the hierarchical power rela- tion between pairs of participants in an email in- teraction thread based solely on features extracted from that thread. As a second major contribution, we introduce a new set of features to capture as- pects of participant behavior such as responsive- ness, and we show that these features are signifi- cantly correlated with the direction of power. We present a fully automatic system for this task ob- taining an accuracy of 73.0%, an improvement of 6.9% over 68.3% by a system using only lexical features. This best-performing system uses our new feature set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Motivation</head><p>Early NLP-based approaches such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bramsen et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gilbert (2012)</ref> built systems to pre- dict hierarchical power relations between people in the Enron email corpus using lexical features from all the messages exchanged between them. One limitation of this approach is that it relies solely on lexical cues and hence works best when large collections of messages exchanged between the pairs of people are available. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bramsen et al. (2011)</ref> excluded sender-recipient pairs who exchanged fewer than 500 words from their evaluation set, since they found smaller text samples are harder to classify. By taking the mes- sage out of the context of the interaction in which it was exchanged, they fail to utilize cues from the structure of interactions, which complements the lexical cues in detecting power relations, as we showed in ).</p><p>We modeled the problem of detecting power re- lationships differently in : we predicted whether a participant in an email thread has a certain type of power or not. However, in that work we did not pre- dict over whom he/she has that power. This may result in noisy features; consider a thread in which participant X has power over participant Y, who has power over participant Z. By ag- gregating features over all messages sent by Y, features salient to a subordinate-superior interac- tion are incorrectly conflated with those salient to superior-subordinate interaction. Another limita- tion of ) is that we used manual annotations for many of our fea- tures such as dialog acts and overt displays of power. Relying on manual annotations for features limited our analysis to a small subset of the Enron corpus, which has only 18 instances of hierarchi- cal power. Consequently, our findings with respect to hierarchical power were weak in terms of both correlations of features and system performance.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce the problem of pre- dicting who has power over whom in pairs of inter- acting participants based on a single thread of in- teractions. <ref type="bibr">From (Bramsen et al., 2011</ref>) we retain the idea that we want to predict the power relation between pairs of people. But in contrast to their formulation, we retain the goal from ) that we want to study com- munication in the context of an interaction, and that we want to be able to make predictions us- ing only the emails exchanged in a single thread. <ref type="bibr">Like (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2013)</ref>, we use features to capture the dialog structure, but we use automatic taggers to generate them and assume no manual annotation at all at training or test time. This allows us to use the entire Enron email cor- pus for this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>In this work, we use the version of Enron email corpus by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Yeh and Harnly (2006)</ref> which captures the thread structure of email exchanges. The cor- pus contains 36,615 email threads. We excluded a small subset of 419 threads that was used for pre- vious manual annotation efforts, part of which was also used to train the DA and ODP taggers (Sec- tion 5) that generate features for our system. The average number of email messages per thread was around 3. We divided the remaining threads into train (50%), dev (25%) and test (25%) sets by ran- dom sampling. We then applied various basic NLP preprocessing steps such as tokenization, POS tag- ging and lemmatization to the body of email mes- sages. We use the Enron gold organizational hier- archy released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al. (2012)</ref> to model hierarchical power. Their corpus was manually built using information from Enron organizational charts. It includes relations of 1,518 employees and captures dominance relations between 13,724 pairs of them. Theirs is the largest such data set available to the best of our knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Problem Formulation</head><p>Let t denote an email thread and M t denote the set of all messages in t. Also, let P t be the set of all participants in t, i.e., the union of senders and recipients (To and CC) of all messages in M t . We are interested in detecting power rela- tions between pairs of participants who interact within a given email thread. Not every pair of par- ticipants (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ P t × P t interact with one an- other within t. Let IM t (p 1 , p 2 ) denote the set of Interaction Messages -non-empty messages in t in which either p 1 is the sender and p 2 is one of the recipients or vice versa. We call the set of</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(p 1 , p 2 ) such that |IM t (p 1 , p 2 )| &gt; 0 the interact- ing participant pairs of t (IPP t ).</formula><p>We focus on the manifestations of power in in- teractions between people across different levels of hierarchy. For every (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ IPP t , we query the set of dominance relations in the gold hierar- chy to determine their hierarchical power relation (HP (p 1 , p 2 )). We exclude pairs that do not exist in the gold hierarchy from our analysis and denote the remaining set of related interacting participant pairs as RIPP t . We assign HP (p 1 , p 2 ) to be su- perior if p 1 dominates p 2 , and subordinate if p 2 dominates p 1 . <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the total number of pairs in IPP t and RIPP t from all the threads in our corpus and across train, dev and test sets. Given a thread t and a pair of participants (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ RIPP t , we want to automatically de- tect HP (p 1 , p 2 ). This problem formulation is similar to the ones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bramsen et al., 2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gilbert, 2012)</ref>. However, the difference is that for us an instance is a pair of participants in a single thread of interaction (which may or may not in- clude other people), whereas for them an instance constitutes all messages exchanged between a pair of people in the entire corpus. Our formula- tion also differs from ) in that we detect power relations between pairs of participants, instead of just whether a par- ticipant had power over anyone in the thread.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Structural Analysis</head><p>In this section we analyze various features that capture the structure of interaction between the pairs of participants in a thread. Each feature f is extracted with respect to a person p over a ref- erence set of messages M (denoted f p M ). For a pair (p 1 , p 2 ), we extract 4 versions of each fea-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ture f : f p 1 IMt (p 1 ,p 2 ) , f p 2 IMt (p 1 ,p 2 ) , f p 1 Mt and f p 2</formula><p>Mt . The first two capture behavior of the pair among them- selves, while the third and fourth capture their overall behavior in the entire thread. We group our features into three categories -THR New , THR PR and DIA PR . THR New is a set of new features we propose, while THR PR and DIA PR incorporate fea- tures we proposed in . THR New and THR PR capture the structure of message exchanges without looking at the con- tent of the emails (e.g., how many emails did a per- son send), while DIA PR captures the pragmatics of the dialog and requires an analysis of the content of the emails (e.g., did they issue any requests).</p><p>THR New : This is a new set of features we in- troduce in this paper. It includes the average num- ber of recipients (AvgRecipients) and To recipients (AvgToRecipients) in emails sent by p, the per- centage of emails p received in which he/she was in the To list (InToList%), boolean features de- noting whether p added or removed people when responding to a message (AddPerson and Re- movePerson), average number of replies received per message sent by p (ReplyRate) and average number of replies received from the other person of the pair to messages where he/she was a To re- cipient (ReplyRateWithinPair). ReplyRateWithin- Pair applies only to IM t (p 1 , p 2 ).</p><p>THR PR : This feature set includes two meta- data based feature sets -positional and verbosity. Positional features include a boolean feature to de- note whether p sent the first message (Initiate), and relative positions of p's first and last messages (FirstMsgPos and LastMsgPos) in M . Verbosity features include p's message count (MsgCount), message ratio (MsgRatio), token count (Token- Count), token ratio (TokenRato) and tokens per message (TokenPerMsg), all calculated over M .</p><p>DIA PR : In (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2013), we used dialog features derived from manual an- notations -dialog acts (DA) and overt displays of power (ODP) -to model the structure of inter- actions within the message content. In this work, we obtain DA and ODP tags on the entire cor- pus using automatic taggers trained on those man- ual annotations. The DA tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Omuya et al., 2013</ref>) obtained an accuracy of 92%. The ODP tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Prabhakaran et al., 2012</ref>) obtained an ac- curacy of 96% and F-measure of 54%. The DA tagger labels each sentence to be one of the 4 dialog acts: Request Action, Request Informa- tion, Inform, and Conventional. The ODP Tag- ger identifies sentences (mostly requests) that ex- press additional constraints on its response, be- yond those introduced by the dialog act. We use 5 features: ReqAction%, ReqInform%, Inform%, Conventional%, and ODP% to capture the per- centage of sentences in messages sent by p that has each of these labels. We also use a feature to cap- ture the number of p's messages with a request that did not get a reply, i.e., dangling requests (Dan- glingReq%), over all messages sent by p.</p><p>We perform an unpaired two-sample two-tailed Student's t-Test comparing mean values of each feature for subordinates vs. superiors. For our analysis, a data point is a related interacting pair, and not a message. Hence, a message with mul- tiple recipients who have a superior/subordinate relation with the sender will contribute to features for multiple data points. We limit our analysis to the related interacting pairs from only our train set. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> presents mean values of features for subordinates and superiors at the interaction level. Thread level versions of these features also ob- tained similar results overall in terms of direction of difference and significance. We denote three significance levels -* (p &lt; .05 ), ** (p &lt; .01 ), and *** (p &lt; .001 ). To control false discovery rates in multiple testing, we adjusted the p-values <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</ref>  the main findings on the significant features below.</p><p>1. Superiors send messages addressed to more people (AvgRecipients and AvgToRecipi- ents). Consequently, they get more replies to their messages (ReplyRate). However, con- sidering messages where the other person of the pair is addressed in the To list (ReplyRate- WithinPair), subordinates get more replies. 2. Superiors issue more requests (ReqAction% and ReqInform%) and overt displays of power (ODP%). Subordinates issue more informs (Inform%) and, surprisingly, have fewer unanswered requests (DanglingReq%). 3. Superiors initiate the interactions more often than subordinates (Initiate). They also leave interactions earlier (LastMsgPos). 4. Superiors send shorter messages (Token- PerMsg). They also send more messages <ref type="bibr">(MsgCount &amp; MsgRatio)</ref> and even contribute a higher ratio of tokens in the thread (Token- Ratio) despite sending shorter messages.</p><p>Finding 1 goes in line with findings from stud- ies analyzing social networks that superiors have higher connectivity in the networks that they are part of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Rowe et al., 2007)</ref>. Intuitively, those who have higher connectivity also send emails to larger number of people, and hence our result. Since su- periors address more people in their emails, they also have a higher chance of getting replies. Find- ing 2 also aligns with the general intuition about how superiors and subordinates behave within in- teractions (e.g., superiors exhibit more overt dis- plays of power than subordinates).</p><p>Findings 3 &amp; 4 are interesting since they re- veal special characteristics of threads involving hi- erarchically related participants. In (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2013), we had found that persons with hierarchical power rarely initiated threads and contributed less within the threads. But that problem formulation was different -we were identifying whether a person in a given thread had hierarchical power over someone else or not. The data points in that formulation included partici- pants from threads that did not have any hierar- chically related people, whereas our current for- mulation do not. These findings suggest that if a person starts an email thread, he's likely not to be the one who has power, but if a thread includes a pair of people who are hierarchically related, then it is likely to be initiated by the superior and he/she tends to contribute more in such threads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Predicting Direction of Power</head><p>We build an SVM-based supervised learning sys- tem that can predict HP (p 1 , p 2 ) to be either su- perior or subordinate based on the interaction within a thread t for any pair of participants (p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ RIPP t . We deterministically fix the order of participants in (p 1 , p 2 ) such that p 1 is the sender of the first message in IM t (p 1 , p 2 ). We use the ClearTK ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ogren et al., 2008)</ref> wrapper for SVMLight <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Joachims, 1999</ref>) in our experiments. We use the related interacting participant pairs in threads from the train set to train our models and optimize our performance on those from the dev set. We report results obtained on dev and test sets.</p><p>In our formulation, values of many features are undefined for some instances (e.g., Inform% is un- defined when MsgCount = 0). Handling of unde- fined values for features in SVM is not straight- forward. Most SVM implementations assume the value of 0 by default in such cases, conflating them  with cases where Inform% is truly 0. In order to mitigate this issue, we use an indicator feature for each structural feature to denote whether or not it is valid. Since we use a quadratic kernel, we ex- pect the SVM to pick up the interaction between each feature and its indicator feature. Lexical features have already been shown to be valuable in predicting power relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bramsen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gilbert, 2012)</ref>. We use another fea- ture set LEX to capture word ngrams, POS (part of speech) ngrams and mixed ngrams. A mixed ngram <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Prabhakaran et al., 2012</ref>) is a special case of word ngram where words belonging to open classes are replaced with their POS tags. We found the best setting to be using both unigrams and bi- grams for all three types of ngrams, by tuning in our dev set. We then performed experiments using all subsets of {LEX, THR New , THR PR , DIA PR }. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> presents the results obtained using var- ious feature subsets. We use a majority class baseline assigning HP (p 1 , p 2 ) to be always su- perior, which obtains 52.5% accuracy. We also use a stronger baseline using word unigrams and bigrams as features, which obtained an accuracy of 68.6%. The performance of the system using each structural feature class on its own is very low. Combining all three of them improves the accuracy to 62.5%. The highest performance ob- tained without using any message content is for THR PR and THR New (61.5%). LEX features by itself obtain a very high accuracy of 70.7%, con- firming the importance of lexical patterns in this task. Perplexingly, adding all structural features to LEX reduces the accuracy by around 2.2 percent- age points. The best performing system (BEST) uses LEX and THR New features and obtains an accuracy of 73.0%, a statistically significant im- provement over the LEX-only system (McNemar).</p><p>We also performed an ablation study to under- stand the importance of different slices of our fea- ture sets. If we remove all feature versions with respect to the second person, the accuracy drops to 72.1%. This suggests that features about the other person's behavior also help the prediction task. If we remove either the thread level versions of features or interaction level versions of features, the accuracy again drops, suggesting that both the pair's behavior among themselves, and their over- all behavior in the thread add value to the predic- tion task. Removing the indicator feature denot- ing the structural features' validity also reduces the performance of the system.</p><p>We now discuss evaluation on our blind test set. The majority baseline (Always Superior) for ac- curacy is 55.0%. The word unigrams and bigrams baseline obtains an accuracy of 68.3%. The LEX system (using other forms of ngrams as well) ob- tains a slightly lower accuracy of 68.1%. Our BEST system using LEX and THR New features obtains an accuracy of 73.0% (coincidentally the same as on the dev set), an improvement of 6.9% over the system using only lexical features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We introduced the problem of predicting who has power over whom based on a single thread of writ- ten interactions. We introduced a new set of fea- tures which describe the structure of the dialog. Using this feature set, we obtain an accuracy of 73.0% on a blind test. In future work, we will tackle the problem of three-way classification of pairs of participants, which will cover cases in which they are not in a power relation at all.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>).
