			<abstract>
				<p>Pronouns are frequently dropped in Chi-nese sentences, especially in informal data such as text messages. In this work we propose a solution to recover dropped pronouns in SMS data. We manually annotate dropped pronouns in 684 SMS files and apply machine learning algorithms to recover them, leveraging lexical, contextual and syntactic information as features. We believe this is the first work on recovering dropped pronouns in Chinese text messages .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Text messages generated by users via SMS or Chat have distinct linguistic characteristics that pose unique challenges for existing natural language processing techniques. Since such text messages are often generated via mobile devices in infor- mal settings and are limited in length, abbrevia- tions and omissions are commonplace. In this pa- per, we report work on detecting one particular type of omission in Chinese text messages, namely dropped pronouns.</p><p>It is well-known that Chinese is a pro-drop lan- guage, meaning pronouns can be dropped from a sentence without causing the sentence to be- come ungrammatical or incomprehensible when the identity of the pronoun can be inferred from the context. Pronouns can be dropped even in formal text genres like newswire, but the extent to which this happens and the types of pronouns that are dropped in text messages and formal gen- res like newswire are very different. For exam- ple, the most frequently dropped pronouns in Chi- nese newswire is the third person singular 它("it") ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baran et al. 2012 )</ref>, and one reason is that first and second person pronouns are rarely used in newswire in the first place. In contrast, in text messages, the first person singular 我 and the second person singular 你 are commonly found in text messages due to their conversational style, and they are often dropped as well when their ref- erent is understood in the context. This is illus- trated in (1), where there are instances of dropped first person singular, second person singular and third person singular pronouns. There is also an instance where the dropped pronoun in Chinese does not have any actual referent, translating to the English pleonastic "it". Dropped pronouns are in parentheses: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1) A 你们 your 那 area 下雪 snow 了 ASP , , 你 you 怎么 how 去 go 上班 work "</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">看来 look like 交通业 transportation 还是 比较 relatively 发达 developed 的.</formula><p>"(It) looks like you have a relatively de- veloped transportation system."</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">B (pleonastic) (it) 下雪 snow (我) (I) 就 then 不 not 能 can 上班 go to work 了 ASP "When (it) snows, (I) cannot go to work." B (它) (it) 还可以 OK "(It) is OK."</formula><p>Detecting dropped pronouns involves first of all determining where in the sentence pronouns are dropped and then determining what the dropped pronoun is, i.e., whether the dropped pronoun should be 我, 你, 他, etc. The dropped pronoun could either correspond to one of possible pro- nouns in Chinese, or it can be an abstract pronoun that does not correspond to any of the Chinese pronouns. For example, Chinese does not have a pronoun that is the equivalent of the pleonastic "it" in English, but there are sentences in which a dropped pronoun occurs in a context that is sim- ilar to where "it" occurs. In this case we label the dropped pronoun as a type of abstract pronoun. Note that we do not attempt to resolve these pro- nouns to an antecedent in this work. We think there is value in just detecting these pronouns. For example, if we translate Chinese sentences with dropped pronouns into English, they may have to be made explicit.</p><p>We approach this as a supervised learning prob- lem, so first we need a corpus annotated with the location and type of dropped pronouns to train machine learning models. We annotated 292,455 words of Chinese SMS/Chat data with dropped pronouns and we describe our annotation in more detail in Section 2. We then present our machine learning approach in Section 3. Experimental re- sults are presented in Section 4, and related work is described in Section 5. Finally we conclude in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Dropped pronoun annotation</head><p>We annotated 684 Chinese SMS/Chat files follow- ing the dropped pronoun annotation guidelines de- scribed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baran et al. 2012</ref> ). The original guide- lines are mainly designed for annotating dropped pronouns in newswire text, and we had to extend the guidelines to accommodate SMS/Chat data. For example, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baran et al. 2012</ref> ) identify 14 types of pronouns, which include four abstract pronouns which do not correspond to any actual pronouns in Chinese. To accommodate SMS/Chat data, we add one more type of abstract pronoun that refers to the previous utterance. The full list of pronouns that we use are listed below:</p><p>1. 我(I): first person singular 2. 我们(we): first person plural 3. 你(you): second person singular 4. 你们(you): second person plural 5. 他(he): third person masculine singular 6. 他们(they): third person masculine plural 7. 她(she): third person feminine singular 8. 她们(they): third person feminine plural 9. 它(it): third person inanimate singular 10. 它们(they): third person inanimate plural 11. Event: abstract pronoun that refers to an event 12. Existential: abstract pronoun that refers to existential subject 13. Pleonastic: abstract pronoun that refers to pleonastic subject 14. generic: abstract pronoun that refers to something generic or unspecific 15. Previous Utterance: abstract pronoun that refers to previous utterance 16. Other: cases where it is unclear what the cor- rect pronoun should be</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Learning</head><p>We have formulated dropped pronoun recovery as a sequential tagging problem, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Yang and Xue. 2010 )</ref>. We check each word token in a sentence and decide if there is a pronoun dropped before this word. If there is one, then we further identify what type of pronoun it should be. Instead of doing this in two separate steps, we trained a 17- class Maximum Entropy classifier with the Mallet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">McCallum et al. 2002)</ref> machine learning pack- age to tag each word token with one of the pro- nouns or None in one run. None indicates that there is no dropped pronoun before this word.</p><p>We leveraged a set of lexical features from pre- vious work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Yang and Xue. 2010 )</ref>. To our knowl- edge, the work we report here represents the first effort on dropped pronoun recovery on Chinese SMS/Chat data. As described in Section 2, SMS data is different from newswire data which is com- monly used in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Converse. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Zhao and Ng. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Peng and Araki. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kong and Zhou. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chung and Gildea 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cai et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Xiang et al. 2013</ref>) in many aspects. The frequency of pronoun being dropped is much higher in SMS/Chat data compared to newswire data. The distribution of dropped pronoun types in SMS data is also very different from that of newswire data. In SMS/Chat data, the identities of the participants who send the messages are crit- ical in identifying the dropped pronoun type, while there is no participant information in newswire data. Thus, we also design a new set of context based features to capture the stylistic properties of text messages.</p><p>Lexical Features: Information embedded in the target and surrounding words provide clues for identifying dropped pronouns, e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(2) (它) (it) 坏 broken 了 ASP . . "(It) is broken."</formula><p>In (2), a pronoun is dropped at the beginning of the sentence. The follwing words "坏了" means "is broken", and it indicates that the subject refers to a thing, not a person. Part-of-speech tags are also crucial in finding the location of a dropped pronoun. Just like pronouns are usually located before verbs, it is more likely to have a pronoun dropped before an verb than a noun. We imple- mented a set of lexical features along with part-of- speech tags within a sliding window of five words to capture such information. The contextual fea- tures are listed below:</p><p>• unigrams within current window;</p><p>• previous and following (including current word) bigrams; • POS tags of unigrams within current window;</p><p>• POS tags of the previous and following (in- cluding current word) bigrams; • POS tags of the following (including current word) trigram; • combination previous word and POS tag of current word; • combination of POS tag of previous word and current word; • POS tag sequence from the previous word to the beginning of a sentence or a punctuation mark.</p><p>Context-based Features: It is hard to recover dropped pronouns without understanding the con- text. In SMS data, one sometimes needs to trace back a few sentences to figure out what a dropped pronoun refers to. In (3), the two sentences are attributed to the same person, and a pronoun is dropped at the be- ginning of the second sentence. While we could easily understand the dropped pronoun refers to "我(I)" from the previous sentence, it is difficult to make this determination by just looking at the second sentence independently. Thus, we propose a list of novel context-based features tailored to- wards SMS/Chat data to capture such information:</p><p>• previous pronoun used by the same partici- pant; • previous pronoun used by the other partici- pant; • all previous pronouns till the beginning of a sentence or a punctuation mark used; • next punctuation mark;</p><p>• if it is a question;</p><p>• if the POS tag of the last word is SP;</p><p>• for the first word in a sentence, use first two nouns/pronouns from the previous sentence.</p><p>Syntactic Features: Syntactic features have been shown to be useful in previous work (?). We also implemented the following syntactic features:</p><p>• if it is the left frontier of the lowest IP an- tecedent; • if current word is "有", then find it's subject;</p><p>• path from current word to the root node.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>: Training, development and test data on SMS data set.</p></div>

To obtain syntactic features, we divided 684 SMS files into 10 portions, and parsed each portion with a model trained on other portions, using the Berkeley parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Petrov and Klein 2007)</ref>. The parsing accuracy stands at 82.11% (F-score), with a precision of 82.57% and a recall of 81.65%. The results of our experiments are presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: precision, recall and f-score for differ- ent dropped pronoun categories on test set. The combination of "我(I)", "你(singular you)" and "utterance" accounts for 63.7% of the overall dropped pronoun population. The overall accu- racy is 92.1%. "NE" stands for None, meaning there is no dropped pronoun.</p><note type="other">.(%) rec.(%) f. count NE 99.1 95.7 97.3 28963 我 48 53.1 50.4 1155 你 34.4 48.1 40.1 787 它 12.1 54.6 19.8 488 prev utterance 87.6 65.3 74.8 314 pleonastic 7 10.2 8.3 172 她 4.3 27.8 7.4 117 他 11 22.2 14.7 109 我们 24 41 30.3 104 generic 6.6 17.1 9.5 91 他们 2.7 11.1 4.4 73 event 4.3 25 7.3 47 它们 4.7 100 8.9 43 other 0 0 0 16 你们 0 0 0 13 existential 12.5 2 3.4 8 她们 0 0 0 2</note></div>

However, it is hard for the classifier to recover "它(it)", e.g., "*pro* 这种？(*pro* that kind?)"</p><p>SMS sentences are usually short. To understand what the dropped pronoun stands for, one needs to look at its previous context. But it is hard for ma- chine to capture such long distance information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>One line of work that is closely related to ours is zero pronoun resolution. In zero pronoun reso- lution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Converse. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Zhao and Ng. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Peng and Araki. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kong and Zhou. 2010)</ref>, pronouns are typically resolved in three steps: zero pronoun detection, anaphoricity determina- tion, and antecedent resolution. In the work we  Dropped pronoun detection is also related to Empty Category (EC) detection and resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chung and Gildea 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cai et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Xiang et al. 2013</ref>), the aim of which is to recover long-distance dependencies, discontinuous con- stituents, and certain dropped elements in phrase structure treebanks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Marcus et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Xue et al. 2005</ref>). In previous work on EC detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chung and Gildea 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cai et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Xiang et al. 2013</ref>), ECs are recovered from newswire data by leveraging lexical and syntactic informa- tion from each sentence. Context information be- yond the current sentence is typically not used. When recovering dropped pronouns in SMS/Chat messages, it is crucially important to make use of information beyond the current sentence.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">NE 我 你 它 ut pl 她 他 我们 ge 他 们 ev 它们 ot 你们 ex</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we report work on recovering dropped pronouns in Chinese SMS/Chat mes- sages. Based on the properties of SMS data, we designed a set of lexical, contextual and syntac- tic features, and trained a Maxent classifier to recover dropped pronouns in Chinese SMS/Chat messages. We believe this is the first work on re- covering dropped pronouns in Chinese text mes- sages. This proves to be a very challenging task, and much remains to be done. In future work, we plan to experiment with applying more expressive machine learning techniques to this task.</p></div>
