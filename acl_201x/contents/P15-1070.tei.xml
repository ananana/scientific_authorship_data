				<p>Traditional approaches to word sense dis-ambiguation (WSD) rest on the assumption that there exists a single, unambigu-ous communicative intention underlying every word in a document. However, writers sometimes intend for a word to be interpreted as simultaneously carrying multiple distinct meanings. This deliberate use of lexical ambiguity-i.e., punning-is a particularly common source of humour. In this paper we describe how traditional, language-agnostic WSD approaches can be adapted to &quot;disambiguate&quot; puns, or rather to identify their double meanings. We evaluate several such approaches on a manually sense-annotated collection of English puns and observe performance exceeding that of some knowledge-based and supervised baselines.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Word sense disambiguation, or WSD, is the task of identifying a word's meaning in context. No matter whether it is performed by a human or a machine, WSD usually rests on the assumption that there is a single unambiguous communicative intention underlying each word in the document. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> However, there exists a class of language constructs known <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Under this assumption, lexical ambiguity arises due to there being a plurality of words with the same surface form but different meanings, and the task of the interpreter is to select correctly among them. An alternative view is that each word is a single lexical entry whose specific meaning is un- derspecified until it is activated by the context <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ludlow, 1996)</ref>. In the case of systematically polysemous terms (i.e., words that have several related senses shared in a systematic way by a group of similar words), it may not be necessary to disam- biguate them at all in order to interpret the communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Buitelaar, 2000)</ref>. While there has been some research in mod- elling intentional lexical-semantic underspecification <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jurgens, 2014)</ref>, it is intended for closely related senses such as those of systematically polysemous terms, not those of coarser-grained homonyms which are the subject of this paper.</p><p>as paronomasia and syllepsis, or more generally as puns, in which homonymic (i.e., coarse-grained) lexical-semantic ambiguity is a deliberate effect of the communication act. That is, the writer intends for a certain word or other lexical item to be in- terpreted as simultaneously carrying two or more separate meanings, or alternatively for it to be un- clear which meaning is the intended one. There are a variety of motivations writers have for employing such constructions, and in turn for why such uses are worthy of scholarly investigation.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, this sort of intentional lex- ical ambiguity has attracted little attention in the fields of computational linguistics and natural lan- guage processing. What little research has been done is confined largely to computational mecha- nisms for pun generation (in the context of natu- ral language generation for computational humour) and to computational analysis of phonological prop- erties of puns. A fundamental problem which has not yet been as widely studied is the automatic detection and identification of intentional lexical ambiguity-that is, given a text, does it contain any lexical items which are used in a deliberately ambiguous manner, and if so, what are the intended meanings?</p><p>We consider these to be important research ques- tions with a number of real-world applications. For instance, puns are particularly common in ad- vertising, where they are used not only to create humour but also to induce in the audience a va- lenced attitude toward the target ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Valitutti et al., 2008)</ref>. Recognizing instances of such lexical am- biguity and understanding their affective connota- tions would be of benefit to systems performing sentiment analysis on persuasive texts. Wordplay is also a perennial topic of scholarship in literary criticism and analysis. To give just one example, puns are one of the most intensively studied as- pects of Shakespeare's rhetoric, and laborious man- ual counts have shown their frequency in certain of his plays to range from 17 to 85 instances per thousand lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Keller, 2009)</ref>. It is not hard to image how computer-assisted detection, classifi- cation, and analysis of puns could help scholars in the digital humanities. Finally, computational pun detection and understanding hold tremendous potential for machine-assisted translation. Some of the most widely disseminated and translated popu- lar discourses-particularly television shows and movies-feature puns and other forms of wordplay as a recurrent and expected feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schröter, 2005</ref>). These pose particular challenges for translators, who need not only to recognize and comprehend each instance of humour-provoking ambiguity, but also to select and implement an appropriate trans- lation strategy. 2 NLP systems could assist transla- tors in flagging intentionally ambiguous words for special attention, and where they are not directly translatable (as is usually the case), the systems may be able to propose ambiguity-preserving alter- natives which best match the original pun's double meaning.</p><p>In the present work, we discuss the adaptation of automatic word sense disambiguation techniques to intentionally ambiguous text and evaluate these adaptations in a controlled setting. We focus on humorous puns, as these are by far the most com- monly encountered and more readily available in (and extractable from) existing text corpora.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as fol- lows: In the following section we give a brief intro- duction to puns, WSD, and related previous work on computational detection and comprehension of humour. In §3 we describe the data set produced for our experiments. In § §4 and 5 we describe how disambiguation algorithms, evaluation metrics, and baselines from traditional WSD can be adapted to the task of pun identification, and in §6 we report and discuss the performance of our adapted sys- tems. Finally, we conclude in §7 with a review of our research contributions and an outline of our plans for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Puns</head><p>Punning is a form of wordplay where a word is used in such a way as to evoke several indepen- dent meanings simultaneously. Humorous and non-humorous puns have been the subject of extensive study in the humanities and social sciences, which has led to insights into the nature of language-based humour and wordplay, including their role in com- merce, entertainment, and health care; how they are processed in the brain; and how they vary over time and across cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Monnot, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Culler, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lagerwerf, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bekinschtein et al., 2011</ref>). Study of literary puns imparts a greater understanding of the cultural or historical context in which the literature was produced, which is of- ten necessary to properly interpret and translate it <ref type="bibr">(Delabastita, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Puns can be classified in various ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Attardo, 1994)</ref>, though from the point of view of our par- ticular natural language processing application the most important distinction is between homographic and homophonic puns. A homographic pun ex- ploits distinct meanings of the same written word, and a homophonic pun exploits distinct meanings of the same spoken word. Puns can be homo- graphic, homophonic, both, or neither, as the fol- lowing examples illustrate:</p><p>(1) A lumberjack's world revolves on its axes.</p><p>(2) She fell through the window but felt no pane.</p><p>(3) A political prisoner is one who stands be- hind her convictions.</p><p>(4) The sign at the nudist camp read, "Clothed until April."</p><p>In (1), the pun on axes is homographic but not homophonic, since the two meanings ("more than one axe" and "more than one axis") share the same spelling but have different pronunciations. In (2), the pun on pane ("sheet of glass") is homophonic but not homographic, since the word for the sec- ondary meaning ("feeling of injury") is properly spelled pain but pronounced the same. The pun on convictions ("strongly held beliefs" and "findings of criminal guilt") in (3) is both homographic and homophonic. Finally, the pun on clothed in (4) is neither homographic nor homophonic, since the word for the secondary meaning, closed, differs in both spelling and pronunciation. Such puns are commonly known as imperfect puns.</p><p>Other characteristics of puns important for our work include whether they involve compounds, multiword expressions, or proper names, and whether the pun's multiple meanings involve mul-tiple parts of speech. We elaborate on the signifi- cance of these characteristics in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Word sense disambiguation</head><p>Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of determining which sense of a polysemous term is the one intended when that term is used in a given communicative act. Besides the target term itself, a WSD system generally requires two inputs: the context (i.e., the running text containing the target), and a sense inventory which specifies all possible senses of the target.</p><p>Approaches to WSD can be categorized accord- ing to the type of knowledge sources used to help discriminate senses. Knowledge-based approaches restrict themselves to using pre-existing lexical- semantic resources (LSRs), or such additional infor- mation as can be automatically extracted or mined from raw text corpora. Supervised approaches, on the other hand, use manually sense-annotated cor- pora as training data for a machine learning sys- tem, or as seed data for a bootstrapping process. Supervised WSD systems generally outperform their knowledge-based counterparts, though this comes at the considerable expense of having hu- man annotators manually disambiguate hundreds or thousands of example sentences. Moreover, su- pervised approaches tend to be such that they can disambiguate only those words for which they have seen sufficient training examples to cover all senses. That is, most of them cannot disambiguate words which do not occur in the training data, nor can they select the correct sense of a known word if that sense was never observed in the training data.</p><p>Regardless of the approach, all WSD systems work by extracting contextual information for the target word and comparing it against the sense information stored for that word. A seminal knowledge-based example is the Lesk algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lesk, 1986)</ref> which disambiguates a pair of tar- get terms in context by comparing their respective dictionary definitions and selecting the two with the greatest number of words in common. Though simple, the Lesk algorithm performs surprisingly well, and has frequently served as the basis of more sophisticated approaches. In recent years, Lesk variants in which the contexts and definitions are supplemented with entries from a distributional the- saurus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lin, 1998</ref>) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for knowledge-based systems on stan- dard data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Miller et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Basile et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>In traditional word sense disambiguation, the part of speech and lemma of the target word are usually known a priori, or can be determined with high accuracy using off-the-shelf natural language processing tools. The pool of candidate senses can therefore be restricted to those whose lexicaliza- tions exactly match the target lemma and part of speech. No such help is available for puns, at least not in the general case. Take the following two examples:</p><p>(5) Tom moped.</p><p>(6) "I want a scooter," Tom moped.</p><p>In the first of these sentences, the word moped is unambiguously a verb with the lemma mope, and would be correctly recognized as such by any automatic lemmatizer and part-of-speech tagger. The moped of the second example is a pun, one of whose meanings is the same inflected form of the verb mope ("to sulk") and the other of which is the noun moped ("motorized scooter"). For such cases an automated pun identifier would therefore need to account for all possible lemmas for all possible parts of speech of the target word. The situation becomes even more onerous for heterographic and imperfect puns, which may require the use of pro- nunciation dictionaries, and application of phono- logical theories of punning, in order to recover the lemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hempelmann, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>As our research interests are in lexical semantics rather than phonology, we focus on puns which are homographic and monolexemic. This allows us to investigate the problem of pun identification in as controlled a setting as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Previous work</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Computational humour</head><p>There is some previous research on computational detection and comprehension of humour, though by and large it is not concerned specifically with puns; those studies which do analyze puns tend to have a phonological or syntactic rather than semantic bent. In this subsection we briefly review some prior work which is relevant to ours.</p><p>Yokogawa (2002) describes a system for detect- ing the presence of puns in Japanese text. However, this work is concerned only with puns which are both imperfect and ungrammatical, relying on syn- tactic cues rather than the lexical-semantic informa- tion we propose to use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Taylor and Mazlack (2004)</ref> describe an n-gram-based approach for recogniz- ing when imperfect puns are used for humorous effect in a certain narrow class of English knock- knock jokes. Their focus on imperfect puns and their use of a fixed syntactic context makes their approach largely inapplicable to perfect puns in running text. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mihalcea and Strapparava (2005)</ref> treat humour recognition as a classification task, employing various machine learning techniques on humour-specific stylistic features such as al- literation and antonymy. Of particular interest is their follow-up analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2006</ref>), where they specifically point to their sys- tem's failure to resolve lexical-semantic ambiguity as a stumbling block to better accuracy, and specu- late that deeper semantic analysis of the text, such as via word sense disambiguation or domain disam- biguation, could aid in the detection of humorous incongruity and opposition.</p><p>The previous work which is perhaps most rele- vant to ours is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mihalcea et al. (2010)</ref>. They build a data set consisting of 150 joke set-ups, each of which is followed by four possible "punchlines", only one of which is actually humorous (but not necessarily due to a pun). They then compare the set-ups against the punchlines using various models of incongruity detection, including many exploiting knowledge-based semantic relatedness such as Lesk. The Lesk model had an accuracy of 56%, which is lower than that of a na¨ıvena¨ıve pol- ysemy model which simply selects the punchline with the highest mean polysemy (66%) and even of a random-choice baseline (62%). However, it should be stressed here that the Lesk model did not directly account for the possibility that any given word might be ambiguous. Rather, for every word in the setup, the Lesk measure was used to select a word in the punchline such that the lexical overlap between each one of their possible definitions was maximized. The overlap scores for all word pairs were then averaged, and the punchline with the low- est average score selected as the most humorous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Corpora</head><p>There are a number of English-language corpora of intentional lexical ambiguity which have been used in past work, usually in linguistics or the so- cial sciences. In their work on computer-generated humour, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lessard et al. (2002)</ref> use a corpus of 374 "Tom Swifty" puns taken from the Internet, plus a well-balanced corpus of 50 humorous and non- humorous lexical ambiguities generated program- matically <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Venour, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hong and Ong (2009)</ref> also study humour in natural language generation, using a smaller data set of 27 punning riddles de- rived from a mix of natural and artificial sources. In their study of wordplay in religious advertis- ing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell et al. (2011)</ref> compile a corpus of 373 puns taken from church marquees and literature, and compare it against a general corpus of 1515 puns drawn from Internet websites and a special- ized dictionary. Zwicky and Zwicky (1986) con- duct a phonological analysis on a corpus of several thousand puns, some of which they collected them- selves from advertisements and catalogues, and the remainder of which were taken from previously published collections. Two studies on cognitive strategies used by second language learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kaplan and Lucas, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lucas, 2004</ref>) used a data set of 58 jokes compiled from newspaper comics, 32 of which rely on lexical ambiguity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bucaria (2004)</ref> conducts a linguistic analysis of a set of 135 hu- morous newspaper headlines, about half of which exploit lexical ambiguity.</p><p>Such data sets-particularly the larger ones- provided us good evidence that intentionally lexical ambiguous exemplars exist in sufficient numbers to make a rigorous evaluation of our task feasible. Un- fortunately, none of the above-mentioned corpora have been published in full, and moreover many of them contain (sometimes exclusively) the sort of imperfect or otherwise heterographic puns which we mean to exclude from consideration. This has motivated us to produce our own corpus of puns, the construction and analysis of which is described in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data set</head><p>As in traditional WSD, a prerequisite for our re- search is a corpus of examples, where one or more human annotators have already identified the am- biguous words and marked up their various mean- ings with reference to a given sense inventory. Such a corpus is sufficient for evaluating what we term pun identification or pun disambiguation-that is, identifying the senses of a term known a priori to be a pun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Construction</head><p>Though several prior studies have produced corpora of puns, none of them are systematically sense- annotated. We therefore compiled our own corpus by pooling together some of the aforementioned corpora, the user-submitted puns from the Pun of the Day website, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and private collections provided to us by some professional humorists. This raw collection of 7750 one-liners was then filtered by trained human annotators to those instances meet- ing the following four criteria:</p><p>One pun per instance: Of all the lexical units in the instance, one and only one may be a pun.</p><p>(This criterion simplifies the task detecting the presence and location of puns in a text, a clas- sification task which we intend to investigate in future work.)</p><p>One content word per pun: The lexical unit that forms the pun must consist of, or contain, only a single content word (i.e., a noun, verb, adjec- tive, or adverb), excepting adverbial particles of phrasal verbs. This criterion is important because, in our observations, it is often only one word which carries ambiguity in puns on compounds and multi-word expressions. Ac- cepting lexical units containing more than one content word would have required our annota- tors to laboriously partition the pun into (pos- sibly overlapping) sense-bearing units and to assign sense sets to each of them, inflating the complexity of the annotation task to unaccept- able levels.</p><p>Two meanings per pun: The pun must have ex- actly two distinct meanings. Though many sources state that puns have only two senses <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Redfern, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Attardo, 1994)</ref>, our annota- tors identified a handful of corpus examples where the pun could plausibly be analyzed as carrying three distinct meanings. To simplify our manual annotation procedure and our eval- uation metrics we excluded these rare outliers.</p><p>Weak homography: The lexical units corre- sponding to the two distinct meanings must be spelled exactly the same way, except that parti- cles and inflections may be disregarded. This somewhat softer definition of homography al- lows us to admit a good many morphologi- cally interesting cases which were nonetheless readily recognized by our human annotators.</p><p>The filtering reduced the number of instances to 1652, whose puns two human judges anno- tated with sense keys from WordNet 3.1 <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>. Using an online annotation tool specially constructed for this study, the annotators applied two sets of sense keys to each instance, one for each of the two meanings of the pun. For cases where the distinction between WordNet's fine-grained senses was irrelevant, the annotators had the option of labelling the meaning with more than one sense key. Annotators also had the option of marking a meaning as unassignable if WordNet had no cor- responding sense key. Further details of our anno- tation tool and its use can be found in Miller and Turkovi´cTurkovi´c (2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Analysis</head><p>Our judges agreed on which word was the pun in 1634 out of 1652 cases, a raw agreement of 98.91%. For the agreed cases, we used DKPro Agreement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Meyer et al., 2014</ref>) to compute Krip- pendorff's α ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Krippendorff, 1980)</ref> for the sense annotations. This is a chance-correcting metric of inter-annotator agreement ranging in (−1, 1], where 1 indicates perfect agreement, −1 perfect disagreement, and 0 the expected score for ran- dom labelling. Our distance metric for α is a straightforward adaptation of the MASI set compar- ison metric ). Whereas standard MASI, d M (A, B), compares two annotation sets A and B, our annotations take the form of unordered pairs of sets {A 1 , A 2 } and {B 1 , B 2 }. We therefore find the mapping between elements of the two pairs that gives the lowest total distance, and halve it:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d M ({A 1 , A 2 } , {B 1 , B 2 }) = 1 2 min(d M (A 1 , B 1 ) + d M (A 2 , B 2 ), d M (A 1 , B 2 ) + d M (A 2 , B 1 )</formula><p>). With this method we observe a Krippendorff's α of 0.777; this is only slightly below the 0.8 threshold recom- mended by Krippendorff, and far higher than what has been reported in other sense annotation studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jurgens and Klapaftis, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Where possible, we resolved sense annotation disagreements automatically by taking the intersec- tion of corresponding sense sets. Where the an- notators' sense sets were disjoint or contradictory (including the cases where the annotators disagreed on the pun word), we had a human adjudicator at- tempt to resolve the disagreement in favour of one annotator or the other. This left us with 1607 in- stances, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> of which we retained only the 1298 that had successful (i.e., not marked as unassignable) annotations for the present study. The contexts in this data set range in length from 3 to 44 words, with an average length of 11.9. The 2596 meanings carry sense key annotations corresponding to any- where from one to seven WordNet synsets, with an average of 1.08. As expected, then, WordNet's sense granularity proved to be somewhat finer than necessary to characterize the meanings in the data set, though only marginally so.</p><p>Of the 2596 individual meanings, 1303 (50.2%) were annotated with noun senses only, 877 (33.8%) with verb senses only, 340 (13.1%) with adjective senses only, and 41 (1.6%) with adverb senses only. Only 35 individual meanings (1.3%) carry sense an- notations corresponding to multiple parts of speech. However, for 297 (22.9%) of our puns, the two meanings had different parts of speech. Similarly, sense annotations for each individual meaning cor- respond to anywhere from one to four different lemmas, with a mean of 1.25. These observations confirm the concerns we raised in §2.2 that pun disambiguators, unlike traditional WSD systems, cannot always rely on the output of a lemmatizer or part-of-speech tagger to narrow down the list of sense candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Pun disambiguation</head><p>It has long been observed that gloss overlap-based WSD systems, such as those based on the Lesk algorithm, fail to distinguish between candidate senses when their definitions have a similar over- lap with the target word's context. In some cases this is because the overlap is negligible or nonexis- tent; this is known as the lexical gap problem, and various solutions to it are discussed in (inter alia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Miller et al. (2012)</ref>. In other cases, the indecision arises because the definitions provided by the sense inventory are too fine-grained; this problem has been addressed, with varying degrees of success, through sense clustering or coarsening techniques (a short but reasonably comprehensive survey of which appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Matuschek et al. (2014)</ref>). A third condition under which senses cannot be discrimi- nated is when the target word is used in an under- specified or intentionally ambiguous manner. We hold that for this third scenario a disambiguator's inability to discriminate senses should not be seen as a failure condition, but rather as a limitation of the WSD task as traditionally defined. By re- framing the task so as to permit the assignment of multiple senses (or groups of senses), we can allow disambiguation systems to sense-annotate in- tentionally ambiguous constructions such as puns.</p><p>Many approaches to WSD, including Lesk-like algorithms, involve computing some score for all possible senses of a target word, and then select- ing the single highest-scoring one as the "correct" sense. The most straightforward modification of these techniques to pun disambiguation, then, is to have the systems select the two top-scoring senses, one for each meaning of the pun. Accord- ingly we applied this modification to the following knowledge-based WSD algorithms:</p><p>Simplified Lesk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000</ref>) disambiguates a target word by examin- ing the definitions 5 for each of its candidate senses and selecting the single sense-or in our case, the two senses-which have the greatest number of words in common with the context. As we previously demonstrated that puns often transcend part of speech, our pool of candidate senses is constructed as follows: we apply a morphological analyzer to recover all possible lemmas of the target word without respect to part of speech, and for each lemma we add all its senses to the pool.</p><p>Simplified extended <ref type="bibr">Lesk (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010</ref>) is similar to simplified Lesk, except that the definition for each sense is concatenated with those of neighbouring senses in Word- Net's semantic network.</p><p>Simplified lexically expanded <ref type="bibr">Lesk (Miller et al., 2012</ref>) is also based on simplified Lesk, with the extension that every word in the context and sense definitions is expanded with up to 100 entries from a large distributional thesaurus.</p><p>The above algorithms fail to make a sense as- signment when more than two senses are tied for the highest lexical overlap, or when there is a single highest-scoring sense but multiple senses are tied for the second-highest overlap. We therefore de- vised two pun-specific tie-breaking strategies. The first is motivated by the informal observation that, though the two meanings of a pun may have dif- ferent parts of speech, at least one of the parts of speech is grammatical in the context of the sentence, and so would probably be the one as- signed by a stochastic or rule-based POS tagger. Our "POS" tie-breaker therefore preferentially se- lects the best sense, or pair of senses, whose POS matches the one applied to the target by the Stan- ford POS tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>). For our second tie-breaking strategy, we posit that since humour derives from the resolution of semantic in- congruity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Raskin, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Attardo, 1994)</ref>, puns are more likely to exploit coarse-grained homonymy than than fine-grained systematic polysemy. Thus, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Matuschek et al. (2014)</ref>, we induced a clustering of WordNet senses by aligning WordNet to the more coarse-grained OmegaWiki LSR. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Our "cluster" fallback works the same as the "POS" one, with the addition that any remaining ties among senses with the second-highest overlap are resolved by preferentially selecting those which are not in the same induced cluster as, and which in Word- Net's semantic network are at least three edges distant from, the sense with the highest overlap.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Scoring</head><p>In traditional word sense disambiguation, in vitro evaluations are conducted by comparing the senses assigned by the disambiguation system to the gold- standard senses assigned by the human annotators. For the case that the system and gold-standard as- signments consist of a single sense each, the exact- match criterion is used: the system receives a score of 1 if it chose the sense specified by the gold stan- dard, and 0 otherwise. Where the system selects a single sense for an instance for which there is more than one correct gold standard sense, the mul- tiple tags are interpreted disjunctively-that is, the system receives a score of 1 if it chose any one of the gold-standard senses, and 0 otherwise. Overall performance is reported in terms of coverage (the number of targets for which a sense assignment was attempted), precision (the sum of scores di- vided by the number of attempted targets), recall (the sum of scores divided by the total number of targets in the data set), and F 1 (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Palmer et al., 2006</ref>).</p><p>The traditional approach to scoring individual targets is not usable as-is for pun disambiguation, because each pun carries two disjoint but equally valid sets of sense annotations. Instead, since our systems assign exactly one sense to each of the pun's two sense sets, we count this as a match (scoring 1) only if each chosen sense can be found in one of the gold-standard sense sets, and no two gold-standard sense sets contain the same chosen sense. (As with traditional WSD scoring, various approaches could be used to assign credit for par- tially correct assignments, though we leave explo- ration of these to future work.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Baselines</head><p>System performance in WSD is normally inter- preted with reference to one or more baselines. To our knowledge, ours is the very first study of auto- matic pun disambiguation on any scale, so at this point there are no previous systems against which to compare our results. However, traditional WSD systems are often compared with two na¨ıvena¨ıve base- lines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gale et al., 1992</ref>) which can be adapted for our purposes.</p><p>The first of these na¨ıvena¨ıve baselines is to randomly select from among the candidate senses. In tradi- tional WSD, the score for a random disambiguator which selects a single sense for a given target t is the number of gold-standard senses divided by the number of candidate senses: score(t) = g(t) ÷ δ (t). In our pun disambiguation task, however, a ran- dom disambiguator must select two senses-one for each of the sense sets g 1 (t) and g 2 (t)-and these senses must be distinct. There are δ (t) 2 pos- sible ways of selecting two unique senses, so the random score for any given instance is score(t) =</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g 1 (t) · g 2 (t) ÷ δ (t) 2 .</formula><p>The second na¨ıvena¨ıve baseline for WSD, known as most frequent sense (MFS), is a supervised base- line, meaning that it depends on a manually sense- annotated background corpus. As its name sug- gests, it involves always selecting from the candi- dates that sense which has the highest frequency in the corpus. As with our test algorithms, we adapt this technique to pun disambiguation by having it select the two most frequent senses (according to WordNet's built-in sense frequency counts). In traditional WSD, MFS baselines are notoriously difficult to beat, even for supervised disambigua- tion systems, and since they rely on expensive sense-tagged data they are not normally considered a benchmark for the performance of knowledge- based disambiguators.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>Using the freely available DKPro WSD framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Miller et al., 2013)</ref>, we implemented our pun dis- ambiguation algorithms, ran them on our full data set, and compared their annotations against those of our manually produced gold standard. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the coverage, precision, recall, and F 1 for simplified Lesk (SL), simplified extended Lesk (SEL), simplified lexically expanded Lesk (SLEL), and the random and most frequent sense baselines; for SEL we also report results for each of our pun- specific tie-breaking strategies. All metrics are reported as percentages, and the highest score for each metric (excluding baseline coverage, which is always 100%) is highlighted in boldface. Accuracy for the random baseline annotator was about 9%; for the MFS baseline it was just over 13%. These figures are considerably lower than what is typically seen with traditional WSD cor- pora, where random baselines achieve accuracies of 30 to 60%, and MFS baselines 65 to 80% <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Palmer et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Snyder and Palmer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Navigli et al., 2007)</ref>. Our baselines' low figures are the re- sult of them having to consider senses from every possible lemmatization and part of speech of the target, and underscore the difficulty of our task.</p><p>The simplest knowledge-based algorithm we tested, simplified Lesk, was over twice as accu- rate as the random baseline in terms of precision (19.74%), but predictably had very low cover- age (35.52%), leading in turn to very low recall (7.01%). Manual examination of the unassigned instances confirmed that failure was usually due to the lack of any lexical overlap whatsoever be- tween the context and definitions. The use of a tie-breaking strategy would not help much here, though some way of bridging the lexical gap would. This is, in fact, the strategy employed by the ex- tended and lexically expanded variants of simpli- fied Lesk, and we observed that both were success- ful to some degree. Simplified lexically expanded Lesk almost completely closed the lexical gap, with nearly complete coverage (98.69%), though this came at the expense of a large drop in precision (to 13.43%). Given the near-total coverage, use of a tie- breaking strategy here would have no appreciable effect on the accuracy.</p><p>Simplified extended Lesk, on the other hand, saw significant increases in coverage, precision, and recall (to 42.45%, 19.96%, and 8.47%, respec- tively). Its recall is statistically indistinguishable 7 from the random baseline, though spot-checks of its unassigned instances show that the problem is very frequently not the lexical gap but rather mul- tiple senses tied for the greatest overlap with the context. We therefore tested our two pun-specific backoff strategies to break this system's ties. Us- ing the "POS" strategy increased coverage by 41%, relatively speaking, and gave us our highest ob- served precision of 21.21%. Our "cluster" strategy effected a relative increase in coverage of over 60%, and gave us the best recall (14.10%). This strategy also had the best tradeoff between precision and recall, with an F 1 of 16.77%.</p><p>Significance testing shows the recall scores for SLEL, SEL+POS, and SEL+cluster to be signifi- cantly better than the random baseline, and statisti- cally indistinguishable from that of MFS. This is excellent news, especially in light of the fact that supervised approaches (even baselines like MFS) usually outperform their knowledge-based counter- parts. Though the three knowledge-based systems are not statistically distinguishable from each other in terms of recall, they do show a statistically sig- nificant improvement over SL and SEL, and the two implementing pun-specific tie-breaking strate- gies were markedly more accurate than SLEL for those targets where they attempted an assignment. These two systems would therefore be preferable for applications where precision is more important than recall.</p><p>We also examined the results of our gener- ally best-performing system, SEL+cluster, to see whether there was any relationship with the targets' part of speech. We filtered the results according to whether both gold-standard meanings of the pun contain senses for nouns only, verbs only, adjec-  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Coverage, precision, and recall for SEL+cluster, and random baseline recall, accord- ing to part of speech.</p><p>tives only, or adverbs only; these amounted to 539, 346, 106, and 8 instances, respectively. These re- sults are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Also shown there is a row which aggregates the 999 targets with "pure" POS, and another for the remaining 608 instances ("mult."), where one or both of the two mean- ings contain senses for multiple parts of speech, or where the two meanings have different parts of speech. The last column of each row shows the recall of the random baseline for comparison. Accuracy was lowest on the verbs, which had the highest candidate polysemy (21.6) and are known to be particularly difficult to disambiguate even in traditional WSD. Still, as with all the other sin- gle parts of speech, performance of SEL+cluster exceeded the random baseline. While recall was lower on targets with mixed POS than those with pure POS, coverage was significantly higher. Nor- mally such a disparity could be attributed to a dif- ference in polysemy: Lesk-like systems are more likely to attempt a sense assignment for highly pol- ysemous targets, since there is a greater likelihood of one of the candidate definitions matching the context, though the probability of the assignment being correct is reduced. In this case, however, the multi-POS targets actually had lower average polysemy than the single-POS ones (13.2 vs. 15.8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have introduced the novel task of pun disambiguation and have proposed and evalu- ated several computational approaches for it. The major contributions of this work are as follows: First, we have produced a new data set consisting of manually sense-annotated homographic puns. The data set is large enough, and the manual an- notations reliable enough, for a principled eval- uation of automatic pun disambiguation systems.</p><p>Second, we have shown how evaluation metrics, baselines, and disambiguation algorithms from tra- ditional WSD can be adapted to the task of pun disambiguation, and we have tested these adapta- tions in a controlled experiment. The results show pun disambiguation to be a particularly challeng- ing task for NLP, with baseline results far below what is commonly seen in traditional WSD. We showed that knowledge-based disambiguation al- gorithms na¨ıvelyna¨ıvely adapted from traditional WSD perform poorly, but that extending them with strate- gies that rely on pun-specific features brings about dramatic improvements in accuracy: their recall be- comes comparable to that of a supervised baseline, and their precision greatly exceeds it.</p><p>There are a number of avenues we intend to ex- plore in future work. First, we would like to try adapting and evaluating some additional WSD al- gorithms for use with puns. Though our data set is probably too small to use with machine learning- based approaches, we are particularly interested in testing knowledge-based disambiguators which rely on measures of graph connectivity rather than gloss overlaps. Second, we would like to investi- gate alternative tie-breaking strategies, such as the domain similarity measures used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mihalcea et al. (2010)</ref>. Finally, whereas in this paper we have treated only the task of sense disambiguation for the case where a word is known a priori to be a pun, we are interested in exploring the requisite problem of pun detection, where the object is to determine whether or not a given context contains a pun, and more precisely whether any given word in a context is a pun.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>725</head><label>725</label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
