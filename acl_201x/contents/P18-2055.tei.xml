				<p>Verb-noun combinations (VNCs)-e.g., blow the whistle, hit the roof, and see stars-are a common type of English idiom that are ambiguous with literal usages. In this paper we propose and evaluate models for classifying VNC usages as idiomatic or literal, based on a variety of approaches to forming distributed representations. Our results show that a model based on averaging word embeddings performs on par with, or better than, a previously-proposed approach based on skip-thoughts. Idiomatic usages of VNCs are known to exhibit lexico-syntactic fixedness. We further incorporate this information into our models, demonstrating that this rich linguistic knowledge is complementary to the information carried by distributed representations .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Multiword expressions (MWEs) are combinations of multiple words that exhibit some degree of id- iomaticity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldwin and Kim, 2010)</ref>. Verb-noun combinations (VNCs), consisting of a verb with a noun in its direct object position, are a common type of semantically-idiomatic MWE in English and cross-lingually <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fazly et al., 2009</ref>). Many VNCs are ambiguous between MWEs and literal combinations, as in the following examples of see stars, in which 1 is an idiomatic usage (i.e., an MWE), while 2 is a literal combination. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> 1. Hereford United were seeing stars at Gilling- ham after letting in 2 early goals 2. Look into the night sky to see the stars MWE identification is the task of automati- cally determining which word combinations at the token-level form MWEs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldwin and Kim, 2010)</ref>, and must be able to make such distinctions. This is particularly important for applications such as machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sag et al., 2002</ref>), where the appropriate meaning of word combinations in context must be preserved for accurate translation.</p><p>In this paper, following prior work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al., 2016</ref>), we frame token-level identification of VNCs as a supervised binary classification prob- lem, i.e., idiomatic vs. literal. We consider a range of approaches to forming distributed rep- resentations of the context in which a VNC oc- curs, including word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, word embeddings tailored to representing sentences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kenter et al., 2016)</ref>, and skip-thoughts sentence embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kiros et al., 2015)</ref>. We then train a support vector machine (SVM) on these representations to classify unseen VNC in- stances. Surprisingly, we find that an approach based on representing sentences as the average of their word embeddings performs comparably to, or better than, the skip-thoughts based approach previously proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>VNCs exhibit lexico-syntactic fixedness. For example, the idiomatic interpretation in example 1 above is typically only accessible when the verb see has active voice, the determiner is null, and the noun star is in plural form, as in see stars or seeing stars. Usages with a determiner (as in example 2), a singular noun (e.g., see a star), or passive voice (e.g., stars were seen) typically only have the lit- eral interpretation.</p><p>In this paper we further incorporate knowl- edge of the lexico-syntactic fixedness of VNCs -automatically acquired from corpora using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al. (2009)</ref> -into our various embedding-based approaches. Our experimental results show that this leads to substantial improve-ments, indicating that this rich linguistic knowl- edge is complementary to that available in dis- tributed representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Much research on MWE identification has fo- cused on specific kinds of MWEs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Patrick and Fletcher, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Uchiyama et al., 2005</ref>), in- cluding English VNCs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al., 2016)</ref>, although some recent work has considered the identification of a broad range of kinds of MWEs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schneider et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brooke et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Savary et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Work on MWE identification has leveraged rich linguistic knowledge of the constructions under consideration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fothergill and Baldwin, 2012)</ref>, treated literal and idiomatic as two senses of an expression and applied ap- proaches similar to word-sense disambiguation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Birke and Sarkar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hashimoto and Kawahara, 2008)</ref>, incorporated topic models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al., 2010)</ref>, and made use of distributed repre- sentations of words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gharbieh et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In the most closely related work to ours, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al. (2016)</ref> represent token instances of VNCs by embedding the sentence that they occur in using skip-thoughts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kiros et al., 2015</ref>) -an encoder- decoder model that can be viewed as a sentence- level counterpart to the word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) skip-gram model. During training the target sentence is encoded using a recurrent neural net- work, and is used to predict the previous and next sentences. Salton et al. then use these sentence embeddings, representing VNC token instances, as features in a supervised classifier. We treat this skip-thoughts based approach as a strong baseline to compare against. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al. (2009)</ref> formed a set of eleven lexico- syntactic patterns for VNC instances capturing the voice of the verb (active or passive), determiner (e.g., a, the), and number of the noun (singular or plural). They then determine the canonical form, C(v, n), for a given VNC as follows: 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C(v, n) = {pt k ∈ P |z(v, n, pt k ) &gt; T z } (1)</formula><p>where P is the set of patterns, T z is a predeter- mined threshold, which is set to 1, and z(v, n, pt k ) is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">z(v, n, pt k ) = f (v, n, pt k ) − f s (2)</formula><p>where f (·) is the frequency of a VNC occurring in a given pattern in a corpus, 3 and f and s are the mean and standard deviations for all patterns for the given VNC, respectively. Fazly et al. <ref type="formula">(2009)</ref> showed that idiomatic usages of a VNC tend to occur in that expression's canon- ical form, while literal usages do not. This ap- proach provides a strong, linguistically-informed, unsupervised baseline, referred to as CForm, for predicting whether VNC instances are idiomatic or literal. In this paper we incorporate knowl- edge of canonical forms into embedding-based ap- proaches to VNC token classification, and show that this linguistic knowledge can be leveraged to improve such approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Word2vec</head><p>We trained word2vec's skip-gram model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) on a snapshot of Wikipedia from September 2015, which consists of approximately 2.6 billion tokens. We used a window size of ±8 and 300 dimensions. We ignore all words that oc- cur less than fifteen times in the training corpus, and did not set a maximum vocabulary size. We perform negative sampling and set the number of training epochs to five. We used batch processing with approximately 10k words in each batch.</p><p>To embed a given a sentence containing a VNC token instance, we average the word embeddings for each word in the sentence, including stop- words. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Prior to averaging, we normalize each embedding to have unit length.</p></div>

We use a Siamese CBOW model that was pretrained on a snapshot of Wikipedia from November 2012 using randomly initialized word embeddings. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Similarly to the word2vec model, to embed a given sentence containing a VNC in- stance, we average the word embeddings for each word in the sentence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data and evaluation</head><p>In this section, we discuss the dataset used in our experiments, and the evaluation of our models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset</head><p>We use the VNC-Tokens dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cook et al., 2008)</ref> -the same dataset used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al. (2016)</ref> -to train and eval- uate our models. This dataset consists of sentences containing VNC usages drawn from the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000), <ref type="bibr">7</ref> along with a label indicating whether the VNC is an idiomatic or literal usage (or whether this cannot be deter- mined, in which case it is labelled "unknown").</p><p>VNC-Tokens is divided into DEV and TEST sets that each include fourteen VNC types and a to- tal of roughly six hundred instances of these types annotated as literal or idiomatic. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al. (2016)</ref>, we use DEV and TEST, and ignore all token instances annotated as "unknown". We borrowed ideas from both of these ap- proaches in structuring our experiments. We retain</p></div>

(2016)</ref>. This allows us to develop and tune a model on DEV, and then determine whether, when retrained on instances of unseen VNCs in (the training portion of) TEST, that model is able to generalize to new VNCs without further tuning to the specific expressions in TEST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation</head><p>The proportion of idiomatic usages in the testing portions of both DEV and TEST is 63%. We there- fore use accuracy to evaluate our models following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al. (2009)</ref> because the classes are roughly balanced. We randomly divide both DEV and TEST into training and testing portions ten times, follow- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al. (2016)</ref>. For each of the ten runs, we compute the accuracy for each expression, and then compute the average accuracy over the ex- pressions. We then report the average accuracy over the ten runs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Parameter tuning</head><p>We tune the SVM for each model on DEV by car- rying out a linear search for the penalty cost from 0.01-100, increasing by a factor of ten each time. Results for this parameter tuning are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. These results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate setting for the penalty cost. For example, the accuracy of the word2vec model ranges from 0.619-0.830 depending on the cost setting.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">DEV and TEST results</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> we report results on DEV and TEST for each model, as well as the unsupervised CForm model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al. (2009)</ref>, which simply labels a VNC as idiomatic if it occurs in its canonical form, and as literal otherwise. We further consider each model (other than CForm) in two setups. −CF corresponds to the models as described in Sec- tion 3. +CF further incorporates lexico-syntactic knowledge of canonical forms into each model by concatenating the embedding representing each VNC token instance with a one-dimensional vec- tor which is one if the VNC occurs in its canonical form, and zero otherwise. We first consider results for the −CF setup. On both DEV and TEST, the accuracy achieved by each supervised model is higher than that of the unsupervised CForm approach, except for Siamese CBOW on TEST. The word2vec model achieves the highest accuracy on DEV and TEST of 0.830 and 0.804, respectively. The difference between the word2vec model and the next-best model, skip-thoughts, is significant using a boot- strap test <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2012</ref>) with 10k repetitions for DEV (p = 0.006), but not for TEST (p = 0.051). Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the relatively simple approach to averaging word embeddings used by word2vec performs as well as, or better than, the much more complex skip- thoughts model used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al. (2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> 8 The word2vec and skip-thoughts models were trained on different corpora, which could contribute to the differences in results for these models. We therefore carried out an ad- ditional experiment in which we trained word2vec on Book- Corpus, the corpus on which skip-thoughts was trained. This new word2vec model achieved accuracies of 0.825 and 0.809, on DEV and TEST, respectively, which are also higher accu- Turning to the +CF setup, we observe that, for both DEV and TEST, each model achieves higher accuracy than in the −CF setup. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> All of these differences are significant using a bootstrap test (p &lt; 0.002 in each case). In addition, each method outperforms the unsupervised CForm approach on both DEV and TEST. These findings demonstrate that the linguistically-motivated, lexico-syntactic knowledge encoded by the canonical form fea- ture is complementary to the information from a wide range of types of distributed representa- tions. In the +CF setup, the word2vec model again achieves the highest accuracy on both DEV and TEST of 0.854 and 0.852, respectively. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The difference between the word2vec model and the next-best model, again skip-thoughts, is signifi- cant for both DEV and TEST using a bootstrap test (p &lt; 0.05 in each case).</p><p>To better understand the impact of the canonical form feature when combined with the word2vec model, we compute the average precision, recall, and F1 score for each MWE for both the positive (idiomatic) and negative (literal) classes, for each run on TEST. 11 For a given run, we then compute the average precision, recall, and F1 score across all MWEs, and then the average over all ten runs. We do this using CForm, and the word2vec model with and without the canonical form feature. Re- sults are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. In line with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fazly et al. (2009)</ref>, CForm achieves higher pre- cision and recall on idiomatic usages than literal ones. In particular, the relatively low recall for the literal class indicates that many literal usages oc- cur in a canonical form. Comparing the word2vec model with and without the canonical form fea- ture, we see that, when this feature is used, there is a relatively larger increase in precision and re- call (and F1 score) for the literal class, than for the idiomatic class. This indicates that, although the racies than those obtained by the skip-thoughts model. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In order to determine that this improvement is due to the information about canonical forms carried by the additional feature in the +CF setup, and not due to the increase in num- ber of dimensions, we performed additional experiments in which we concatenated the embedding representations with a random binary feature, and with a randomly chosen value between 0 and 1. For each model, neither of these approaches outperformed that model using the +CF setup. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In the +CF setup, the word2vec model using embed- dings that were trained on the same corpus as skip-thoughts achieved accuracies of 0.846 and 0.851, on DEV and TEST, respectively. These are again higher accuracies than the cor- responding setup for the skip-thoughts model. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> We carried out the same analysis on DEV. The findings were similar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>Determining whether a usage of a VNC is id- iomatic or literal is important for applications such as machine translation, where it is vital to preserve the meanings of word combinations. In this paper we proposed two approaches to the task of clas- sifying VNC token instances as idiomatic or lit- eral based on word2vec embeddings and Siamese CBOW. We compared these approaches against a linguistically-informed unsupervised baseline, and a model based on skip-thoughts previously ap- plied to this task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salton et al., 2016)</ref>. Our exper- imental results show that a comparatively simple approach based on averaging word embeddings performs at least as well as, or better than, the ap- proach based on skip-thoughts. We further pro- posed methods to combine linguistic knowledge of the lexico-syntactic fixedness of VNCs -so- called "canonical forms", which can be automat- ically acquired from corpora via statistical meth- ods -with the embedding based approaches. Our findings indicate that this rich linguistic knowl- edge is complementary to that available in dis- tributed representations. Alternative approaches to embedding sentences containing VNC instances could also be consid- ered, for example, FastSent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hill et al., 2016)</ref>. However, all of the models we used represent the context of a VNC by the sentence in which it oc- curs. In future work we therefore also intend to consider approaches such as context2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Melamud et al., 2016</ref>) which explicitly encode the con- text in which a token occurs. Finally, one known challenge of VNC token classification is to de- velop models that are able to generalize to VNC types that were not seen during training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gharbieh et al., 2016)</ref>. In future work we plan to explore this experimental setup.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fazly et al.
