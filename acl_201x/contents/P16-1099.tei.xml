<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Work plays a major role in nearly every facet of our lives. Negative and positive experiences at work places can have significant social and per- sonal impacts. Employment condition is an im- portant social determinant of health. But how exactly do jobs influence our lives, particularly with respect to well-being? Many theories address this question <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Archambault and Grudin, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004</ref>), but they are hard to validate as well-being is influenced by many fac- tors, including geography as well as social and in- stitutional support.</p><p>Can computers help us understand the complex relationship between work and well-being? Both are broad concepts that are difficult to capture ob- jectively (for instance, the unemployment rate as a statistic is continually redefined) and thus chal- lenging subjects for computational research.</p><p>Our first contribution is to propose a classifica- tion framework for such broad concepts as work that alternates between humans-in-the-loop anno- tation and machine learning over multiple itera- tions to simultaneously clarify human understand- ing of these concepts and automatically determine whether or not posts from public social media sites are about work. Our framework balances the ef- fectiveness of crowdsourced workers with local experience, evaluates the degree of subjectivity throughout the process, and uses an iterative post- hoc evaluation method to address the problem of discovering gold standard data. Our performance (on an open-domain problem) demonstrates the value of our humans-in-the-loop approach which may be of special relevance to those interested in discourse understanding, particularly settings characterized by high levels of subjectivity, where integrating human intelligence into active learning processes is essential.</p><p>Our second contribution is to use our classi- fiers to study job-related discourse on social me- dia using data-driven ethnography. Language is fundamentally a social phenomenon, and social media gives us a lens through which to observe a very particular form of discourse in real time. We add depth to the NLP analysis by gathering data from specific geographical regions to study dis- course along a broad spectrum of interacting so- cial groups, using work as a framing device, and we fuse language-based analysis with temporal, geospatial and labor statistics dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>Though not the first study of job-related social media, prior ones used data from large compa- nies' internal sites, whose users were employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(De Choudhury and Counts, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yardi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kolari et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brzozowski, 2009</ref>). An obvious limitation in that case is it excludes popu- lations without access to such restricted networks. Moreover, workers may not disclose true feelings about their jobs on such sites, since their employ-ers can easily monitor them. On the other hand, we show that on Twitter, it is quite common for tweets to relate negative feelings about work ("I don't wanna go to work today"), unprofessional behavior ("Got drunk as hell last night and still made it to work"), or a desire to work elsewhere ("I want to go work at Disney World so bad").</p><p>Nonetheless, these studies inform our work. <ref type="bibr">DeChoudhury et al. (2013)</ref> investigated the land- scape of emotional expression of the employees via enterprise internal microblogging. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yardi et al. (2008)</ref> examined temporal aspects of blogging usage within corporate internal blogging commu- nity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kolari et al. (2007)</ref> characterized compre- hensively how behaviors expressed in posts impact a company's internal social networks. Brzozowski (2009) described a tool that aggregated shared in- ternal social media which when combined with its enterprise directory added understanding the orga- nization and employees connections.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, the Job Demands-Resources Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004</ref>) suggests that job demands (e.g., overworked, dissonance, and conflict) lead to burnout and disengagement while resources (e.g., appreciation, cohesion, and safety) often result in satisfaction and productivity. Although burnout and engagement have an inverse relationship, these states fluctuate and can vary over time. In 2014, more than two-thirds of U.S. workers were disengaged at work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gallup, 2015a)</ref> and this disconnection costs the U.S. up to $398 billion an- nually in lost work and medical treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gallup, 2015b)</ref>. Indeed, job dissatisfaction poses serious health risks and has even been linked to suicide <ref type="bibr">(Hazards Magazine, 2014</ref>). Thus, examining social media for job-related messages provides a novel opportunity to study job discourse and associated demands and resources. Moreover, the declarative and affective tone of these tweets may have important implications for understanding the relationship between burnout and engagement with such public health concerns as mental health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Humans-in-the-Loop Classification</head><p>From July 2013 to June 2014 we collected over 7M geo-tagged tweets from around 85,000 public accounts in a 15-county around a midsized city us- ing DataSift <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . We removed punctuation and spe- cial characters, and used the Internet Slang Dictio-nary 2 to normalize nonstandard terms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows our humans-in-the-loop frame- work for learning classifiers to identify job-related posts. It consists of four rounds of machine clas- sification -similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al. (2014)</ref> ex- cept that our rounds are not as uniform -where the classifier in each round acts as a filter on our training data, providing human annotators a sam- ple of Twitter data to label and (except for the final round) using these labeled data to train the classi- fiers in later rounds. The initial classifier C 0 is a simple term- matching filter; see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> (number options were considered for some terms). The other classifiers (C 1 , C 2 , C 3 ) are SVMs that use a feature space of n-grams from the training set.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: C 0 rules identifying Job-Likely tweets.</p><p>Round 1. We ran C 0 on our dataset. Ap- proximately 40K tweets having at least five to- kens passed this filter. We call them Job-Likely tweets. We randomly chose around 2,000 Job- Likely tweets and split them evenly into 50 AMT Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), and further ran- domly duplicated five tweets in each HIT to evalu- ate each worker's consistency. Five crowdworkers assigned to each HIT 4 answered, for each tweet, the question: Is this tweet about job or employ- ment? All crowdworkers lived in the U.S. and had an approval rating of 90% or better. They were paid $1.00 per HIT <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . We assessed inter-annotator reliability among the five annotators in each HIT using Geertzen's tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Geertzen, 2016)</ref>. This yielded 1,297 tweets where all 5 annota- tors agreed on the same label <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. To balance our training data, we added 757 tweets chosen ran- domly from tweets outside the Job-Likely set that we labeled not job-related. C 1 trained on this set.</p><p>Round 2. Our goal was to collect 4,000 more la- beled tweets that, when combined with the Round 1 training data, would yield a class-balanced set. Using C 1 to perform regression, we ranked the tweets in our dataset by the confidence score ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chang and Lin, 2011</ref>). We then spot-checked the tweets to estimate the frequency of job-related tweets as the confidence score increases. We dis- covered that among the top-ranked tweets about half, and near the separating hyperplane (i.e., where the confidence scores are near zero) almost none, are job-related.</p><p>Based on these estimates, we randomly sam- pled 2,400 tweets from those in the top 80th per- centile of confidence scores (Type-1). We then randomly sampled about 800 tweets each from the first deciles of tweets greater and lesser than zero, respectively (Type-2).</p><p>The rationale for drawing from these two groups was that the false Type-1 tweets represent those on which the C 1 classifier most egregiously fails, and the Type-2 tweets are those closest to the feature vectors and those toward which the classi- fier is most sensitive.</p><p>Crowdworkers again annotated these tweets in the same fashion as in Round 1 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>), and cross-round comparisons are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 2 and 4</ref>. We trained C 2 on all tweets from Round 1 and 2 with unanimous labels (bold in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>: Summary of both annotation rounds. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We consulted with Turker Nation (http://www. turkernation.com) to ensure that the workers were treated and compensated fairly for their tasks. We also re- warded annotators based on the qualities of their work.    Round 3. Two coauthors with prior experi- ence from the local community reviewed in- stances from Round 1 and 2 on which crowd- workers disagreed (highlighted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>) and provided labels. Cohen's kappa agreement was high: κ = 0.80. Combined with all labeled data from the previous rounds this yielded 2,670 gold- standard-labeled job-related and 3,250 not job- related tweets. We trained C 3 on this entire set. Since it is not strictly class-balanced, we grid- searched on a range of class weights and chose the estimator that optimized F1 score, using 10- fold cross validation 6 . <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> shows C 3 's top- weighted features, which reflect the semantic field of work for the job-related class.  Nearly all tweets that contained at least one of these hashtags: #veteranjob, #job, #jobs, #tweetmyjobs, #hiring, #retail, #realestate, #hr also included a URL, which spot-checking re- vealed nearly always led to a recruitment web- site (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 7</ref>). This led to an effective heuris- tic to separate individual from business accounts only for posts that have first been classified as job- related: if an account had more job-related tweets with any of the above hashtags + URL patterns, we labeled it business; otherwise individual.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussion</head><p>Crowdsourced Validation The fundamental difficulty in open-domain classification problems such as this one is there is no gold-standard data to hold out at the beginning of the process. To address this, we adopted a post-hoc evaluation where we took balanced sets of labeled tweets from each classifier (C 0 , C 1 , C 2 and C 3 ) and asked AMT workers to label a total of 1,600 sam- ples, taking the majority votes (where at least 3 out of 5 crowdworkers agreed) as reference labels.</p><p>Our results <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 8)</ref> show that C 3 performs the best, and significantly better than C 0 and C 1 .</p><p>Estimating Effective Recall The two machine- labeled classes in our test data are roughly bal- anced, which is not the case in real-world scenar- ios. We estimated the effective recall under the assumption that the error rates in our test sam- ples are representative of the entire dataset. Let y be the total number of the classifier-labeled "posi- tive" elements in the entire dataset and n be the to- tal of "negative" elements. Let y t be the number of classifier-labeled "positive" tweets in our 1, 600- samples test set and let n t = 1, 600 − y t . Then the estimated effective recalî R =   <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 8</ref>'s tweets labeled by C 0 -C 3 as job-related, we asked AMT workers: Is this tweet more likely from a per- sonal or business account? <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 9</ref> shows that this method was quite accurate.  Our explanation for the strong performance of the business classifier is that the class of job- related tweets is relatively rare, and so by apply- ing the classifier only to job-related tweets we sim-plify the individual-or-business problem dramati- cally. Another, perhaps equally effective, simplifi- cation is that our tweets are geo-specific and so we automatically filter out business tweets from, e.g., national media.</p><p>Generalizability Tests Can our best model C 3 discover job-related tweets from other geograph- ical regions, even though it was trained on data from one specific region? We repeated the tests above on 400 geo-tagged tweets from Detroit (bal- anced between job-related and not). <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 10</ref> shows that C 3 and the business classifier gener- alize well to another region. This suggests the transferability of our humans-in-the-loop classifi- cation framework and of heuristic to separate indi- vidual from business accounts for tweets classified as job-related.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Understanding Job-Related Discourse</head><p>Using the job-related tweets -from both individ- ual and business accounts -extracted by C 3 from the July 2013-June 2014 dataset (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 12</ref>), we conducted the following analyses.</p><p>C 3 Versus C 0 The fact that C 3 outperforms C 0 demonstrates our humans-in-the-loop framework is necessary and effective compared to an intu- itive term-matching filter. We further examined the messages labeled as job-related by C 3 , but not captured by C 0 . More than 160,000 tweets fell into this Difference set, in which approximately 85,000 tweets are from individual accounts while the rest are from business accounts. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 11</ref> shows the top 3 most frequent uni-, bi-, and tri- grams in the Difference dataset. These n-grams from the individual group suggest that people of- ten talk about job-related topics while mentioning temporal information or announcing their working schedules. We neglected such time-related phrases when defining C 0 . In contrast, the frequencies of the listed n-grams in the business group are much higher than those in the individual group. This in- dicates that our definitions of inclusion terms in C 0 did not capture a considerable amount of posts involving broad job-related topics, which is also reflected in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 9</ref>: our business classifier did not find business accounts from the job-related tweets extracted by C 0 .    Individual users used an abbreviation for the name of the midsized city to mark their location, and fml 7 to express personal embarrassing stories. Work and job are self-explanatory. Money, mo- tivation relates to jobs. Tired, exhausted, fuck, insomnia, bored, struggle express negative con- ditions. Likewise, lovemyjob, happy, awesome, excited, yay, tgif 8 convey positive affects experi- enced from jobs. Business accounts exhibit dis- tinct patterns. Besides the hashtags queried (Ta- ble 7), we saw local place names, like corning, rochester, batavia, pittsford, and regional ones like syracuse, ithaca. Customerservice, nursing, accounting, engineering, hospitality, construction record occupations, while kellyjobs, familydollar, cintasjobs, cfgjobs, searsjobs point to business agents. Unlike individual users, businesses do not use hashtags reflecting affective expressions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual</head><p>Linguistic Differences We used the TweetNLP POS tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gimpel et al., 2011</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref> shows nine part-of-speech tag 9 frequencies for three sub- sets of tweets. Business accounts use NNPs more than indi- viduals, perhaps because they often advertise job openings at specific locations, like New York, Sears. Individuals use NNPs less frequently and in a more casual way, e.g., Jojo, galactica, Valli. Also, individuals use JJ, NN, NNS, PRP, PRP$, RB, UH, and VB more regularly than business ac- <ref type="bibr">7</ref> An acronym for Fuck My Life. 8 An acronym for Thank God It's Friday to express the joy one feels in knowing that the work week has officially ended and that one has two days off which to enjoy. 9 JJ -Adjective; NN -Noun (singular or mass); NNS - Noun (plural); NNP -Proper noun (singular); PRP -Personal pronoun; PRP$ -Possessive pronoun; RB -Adverb; UH - Interjection; VB -Verb (base form) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Santorini, 1990).</ref> counts do. Not job-related tweets have similar pat- terns to job-related ones from individual accounts, suggesting that individual users exhibit analogous language habits regardless of topic.</p><p>Temporal Patterns Our findings that individual users frequently used time-related n-grams <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">(Table  11</ref>) prompted us to examine the temporal patterns of job discourse. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4a</ref> suggests that individuals talk about jobs the most in December and January (which also have the most tweets over other topics), and the least in the warmer months. July witnesses the busiest job-related tweeting from business and January the least. The user community is slightly less active in the warmer months, with fewer tweets then. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4b</ref> shows that job-related tweet volumes are higher on weekdays and lower on weekends, following the standard work week. Weekends see fewer business tweets than weekdays do. Sunday is the most -while Friday and Saturday are the least -active days from the not job-related per- spective. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4c</ref> shows hourly trends. Job-related tweets from business accounts are most frequent during business hours, peaking at 11, and then ta- per off. Perhaps professionals are either getting their commercial tasks completed before lunch, or expecting others to check updates during lunch. Individuals post about jobs almost anytime awake and have a similar distribution to non-job-related tweets.</p><p>Measuring Affective Changes We examined positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) to measure diurnal changes in public mood ( <ref type="figure">Figures  5 and 6</ref>), using two recognized lexicons, in job- related tweets from individual accounts (left), job- related tweets from business accounts (middle), and not job-related tweets (right).</p><p>(1) Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count We used LIWC's positive emotion and negative emo- tion to represent PA and NA respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pennebaker et al., 2001</ref>) because it is common in behavioral health studies, and used as a stan- dard comparison in referenced work. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the mean daily trends of PA and NA. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Pan- els 5a and 5b reveal contrasting job-related af- fective patterns, compared to prior trends from enterprise-wide micro-blog usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(De Choudhury and Counts, 2013)</ref>, i.e., public social media ex- hibit gradual increase in PA while internal enter- prise network decrease after business. This per- haps confirms our suspicion that people talk about work on public social media differently than on work-based media.</p><p>(2) Word-Emotion Association Lexicon We focused on the words from EmoLex's positive and negative categories, which represent sentiment po- larities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mohammad and Turney, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mohammad and Turney, 2010)</ref> and calculated the score for each tweet similarly as LIWC. The average daily positive and negative sentiment scores in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> display patterns analogous to <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>Labor Statistics We explored associations be- tween Twitter temporal patterns, affect, and of- ficial labor statistics <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 8</ref>). These monthly statistics 11 include: labor force, employment, un- employment, and unemployment rate. We col- lected one more year of Twitter data from the same area, and applied C 3 to extract the job- related posts from individual and business ac- counts <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 12</ref> summarizes the basic statistics), then defined the following monthwise statistics for our two-year dataset: count of overall/job- individual/job-business/others tweets; percentage of job-individual/job-business/others tweets in overall tweets; average LIWC PA/NA scores of job-individual/job-business/others tweets <ref type="bibr">12</ref> .</p><p>Positive affect expressed in job-related dis- course from both individual and business accounts correlate negatively with unemployment and un-employment rate. This is intuitive, as unemploy- ment is generally believed to have a negative im- pact on individuals' lives. The counts of job- related tweets from individual and not job-related tweets are both positively correlated with unem- ployment and unemployment rate, suggesting that unemployment may lead to more activities in pub- lic social media. This correlation result shows that online textual disclosure themes and behaviors can reflect institutional survey data.</p><p>Inside vs. Outside City We compared tweets occurring within the city boundary to those lying outside <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 13)</ref>. The percentages of job-related tweets from individual accounts, either in urban or rural areas, remain relatively even. The proportion of job-related tweets from business accounts de- creased sharply from urban to rural locations. This may be because business districts are usually cen- tered in urban areas and individual tweets reflect more complex geospatial distributions.</p><p>Job-Life Cycle Model Based on hand inspec- tion of a large number of job-related tweets and on models of the relationship between work and well- ness found in behavioral studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Archambault and Grudin, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004</ref>), we tentatively propose a job-life model for job- related discourse from individual accounts ( <ref type="figure">Figure  7</ref>). Each state in the model has three dimensions: the point of view, the affect, and the job-related ac- tivity, in terms of basic level of employment, ex- pressed in the tweet.</p><p>We concatenated together all job-related tweets posted by each individual into a single document and performed latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003)</ref> on this user-level corpus, using Gensim <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Rehůřek and Sojka, 2010)</ref>. We used 12     <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 14</ref>. Topic 0 appears to be about getting ready to start a job, and topic 1 about leaving work per- manently or temporarily. Topics 2, 5, 6, 8, and 11 suggest how key affect is for understanding job-   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We used crowdsourcing and local expertise to power a humans-in-the-loop classification frame- work that iteratively improves identification of public job-related tweets. We separated busi- ness accounts from individual in job-related dis- course. We also analyzed identified tweets inte- grating temporal, affective, geospatial, and statis- tical information. While jobs take up enormous amounts of most adults' time, job-related tweets are still rather infrequent. Examining affective changes reveals that PA and NA change indepen- dently; low NA appears to indicate the absence of negative feelings, not the presence of positive ones.</p><p>Our work is of social importance to working- age adults, especially for those who may struggle with job-related issues. Besides providing insights for discourse and its links to social science, our study could lead to practical applications, such as: aiding policy-makers with macro-level insights on job markets, connecting job-support resources to those in need, and facilitating the development of job recommendation systems.</p><p>This work has limitations. We did not study whether providing contextual information in our humans-in-the-loop framework would influence the model performance. This is left for future work. Additionally we recognize that the hash- tag inventory used to discover business accounts from job-related topics might need to change over time, to achieve robust performance in the future.
