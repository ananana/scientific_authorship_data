				<p>We present a named entity recognition (NER) system for tagging fiction: LitNER. Relative to more traditional approaches , LitNER has two important properties: (1) it makes no use of hand-tagged data or gazetteers, instead it boot-straps a model from term clusters; and (2) it leverages multiple instances of the same name in a text. Our experiments show it to substantially outperform off-the-shelf supervised NER systems.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Much of the work on applying NLP to the anal- ysis of literature has focused on literary fig- ures/characters in the text, e.g. in the context of so- cial network analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Elson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Agarwal et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ardanuy and Sporleder, 2015)</ref> or anal- ysis of characterization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bamman et al., 2014</ref>). Named entity recognition (NER) of person names is generally the first step in identifying characters; locations are also a prevalent NE type, and can be useful when tracking different plot threads <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wallace, 2012</ref>), or trends in the settings of fiction.</p><p>There are not, to our knowledge, any NER systems that are specifically targeted at litera- ture, and most related work has used Stanford CoreNLP as an off-the-shelf solution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bamman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Vala et al., 2015)</ref>. In this paper, we show that it is possible to take advantage of the properties of fiction texts, in particular the repeti- tion of names, to build a high-performing 3-class NER system which distinguishes people and lo- cations from other capitalized words and phrases. Notably, we do this without any hand-labelled data whatsoever, bootstrapping a text-level context classifier from a low-dimensional Brown cluster- ing of the Project Gutenberg corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The standard approach to NER is to treat it as a supervised sequential classification problem, typ- ically using conditional random fields or similar models, based on local context features as well as properties of the token itself. Relevant to the present work is the fact that, despite there being some work on enforcing tag consistency across multiple instances of the same token ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>) and the use of non-local features <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009</ref>) to improve supervised sequential models, the consensus seems to be that this non- local information has a relatively modest effect on performance in standard datasets, and as a result off-the-shelf NER systems in practice treat each sentence as a separate document, with multiple in- stances of the same token in different sentences viewed as entirely independent classification prob- lems. We also note that although supervised NER is the norm, there is a smaller body of work in semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches to NER and semantic lexicon induction, for instance pattern bootstrapping ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nadeau et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Thelen and Riloff, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McIntosh et al., 2011</ref>) as well as generative approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Elsner et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>In the context of literature, the most closely re- lated task is character identification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Vala et al., 2015)</ref>, which is itself an intermediate task for char- acter speech identification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">He et al., 2013)</ref>, analy- sis of characterization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bamman et al., 2014)</ref>, and analysis of social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Elson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Agarwal et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ardanuy and Sporleder, 2015)</ref>. In addition to NER, character identifica-tion also involves clustering multiple aliases of the same character, and discarding person names that don't correspond to characters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Vala et al. (2015)</ref> identify some of the failures of off-the-shelf NER with regards to character identification, and at- tempt to fix them; their efforts are focused, how- ever, on characters that are referred to by descrip- tion rather than names or aliases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Corpus preparation and segmentation</head><p>The corpus we use for building and testing our NER system is the 2010 image of the (US) Project Gutenberg corpus, 1 a reasonably compre- hensive collection of out-of-copyright English lit- erary texts, to our knowledge the largest that is publicly available in a machine-readable, full-text format. We access the texts via the GutenTag tool ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brooke et al., 2015)</ref>, which allows both filter- ing of texts by genre as well as within-text filtering to remove Project Gutenberg copyright informa- tion, front and back matter (e.g. table of contents), and headers. We focus here only on fiction texts (i.e. novels and short stories); other kinds of liter- ature (e.g. plays) are rare in the corpus and have very different properties in terms of the distribu- tion of names. The final corpus size is 10844 texts.</p><p>GutenTag also provides an initial segmenta- tion of tokens into potential names, using a sim- ple rule-based system which segments contiguous capitalized words, potentially with common inter- vening function words like of as well as leading the (e.g. the King of Westeros). It largely (but not entirely) overcomes the problem of sentence- initial capitalization in English by generalizing over an entire text; as long as a capitalized word or phrase appears in a non-sentence initial po- sition at least once in a text, it will be tagged in the sentence-initial position as well. To im- prove precision, the name tagger in the version of GutenTag used for this paper (0.1.3) has lower bounds on token count (at least 10) and an upper bound on the length of names (no longer than 3 words). For this work, however, we remove those restrictions to maximize recall. Though not our primary concern, we return to evaluate the quality of the initial segmentation in Section 5.</p><p>1 http://www.gutenberg.org</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Brown clustering</head><p>The next step is to induce Brown clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brown et al., 1992</ref>) over the pre-segmented corpus (in- cluding potential names), using the tool of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liang (2005)</ref>. Briefly, Brown clusters are formed us- ing an agglomerative hierarchical cluster of terms based on their immediate context, placing terms into categories to maximize the probability of con- secutive terms over the entire corpus. Note that using information from Brown clusters is a well established technique in NER, but more typically as features within a supervised framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Miller et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ritter et al., 2011</ref>); we are unaware of any work using them directly as a source of bootstrapped training examples. We used default settings except for the number of clus- ters (c): 50. The rationale for such a small cluster size-the default is 1000, and NER systems which use Brown clusters as features do better with even more <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Derczynski et al., 2015)</ref>-is that we want to have clusters that correspond to major noun cat- egories (e.g. PERSON and LOCATION), which we consider the next most fundamental division be- yond part-of-speech; 50 was selected because it is roughly comparable to the size of the Penn Tree- bank tagset <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Marcus et al., 1993</ref>). We did not tune this number, except to observe that larger num- bers (e.g. 100 or 200) resulted in increasingly frag- mented clusters for our entities of interest.</p><p>To automatically extract a seed list of peo- ple and locations, we ranked the clusters by the total (token) count of names (as identified by GutenTag), and took the first cluster to be PER- SON, and the second to be LOCATION; all other clusters are considered OTHER, our third, catch- all category. Alternatively, we could have set c higher and manually grouped the clusters based on the common words in the clusters, adding a thin layer of supervision to the process; with a low c, however, this was unnecessary since the composi- tion and ranking of the clusters conformed exactly to our expectations. The top-5 clusters by token count of names are given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Note the presence of the multiword name New York in the second cluster, as a result of the segmentation.</p><p>The most common words in the first two clus- ters are mostly what we would expect, though there is a bit of noise, e.g. Him included as a place. The other clusters are messier, but still in- <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Top-5 Brown clusters derived from PG corpus, by token count of names terpretable: e.g. Cluster 4 is a collection of terms of address. Note that although we do not con- sider an term like Doctor to be a person name, Doctor Smith or the Doctor would be; in many literary contexts characters are referred to by an alias, and failure to deal properly with these sit- uations is a significant problem with off-the-shelf NER systems in literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Vala et al., 2015)</ref>. In any case, Brown clustering works fairly well for common names, but for rarer ones, the cluster- ing is haphazard. Fiction, though, has many rare names and locations, since authors will often in- vent them. Another problem with Brown clus- tering is that ignores possible sense distinctions: for instance, Florence is both a city and a person name. To avoid confusion, authors will generally preserve one-sense-per-document, but this is not true at the corpus level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Text-level context classifier</head><p>The central element of our NER system is a text- level classifier of names based on context. By text-level, we mean that it assumes one-sense-per- document, classifying a name for an entire doc- ument, based on all instances of the name in the document ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gale et al., 1992)</ref>. It is trained on the (text-level) "instances" of relatively common names (appearing more than 100 times in the cor- pus) from the 3 NE label types derived based on the Brown clustering. That is, to build a training set, we pass through the corpus and each time we come across a common name in a particular doc- ument, we build a feature vector corresponding to all the contexts in that document, with the label taken from the clustering. Our rationale here is that the challenging part of NER in literature is names that appear only in one text; by limiting our context for common words to a single text, we simulate the task for rarer words. Mary is a common name, and may be a major character in one text, but a minor one in another; hence, we build a classifier that deals with both context-rich and context-poor situations. The noisy training set thus constructed has about 1 million examples.</p><p>Our feature set consists of filtered word fea- tures in a 2-word window (w −2 w −1 w 0 w +1 w +2 ) around the token occurrences w 0 of a target type in a given text, made up of position-indexed uni- grams (w −2 , w −1 , w +1 and w +2 ) and bigrams (w −2 w −1 , w +1 w +2 and w −1 w +1 ), excluding uni- grams when a subsuming bigram feature matched (e.g. if we match trust in, we do not add trust and in). For this we used the name-segmented corpus, and when one of the words in the context was also a name, we take the category from the Brown clus- tering as the word (so w 2 for London in from Lon- don to New York is LOCATION, not New). Across multiple tokens of the same type, we count the same context only once, creating a binary feature vector which was normalized by dividing by the count of all non-zero entries once all contexts were collected. To be included as features, the n-grams had to occur with ≥ 10 different w 0 target word types. Note that given our bootstrapping setup, the word type itself cannot be used directly as a feature.</p><p>For classification, we use logistic regression from scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) trained with SGD using L2 regularization (C = 1). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The only non-standard setting that we use is the "bal- anced" option, which weights classes by the in- verse of their count in the training set, countering the preference for the majority class; we do this because our bootstrapped distribution is an unre- liable reflection of the true distribution, and also because it makes it a fairer comparison to off-the- shelf models with no access to this distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Improved phrase classification</head><p>Relative to (true) supervised models, our boot- strapped model suffers from being able to use only context, and not the identity of the name itself. In the case of names which are phrases, this is troubling because there are many generalizations to be made; for instance names ending with City are locations. Our final model addresses this fail- ing somewhat by using more information from our Brown clustering: from each of the initial and fi- nal words across all names, we extract a set of words W s that appear at least ten times in position s ∈ S, S = {initial, f inal} across all phrases. Let c(w, t, s) be the the number of times a word w ∈ W s appears in the corpus at position s in phrases which were Brown clustered into the en- tity type t ∈ T , and p(t|r) be the original prob- ability of phrase r being type t as determined by the logistic regression classifier. For our two ho- mogenous entity types <ref type="figure">(PERSON and LOCATION)</ref>, we calculate a new score p :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p (t|r) = p(t|r) + s∈S c(r s , t, s) t ∈T c(r s , t , s) − w ∈Ws c(w ,t,s) t ∈T c(w ,t ,s) |W s |<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The first term in the outermost summation in Equation 1 is the proportion of occurrences of the given expression in position s which correspond to type t. To avoid applying too much weight to the homogeneous classes, the second term in the summation subtracts the average number of occur- rences in the given position for all words in W s . As such, the total effect on the score can be neg- ative. Note that if r s / ∈ W s , no modification is made, and for the OTHER type p (t|r) = p(t|r). Once we have calculated p (t|r) for each class, we choose the t with the highest p (t|r).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>Our interest is in a general NER system for liter- ature. Though there are a few novels which have been tagged for characters <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Vala et al., 2015)</ref>, we wanted to test our system relative to a much wider range of fiction. To this end, we randomly sampled texts, sentences, and then names within those sen- tences from our name-segmented Project Guten- berg corpus to produce a set of 1000 examples. These were tagged by a single annotator, an En- glish native speaker with a PhD in English Liter- ature. The annotator was presented with the sen- tence and the pre-segmented name of interest, and asked (via written instructions) to categorize the indicated name into PERSON, LOCATION, OTHER, UNCERTAIN due to ambiguity, or segmentation er- ror. We ran a separate two-annotator agreement study over 200 examples which yielded a Cohen's Kappa of 0.84, suggesting high enough reliability that a single annotator was sufficient. The class</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System</head><p>Acc For the main evaluation, we excluded both UNCER- TAIN examples and segmentation errors, but had our annotator provide correct segmentation for the 15 segmentation errors and carried out a separate comparison on these. We compare our system to a selection of publicly available, off-the-shelf NER sys- tems: OpenNLP, 4 LingPipe, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and Stanford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>), as well as the initial Brown clustering. OpenNLP allowed us to classify only PERSON and LOCATION, but for Stanford CoreNLP and LingPipe we used the existing 3-entity systems, with the ORGANI- ZATION tag collapsed into OTHER (as it was in our guidelines; instances of ORGANIZATION are rare in literature). Since the exact segmentation guide- lines likely varied across these systems-in par- ticular, we found that Stanford CoreNLP of- ten left off the title in names such as Mr. Smith- and we didn't want to focus on these issues, we did not require exact matches of our name seg- mentation; instead, we consider the entire name as PERSON or LOCATION if any of the tokens were tagged as such (names with both tags were con- sidered OTHER). For our system (LitNER), we test a version where only the immediate sentence context is used ("sentence"), and versions based on text context ("text") with or without our phrase improvement ("±phrase").</p><note type="other">F M All PERSON baseline .696 - OpenNLP .435 .572 LingPipe .528 .536 Stanford CoreNLP .786 .751 Brown clusters .803 .672 LitNER sentence +phrase .757 .671 LitNER text −phrase .855 .771 LitNER text +phrase .871 .792</note><p>We evaluate using two standard metrics: accu- racy ("Acc"), and macroaveraged F-score ("F M ").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> show that our system eas- ily bests the off-the-shelf systems when it is given the contextual information from the entire text; the difference is more stark for accuracy (+0.085 ab- solute), though consistent for F M (+0.041 abso- lute). Stanford CoreNLP is the only compet- itive off-the-shelf system-the other two are far too conservative when encountering names they haven't seen before. LitNER is also clearly better than the Brown clusters it was trained on, partic- ularly for F M (+0.120 absolute). With regards to different options for LitNER, we see a major ben- efit from considering all occurrences of the name in the texts rather than just the one we are testing on <ref type="figure">(Section 3.3)</ref>, and a more modest benefit from using the information on parts of phrases taken from the Brown clustering <ref type="figure">(Section 3.4)</ref>.</p><p>For the segmentation errors, we compared our corrected segmentations with the segmen- tation provided by the CRF-based Stanford CoreNLP system, our best competitor. Only 2 of the 15 were segmented correctly by Stanford CoreNLP. This potential 0.002 improvement is tiny compared to the 0.085 difference in accuracy between the two systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Aspects of the method presented here could the- oretically be applied to NER in other genres and other languages, but one important point we wish to make is that our approach clearly takes advan- tage of specific properties of (English) literature. The initial rule-based segmentation, for instance, depends on reliable capitalization of names, which is often not present in social media, or in most non- European languages. We have found more subtle genre effects as well: for comparison, we applied the preliminary steps of our approach to another corpus of published texts which is of compara- ble (token) size to the Project Gutenberg corpus, namely the Gigaword newswire corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Graff and Cieri, 2003)</ref>, and noted degraded performance for both segmentation and Brown clustering. With re- spect to the former, the obvious issue is consid- erably more complex proper nouns phrases such as governmental organizations and related titles. For the latter, there were several clusters in the top 10 (including the first one) which corresponded to LOCATION, while the first (fairly) clean PERSON cluster was the 15th largest; in general, individual people, organizations, and other groupings of peo- ple (e.g. by country of origin) were not well dis- tinguished by Brown clustering in the Gigaword corpus, at least not with the same low number of clusters that worked well in the Project Gutenberg corpus.</p><p>Also less than promising is the potential for using text-level classification in other genres: whereas the average number of token occurrences of distinct name types within a single text in the Project Gutenberg corpus is 5.9, this number is just 1.6 for the much-shorter texts of the Giga- word corpus. Except in cases where it is possible to collapse texts into appropriately-sized groups where the use of a particular name is likely to be both common and consistent-an example might be a collection of texts written by a single au- thor, which in social media such as Twitter seems to obey the classic one-sense-per-discourse rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gella et al., 2014</ref>)-it's not clear that this ap- proach can be applied successfully in cases where texts are relatively short, which is a far more com- mon situation. We also note that relying primarily on contextual classification while eschewing re- sources such as gazetteers makes much less sense outside the context of fiction; we would expect rel- atively few fictitious entities in most genres.</p><p>LitNER tags names into only two main classes, PERSON and LOCATION, plus a catch-all OTHER. This coarse-grained tag set reflects not only the practical limitations of the method, but also where we believe automatic methods have potential to provide useful information for literary analysis. The other clusters in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reflect word cate- gories which are relatively closed-class and much less central to the fictional narratives as character and setting; we don't see a compelling case for tagging them. When these and non-entities are ex- cluded from OTHER, what remains is eclectic, in- cluding names referring to small groups of people (e.g. families), animals, gods, ships, and titles of other works of literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented LitNER, an NER system targeted specifically at fiction. Our results show that a simple classifier, trained only with noisy examples derived in an unsupervised fash- ion, can easily beat a general-purpose supervised system, provided it has access to the full context of the text. Finally, we note that the NER tagging provided by LitNER has been integrated into the GutenTag tool (as of version 0.1.4). 6</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Performance of NER systems
