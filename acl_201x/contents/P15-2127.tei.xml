				<p>In this paper, we propose a flexible principle-based approach (PBA) for reader-emotion classification and writing assistance. PBA is a highly automated process that learns emotion templates from raw texts to characterize an emotion and is comprehensible for humans. These templates are adopted to predict reader-emotion, and may further assist in emotional resonance writing. Results demonstrate that PBA can effectively detect reader-emotions by exploiting the syntactic structures and semantic associations in the context, thus outperforming well-known statistical text classification methods and the state-of-the-art reader-emotion classification method. Moreover, writers are able to create more emotional resonance in articles under the assistance of the generated emotion templates. These templates have been proven to be highly inter-pretable, which is an attribute that is difficult to accomplish in traditional statistical methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Internet has rapidly grown into a powerful medium for disseminating information. People can easily share experiences and emotions anytime and anywhere on social media websites. Human feelings can be quickly collected through emotion classification, as these emotions reflect an individ- ual's feelings and experiences toward some sub- ject matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Turney, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Wilson et al., 2009</ref>). Moreover, people can obtain more sponsorship opportunities from manufacturers if their articles about a certain product are able to create more emotional resonance in the readers. Therefore, * Corresponding author emotion classification has been attracting more and more attention, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al. (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Purver and Battersby (2012)</ref>.</p><p>Emotion classification aims to predict the emo- tion categories (e.g., happy or angry) of the given text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Quan and Ren, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009</ref>). There are two aspects of emotions in texts, namely, writer's and reader's emotions. The former concerns the emotion expressed by the writer of the text, and the latter concerns the emotion a reader had after reading it. Rec- ognizing reader-emotion is different and may be even more complex than writer-emotion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Tang and Chen, 2012)</ref>. A writer may directly express her emotions through sentiment words. By contrast, reader-emotion possesses a more perplexing nature, as even common words can invoke different types of reader-emotions de- pending on the reader's personal experiences and knowledge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lin et al., 2007)</ref>. For instance, a sen- tence like "Kenya survivors describe deadly at- tack at Garissa University" is simply stating the facts without any emotion, but may invoke emo- tions such as angry or worried in its readers.</p><p>In light of this rationale, we propose a principle- based approach (PBA) for reader-emotion classifi- cation. It is a highly automated process that in- tegrates various types of knowledge to generate discriminative linguistic templates that can be ac- knowledged as the essential knowledge for hu- mans to understand different kinds of emotions. PBA recognizes reader-emotions of documents us- ing an alignment algorithm that allows a template to be partially matched through a statistical scor- ing scheme. Experiments demonstrate that PBA can achieve a better performance than other well- known text categorization methods and the state- of-the-art reader-emotion classification method. Furthermore, we adopt these generated templates to assist in emotional resonance writing. Results show that writers are able to generate more emo-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">−2log p(w) N (w∧E) (1−p(w)) N (E)−N (w∧E) p(w) N (w∧¬E) (1−p(w)) N (¬E)−N (w∧¬E) p(w|E) N (w∧E) (1−p(w|E)) N (E)−N (w∧E) p(w|¬E) N (w∧¬E) (1−p(w|¬E)) N (¬E)−N (w∧¬E) (1)</formula><p>tional resonance in readers after exploiting these templates, demonstrating the capability of PBA in extracting templates with high interpretability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Extracting Emotion Templates from Raw Text</head><p>PBA attempts to construct emotion templates through recognition of crucial elements using a three-layered approach. First, since keywords contain important information, PBA learns reader- emotion specific keywords using an effective feature selection method, log likelihood ratio (LLR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Manning and Schütze, 1999)</ref>. It employs Equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> to calculate the likelihood of the assumption that the occurrence of a word w in reader-emotion E is not random. In (1), E denotes the set of documents of the reader-emotion in the training data; N (E) and N (¬E) denote the num- bers of documents that do or do not contain this emotion, respectively; and N (w ∧ E) is the num- ber of documents with emotion E and having w.</p><p>The probabilities p(w), p(w|E), and p(w|¬E) are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. A larger LLR value is considered closely associ- ated with an emotion. Words in the training data are ranked by LLR values, and the top 200 are in- cluded in our emotion keyword list. Next, named entities (NEs) have been shown to improve the performance of identifying top- ics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bashaddadh and Mohd, 2011</ref>). Thus, we uti- lize Wikipedia to semi-automatically label NEs with their semantic classes, which can be con- sidered as a form of generalization. Wikipedia's category tags are used to label NEs recognized by the Stanford NER 1 . If there are more than one category tag for an NE, we select the most dominant one with the highest number of as- sociated Wikipedia pages. The assumption is that the generality of a tag is indicated by the number of Wikipedia pages that are linked to it. For example, a query "奥巴马 (Obama)" to the Wikipedia would return a page titled "贝拉克.奥巴马 (Barack Obama)". Within this page, there are a number of category tags such as "民主党 (Democratic Party)" and "美国总统 1 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml (Presidents of the United States)". Suppose "美国总统 (Presidents of the United States)" has more out-going links, we will label "奥巴马 (Obama)" as " <ref type="bibr">[美国总统]</ref> (Presidents of the United States)". We also annotate those NEs not found in Wikipedia with their category tags. In this manner, we can transform plain NEs to a more general class and increase the cov- erage of each label. Finally, to incorporate richer semantic context, we exploit the Extended HowNet (E-HowNet) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen et al., 2005</ref>) after the above processes to tag the remaining text with sense labels. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates crucial element labeling process. Consider the clause C n = "奥巴马又代表民主党赢得美国总统选举 (Obama, representing the Democratic Party, won the U.S. Presidential election)". First, "奥巴马 (Obama)" is found in the emotion keyword list and tagged. Then, NEs like "民主党 (Democratic Party)" and "总统选举 (Presidential election)" are recognized and tagged as "{政党 (Party)}" and "{总统选举 (Presidential election)}". Sub- sequently, other terms such as "代表 (represent)" and "赢得 (won)" are labeled with their corre- sponding E-HowNet senses. Finally, we obtain the sequence " <ref type="bibr">[奥巴马]</ref> : {代表} : {政党} : {得到} : {国家} : {总统选举} ( <ref type="bibr">[Obama]</ref> : {represents} : {party} : {got} : {country} : {Presidential elec- tion})." This three-layered labeling process serves as a generalization of the raw text for capturing crucial elements used in the template generation stage that follows.</p><p>The emotion template generation process aims at automatically constructing representative tem- plates consisting of a sequence of crucial el- ements. We observed that the rank-frequency distribution of the elements follows the Zipf's law <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Manning and Schütze, 1999</ref>). Thus, we rank the templates according to their frequency, and adopt a dominating set algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Johnson, 1974)</ref> to use the top 20% templates to cover the rest. First, we constructed a directed graph G = {V, E}, in which vertices V contains all crucial element sequences {CES 1 , · · · , CES m } in each emotion, and edges E represent the dominating re- lations between sequences. If CES x dominates CES y , there is an edge CES x → CES y . A 776 A clause C n in an article: sequence of crucial elements dominating relation is defined as follows. 1) Cru- cial element sequences with high frequency are selected as candidate dominators. 2) Longer se- quences dominate shorter ones if their head and tail elements are identical. The intermediate el- ements are treated as insertions and/or deletions, which can be scored based on their distribution in this emotion during the matching process. Lastly, we preserve top 100 most prominent and distinc- tive ones from approximately 55,000 sequences based on the dominating rate. This process serves as a kind of dimension reduction and facilitates the execution of our matching algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Template Matching for Inference</head><p>We believe that human perception of an emotion is through recognizing important events or semantic contents. For instance, when an article contains strongly correlated words such as "Japan (coun- try)", "Earthquake (disaster)", and "Tsunami (dis- aster)" simultaneously, it is natural to conclude that this article is more likely to elicit emotions like depressed and worried rather than happy and warm. Following this line of thought, PBA uses an alignment algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970)</ref> to measure the similarity between tem- plates and texts. It enables a single template to match multiple semantically related expressions with appropriate scores. For each clause in a doc- ument d j , we first label crucial elements CE = {ce 1 , · · · , ce n }, followed by the matching proce- dure that compares all sequences in CE from d j to all emotion templates ET = {et 1 , · · · , et j } in each emotion category, and calculates the scores. Within the alignment matching, a statistical based scoring criterion is used to score insertions, dele- tions, and substitutions as described below. The emotion e i with the highest sum of scores defined in (2) is considered as the winner.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Emotion(d j ) = arg max e i ∈E etn∈ETc i ,cem∈CE d j ∆(et n , ce m ) = k l ∆(et n · sl k , ce m · ce l )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where sl k and ce l represent the k th slot of et n and l th element of ce m , respectively. Details for scor- ing matched and unmatched elements are as fol- lows. If et n ·sl k and ce m ·ce l are identical, we add a matched score (MS) obtained from the LLR value of ce l if it matches a keyword. Otherwise, the score is determined by multiplying the frequency of the crucial element in category c i by a normal- izing factor λ = 100, as in (3). On the other hand, an unmatched element is given a score of insertion or deletion. The insertion score (IS), defined as (4), can be accounted for by the inversed entropy of this element, which represents the uniqueness or generality of it among categories. And the dele- tion score (DS), defined as <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(5)</ref>, is computed from the log frequency of this crucial element in this emotion category.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">MS (ce l ) =          LLR ce l , if ce l ∈ keyword λ f ce l m i=1 f ce i , otherwise (3) IS (ce l ) = 1 − m i=1 P (ce lc i ) · log 2 (P (ce lc i ))<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">DS (ce l ) = log f ce l m i=1 f ce i<label>(5)</label></formula><p>4 Experiments</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset and Setting</head><p>We collected a corpus of Chinese news articles from Yahoo! Kimo News 2 , in which each article is given votes from readers with emotion tags in eight categories: angry, worried, boring, happy, odd, depressing, warm, and informative. We con- sider the voted emotions as the reader's emotion toward the news. Following previous studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lin et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lin et al. (2008)</ref> that used a similar source, we exclude "informative" as it is not considered as an emotion category. To ensure the quality of our evaluation, only articles with a clear statistical distinction between the highest vote of emotion and others determined by t-test with a 95% confidence level are retained. Finally, 47,285 out of 68,026 articles are kept, and divided into the training set and the test set, each contain- ing 11,681 and 35,604 articles, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Reader's Emotion Classification</head><p>Several classification methods are implemented and compared. Na¨ıveNa¨ıve Bayes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McCallum et al., 1998</ref>) serves as the baseline, denoted as NB. In addition, a probabilistic graphical model that uses LDA as document representation to train an SVM classifier that determines a document as either rel- evant or irrelevant ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003</ref>), denotes as LDA. Next, an emotion keyword-based model, de- noted as KW, is trained using SVM to test the effect of our keyword extraction approach. CF is the state-of-the-art reader-emotion recognition method that combines various features including bigrams, words, metadata, and emotion category words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lin et al., 2007</ref>). For evaluation, we adopt the accuracy measures as used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lin et al. (2007)</ref>, and compute the macro-average (A M ) and micro- average (A µ ). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1 shows a comprehensive  evaluation of PBA and other methods</ref>   Since NB only considers surface word weight- ings and ignore inter-word relations, it only achieved an accuracy of 58.11%. By contrast, LDA includes both keywords and long-distance re- lations, thus greatly outperforms NB with an over- all accuracy of 76.10%. It even obtained the high- est accuracy of 92.83% for the emotions "worried" and "odd" among all methods. Notably, KW can bring about substantial proficiency in detecting the emotions, which indicates that reader-emotion can be recognized effectively by using only the LLR scores of keywords. Meanwhile, CF achieved a satisfactory overall accuracy around 85%, due to the combined lexical feature sets (e.g., charac- ter bigrams, word dictionary, and emotion key- words), paired with metadata of the articles. For instance, we found that many sports-related ar- ticles invoke the emotion "happy". Specifically, 45% of all "happy" instances are sports-related, and a sports-related article has a 31% chance of having the emotion tag "happy". Hence, the high accuracy of the emotion category "happy" could be the result of people's general enthusiasm over sports rather than a particular event. On top of that, PBA can generate distinctive emotion tem- plates to capture variations of similar expressions, thus achieving better outcome. For instance, the template "{国家 country }" : [发生 occur ] : [地震 earthquake ] : {劫难 disaster }" is generated by PBA for the emotion "worried". It is perceivable that this template is relaying information about dis- astrous earthquakes in a country, and such news often makes readers worry. The ability to yield such emotion-specific, human interpretable tem- plates could account for the outstanding perfor- mance of PBA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Reader's Emotion Templates Suggestion in Emotional Resonance Writing</head><p>This experiment aims at testing the effectiveness of the emotion templates in aiding writers to com- pose articles with stronger emotional resonance.</p><p>Here, we only consider coarse-grained emotion categories (i.e., positive and negative). Thus, fine- grained emotions like happy, warm, and odd are merged into 'positive', while angry, boring, de- pressing, and worried are merged into 'negative'. 10 templates for each of the fine-grained emo- tions are selected, resulting in 30 and 40 templates for the two coarse-grained emotions, respectively. We recruited seven writers to compose two arti- cles that they think will trigger positive and neg- ative emotions without using templates (denoted as NT). Then, we asked them to compose two more articles with the aid of templates (denoted as WT). Afterwards, all articles are randomly or- ganized into a questionnaire to test the emotional resonance. Subjects are required to perform two tasks: 1) answer 'positive', 'neutral', or 'negative' 2) give a score according to the five-point Likert scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Likert, 1932</ref>) for a given emotion. In the end, 42 effective responses are gathered. For Task 1, the score is defined as the number of matching responses and answers. As for Task 2, the score is the sum of all articles. Higher scores indicate bet- ter emotional resonance between writers and read- ers. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the sum of scores in Task 1 from all subjects, grouped by writer. As for Task 2, <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the average score across subjects, grouped by writers. In both tasks, we can see that higher scores are obtained after using templates, indicating that emotion templates can indeed assist writers in creating stronger emotional resonance in their composition.</p><p>To sum up, results show that PBA can gener- ate emotion templates that not only help machines predict reader's emotion, but also effectively aid writers in creating a stronger emotional resonance with the readers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present PBA, a flexible, highly automated, and human-interpretable approach for reader-emotion classification. By capturing prominent and representative patterns in texts, PBA can effectively recognize the reader-emotion.</p><p>Results demonstrate that PBA outperforms other reader-emotion detection methods, and can assist writers in creating higher emotional resonance. In the future, we plan to further refine and employ it to other NLP applications.
