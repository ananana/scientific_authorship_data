				<p>Open Information Extraction (Open IE) serves for the analysis of vast amounts of texts by extraction of assertions, or relations , in the form of tuples argument 1; relation; argument 2. Various approaches to Open IE have been designed to perform in a fast, unsupervised manner. All of them require language specific information for their implementation. In this work, we introduce an approach to Open IE based on syntactic constraints over POS tag sequences targeted at Spanish language. We describe the rules specific for Spanish language constructions and their implementation in EXTRHECH, an Open IE system for Spanish. We also discuss language-specific issues of implementation. We compare EXTRHECH&apos;s performance with that of REVERB, a similar Open IE system for English, on a parallel dataset and show that these systems perform at a very similar level. We also compare EXTRHECH&apos;s performance on a dataset of grammatically correct sentences against its performance on a dataset of random texts extracted from the Web, drastically different in their quality from the first dataset. The latter experiment shows ro-bustness of EXTRHECH on texts from the Web.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Open IE is a rapidly developing area in text pro- cessing, with its own applications and approaches that are different from traditional IE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Etzioni, 2011)</ref>. Unlike traditional IE, where systems are targeted at extraction of instances of particular re- lations with arguments restricted to certain seman- tic classes, e.g., to be born in(HUMAN; LOCA- TION), Open IE serves for extraction of all pos- sible relations with arbitrary arguments. For ex- ample, in "Woman who drove van full of kids is charged with attempted murder" two relations can be identified: Woman; drove; van full of kids and Woman; is charged with; attempted murder.</p><p>The ability to extract arbitrary relations from text allows applications of Open IE that are not possible in the frame of traditional IE. Among them are fact extraction at sentence level (e.g., Mozart; was born in; Salzburg), new perspective on search as question answering (e.g., Where was Mozart born?) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Etzioni, 2011)</ref>, or assessment of the quality of text documents at Web scale ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Horn et al., 2013)</ref>. Additionally, the output of Open IE systems can serve for ontology population <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Soderland et al., 2010</ref>) and acquisition of common sense knowledge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lin et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Although all Open IE systems are targeted at the extraction of arbitrary relations, the approaches to this task vary significantly. The pilot approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banko et al. (2007)</ref> is based on semi-supervised learning of general relation pat- terns that then serve for extraction of arbitrary relations. However, the output of such systems contains many incoherent and inconsistent extrac- tions, and the training stage is quite computation- ally complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fader et al. (2011)</ref> suggested an- other approach where syntactic and lexical con- straints were applied over POS-tagged input. This approach has proven to be robust and fast enough for relation extraction at Web scale.</p><p>Although Open IE is targeted at extraction of arbitrary relations without any semantic restric- tions, all approaches have strong language de- pendent restrictions and require language spe- cific information to be introduced in the corre- sponding systems. For Spanish language, the apporach based on rules over dependency trees has been implemented both using full parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilar-Galicia, 2012</ref>) and using shallow depen- dency parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gamallo et al., 2012</ref>). The for- mer work shows that this approach is too com- putationally costly and is not always robust even on grammatically correct texts. The latter work does not report any results for Spanish language or discusses any details specific to implementations for languages other than English. Further, we are not aware of any existing research on whether the approach based on syntactic constraints over POS tags can be generalized to other languages. Ad- ditionally, although Open IE is claimed to be use- ful for information extraction from the Web, we are not aware of any research on its applicability to texts randomly extracted from the Internet, i.e., those that have not been verified for grammatical correctness by peers or editors.</p><p>In this paper we discuss Open IE based on syn- tactic constraints over POS tag sequences, aimed at Spanish language. We describe its implemen- tation and introduce EXTRHECH, an Open IE sys- tem for Spanish. We also compare its performance with that of REVERB <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fader et al., 2011</ref>) on a parallel dataset. Additionally, we evaluate perfor- mance of our system over a dataset of texts ran- domly extracted from the Internet and discuss the issues that arise when processing random Internet texts. We also give a brief analysis of errors.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Related work is reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 presents our approach to Open IE for Spanish and describes the EXTRHECH system. Section 4 describes the experiments for a parallel English-Spanish dataset and for a Spanish dataset of texts randomly ex- tracted from the Internet. In Section 5, a brief analysis of errors is presented. Section 6 draws the conclusions and outlines future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>There exist several approaches to Open IE.</p><p>Chronologically the first one was introduced in the pilot works on Open IE by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banko et al. (2007)</ref> and . Their approach is based on semi-supervised machine learning prin- ciples and includes three main steps: (1) man- ual labeling of a training corpus for seed relation phrases and features; (2) further semi-supervised learning of relations; (3) automatic extractions of relations and their arguments. This approach is implemented in TEXTRUNNER ( , WOE pos , and WOE parse , both <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Wu and Weld, 2010)</ref>. In these systems, the detection of a relation triple starts from the potential argu- ments expressed as noun phrases, i.e., before the connecting relation phrase is detected. Once de- tected, neither the argument phrases nor the rela- tion phrase can be backtracked, which makes the approach prone to incoherent and uninformative extractions. For example, in "to make a deal with", deal can be erroneously extracted as an argument, although it is a part of the relation phrase.</p><p>The group of rule-based approaches includes systems based on rules applied over linguisti- cally annotated texts. FES-2012 system (Aguilar- Galicia, 2012) applies rules to the fully parsed sen- tences. However, in the same work the authors show that this approach is too slow to be scaled to a Web-sized corpus and that it is not robust. An- other system implementing rule-based approach is DEPOE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gamallo et al., 2012</ref>). In this system, the rules are applied to the output of shallow depen- dency parsing. In REVERB system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fader et al., 2011</ref>), syntactic constraints are applied over POS tags and syntactic chunks. The last two systems show better results in terms of precision/recall and speed, and, consequently, scalability to a Web- sized corpus.</p><p>Finally, the approach based on the deep au- tomatic linguistic analysis is implemented in OLLIE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mausam et al., 2012)</ref>. This system com- bines various approaches: it uses output of a rule- based Open IE system to bootstrap learning of the relation patterns and then additionally applies lex- ical and semantic patterns to extract relations that are not expessed through verb phrases. Such a complex approach leads to high-precision results with a high yield. However, there is a tradeoff be- tween accuracy of the output and cost of imple- mentation and computation and complexity of the training stage.</p><p>All these approaches require language- dependent information for their implementation. The third approach directly uses lexical infor- mation for the context analysis. The other two approaches employ language-specific morpholog- ical and syntactic information. Of the described systems, only two have been implemented for languages other than English. FES-2012 system is implemented for Spanish language; however, its use of the full syntactic parsing does not scale to a Web-sized corpus. DEPOE system, based on rules over shallow dependency parsing, is claimed to have its variants for Spanish, Portuguese, and Galician languages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gamallo et al., 2012)</ref>. How- ever, the authors do not report any experimental results on languages other than English or any language-specific details.</p><p>The approach based on syntactic constraints over POS tags has not been applied to languages other than English, in spite of that this method can be easily adapted to other languages because it only requires a reliable POS tagger. The basic al- gorithm for relation extraction, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fader et al. (2011)</ref>, is as follows:</p><p>• First, search for a verb-containing relation phrase in a sentence; • If detected, search for a noun phrase to the left of the relation phrase; • If a noun phrase detected, search for another noun phrase to the right of the relation phrase.</p><p>Additionally, the experiments for Open IE sys- tems have been conducted only on texts that came from verified sources, i.e., Wikipedia, news, or textbooks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fader et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mausam et al., 2012</ref>). However, Open IE is meant to work with Web text data that may come from any source including those that have not been edited or verified for grammar errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System Description</head><p>In this section we introduce EXTRHECH, 1 a sys- tem for Open IE in Spanish. It takes a POS-tagged text as input, applies syntactic constraints over se- quences of POS-tags, and returns a list of extracted relations as triples argument 1; relation; argu- ment 2 that correspond to each sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Basic Processing</head><p>The system takes as input a POS-tagged text. In our experiemnts, we used a morphological ana- lyzer from Freeling-2. <ref type="bibr">2 (Padró et al., 2010</ref>). For Spanish language, it returns POS tags accoridng to EAGLES POS tag set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Leech and Wilson, 1999</ref>). Consequently, our system is designed to work with this POS tag set.</p><p>Spanish uses a number of non-ASCII charac- ters, such asáas´asá, ´ e, ˜ n, etc. These characters can come in different encodings. To be able to cor- rectly analyze text with these characters, Freeling analyzer should receive the input in ISO encod- ing. Thus, the input text needs an additional pre- processing stage to be converted into this encod- ing. Though this might look as a minor technical issue, guessing the original encoding becomes a significant problem when working with texts from arbitrary sources on the Web. We discuss encoding related issues in Section 4.2.</p><p>After the text has been properly POS-tagged, we feed it into EXTRHECH system, which ap- plies the fact extraction algorithm described in Section 2 to each sentence, one sentence at a time. We use the same basic algorithm as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fader et al., 2011</ref>) but with different triple matching rules as appropriate for Spanish grammar.</p><p>The original POS-tag sequences for English would produce nonsense results on Spanish input due to substantial difference in grammars: infini- tives are not preceded by "to", adjectives usually follow nouns, and oblique case pronouns precede verbs instead of following them, just to name a few peculiarities of Spanish. First, the system looks for a verb-containing phrase in a sentence by matching it against the fol- lowing expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">VREL → (V W* P) | (V),</formula><p>where V stands either for a single verb optionally preceded by a reflexive pronoun (se realizaron, "were carried out"), or a participle (calificado, "qualified"). V W* P matches a verb with depen- dent words, where W stands for either a noun, an adjective, an adverb, a pronoun, or an article, and P stands either for a preposition optionally imme- diately followed by an infinitive, or for a gerund (sigue siendo, "continues to be"). The symbol * denotes zero or more matches. Here and fur- ther, the whole match is referred to as verb phrase (though it is not a verb phrase in linguistic sense).</p><p>After detecting a verb phrase, EXTRHECH looks for a noun phrase to the left from the be- ginning of the verb phrase. This noun phrase is a potential first argument of the relation. If a match is found, then the system looks for another noun phrase to the right from the end of the verb phrase. The noun on the right side is treated as the second argument.</p><p>Noun phrases are searched for with the follow- ing regular expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">NP → Np (PREP Np)?,</formula><p>where Np matches a noun optionally preceded by either an article (la dinámica, "the dynamics"), an adjective, an ordinal number (los primeros ganadores, "the first winners"), a number (3 casas, "3 houses"), or their combination, and optionally followed by either a single adjective (un esfuerzo criminal, "a criminal effort"), a single participle, or both (los documentos escritos antiguos, "the ancient written documents"). The whole expres- sion matched by Np can be preceded by an indef- inite determinant construction, e.g., uno de, "one of ". PREP matches a single preposition. Hence, an entire noun phrase is either a single noun with optional modifiers or a noun with optional modi- fiers followed by a prepositional phrase that is a preposition and another noun with its correspond- ing optional modifiers (una larga lista de proble- mas actuales, "a long list of current problems"). The symbol ? denotes 0 or 1 matches.</p><p>If noun phrases are matched on both sides of the verb phrase, all three components are considered to represent a relation and are extracted in the form of a triple.</p><p>As an output unit, EXTRHECH returns a triple consisting of argument 1; relation; argument 2, where argument 1 semantically is, e.g., an agent or experiencer of the relation and argument 2 is a general object or circumstance of the relation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Additional Processing</head><p>Above we described the core rules and the basic sequence for relation extraction. In addition to them, we also implemented several optional rules for processing of certain language constructions that can be turned on and off with the input pa- rameters.</p><p>First, participle clauses that follow a noun can be searched for a relational triple if they terminate with a noun. For example, from a phrase Precios del café suministrados por la OIC ("Coffee prices provided by International Coffee Organization") EXTRHECH returns the relation:</p><p>Precios del café; suministrados por; la OIC.</p><p>Second, EXTRHECH also approaches resolu- tion of coordinating conjunctions between verb phrases and between noun phrases into corre- sponding separate relations. Here follows the ex- ample of a sentence with a coordinating conjunc- tion between verb phrases: El cerebro almacena enormes cantidades de información y realiza millones de actividades todos los días ("The brain stores vast amounts of information and performs millions of activities every day")</p><p>. Two facts are detected:</p><p>El cerebro; almacena enormes cantidades de; información and El cerebro; realiza millones de; actividades todos los días.</p><p>Third, relative clauses introduced by single rel- ative pronouns (e.g., que ("that", "who"), cual ("which")) as in las partes que conforman un trabajo de investigación ("parts that make up a research work") are also searched for relations. However, relative pronoun phrases with preposi- tions, e.g. en el cual ("in which") are not taken into consideration for relation extraction due to their coreferential complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Limitations</head><p>The implementation of basic processing per- formed by EXTRHECH system follows the algo- rithm introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fader et al., 2011</ref>). This means that extracted facts are limited to the rela- tions expressed through a verb phrase. This limi- tation is discussed in the cited paper.</p><p>In our apporach to Open IE in Spanish, we do not allow pronouns to be potential arguments of a relation. It was mainly done because of a wide use of a neutral pronoun lo ("this", "which", or no direct translation) as a head of relative clauses in Spanish language, e.g., lo que dio valor al poder judicial (" that gave value to the judiciary"). In- cluding pronouns for potential argument matches would return a lot of uninformative relations as lo; dio valor a; el poder judicial. This issue can be solved only by introducing anaphora resolution techniques which involves processing on a super- sentence level. Although seemingly feasible, this modification will necessarily slow down the ex- traction speed which is critical while working with large scale corpora. As mentioned in Section 2, high speed performance is one of the main advan- tages of the approach to Open IE based on syntac- tis constraints compared to the others. Hence, any modifications that would affect its speed should be considered with caution.</p><p>Another language dependent limitation is re- lated to the order of the processing.</p><p>As earlier described in Section 3.1, an extracted triple is expected to correspond semantically to agent/experiencer; relation; general ob- ject/circumstance. This is expected to be cor- rect for a direct word order, i.e., Subject -Verb -(Indirect) Object, which is a dominant word or- der for Spanish. Yet the inverted word order, i.e.</p><p>(Indirect) Object -Verb -Subject (e.g., De la médula espinal nacen los nervios periféricos, i.e., literally *"From the spinal cord arise peripheral nerves"), also occasionally takes place in gram- matically correct and stylistically neutral Spanish texts. However, the occurence of this construction is less then 10% according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clements, 2006</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and Evaluation</head><p>In this section we describe the experiments con- ducted with EXTRHECH system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiment on parallel news dataset</head><p>We compare EXTRHECH's performance with that of REVERB, an Open IE system for English based on the same algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fader et al., 2011</ref>). Since these systems are designed for different languages, we ran our experiment on a parallel dataset. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We took 300 parallel sentences from the English-Spanish part of News Commentary Cor- pus <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Callison-Burch et al., 2011</ref>). Then, we ran the extractors over the corresponding languages. After that, two human annotators labeled each ex- traction as correct or incorrect. For the Spanish part of the dataset, the annotators agreed on 80% of extractions (Cohen's kappa κ = 0.60), whereas for the English part they agreed on 85% of extrac- tions with κ = 0.68. For both datasets their respec- tive κ coefficients indicate substantial agreement between the annotators.</p><p>Precision was calculated as a fraction of correct extractions among all returned extractions. We calculated Recall as a fraction of all returned cor- rect extractions among all possible (i.e., expected) correct extractions. By manual revision of the sen- tences in the datasets, we made a list of all ex- pected correct extractions. Their number was used to estimate the recall.</p><p>In contrast to REVERB, our system does not have a confidence score mechnaism at this point. To make the comparison between the systems ap- propriate, we ran REVERB extractor with the con- fidence score level set to 0 that means that the sys- tem returns all relations that match the rules, i.e., in the same way as EXTRHECH does. Hence, the systems were in equivalent conditions. The results of the experiment are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>As we see, on a parallel dataset of texts from News Commentary Corpus, both systems show a very similar performance. Based on this observa- tion, we can conclude that the algorithm suggested  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Performance comparison of REVERB and EXTRHECH systems over a parallel dataset.</p><p>in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fader et al., 2011</ref>) can be easily adopted for other languages with dominating SVO word order and an available POS-tagger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experiment on Raw Web dataset</head><p>One of the most important goals of Open IE sys- tems is to be able to process large amounts of texts directly from the Web. This requires high per- formance speed and robustness on texts that of- ten lack grammatical and orthographical correct- ness or coherence. The study showing the ap- proach's advantage in speed was already presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fader et al., 2011</ref>). In this work we focused on robustness. We evaluated the performance of our system on a dataset of sentences extracted from the Internet "as is". For this dataset, we took 200 random data chunks detected by a sentence splitter from CommonCrawl 2012 corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kirkpatrick, 2011</ref>), which is a collection of web texts crawled from over 5 billion web pages. However, 41 from those 200 chunks were not samples of textual information in human language but rather pieces of programming codes or numbers. We took out these chunks because they are not rele- vant for our research. In a real life scenario they could be easily detected and eliminated from the Web data stream. After this, our dataset consisted of 159 sentences written in human language. We will refer to this dataset as Raw Web text dataset. 1 Of 159 sentences of the dataset, 36 sentences (22% of the dataset) were grammatically incorrect or in- coherent, as evaluated by a professional linguist. We ran EXTRHECH system over this dataset and asked two human judges to label extractions as correct or incorrect. The annotators agreed on 70% of extractions with Cohen's κ = 0.40, which indicates the lower bound of moderate agreement between judges.</p><p>Precision and Recall were calculated in the same manner as described in Section 4.1. We com- pare these numbers to the results obtained for the dataset of grammatically correct sentences from News Commentary Corpus in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>We can observe that system's performence has  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Performance of EXTRHECH on the gram- matically correct dataset and the dataset of noisy sentences extracted from the Web not lowered significantly when processing "noisy" texts compared to edited newspaper texts. An in- teresting observation is that texts from the Internet are poorer in facts than the news texts. The num- ber of expected extractions was manually evalu- ated by a human expert for both datasets. The ra- tio of extractions to sentences for the news dataset was 1.5:1, while for the Raw Web dataset it was only 1.03:1. Now we will briefly discuss the issue arising due to various encoding standards used for non- ASCII characters, e.g., ofáof´ofá, ´ e, ˜ n, etc. While apply- ing Freeling morphological analyzer to the dataset, we encountered an issue that the sentences came in various encodings. As we mentioned in Sec- tion 3, Freeling-2.2 analyzer works properly only with ISO encoded input. Therefore, we had to convert each sentence from the dataset into ISO encoding. While most of the sentences were in UTF-8 encoding and were converted in a single pass, the encoding of about 3% of the sentences was initially corrupted, therefore, they were not processed correctly by the POS-tagger. Although the issue is manageable at the scale of a small dataset, it might affect the speed and quality of fact extraction when working at Web scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Error Analysis</head><p>After running EXTRHECH on the datasets, we an- alyzied the errors in the output. We followed the classifications of the types of errors and their causes suggested in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhila and Gelbukh, 2014</ref>). The distribution of the errors in EXTRHECH's out- put over the types of errors is shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The data about error types was gathered over ex- tractions from Raw Web dataset. When errors are present both in the arguments and in the relation phrase, they are likely to have the same cause.</p><p>Based on the analysis of the outputs over Raw Web dataset, the following causes for errors have been observed:</p><p>• Underspecified noun phrase • Overspecified verb phrase • Non-contiguous verb phrase Type of errors Percentage Incorrect relation phrase 21% Incorrect argument(s) 45% of them, with also incorrect relation 19% Incorrect argument order 6% <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Distribution of errors in output by the basic error types in relation extraction for EXTRHECH system run over Raw Web dataset</p><p>• N-ary relation or preposition (e.g., entre, "be- tween") • Conditional subordinate clause • Incorrectly resolved relative clause • Incorrectly resolved conjunction • Inverse word order • Incorrect POS-tagging • Grammatical errors in original sentences</p><p>Inverse word order is one of the main causes for the incorrect order of arguments in extracted rela- tions. However, as it can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, this is the least common type of errors, which is in ac- cordance to the low frecuency of the inverse word order <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clements, 2006)</ref>. A more detailed analysis of the issues that cause the errors can be found in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhila and Gelbukh, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We have introduced an approach to Open IE based on syntactic constraints over POS tag sequences targeted at Spanish language. We described the rules for relation phrases and their arguments in Spanish and their implementation in EXTRHECH system. Further, we presented a series of ex- periments with EXTRHECH and showed (1) that the performance of this approach to Open IE is similar for English and Spanish, and (2) that EXTRHECH's performance is robust on texts of varying quality. We also gave a brief classification of errors by their types and causes.</p><p>Our future plans include implementation of shallow parsing and syntactic n-grams ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sidorov et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Sidorov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sidorov et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sidorov, 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sidorov, 2013b)</ref>, as well as learning techniques, and analysis of their influence on the system's performance.</p></div>
