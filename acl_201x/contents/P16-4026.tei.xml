			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce GoWvis 1 , an interactive web application that represents any piece of text inputted by the user as a graph-of-words and leverages graph degeneracy and community detection to generate an ex-tractive summary (keyphrases and sentences) of the inputted text in an un-supervised fashion. The entire analysis can be fully customized via the tuning of many text preprocessing, graph building, and graph mining parameters. Our system is thus well suited to educational purposes , exploration and early research experiments. The new summarization strategy we propose also shows promise.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The term independence assumption made by the traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation of text comes with many limitations. One approach that challenges this assumption is the Graph-of- Words model (GoW). As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, it rep- resents a textual document as a graph whose ver- tices are unique terms in the document and whose edges capture term co-occurrence within a win- dow of predetermined, fixed size, that is slided over the entire document from start to finish.</p><p>This approach is statistical, as terms are linked based on local context of co-occurrence only, re- gardless of any semantic or syntactic information (Distributional Hypothesis). Unlike BoW, GoW encodes term dependency and term order (via di- rected edges). The strength of the dependence be- tween two words can also be captured by assigning a weight to the edge that links them. While other definitions can be used, we consider here edge A method for solution of systems of linear algebraic equations with m-dimensional lambda matrices. A system of linear algebraic equations with m-dimensional lambda matrices is considered. The proposed method of searching for the solution of this system lies in reducing it to a numerical system of a special kind. weights to be integers matching co-occurrence counts.</p><p>GoW can be tracked back to the works of (Mi- halcea and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tarau, 2004</ref>) and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Erkan and Radev, 2004</ref>) who applied it to the tasks of unsupervised keyword extraction and extractive single docu- ment summarization. Notably, the former effort ranked nodes based on a modified version of the PageRank algorithm.</p><p>Recently, (  showed that degeneracy-based approaches (i.e., extracting dense, cohesive subgraphs) could out- perform PageRank for unsupervised keyword ex- traction. We will show in subsection 3.4 how com- bining this strategy with graph clustering may im- prove summarization performance for multitopic documents. Other NLP tasks on which GoW- based approaches have reached new state-of-the- art include ad-hoc information retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rousseau and Vazirgiannis, 2013)</ref> and document classifica- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Malliaros and Skianis, 2015)</ref>. The high success, promising potential and visual nature of the GoW representation was the impetus for the development of GoWvis.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as fol- lows: Section 2 provides some background on graph degeneracy and community detection, Sec- tion 3 presents our system, and finally, Section 4 concludes and discusses future work.</p><p>2 Graph mining 2.1 Graph degeneracy k-core. A core of order k (or k-core) of a graph G is a maximal connected subgraph of G in which every vertex v has at least degree k <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Seidman, 1983)</ref>. It is a relaxation of a clique: a k-core with k + 1 members is a subgraph where every two nodes are adjacent, that is, a clique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Luce and Perry, 1949)</ref>. In the classical unweighted case, edge weights are not taken into account and thus the degree of a node v is simply equal to the num- ber of its neighbors. In the weighted (or general- ized) case, the degree of a vertex v is the sum of the weights of its incident edges.</p><p>k-core decomposition. The k-core decomposi- tion of a graph G is the list of all its cores from 0 (G itself) to k max (its main core). It forms a hi- erarchy of subgraphs that are recursively included in one another and whose cohesiveness and size respectively increases and decreases with k <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Seidman, 1983)</ref>. A linear (resp. linearithmic) time al- gorithm for k-core decomposition can be found in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batagelj and Zaveršnik, 2002</ref>) for the unweighted (resp. weighted) case. Both algorithms implement a pruning process that removes the lowest degree node at each step.</p><p>The core number of a node is the highest or- der of a core that contains this node. Nodes with high core numbers have the desirable property of not only being central (like nodes with high de- gree centrality) but also part of cohesive subgraphs with other central nodes (i.e., the other members of the upper cores). For this reason, they make, among other things, influential spreaders ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kitsak et al., 2010</ref>) and good keywords ( .</p><p>The main core of a graph yields a fast (but rough) approximation of its densest subgraph. In- deed, it may contain in some cases a very large portion of the nodes of the graph. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Seidman, 1983</ref>) puts it, k-cores should be regarded as seedbeds within which it is possible to find more cohesive subgraphs.</p><p>k-truss. A triangle-based extension of k-core that yields densest subgraphs is k-truss <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cohen, 2008)</ref>. More precisely, the k-truss of a graph G is the largest subgraph of G in which every edge belongs to at least k − 2 cycle subgraphs of length 3 (i.e., triangles). Put differently, every edge in the k-truss joins two vertices that have at least k − 2 common neighbors.</p><p>k-truss decomposition. The k-truss decompo- sition of a graph G is the set of all its k-trusses from k − 2 to k max . The k-trusses correspond to densely connected subsets of the k-cores that can be viewed as their essential parts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Malliaros et al., 2016</ref>). The maximal k-truss thus yields a smaller and denser subgraph of G that better approximates its densest subgraph. Nevertheless, the finer reso- lution of the k-truss decomposition comes at the cost of a greater complexity, polynomial in the number of edges ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wang and Cheng, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>By analogy with k-core, the truss number of an edge is the highest order of a truss the edge be- longs to. By extension, we define the truss number of a node as the maximum truss number of its in- cident edges, like in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Malliaros et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We wrote our own implementation of weighted k-core in R (R Core Team, 2015). For unweighted k-core, we used the igraph package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</ref>), and for k-truss, the C++ imple- mentation offered by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wang and Cheng, 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Community detection</head><p>While the k-core and k-truss decomposition algo- rithms converge towards the unique most cohesive subgraph of a graph, the task of community de- tection consists in clustering a graph into multi- ple groups within which connections are dense and between which they are sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fortunato, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Many community detection algorithms have been proposed, of which some of the most pop- ular are listed below. The fundamental Modularity function used by the first three algorithms mea- sures the strength of the partition of a graph by comparing the number of within-group edges to the expected such number in a null model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Newman and Girvan, 2004</ref>).</p><p>The fast greedy algorithm (Clauset et al., 2004) merges at each step the pair of nodes that yields the largest gain in modularity until a single com- munity remains. The best partition is the one as- sociated with the greatest modularity value.</p><p>The multi-level (or Louvain) algorithm (Blon- del et al., 2008) first aggregates each node with one of its neighbors such that the gain in modu-larity is maximized. Then, the groupings obtained at the first step are turned into nodes, yielding a new graph. This two-step process iterates until a peak in modularity is attained and no more change occurs.</p><p>The walktrap algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pons and Latapy, 2005</ref>) uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering with a random walk-based distance between ver- tices to obtain a set of subdivisions of the graph. The optimal clustering is given by the level of the hierarchy that maximizes modularity.</p><p>Finally, the infomap algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008)</ref> optimizes the map equation to find an optimal compression of a description of information flow in the graph. Unlike other afore- mentioned algorithms, infomap works for directed networks.</p><p>We used the R wrappers of the igraph C im- plementations of the algorithms presented above. Note that all igraph implementations can (option- ally) take edge weights into account. Unless men- tioned, all other parameters remained at their de- fault values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">GoWvis</head><p>Our system was developed in R Shiny ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chang et al., 2015)</ref>, and can be broken down into the four modules shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. The steps are sequen- tial except the last two which are performed in parallel. In what follows, we present the tuning parameters involved at each step and discuss their individual impact (all other parameters being held constant).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Text preprocessing</head><p>The first module cleans the inputted text by (1) removing special characters, punctuation marks except the ones indicative of sentence boundary (used by the second module, see subsection 3.2) and intra-word dashes, (2) removing numbers ex- cept dates (like "2016"), and (3) tokenizing. In addition to R built-in functions, the stringr pack- age <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Wickham, 2015)</ref> is used here. Also, text is split into sentences using the implementation of the Apache OpenNLP Maxent sentence detector offered by the openNLP R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hornik, 2015)</ref>. The list of sentences is eventually passed to the fourth module (see subsection 3.4). Additionally, the user is provided with the following tuning pa- rameters:</p><p>Keep only nouns and adjectives? Boolean, de- faults to TRUE. Uses openNLP's implementation of the Apache OpenNLP Maxent POS tagger to perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Then, fol- lowing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004</ref></p><note type="other">), only nouns and adjectives are kept. Stopwords removal. Boolean, defaults to TRUE. Only actionable if no POS-based screen- ing is performed. Removes common English stop- words 2 from the SMART information retrieval system.</note><p>Stemming. Boolean, defaults to TRUE. Re- tains only the stem of each term by implement- ing Porter's stemmer with the R SnowballC pack- age <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bouchet-Valat, 2014</ref>). For instance, when stemming is performed, win and winning are both collapsed to win. Stemming thus tends to yield smaller and denser graphs.</p><p>The unique words that passed the aforelisted preprocessing steps are then used as the nodes of the graph-of-words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Graph-of-Words building</head><p>The graph-of-words is constructed by adding edges between the n nodes previously obtained. Complexity is O(nW ) where W is window size. The module offers the following tuning parame- ters:</p><p>Window size. Integer between 2 and 12, de- faults to 3. Specifies the size of the window slided over the document. Values around 3 and 4 have been reported to work well ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Malliaros and Skianis, 2015)</ref>. Note that the larger the window, the denser the graph, since more edges are created while the number of nodes remains constant.</p><p>Build on processed text? Boolean, defaults to TRUE. Whether the window should be slided over the (1) processed or the (2) unprocessed text. May yield very different results, depending on the pre- processing steps that have been applied. Indeed, two words that are initially very distant in the orig- inal, unprocessed text and whose co-occurence would therefore not be captured may end up close to each other in the processed text if many words between them (e.g., stopwords) were removed as a result of preprocessing. Consequently, build- ing the graph from the processed text tends to link more distant words and produce denser graphs than when using the unprocessed text.</p><p>Overspan sentences? Boolean, defaults to TRUE. If FALSE, an edge between two co- occurring words is only created (or if the edge al- ready exists, its weight is only incremented) if the two words belong to the same sentence. The punc- tuation marks ".", ";", "!", "?", and "..." are used here as sentence boundaries.</p><p>Color. List, defaults to heat. A set of five built-in R palettes to color the nodes of the graph, including the color-blind-friendly gray.colors. Node colors match their core (or truss) number (also indicated in a legend) and go darker as k in- creases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Graph-of-Words mining</head><p>This module analyzes the graph-of-words returned at the previous step using graph degeneracy and community detection. The user can tweak the fol- lowing parameters to customize the analysis:</p><p>Degeneracy. List, defaults to "weighted k- core". Choice of the graph decomposition method, among "k-core", "weighted k-core", and "k- truss". If "weighted k-core" is selected, the edge weights appear as edge labels in the plot.</p><p>Directed? Boolean, defaults to TRUE. Whether edge direction should be taken into account in computing node degree. Only actionable if a degree-based degeneracy algorithm has been se- lected (i.e., any but "k-truss"). When TRUE, edges in the plot feature arrows indicating their di- rection.</p><p>Mode. List, defaults to "all". Which of the in- cident edges of a node should be taken into ac- count in computing its degree, between "all" (all edges), "in" (incoming edges only), or "out" (out- going edges only). Only actionable if edge direc- tion is taken into account, and only impacts the output of the k-core algorithms. Note that the de- fault value "all" gives the same results as when edge direction is ignored, but generates a plot with arrow edges.</p><p>Community detection? List, defaults to "none".</p><p>Choice of the graph clustering algorithm, among "fast greedy", "louvain", "walktrap", "infomap", and "none". If not "none", each main community (see size threshold parameter below) is separately degenerated. If "walktrap", the user can select the length of the random walks between 2 and 8 (defaults to 4). If "infomap", the user can spec- ify whether edge direction should be taken into account. Clustering increases coverage for mul- titopic documents. Weighted? Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Whether edge weights should be used by the com- munity detection algorithm. Only actionable if the community detection parameter is not "none". If TRUE, the edge weights appear as edge labels in the plot.</p><p>Size threshold. Numeric (from 0.4 to 1.0, by 0.1), defaults to 0.8. Only actionable if the com- munity detection parameter is not "none". Per- centile size threshold used to determine which communities should be considered to be main ones. For instance, the default value of 0.8 retains as main communities the ones whose sizes (i.e., number of nodes) exceed that of 80% of all de- tected communities. As will be further illustrated in subsection 3.4, this parameter enables the user to chose whether the summary should cover only the major or also the subtle topics of the docu- ment. Nonetheless, diminishing size threshold in- creases the risk of including irrelevant (or noise) topics in the summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Text summarization</head><p>The fourth module uses the results from the previ- ous step (graph mining) to (1) extract keyphrases from and (2) select a subset of the original sen- tences in the document inputted by the user in an unsupervised manner. It is performed in paral- lel with the graph plotting module (see subsection 3.5).</p><p>1. Keyphrase extraction. The terms whose core (or truss) number is exactly equal to k max − p are used as seeds from which keyphrases (n- grams) are reconstructed. p is an integer parame- ter between 0 and 10 that lets the user navigate the core (or truss) hierarchy up and down. If p = 0 (the default), the main core is used. Whenever k max ≤ p, the user is informed that their selec- tion is empty. In practice, one would want to re- tain all the words whose core (or truss) number is at least equal to k max − p, that is, the members of the (k max − p)-core (or truss), and this is in- deed what we do for sentence selection (see "Sen- tence selection" paragraph below). Here though, we only use a single slice of the hierarchy (called a shell) to make it clear for the user how the pro- cess of keyword extraction and keyphrase recon- struction works.</p><p>Reconciliation is then performed by pasting to- gether the seeds that are found adjacent in the orig- inal, unprocessed text. For example, if "algebra" and "linear" both belong to the selected shell and "linear algebra" is present in the text, the two seeds are collapsed and added to the set of candidate keyphrases. Duplicates and keyphrases included in higher order keyphrases are then discarded.</p><p>When community detection is used, as already explained, each main community is separately de- generated. The entire process of keyterm extrac- tion and keyphrase reconstruction is then run for each main community, ensuring that keyphrases cover the main topics in the document.</p><p>Example. We created a two-topic 925-word document 3 by drawing and intertwining an equal number of sentences from two Wikipedia articles, one about the website Stack Overflow (SO) and one about pizza. With all default parameters, the keyphrases extracted are all about SO: stack over- flow, user, answer question... However, still with all default parameters, by simply enabling com- munity detection (e.g., with "fast greedy"), the two topics are detected (answer question, pizza margherita, queen margherita).</p><p>Related work. Similarly, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bougouin et al., 2013)</ref> have used clustering and graph mining for keyphrase extraction, but the other way around. They first group candidate keyphrases into topics via hierarchical clustering (with a word overlap distance), and then apply PageRank on a complete graph with topic nodes and edge weights based on keyphrase offset positions. Closer to our approach is that of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Grineva et al., 2009)</ref>. Like us, they also observe that terms tend to cluster based on topic and that the largest communities correspond to the main themes in the document. However, they use a complete graph where edges are weighted based on Wikipedia-based semantic relatedness. Addi- tionally, they select all the terms in the top-ranked communities whereas we extract only a highly co- hesive subgraph from each main group.</p><p>2. Sentence selection. Unlike for keyphrase extraction, the entire k max − p core (or truss) is used here as seedbed. Representative members are drawn from the list of sentences extracted from the original document (in subsection 3.1) follow- ing a three-step process: (1) sentences that do not contain any term belonging to the selected core (or truss) are pruned out, (2) the remaining sen- tences are ranked in decreasing order according to how many different central terms they feature, and finally, (3) sentences are selected one at a time from the top until a certain summary length has been reached. If two or more sentences have the same rank, the longest and least redundant is se- lected, where length is the number of words in the sentence and redundancy is computed in terms of word overlap with the current summary (stem- ming and stopword removal are performed based on user selection). The summary length tuning pa- rameter is a decimal number (between 0.01 and 0.51, by 0.05, defaults to 0.01) indicating the per- centage of total candidate sentences (from step 2 above) to include in the summary. Again, if com- munity detection is performed, the process is run separately for each community, enabling coverage of the main topics in the document. In the pre- vious example, using community detection gener- ates a 11:1 compression ratio summary covering both themes (not shown here due to space limita- tions).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion and next steps</head><p>We have presented GoWvis, a freely accessible web application providing an engaging illustra- tion of the GoW concept and how it can be ap- plied to unsupervised extractive single document summarization.
