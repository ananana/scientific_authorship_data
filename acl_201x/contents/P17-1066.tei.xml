				<p>How fake news goes viral via social me-dia? How does its propagation pattern differ from real stories? In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of identifying rumors, i.e., fake information, out of microblog posts based on their propagation structure. We firstly model mi-croblog posts diffusion with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and developed over time. We then propose a kernel-based method called Propagation Tree Kernel, which captures high-order patterns differentiating different types of rumors by evaluating the similarities between their propagation tree structures. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based approach can detect rumors more quickly and accurately than state-of-the-art rumor detection models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>On November 9th, 2016, Eric Tucker, a grass- roots user who had just about 40 followers on Twitter, tweeted his unverified observations about paid protesters being bused to attend anti-Trump demonstration in Austin, Texas. The tweet, which was proved false later, was shared over 16 thou- sand times on Twitter and 350 thousand times on Facebook within a couple of days, fueling a nation-wide conspiracy theory <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . The diffusion of the story is illustrated as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> which gives the key spreading points of the story along the time line. We can see that after the initial post, the tweet was shared or promoted by some influential online communities and users (including Trump himself), resulting in its wide spread.</p><p>A widely accepted definition of rumor is "un- verified and instrumentally relevant information statements in circulation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(DiFonzo and Bordia, 2007)</ref>. This unverified information may eventu- ally turn out to be true, or partly or entirely false. In today's ever-connected world, rumors can arise and spread at lightening speed thanks to social me- dia platforms, which could not only be wrong, but be misleading and dangerous to the public society. Therefore, it is crucial to track and debunk such rumors in timely manner.</p><p>Journalists and fact-checking websites such as snopes.com have made efforts to track and de- tect rumors. However, such endeavor is man- ual, thus prone to poor coverage and low speed. Feature-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Castillo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ma et al., 2015</ref>) achieved certain suc- cess by employing large feature sets crafted from message contents, user profiles and holistic statis- tics of diffusion patterns (e.g., number of retweets, propagation time, etc.). But such an approach was over simplified as they ignored the dynamics of rumor propagation. Existing studies considering propagation characteristics mainly focused on the temporal features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kwon et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kwon et al., , 2017</ref> rather than the structure of propagation.</p><p>So, can the propagation structure make any difference for differentiating rumors from non- rumors? Recent studies showed that rumor spread- ers are persons who want to get attention and pop- ularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sunstein, 2014)</ref>. However, popular users who get more attention on Twitter (e.g., with more followers) are actually less likely to spread rumor in a sense that the high audience size might hinder a user from participating in propagating unverified information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kwon et al., 2017)</ref>. Intuitively, for "successful" rumors being propagated as widely as popular real news, initial spreaders (typically lack of popularity) must attract certain amount of broadcasting power, e.g., attention of influential users or communities that have a lot of audiences joining in promoting the propagation. We refer to this as a constrained mode propagation, rela- tive to the open mode propagation of normal mes- sages that everyone is open to share. Such differ- ent modes of propagation may imply some distinct propagation structures between rumors and non- rumors and even among different types of rumors.</p><p>Due to the complex nature of information dif- fusion, explicitly defining discriminant features based on propagation structure is difficult and bi- ased. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> exemplifies the propagation struc- tures of two Twitter posts, a rumor and a non- rumor, initiated by two users shown as the root nodes (in green color). The information flows here illustrate that the rumorous tweet is first posted by a low-impact user, then some popular users joining in who boost the spreading, but the non-rumorous tweet is initially posted by a popular user and directly spread by many general users; content- based signal like various users' stance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhao et al., 2015)</ref> and edge-based signal such as relative influ- ence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kwon et al., 2017)</ref> can also suggest the dif- ferent nature of source tweets. Many of such im- plicit distinctions throughout message propagation are hard to hand craft specifically using flat sum- mary of statistics as previous work did. In addi- tion, unlike representation learning for plain text, learning for representation of structures such as networks is not well studied in general. Therefore, traditional and latest text-based models (Castillo To capture high-order propagation patterns for rumor detection, we firstly represent the propaga- tion of each source tweet with a propagation tree which is formed by harvesting user's interactions to one another triggered by the source tweet. Then, we propose a kernel-based data-driven method called Propagation Tree Kernel (PTK) to generate relevant features (i.e., subtrees) automatically for estimating the similarity between two propagation trees. Unlike traditional tree kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Moschitti, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhang et al., 2008</ref>) for modeling syntac- tic structure based on parse tree, our propagation tree consists of nodes corresponding to microblog posts, each represented as a continuous vector, and edges representing the direction of propagation and providing the context to individual posts. The basic idea is to find and capture the salient sub- structures in the propagation trees indicative of ru- mors. We also extend PTK into a context-enriched PTK (cPTK) to enhance the model by considering different propagation paths from source tweet to the roots of subtrees, which capture the context of transmission. Extensive experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art rumor detec- tion models with large margin.</p><p>Moreover, most existing approaches regard ru- mor detection as a binary classification problem, which predicts a candidate hypothesis as rumor or not. Since a rumor often begins as unverified and later turns out to be confirmed as true or false, or remains unverified ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zubiaga et al., 2016)</ref>, here we consider a set of more practical, finer-grained classes: false rumor, true rumor, unverified ru- mor, and non-rumor, which becomes an even more challenging problem.</p></div>

All such approaches are over simplistic because they ignore the dynamic prop- agation patterns given the rich structures of social media data.</p><p>Some studies focus on finding temporal pat- terns for understanding rumor diffusion. <ref type="bibr">Kown et al. (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">2017)</ref> introduced a time-series fitting model based on the temporal properties of tweet volume. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ma et al.

Here we focus on classifying a given source tweet regarding a claim which is a finer-grained task. Similar setting was also considered in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Qazvinian et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>Kernel methods are designed to evaluate the similarity between two objects, and tree kernel specifically addresses structured data which has been successfully applied for modeling syntac- tic information in many natural language tasks such as syntactic parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collins and Duffy, 2001</ref>), question-answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Moschitti, 2006</ref>), se- mantic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Moschitti, 2004)</ref>, relation extrac- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhang et al., 2008)</ref> and machine transla- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sun et al., 2010</ref>). These kernels are not suit- able for modeling the social media propagation structures because the nodes are not given as dis- crete values like part-of-speech tags, but are rep- resented as high dimensional real-valued vectors. Our proposed method is a substantial extension of tree kernel for modeling such structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Representation of Tweets Propagation</head><p>On microblogging platforms, the follower/friend relationship embeds shared interests among the users. Once a user has posted a tweet, all his fol- lowers will receive the tweet. Furthermore, Twit- ter allows a user to retweet or comment another user's post, so that the information could reach be- yond the network of the original creator.</p><p>We model the propagation of each source tweet as a tree structure T (r) = V, E, where r is the source tweet as well as the root of the tree, V refers to a set of nodes each representing a responsive post (i.e., retweet or reply) of a user at a certain time to the source tweet r which initiates the cir- culation, and E is a set of directed edges corre- sponding to the response relation among the nodes in V . If there exists a directed edge from v i to v j , it means v j is a direct response to v i .</p><p>More specifically, each node v ∈ V is repre- sented as a tuple v = (u v , c v , t v ), which provides the following information: u v is the creator of the post, c v represents the text content of the post, and t v is the time lag between the source tweet r and v. In our case, u v contains attributes of the user such as # of followers/friends, verification status, # of history posts, etc., c v is a vector of binary features based on uni-grams and/or bi-grams representing the post's content.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Background of Tree Kernel</head><p>Before presenting our proposed algorithm, we briefly present the traditional tree kernel, which our PTK model is based on.</p><p>Tree kernel was designed to compute the syn- tactic and semantic similarity between two natu- ral language sentences by implicitly counting the number of common subtrees between their corre- sponding parse trees. Given a syntactic parse tree, each node with its children is associated with a grammar production rule. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the syntactic parse tree of "cut a tree" and its sub- trees. A subtree is defined as any subgraph which has more than one nodes, with the restriction that entire (not partial) rule productions must be in- cluded. For example, the fragment [NP <ref type="bibr">[D a]</ref>] is excluded because it contains only part of the pro- duction NP → D N ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Collins and Duffy, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Collins and Duffy (2001)</ref>, given two parse trees T 1 and T 2 , the kernel function K(T 1 , T 2 ) is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v i ∈V 1 v j ∈V 2 ∆(v i , v j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where V 1 and V 2 are the sets of all nodes respec- tively in T 1 and T 2 , and each node is associated with a production rule, and ∆(v i , v j ) evaluates the common subtrees rooted at v i and v j . ∆(v i , v j ) can be computed using the following recursive procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collins and Duffy, 2001</ref>):</p><p>1) if the production rules at v i and v j are differ- ent, then ∆(v i , v j ) = 0;</p><p>2) else if the production rules at v i and v j are same, and v i and v j have only leaf children (i.e., they are pre-terminal symbols), then</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆(v i , v j ) = λ; 3) else ∆(v i , v j ) = λ min(nc(v i ),nc(v j )) k=1 (1 + ∆(ch(v i , k), ch(v j , k))).</formula><p>where nc(v) is the number of children of node v, ch(v, k) is the k-th child of node v, and λ (0 &lt; λ ≤ 1) is a decay factor. λ = 1 yields the number of common subtrees; λ &lt; 1 down weighs the contribution of larger subtrees to make the ker- nel value less variable with respect to subtree size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Our PTK Model</head><p>To classify propagation trees, we can calculate the similarity between the trees, which is supposed to reflect the distinction of different types of ru- mors and non-rumors based on structural, linguis- tic and temporal properties. However, existing tree kernels cannot be readily applied on propagation trees because 1) unlike parse tree where the node is represented by enumerable nominal value (e.g., part-of-speech tag), the propagation tree node is given as a vector of continuous numerical values representing the basic properties of the node; 2) the similarity of two parse trees is based on the count of common subtrees, for which the com- monality of subtrees is evaluated by checking if the same production rules and the same children are associated with the nodes in two subtrees being compared, whereas in our context the similarity function should be defined softly since hardly two nodes from different propagation trees are same.</p><p>With the representation of propagation tree, we first define a function f to evaluate the similarity between two nodes v i and v j (we simplify the node representation for instance v i = (u i , c i , t i )) as the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (v i , v j ) = e −t (αE(u i , u j ) + (1 − α)J (c i , c j ))</formula><p>where t = |t i − t j | is the absolute difference be- tween the time lags of v i and v j , E and J are user-based similarity and content-based similar- ity, respectively, and α is the trade-off parameter. The intuition of using exponential function of t to scale down the similarity is to capture the discrim- inant signals or patterns at the different stages of propagation. For example, a questioning message posted very early may signal a false rumor while the same posted far later from initial post may in- dicate the rumor is still unverified, despite that the two messages are semantically similar.</p><p>The</p><note type="other">user-based similarity is defined as an Eu- clidean distance E(u i , u j ) = ||u i − u j || 2 , where u i and u j are the user vectors of node v i and v j and || • || 2 is the 2-norm of a vector. Here E is used to capture the characteristics of users partici- pating in spreading rumors as discriminant signals, throughout the entire stage of propagation.</note><p>Contentwise, we use Jaccard coefficient to mea- sure the similarity of post content:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">J (c i , c j ) = |N gram(c i ) ∩ N gram(c j )| |N gram(c i ) ∪ N gram(c j )|</formula><p>where c i and c j are the sets of content words in two nodes. For n-grams here, we adopt both uni-grams and bi-grams. It can capture cue terms e.g., 'false', 'debunk', 'not true', etc. commonly occurring in rumors but not in non-rumors. Given two propagation trees T 1 = V 1 , E 1 and T 2 = V 2 , E 2 , PTK aims to compute the simi- larity between T 1 and T 2 iteratively based on enu- merating all pairs of most similar subtrees. First, for each node v i ∈ V 1 , we obtain v i ∈ V 2 , the most similar node of v i from V 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v i = arg max v j ∈V 2 f (v i , v j )</formula><p>Similarly, for each v j ∈ V 2 , we obtain v j ∈ V 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v j = arg max v i ∈V 1 f (v i , v j )</formula><p>Then, the propagation tree kernel K P (T 1 , T 2 ) is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v i ∈V 1 Λ(v i , v i ) + v j ∈V 2 Λ(v j , v j )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Λ(v, v ) evaluates the similarity of two sub- trees rooted at v and v , which is computed recur- sively as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1) if v or v are leaf nodes, then Λ(v, v ) = f (v, v ); 2) else Λ(v, v ) = f (v, v ) min(nc(v),nc(v )) k=1 (1 + Λ(ch(v, k), ch(v , k)))</formula><p>Note that unlike traditional tree kernel, in PTK the node similarity f ∈ [0, 1] is used for softly count- ing similar subtrees instead of common subtrees. Also, λ in tree kernel is not needed as subtree size is not an issue here thanks to node similarity f . PTK aims to capture discriminant patterns from propagation trees inclusive of user, content and temporal traits, which is inspired by prior analyses on rumors spreading, e.g., user information can be a strong clue in the initial broadcast, content fea- tures are important throughout entire propagation periods, and structural and temporal patterns help for longitudinal diffusion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zubiaga et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kwon et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Context-Sensitive Extension of PTK</head><p>One defect of PTK is that it ignores the clues out- side the subtrees, e.g., how the information propa- gates from source post to the current subtree. Intu- itively, propagation paths provide further clue for determining the truthfulness of information since they embed the route and context of how the prop- agation happens. Therefore, we propose context- sensitive PTK (cPTK) by considering the propa- gation paths from the root of the tree to the roots of subtrees, which shares similar intuition with the context-sensitive tree kernel ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhou et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>For a propagation tree node v ∈ T (r), let L r v be the length (i.e., # of nodes) of the propagation path from root r to v, and v <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref> be the x-th ancestor of v on the path starting from</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">v (0 ≤ x &lt; L r v , v[0] = v, v[L r v − 1] = r)</formula><p>. cPTK evaluates the similarity between two trees T 1 (r 1 ) and T 2 (r 2 ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">v i ∈V 1 L r 1 v i −1 x=0 Λ x (v i , v i ) + v j ∈V 2 L r 2 v j −1 x=0 Λ x (v j , v j )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where Λ x (v, v ) measures the similarity of sub- trees rooted at v <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref> and v <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref> for context-sensitive evaluation, which is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">1) if x &gt; 0, Λ x (v, v ) = f (v[x], v [x]), where</formula><p>v <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref> and v <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref> are the x-th ancestor nodes of v and v on the respective propagation path.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">2) else Λ x (v, v ) = Λ(v, v ), namely PTK.</formula><p>Clearly, PTK is a special case of cPTK when x = 0 (see equation 3). cPTK evaluates the oc-currence of both context-free (without consider- ing ancestors on propagation paths) and context- sensitive cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Rumor Detection via Kernel Learning</head><p>The advantage of kernel-based method is that we can avoid painstakingly engineering the features. This is possible because the kernel function can explore an implicit feature space when calculating the similarity between two objects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Culotta and Sorensen, 2004</ref>). We incorporate the proposed tree kernel func- tions, i.e., PTK (equation 2) or cPTK (equation 3), into a supervised learning framework, for which we utilize a kernel-based SVM classifier. We treat each tree as an instance, and its similarity values with all training instances as feature space. There- fore, the kernel matrix of training set is m × m and that of test set is n × m where m and n are the sizes of training and test sets, respectively.</p><p>For our multi-class task, we perform a one-vs- all classification for each label and then assign the one with the highest likelihood among the four, i.e., non-rumor, false rumor, true rumor or unver- ified rumor. We choose this method due to in- terpretability of results, similar to recent work on occupational class classification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lukasik et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

We held out 10% of the trees in each dataset for model tuning, and for the rest of the trees, we performed 3-fold cross-validation. We used accuracy, F 1 measure as evaluation metrics. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> shows that our proposed methods outper- form all the baselines on both datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Experimental Results</head><p>Among all baselines, GRU performs the best, which learns the low-dimensional representation of responsive tweets by capturing the textual and temporal information. This indicates the effec- tiveness of complex signals indicative of rumors beyond cue words or phrases (e.g., "what?", "re- ally?", "not sure", etc.). This also justifies the good performance of BOW even though it only uses uni-grams for representation. Although DTR uses a set of regular expressions, we found only 19.59% and 22.21% tweets in our datasets con- taining these expressions. That is why the results of DTR are not satisfactory.</p><p>SVM-TS and RFC are comparable because both of them utilize an extensive set of features especially focusing on temporal traits. But none of the models can directly incorporate structured propagation patterns for deep similarity compar-  ison between propagation trees. SVM-RBF, al- though using a non-linear kernel, is based on tra- ditional hand-crafted features instead of the struc- tural kernel like ours. So, they performed obvi- ously worse than our approach.</p><p>Representation learning methods like GRU cannot easily utilize complex structural informa- tion for learning important features from our net- worked data. In contrast, our models can cap- ture complex propagation patterns from structured data rich of linguistic, user and temporal signals. Therefore, the superiority of our models is clear: PTK-which only uses text is already better than GRU, demonstrating the importance of propaga- tion structures. PTK that combines text and user yields better results on both datasets, implying that both properties are complementary and PTK in- tegrating flat and structured information is obvi- ously more effective.</p><p>It is also observed that cPTK outperforms PTK except for non-rumor class. This suggests the context-sensitive modeling based on PTK is ef- fective for different types of rumors, but for non- The example subtree of a rumor captured by the algorithm at early stage of propagation rumors, it seems that considering context of prop- agation path is not always helpful. This might be due to the generally weak signals originated from node properties on the paths during non-rumor's diffusion since user distribution patterns in non- rumors do not seem as obvious as in rumors. This is not an issue in cPTK-since user information is not considered at all. Over all classes, cPTK achieves the highest accuracies on both datasets.</p><p>Furthermore, we observe that all the baseline methods perform much better on non-rumors than on rumors. This is because the features of exist- ing methods were defined for a binary (rumor vs. non-rumor) classification problem. So, they do not perform well for finer-grained classes. Our ap- proach can differentiate various classes much bet- ter by deep, detailed comparison of different pat- terns based on propagation structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Early Detection Performance</head><p>Detecting rumors at an early stage of propaga- tion is very important so that preventive measures could be taken as quickly as possible. In early de- tection task, all the posts after a detection deadline are invisible during test. The earlier the deadline, the less propagation information can be available. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the performances of our PTK and cPTK models versus RFC (the best system based on feature engineering), GRU (the best sys- tem based on RNN) and DTR (an early-detection-specific algorithm) against various deadlines. In the first few hours, our approach demonstrates superior early detection performance than other models. Particularly, cPTK achieve 75% accu- racy on Twitter15 and 73% on Twitter16 within 24 hours, that is much faster than other models.</p><p>Our analysis shows that rumors typically demonstrate more complex propagation substruc- tures especially at early stage. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows a detected subtree of a false rumor spread in its first few hours, where influential users are some- how captured to boost its propagation and the in- formation flows among the users with an obvious unpopular-to-popular-to-unpopular trend in terms of user popularity, but such pattern was not wit- nessed in non-rumors in early stage. Many textual signals (underlined) can also be observed in that early period. Our method can learn such structures and patterns naturally, but it is difficult to know and hand-craft them in feature engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We propose a novel approach for detecting ru- mors in microblog posts based on kernel learn- ing method using propagation trees. A propa- gation tree encodes the spread of a hypothesis (i.e., a source tweet) with complex structured pat- terns and flat information regarding content, user and time associated with the tree nodes. En- lightened by tree kernel techniques, our kernel method learns discriminant clues for identifying rumors of finer-grained levels by directly mea- suring the similarity among propagation trees via kernel functions. Experiments on two Twitter datasets show that our approach outperforms state- of-the-art baselines with large margin for both general and early rumor detection tasks.</p><p>Since kernel-based approach covers more struc- tural information than feature-based methods, it allows kernel to further incorporate information from a high dimensional space for possibly better discrimination. In the future, we will focus on im- proving the rumor detection task by exploring net- work representation learning framework. More- over, we plan to investigate unsupervised mod- els considering massive unlabeled rumorous data from social media.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An illustration of how the rumor about "buses used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas" becomes viral, where '*' indicates the level of influence.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,127.33,62.81,340.15,172.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
