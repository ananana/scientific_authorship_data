				<p>While recent years have seen a surge of interest in automated essay grading, including work on grading essays with respect to particular dimensions such as prompt adherence, coherence, and technical quality , there has been relatively little work on grading the essay dimension of argument strength, which is arguably the most important aspect of argumentative essays. We introduce a new corpus of argumentative student essays annotated with argument strength scores and propose a supervised , feature-rich approach to automatically scoring the essays along this dimension. Our approach significantly outperforms a baseline that relies solely on heuristically applied sentence argument function labels by up to 16.1%.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Automated essay scoring, the task of employing computer technology to evaluate and score writ- ten text, is one of the most important educational applications of natural language processing (NLP) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Shermis and Burstein (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shermis et al. (2010)</ref> for an overview of the state of the art in this task). A major weakness of many ex- isting scoring engines such as the Intelligent Es- say Assessor TM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Landauer et al., 2003</ref>) is that they adopt a holistic scoring scheme, which summa- rizes the quality of an essay with a single score and thus provides very limited feedback to the writer. In particular, it is not clear which dimension of an essay (e.g., style, coherence, relevance) a score should be attributed to. Recent work addresses this problem by scoring a particular dimension of es- say quality such as coherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004</ref>), technical errors, relevance to prompt <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Higgins et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Persing and Ng, 2014)</ref>, or- ganization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Persing et al., 2010)</ref>, and thesis clarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Persing and Ng, 2013)</ref>. Essay grading software that provides feedback along multiple dimensions of essay quality such as E-rater/Criterion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Attali and Burstein, 2006</ref>) has also begun to emerge.</p><p>Our goal in this paper is to develop a com- putational model for scoring the essay dimension of argument strength, which is arguably the most important aspect of argumentative essays. Argu- ment strength refers to the strength of the argu- ment an essay makes for its thesis. An essay with a high argument strength score presents a strong argument for its thesis and would convince most readers. While there has been work on design- ing argument schemes (e.g., , <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Song et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Stab and Gurevych (2014a)</ref>) for annotating arguments manually (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Song et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Stab and Gurevych (2014b)</ref>) and auto- matically (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Falakmasir et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Song et al. (2014)</ref>) in student essays, little work has been done on scoring the argument strength of student essays. It is worth mentioning that some work has investigated the use of automatically determined argument labels for heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ong et al., 2014</ref>) and learning-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Song et al., 2014</ref>) essay scor- ing, but their focus is holistic essay scoring, not argument strength essay scoring.</p><p>In sum, our contributions in this paper are two- fold. First, we develop a scoring model for the ar- gument strength dimension on student essays us- ing a feature-rich approach. Second, in order to stimulate further research on this task, we make our data set consisting of argument strength anno- tations of 1000 essays publicly available. Since progress in argument strength modeling is hin- dered in part by the lack of a publicly annotated corpus, we believe that our data set will be a valu- able resource to the NLP community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Corpus Information</head><p>We use as our corpus the 4.5 million word Interna- tional Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) (Granger Topic Languages Essays Most university degrees are the- oretical and do not prepare stu- dents for the real world. They are therefore of very little value.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">80</head><p>In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote "All men are equal but some are more equal than others." How true is this today? 10 64 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Some examples of writing topics.</p><p>et al., 2009), which consists of more than 6000 essays on a variety of different topics written by university undergraduates from 16 countries and 16 native languages who are learners of English as a Foreign Language. 91% of the ICLE texts are written in response to prompts that trigger ar- gumentative essays. We select 10 such prompts, and from the subset of argumentative essays writ- ten in response to them, we select 1000 essays to annotate for training and testing of our essay ar- gument strength scoring system. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows three of the 10 topics selected for annotation. Fif- teen native languages are represented in the set of annotated essays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Corpus Annotation</head><p>We ask human annotators to score each of the 1000 argumentative essays along the argument strength dimension. Our annotators were selected from over 30 applicants who were familiarized with the scoring rubric and given sample essays to score. The six who were most consistent with the expected scores were given additional essays to annotate. Annotators evaluated the argument strength of each essay using a numerical score from one to four at half-point increments (see <ref type="table">Ta- ble 2</ref> for a description of each score). 1 This con- trasts with previous work on essay scoring, where the corpus is annotated with a binary decision (i.e., good or bad) for a given scoring dimension (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Higgins et al. (2004)</ref>). Hence, our annota- tion scheme not only provides a finer-grained dis- tinction of argument strength (which can be im- portant in practice), but also makes the prediction task more challenging.</p><p>Score <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Description of Argument Strength  4  essay makes a strong argument for its thesis  and would convince most readers  3  essay makes a decent argument for its thesis  and could convince some readers  2</ref> essay makes a weak argument for its thesis or sometimes even argues against it 1 essay does not make an argument or it is often unclear what the argument is <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Descriptions of the meaning of scores.</p><p>To ensure consistency in annotation, we ran- domly select 846 essays to have graded by mul- tiple annotators. Though annotators exactly agree on the argument strength score of an essay only 26% of the time, the scores they apply fall within 0.5 points in 67% of essays and within 1.0 point in 89% of essays. For the sake of our experiments, whenever the two annotators disagree on an es- say's argument strength score, we assign the es- say the average the two scores rounded down to the nearest half point. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref> shows the number of essays that receive each of the seven scores for argument strength.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Score Prediction</head><p>We cast the task of predicting an essay's argument strength score as a regression problem. Using re- gression captures the fact that some pairs of scores are more similar than others (e.g., an essay with an argument strength score of 2.5 is more similar to an essay with a score of 3.0 than it is to one with a score of 1.0). A classification system, by contrast, may sometimes believe that the scores 1.0 and 4.0 are most likely for a particular essay, even though these scores are at opposite ends of the score range. In the rest of this section, we de- scribe how we train and apply our regressor.</p><p>Training the regressor. Each essay in the train- ing set is represented as an instance whose label is the essay's gold score (one of the values shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref>), with a set of baseline features (Sec- tion 5) and up to seven other feature types we pro- pose (Section 6). After creating training instances, we train a linear regressor with regularization pa- rameter c for scoring test essays using the linear SVM regressor implemented in the LIBSVM soft- ware package <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chang and Lin, 2001</ref>). All SVM- specific learning parameters are set to their default values except c, which we tune to maximize per- formance on held-out validation data. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Applying the regressor. After training the re- gressor, we use it to score the test set essays. Test instances are created in the same way as the train- ing instances. The regressor may assign an essay any score in the range of 1.0−4.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Baseline Systems</head><p>In this section, we describe two baseline systems for predicting essays' argument strength scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Baseline 1: Most Frequent Baseline</head><p>Since there is no existing system specifically for scoring argument strength, we begin by designing a simple baseline. When examining the score dis- tribution shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref>, we notice that, while there exist at least a few essays having each of the seven possible scores, the essays are most densely clustered around scores 2.5 and 3.0. A system that always predicts one of these two scores will very frequently be right. For this reason, we develop a most frequent baseline. Given a training set, Baseline 1 counts the number of essays assigned to each of the seven scores. From these counts, it determines which score is most frequent and as- signs this most frequent score to each test essay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Baseline 2: Learning-based Ong et al.</head><p>Our second baseline is a learning-based version of <ref type="bibr">Ong et al.'s (2014)</ref> system. Recall from the intro- duction that Ong et al. presented a rule-based ap- proach to predict the holistic score of an argumen- tative essay. Their approach was composed of two steps. First, they constructed eight heuristic rules for automatically labeling each of the sentences in their corpus with exactly one of the following argument labels: OPPOSES, SUPPORTS, CITA- TION, CLAIM, HYPOTHESIS, CURRENT STUDY, or NONE. After that, they employed these sen- tence labels to construct five heuristic rules to holistically score a student essay. We create Baseline 2 as follows, employing the methods described in Section 4 for training, pa- rameter tuning, and testing. We employ Ong et al.'s method to tag each sentence of our essays with an argument label, but modify their method to accommodate differences between their and our corpus. In particular, our more informal corpus # Rule 1 Sentences that begin with a comparison dis- course connective or contain any string prefixes from "conflict" or "oppose" are tagged OP- POSES.</p><p>2 Sentences that begin with a contingency con- nective are tagged SUPPORTS. 3 Sentences containing any string prefixes from "suggest", "evidence", "shows", "Essentially", or "indicate" are tagged CLAIM. 4 Sentences in the first, second, or last paragraph that contain string prefixes from "hypothes", or "predict", but do not contain string prefixes from "conflict" or "oppose" are tagged HY- POTHESIS.</p><p>5 Sentences containing the word "should" that contain no contingency connectives or string prefixes from "conflict" or "oppose" are also tagged HYPOTHESIS. 6 If the previous sentence was tagged hypothesis and this sentence begins with an expansion con- nective, it is also tagged HYPOTHESIS. 7 Do not apply a label to this sentence. does not contain CURRENT STUDY or CITATION sentences, so we removed portions of rules that attempt to identify these labels (e.g. portions of rules that search for a four-digit number, as would appear as the year in a citation). Our resulting rule set is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref>. If more than one of these rules applies to a sentence, we tag it with the label from the earliest rule that applies.</p><p>After labeling all the sentences in our corpus, we then convert three of their five heuristic scor- ing rules into features for training a regressor. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The resulting three features describe (1) whether an essay contains at least one sentence labeled HY- POTHESIS, (2) whether it contains at least one sen- tence labeled OPPOSES, and (3) the sum of CLAIM sentences and SUPPORTS sentences divided by the number of paragraphs in the essay. If the value of the last feature exceeds 1, we instead assign it a value of 1. These features make sense because, for example, we would expect essays containing lots of SUPPORTS sentences to offer stronger ar- guments.</p><p>grading. The reason is that any list of word n-gram features automatically compiled from a given set of training essays would be contaminated with prompt-specific n-grams that may make the result- ing regressor generalize less well to essays written for new prompts.</p><p>To generalize our feature set in a way that does not risk introducing prompt-dependent features, we introduce POS n-gram features. Specifically, we construct one feature from each sequence of 1−5 part-of-speech tags appearing in our corpus. In order to obtain one of these features' values for a particular essay, we automatically label each es- say with POS tags using the Stanford CoreNLP system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Manning et al., 2014</ref>), then count the number of times the POS tag sequence occurs in the essay. An example of a useful feature of this type is "CC NN ,", as it is able to capture when a student writes either "for instance," or "for ex- ample,". We normalize each essay's set of POS n-gram features to unit length.</p><p>2. Semantic Frames (SFR) While POS n-grams provide syntactic generalizations of word n-grams, FrameNet-style semantic role labels provide se- mantic generalizations. For each essay in our data set, we employ SEMAFOR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Das et al., 2010</ref>) to identify each semantic frame occurring in the es- say as well as each frame element that participates in it. For example, a semantic frame may describe an event that occurs in a sentence, and the event's frame elements may be the people or objects that participate in the event. For a more concrete exam- ple, consider the sentence "I said that I do not be- lieve that it is a good idea". This sentence contains a Statement frame because a statement is made in it. One of the frame elements participating in the frame is the Speaker "I". From this frame, we would extract a feature pairing the frame to- gether with its frame element to get the feature "Statement-Speaker-I". We would expect this fea- ture to be useful for argument strength scoring be- cause we noticed that essays that focus excessively on the writer's personal opinions and experiences tended to receive lower argument strength scores.</p><p>As with POS n-grams, we normalize each es- say's set of Semantic Frame features to unit length.</p><p>3. Transitional Phrases (TRP) We hypothesize that a more cohesive essay, being easier for a reader to follow, is more persuasive, and thus makes a stronger argument. For this reason, it would be worthwhile to introduce features that measure how cohesive an essay is. Consequently, we create features based on the 149 transitional phrases compiled by Study Guides and Strate- gies <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Study Guides and Strategies collected these transitions into lists of phrases that are useful for different tasks (e.g. a list of transitional phrases for restating points such as "in essence" or "in short"). There are 14 such lists, which we use to general- ize transitional features. Particularly, we construct a feature for each of the 14 phrase type lists. For each essay, we assign the feature a value indicat- ing the average number of transitions from the list that occur in the essay per sentence. Despite be- ing phrase-based, transitional phrases features are designed to capture only prompt-independent in- formation, which as previously mentioned is im- portant in essay grading. 4. Coreference (COR) As mentioned in our dis- cussion of transitional phrases, a strong argument must be cohesive so that the reader can under- stand what is being argued. While the transi- tional phrases already capture one aspect of this, they cannot capture when transitions are made via repeated mentions of the same entities in differ- ent sentences. We therefore introduce a set of 19 coreference features that capture information such as the fraction of an essay's sentences that mention entities introduced in the prompt, and the average number of total mentions per sentence. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Calculat- ing these feature values, of course, requires that the text be annotated with coreference informa- tion. We automatically coreference-annotate the essays using the Stanford CoreNLP system. 5. Prompt Agreement (PRA) An essay's prompt is always either a single statement, or can be split up into multiple statements with which a writer may AGREE STRONGLY, AGREE SOME- WHAT, be NEUTRAL, DISAGREE SOMEWHAT, DISAGREE STRONGLY, NOT ADDRESS, or ex- plicitly have NO OPINION on. We believe in- formation regarding which of these categories a writer's opinion falls into has some bearing on the strength of her argument because, for example, a writer who explicitly mentions having no opinion has probably not made a persuasive argument.</p><p>For this reason, we annotate a subset of 830 of our ICLE essays with these agreement labels. We then train a multiclass maximum entropy classifier using MALLET <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(McCallum, 2002</ref>) for identifying which one of these seven categories an author's opinion falls into. The feature set we use for this task includes POS n-gram and semantic frame fea- tures as described earlier in this section, lemma- tized word 1-3 grams, the keyword and prompt ad- herence keyword features we described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Persing and Ng (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Persing and Ng (2014)</ref>, respec- tively, and a feature indicating which statement in the prompt we are attempting to classify the au- thor's agreement level with respect to.</p><p>Our classifier's training set in this case is the subset of prompt agreement annotated essays that fall within the training set of our 1000 essay ar- gument strength annotated data. We then apply the trained classifier to our entire 1000 essay set in order to obtain predictions from which we can then construct features for argument strength scor- ing. For each prediction, we construct a feature indicating which of the seven classes the classifier believes is most likely, as well as seven additional features indicating the probability the classifier as- sociates with each of the seven classes.</p><p>We produce additional related annotations on this 830 essay set in cases when the annotated opinion was neither AGREE STRONGLY nor DIS- AGREE STRONGLY, as the reason the annotator chose one of the remaining five classes may some- times offer insight into the writer's argument. The classes of reasons we annotate include cases when the writer: (1) offered CONFLICTING OPINIONS, (2) EXPLICITLY STATED an agreement level, (3) gave only a PARTIAL RESPONSE to the prompt, (4) argued a SUBTLER POINT not capturable by extreme opinions, (5) did not make it clear that the WRITER'S POSITION matched the one she ar- gued, (6) only BRIEFLY DISCUSSED the topic, (7) CONFUSINGLY PHRASED her argument, or (8) wrote something whose RELEVANCE to the topic was not clear. We believe that knowing which rea- son(s) apply to an argument may be useful for ar- gument strength scoring because, for example, the CONFLICTING OPINIONS class indicates that the author wrote a confused argument, which proba- bly deserves a lower argument strength score.</p><p>We train eight binary maximum entropy classi- fiers, one for each of these reasons, using the same training data and feature set we use for agreement level prediction. We then use the trained classi- fiers to make predictions for these eight reasons on all 1000 essays. Finally, we generate features for our argument strength regressor from these predic- tions by constructing two features from each of the eight reasons. The first binary feature is turned on whenever the maximum entropy classifier believes that the reason applies (i.e., when it assigns the reason a probability of over 0.5). The second fea- ture's value is the probability the classifier assigns for this reason.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Argument Component Predictions (ACP)</head><p>Many of our features thus far do not result from an attempt to build a deep understanding of the structure of the arguments within our essays. To introduce such an understanding into our system, we follow Stab and Gurevych (2014a), who col- lected and annotated a corpus of 90 persuasive es- says (not from the ICLE corpus) with the under- standing that the arguments contained therein con- sist of three types of argument components. In one essay, these argument components typically include a MAJOR CLAIM, several lesser CLAIMs which usually support or attack the major claim, and PREMISEs which usually underpin the valid- ity of a claim or major claim.</p><p>Stab and Gurevych (2014b) trained a system to identify these three types of argument components within their corpus given the components' bound- aries. Since our corpus does not contain annotated argument components, we modify their approach in order to simultaneously identify argument com- ponents and their boundaries.</p><p>We begin by implementing a maximum entropy version of their system using MALLET for per- forming the argument component identification task. We feed our system the same structural and lexical features they described. We then augment the system in the following ways.</p><p>First, since our corpus is not annotated with ar- gument component boundaries, we construct a set of low precision, high recall heuristics for iden- tifying the locations in each sentence where an argument component's boundaries might occur. The majority of these rules depend primarily on a syntactic parse tree we automatically generated for the sentence using the Stanford CoreNLP sys- tem. Since a large majority of annotated argument components are substrings of a simple declarative clause (an S node in the parse tree), we begin by identifying each S node in the sentence's tree.</p><p>Given one of these clauses, we collect a list of left and right boundaries where an argument com- ponent may begin or end. The rules we used to (a) Potential left boundary locations # Rule 1 Exactly where the S node begins. 2 After an initial explicit connective, or if the connec- tive is immediately followed by a comma, after the comma. 3 After nth comma that is an immediate child of the S node. 4 After nth comma.</p><p>(b) Potential right boundary locations # Rule 5 Exactly where the S node ends, or if S ends in a punctuation, immediately before the punctuation. 6 If the S node ends in a (possibly nested) SBAR node, immediately before the nth shallowest SBAR. 6 7 If the S node ends in a (possibly nested) PP node, immediately before the nth shallowest PP. find these boundaries are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>Given an S node, we use our rules to construct up to l × r argument component candidate in- stances to feed into our system by combining each left boundary with each right boundary that oc- curs after it, where l is the number of potential left boundaries our rules found, and r is the number of right boundaries they found.</p><p>The second way we augment the system is by adding a boundary rule feature type. Whenever we generate an argument component candidate in- stance, we augment its normal feature set with two binary features indicating which heuristic rule was used to find the candidate's left boundary, and which rule was used to find its right boundary. If two rules can be used to find the same left or right boundary position, the first rule listed in the table is the one used to create the boundary rule feature. This is why, for example, the table contains mul- tiple rules that can find boundaries at comma lo- cations. We would expect some types of commas (e.g., ones following an explicit connective) to be more significant than others.</p><p>A last point that requires additional explanation is that several of the rules contain the word "nth". This means that, for example, if a sentence con- tains multiple commas, we will generate multiple left boundary positions for it using rule 4, and the left boundary rule feature associated with each po- sition will be different (e.g., there is a unique fea- <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The S node may end in an SBAR node which itself has an SBAR node as its last child, and so on. In this case, the S node could be said to end with any of these "nested" SBARS, so we use the position before each (nth) one as a right boundary. ture for the first comma, and for the the second comma, etc.).</p><p>The last augmentation we make to the system is that we apply a NONE label to all argument component candidates whose boundaries do not exactly match those of a gold standard argument component. While Stab and Gurevych also did this, their list of such argument component candi- dates consisted solely of sentences containing no argument components at all. We could not do this, however, since our corpus is not annotated with ar- gument components and we therefore do not know which sentences these would be.</p><p>We train our system on all the instances we gen- erated from the 90 essay corpus and apply it to la- bel all the instances we generated in the same way from our 1000 essay ICLE corpus. As a result, we end up with a set of automatically generated ar- gument component annotations on our 1000 essay corpus. We use these annotations to generate five additional features for our argument strength scor- ing SVM regressor. These features' values are the number of major claims in the essay, the number of claims in the essay, the number of premises in the essay, the fraction of paragraphs that contain either a claim or a major claim, and the fraction of paragraphs that contain at least one argument component of any kind.</p><p>7. Argument Errors (ARE) We manually iden- tified three common problems essays might have that tend to result in weaker arguments, and thus lower argument strength scores. We heuristically construct three features, one for each of these problems, to indicate to the learner when we be- lieve an essay has one of these problems.</p><p>It is difficult to make a reasonably strong argu- ment in an essay that is too short. For this reason, we construct a feature that encodes whether the es- say has 15 or fewer sentences, as only about 7% of our essays are this short.</p><p>In the Stab and Gurevych corpus, only about 5% of paragraphs have no claims or major claims in them. We believe that an essay that contains too many of these claim or major claim-less para- graphs may have an argument that is badly struc- tured, as it is typical for a paragraph to contain one or two (major) claim(s). For this reason, we construct a feature that encodes whether more than half of the essay's paragraphs contain no claims or major claims, as indicated by the previously gen- erated automatic annotations.</p><p>Similarly, only 5% of the Stab and Gurevych es- says contain no argument components at all. We believe that an essay that contains too many of these component-less paragraphs is likely to have taken too much space discussing issues that are not relevant to the main argument of the essay. For this reason, we construct a feature that encodes whether more than one of the essay's paragraphs contain no components, as indicated by the previ- ously generated automatic annotations.</p></div>

In each experiment, we use 60% of our la- beled essays for model training, another 20% for parameter tuning and feature selection, and the fi- nal 20% for testing. These correspond to the train- ing set, held-out validation data, and test set men- tioned in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Scoring Metrics</head><p>We employ four evaluation metrics. As we will see below, S1, S2, and S3 are error metrics, so lower scores on them imply better performance. In contrast, P C is a correlation metric, so higher correlation implies better performance.</p><p>The simplest metric, S1, measures the fre- quency at which a system predicts the wrong score out of the seven possible scores. Hence, a system that predicts the right score only 25% of the time would receive an S1 score of 0.75.</p><p>The S2 metric measures the average distance between a system's predicted score and the actual score. This metric reflects the idea that a system that predicts scores close to the annotator-assigned scores should be preferred over a system whose predictions are further off, even if both systems estimate the correct score at the same frequency.</p><p>The S3 metric measures the average square of the distance between a system's score predictions and the annotator-assigned scores. The intuition behind this metric is that not only should we prefer a system whose predictions are close to the anno- tator scores, but we should also prefer one whose predictions are not too frequently very far away from the annotated scores. The three error metric scores are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 N A j =E ′ j 1, 1 N N j=1 |A j − E j |, 1 N N j=1 (A j − E j ) 2 System S1 S2 S3 P C Baseline 1</formula><p>.668 .428 .321 .000 Baseline 2</p><p>.652 .418 .267 .061 Our System .618 .392 .244 .212 <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Five-fold cross-validation results for ar- gument strength scoring.</p><p>where A j , E j , and E ′ j are the annotator assigned, system predicted, and rounded system predicted scores 7 respectively for essay j, and N is the num- ber of essays.</p><p>The last metric, P C, computes Pearson's cor- relation coefficient between a system's predicted scores and the annotator-assigned scores. P C ranges from −1 to 1. A positive (negative) P C implies that the two sets of predictions are posi- tively (negatively) correlated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Results and Discussion</head><p>Five-fold cross-validation results on argument strength score prediction are shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. The first two rows show our baseline systems' per- formances. The best baseline system (Baseline 2), which recall is a learning-based version of <ref type="bibr">Ong et al.'s (2014)</ref> system, predicts the wrong score 65.2% of the time. Its predictions are off by an average of .418 points, the average squared error of its predictions is .267, and its average Pear- son correlation coefficient with the gold argument strength score across the five folds is .061. Results of our system are shown on the third row of <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. Rather than using all of the available features (i.e., Baseline 2's features and the novel features described in Section 6), our system uses only the feature subset selected by the backward elimination feature selection algo- rithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blum and Langley, 1997</ref>) that achieves the best performance on the validation data (see Sec- tion 7.3 for details). As we can see, our system predicts the wrong score only 61.8% of the time, predicts scores that are off by an average of .392 points, the average squared error of its predictions is .244, and its average Pearson correlation coeffi- cient with the gold scores is .212. These numbers correspond to relative error reductions 8 of 5.2%, 6.2%, 8.6%, and 16.1% over Baseline 2 for S1, S2, S3, and PC, respectively, the last three of which are significant improvements 9 . The magnitudes of these improvements suggest that, while our system yields improvements over the best baseline by all four measures, its greatest contribution is that its predicted scores are best-correlated with the gold standard argument strength scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Feature Ablation</head><p>To gain insight into how much impact each of the feature types has on our system, we perform fea- ture ablation experiments in which we remove the feature types from our system one-by-one.</p><p>We show the results of the ablation experiments on the held-out validation data as measured by the four scoring metrics in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. The top line of each subtable shows what a system that uses all available features's score would be if we removed just one of the feature types. So to see how our system performs by the P C metric if we remove only prompt agreement (PRA) features, we would look at the first row of results of <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>(d) under the column headed by PRA. The number here tells us that the resulting system's P C score is .303. Since our system that uses all feature types obtains S1, S2, S3, and P C scores of .521, .366, .218, and .341 on the validation data respectively, the removal of PRA features costs the complete sys- tem .038 P C points, and thus we can infer that the inclusion of PRA features has a beneficial effect.</p><p>From row 1 of <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>(a), we can see that re- moving the Baseline 2 feature set (BAS) yields a system with the best S1 score in the presence of the remaining feature types in this row. For this reason, we permanently remove the BAS features from the system before we generate the results on line 2. We iteratively remove the feature type that yields a system with the best performance in this way until we get to the last line, where only one feature type is used to generate each result.</p><p>Since the feature type whose removal yields the best system is always the rightmost entry in a line, the order of column headings indicates the rela- tive importance of the feature types, with the left- most feature types being most important to per- formance and the rightmost feature types being least important in the presence of the other feature types. The score corresponding to the best system is boldfaced for emphasis, indicating that all fea-(a) Results using the S1 metric SFR ACP TRP PRA POS COR ARE BAS . <ref type="bibr">534 .594 .530 .524 .522 .532 .529 .521 .530 .554 .526 .529 .526 .528 .525 .534 .555 .525 .531 .528 .522 .543 .558 .536 .530 .527 .565 .561 .536 .529 .563 .547 .539 .592 .550</ref> (b) Results using the S2 metric POS PRA ACP TRP BAS SFR COR ARE . <ref type="bibr">370 .369 .375 .367 .367 .366 .366 .365 .369 .369 .375 .366 .366 .365 .365 .370 .371 .372 .367 .366 .365 .374 .374 .376 .368 .366 .377 .375 .374 .368 .381 .377</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Feature ablation results. In each subtable, the first row shows how our system would perform on the vali- dation set essays if each feature type was removed. We then remove the least important feature type, and show in the next row how the adjusted system would perform without each re- maining type.</p><p>ture types appearing to its left are included in the best system. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> It is interesting to note that while the relative importance of different feature types does not re- main exactly the same if we measure performance in different ways, we can see that some feature types tend to be more important than others in a majority of the four scoring metrics.</p><p>From these tables, it is clear that POS n-grams  <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>: Distribution of regressor scores for our system.</p><p>(POS), prompt agreement features (PRA), and ar- gument component predictions (ACP) are the most generally important feature types in roughly that order. They all appear in the leftmost three po- sitions under the tables for metrics S2, S3, and P C, the three metrics by which our system sig- nificantly outperforms Baseline 2. Furthermore, removing any of them tends to have a larger neg- ative impact on our system than removing any of the other feature types. Transitional phrase features (TRP) and Base- line 2 features (BAS), by contrast, are of more middling importance. While both appear in the best feature sets for the aforementioned metrics (i.e., they appear to the left of the boldfaced entry in the corresponding ablation tables), the impact of their removal is relatively less than that of POS, PRA, or ACP features.</p><p>Finally, while the remaining three feature types might at first glance seem unimportant to argu- ment strength scoring, it is useful to note that they all appear in the best performing feature set as measured by at least one of the four scoring metrics. Indeed, semantic frame features (SFR) appear to be the most important feature type as measured by the S1 metric, despite being one of the least useful feature types as measured by the other performance metrics. From this we learn that when designing an argument strength scoring system, it is important to understand what the ulti- mate goal is, as the choice of performance metric can have a large impact on what type of system will seem ideal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Analysis of Predicted Scores</head><p>To more closely examine the behavior of our sys- tem, in <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> we chart the distributions of scores it predicts for essays having each gold standard score. As an example of how to read this table, consider the number 2.60 appearing in row 2.0 in the .25 column of the S3 region. This means that 25% of the time, when our system with param- eters tuned for optimizing S3 (including the S3 feature set as selected in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>(c)) is presented with a test essay having a gold standard score of 2.0, it predicts that the essay has a score less than or equal to 2.60.</p><p>From this table, we see that our system has a bias toward predicting more frequent scores as the smallest entry in the table is 2.36 and the largest entry is 3.19, and as we saw in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref>, 71.4% of essays have gold scores in this range. Neverthe- less, our system does not rely entirely on bias, as evidenced by the fact that each column in the table has a tendency for its scores to ascend as the gold standard score increases, implying that our system has some success at predicting lower scores for es- says with lower gold standard argument strength scores and higher scores for essays with higher gold standard argument strength scores. The ma- jor exception to this rule is line 1.0, but this is to be expected since there are only two essays hav- ing this gold score, so the sample from which the numbers on this line are calculated is very small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a feature-rich approach to the new problem of predicting argument strength scores on student essays. In an evaluation on 1000 argumen- tative essays selected from the ICLE corpus, our system significantly outperformed a baseline sys- tem that relies solely on features built from heuris- tically labeled sentence argument function labels by up to 16.1%. To stimulate further research on this task, we make all of our annotations publicly available.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>Table 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Distribution of argument strength scores.</figDesc><table></table></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> For parameter tuning, we employ the following c values: 10 0 10 1 , 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 5 , or 10 6 .</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> Our Approach Our approach augments the feature set available to Baseline 2 with seven types of novel features. 1. POS N-grams (POS) Word n-grams, though commonly used as features for training text classifiers, are typically not used in automated essay 3 We do not apply the remaining two of their heuristic scoring rules because they deal solely with current studies and citations.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> http://www.studygs.net/wrtstr6.htm 5 See our website at http://www.hlt.utdallas. edu/ ˜ persingq/ICLE/ for a complete list of coreference features.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> We round all predictions to 1.0 or 4.0 if they fall outside the 1.0−4.0 range and round S1 predictions to the nearest half point. 8 These numbers are calculated B−O B−P where B is the baseline system&apos;s score, O is our system&apos;s score, and P is a perfect score. Perfect scores for error measures and P C are 0 and 1 respectively.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="9"> All significance tests are paired t-tests with p &lt; 0.05.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="10"> The reason the performances shown in these tables appear so much better than those shown previously is that in these tables we tune parameters and display results on the validation set in order to make it clearer why we chose to remove each feature type. In Table 6, by contrast, we tune parameters on the validation set, but display results using those parameters on the test set.</note>
