				<p>Spoken dialogue systems (SDS) are rapidly appearing in various smart devices (smartphone, smart-TV, in-car navigating system, etc). The key role in a successful SDS is a spoken language understanding (SLU) component, which parses user utterances into semantic concepts in order to understand users&apos; intentions. However, such semantic concepts and their structure are manually created by experts, and the annotation process results in extremely high cost and poor scalability in system development. Therefore, the dissertation focuses on improving SDS generalization and scalability by automatically inferring domain knowledge and learning structures from unlabeled conversations through a matrix factorization (MF) technique. With the automatically acquired semantic concepts and structures, we further investigate whether such information can be utilized to effectively understand user utterances and then show the feasibility of reducing human effort during SDS development.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Various smart devices (e.g. smartphone, smart- TV, in-car navigating system) are incorporating spoken language interfaces, a.k.a. spoken dia- logue systems (SDS), in order to help users finish tasks more efficiently. The key role in a successful SDS is a spoken language understanding (SLU) component; in order to capture the language vari- ation from dialogue participants, the SLU compo- nent must create a mapping between the natural language inputs and semantic representations that correspond to users' intentions.</p><p>The semantic representation must include "con- cepts' and a "structure": concepts are the domain- specific topics, and the structure describes the re- lations between concepts and conveys intentions. However, most prior work focused on learning the mapping between utterances and semantic rep- resentations, where such knowledge still remains predefined. The need of annotations results in extremely high cost and poor scalability in sys- tem development. Therefore, current technology usually limits conversational interactions to a few narrow predefined domains/topics. With the in- creasing conversational interactions, this disserta- tion focuses on improving generalization and scal- ability of building SDSs with little human effort.</p><p>In order to achieve the goal, two questions need to be addressed: 1) Given unlabelled conversa- tions, how can a system automatically induce and organize the domain-specific concepts? 2) With the automatically acquired knowledge, how can a system understand user utterances and intents? To tackle the above problems, we propose to acquire the domain knowledge that captures human's se- mantics, intents, and behaviors. Then based on the acquired knowledge, we build an SLU component to understand users and to offer better interactions in dialogues.</p><p>The dissertation shows the feasibility of build- ing a dialogue learning system that is able to un- derstand how particular domains work based on unlabeled conversations. As a result, an initial SDS can be automatically built according to the learned knowledge, and its performance can be quickly improved by interacting with users for practical usage, presenting the potential of reduc- ing human effort for SDS development.  Our MF method completes a partially-missing matrix for semantic decoding/behavior prediction. Dark circles are observed facts, shaded circles are inferred facts. The ontology induction maps observed feature patterns to semantic concepts. The feature rela- tion model constructs correlations between observed feature patterns. The concept relation model learns the high-level semantic correlations for inferring hidden semantic slots or predicting subsequent behav- iors. Reasoning with matrix factorization incorporates these models jointly, and produces a coherent and domain-specific SLU model. the intent detection problem in SLU, showing that results obtained from the unsupervised training process align well with the performance of tradi- tional supervised learning. Following their suc- cess of unsupervised SLU, recent studies have also obtained interesting results on the tasks of rela- tion detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hakkani-TÃ¼r et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2014a</ref>), entity extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wang et al., 2014)</ref>, and extending domain coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(El-Kahky et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen and Rudnicky, 2014)</ref>. However, most studies above do not explicitly learn latent factor representations from the data-while we hypothe- size that the better robustness can be achieved by explicitly modeling the measurement errors (usu- ally produced by automatic speech recognizers (ASR)) using latent variable models and taking ad- ditional local and global semantic constraints into account. Latent Variable Modeling in SLU Early stud- ies on latent variable modeling in speech included the classic hidden Markov model for statistical speech recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jelinek, 1997)</ref>. Recently,  were the first to study the intent detection problem using query logs and a discrete Bayesian latent variable model. In the field of dialogue modeling, the partially observ- able Markov decision process (POMDP) ( <ref type="bibr">Young et al., 2013</ref>) model is a popular technique for di- alogue management, reducing the cost of hand- crafted dialogue managers while producing ro- bustness against speech recognition errors. More recently,  used a semi-supervised LDA model to show improvement on the slot fill- ing task. Also, <ref type="bibr">Zhai and Williams (2014)</ref> proposed an unsupervised model for connecting words with latent states in HMMs using topic models, obtain- ing interesting qualitative and quantitative results. However, for unsupervised SLU, it is not obvi- ous how to incorporate additional information in the HMMs. With increasing works about learn-ing the feature matrices for language representa- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, matrix factorization (MF) has become very popular for both implicit and explicit feedback ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rendle et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 2015a)</ref>.</p><p>This thesis proposal is the first to propose a framework about unsupervised SLU modeling, which is able to simultaneously consider various local and global knowledge automatically learned from unlabelled data using a matrix factorization (MF) technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Proposed Work</head><p>The proposed framework is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a), where there are two main parts, one is knowledge acquisition and another is SLU modeling by MF. The first part is to acquire the domain knowledge that is useful for building the domain-specific dia- logue systems, which addresses the question about how to induce and organize the semantic concepts (the first problem). Here we propose ontology in- duction and structure learning procedures. The on- tology induction refers to the semantic concept in- duction (yellow block) and the structure learning refers to relation models (blue and pink blocks) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a). The details are described in Section 4. The second part is to self-train an SLU compo- nent using the acquired knowledge for the domain- specific SDS, and this part answers to the ques- tion about how to utilize the obtained information in SDSs to understand user utterances and intents. There are two aspects regarding to SLU modeling, semantic decoding and behavior prediction. The semantic decoding is to parse the input utterances into semantic forms for better understanding, and the behavior prediction is to predict the subsequent user behaviors for providing better system interac- tions. This dissertation plans to apply MF tech- niques to unsupervised SLU modeling, including both semantic decoding and behavior prediction.</p><p>In the proposed model, we first build a fea- ture matrix to represent training utterances, where each row refers to an utterance and each column refers to an observed feature pattern or a learned semantic concept (either a slot or a behavior).   terance implies the meaning facet food. The MF approach is able to learn the latent feature vec- tors for utterances and semantic concepts, infer- ring implicit semantics to improve the decoding process-namely, by filling the matrix with prob- abilities (lower part of the matrix in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(b)</ref>).</p><p>The feature model is built on the observed fea- ture patterns and the learned concepts, where the concepts are obtained from the knowledge acqui- sition process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2015b</ref>). Section 5.1 explains the detail of the feature model. In order to consider the addi- tional structure information, we propose a rela- tion propagation model based on the learned struc- ture, which includes a feature relation model (blue block) and a concept relation model (pink block) described in Section 5.2.</p><p>Finally we train an SLU model by learn- ing latent feature vectors for utterances and slots/behaviors through MF techniques. Combin- ing with a relation propagation model, the trained SLU model is able to estimate the probability that each concept occurs in the testing utterance, and how likely each concept is domain-specific simul- taneously. In other words, the SLU model is able to transform testing utterances into domain- specific semantic representations or predicted be- haviors without human involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Knowledge Acquisition</head><p>Given unlabeled conversations and available knowledge resources, we plan to extract organized knowledge that can be used for domain-specific SDSs. The ontology induction and structure learn- ing are proposed to automate an ontology building process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Ontology Induction</head><p>Chen et al. <ref type="bibr">(2013; 2014b)</ref> proposed to automat- ically induce semantic slots for SDSs by frame- semantic parsing, where all ASR-decoded utter-  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows an ex- ample of an ASR-decoded text output parsed by SEMAFOR. There are three frames (capability, expensiveness, and locale by use) in the utter- ance, which we consider as slot candidates.</p><p>Since SEMAFOR was trained on FrameNet annotation, which has a more generic frame- semantic context, not all the frames from the pars- ing results can be used as the actual slots in the domain-specific dialogue systems. For instance, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, "expensiveness" and "locale by use" frames are essentially the key slots for the pur- pose of understanding in the restaurant query do- main, whereas the "capability" frame does not convey particularly valuable information for the domain-specific SDS. In order to fix this is- sue, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2014b)</ref> proved that integrating continuous-valued word embeddings with a prob- abilistic frame-semantic parser is able to identify key semantic slots in an unsupervised fashion, re- ducing the cost of designing task-oriented SDSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Structure Learning</head><p>A key challenge of designing a coherent seman- tic ontology for SLU is to consider the struc- ture and relations between semantic concepts. In practice, however, it is difficult for domain ex- perts and professional annotators to define a co- herent slot set, while considering various lexical, syntactic, and semantic dependencies. The pre- vious work exploited the typed syntactic depen- dency theory for unsupervised induction and or- ganization of semantic slots in SDSs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2015b</ref>). More specifically, two knowledge graphs, a slot-based semantic knowledge graph and a word-based lexical knowledge graph, are au- tomatically constructed. To jointly consider the word-to-word, word-to-slot, and slot-to-slot rela- tions, we use a random walk inference algorithm to combine these two knowledge graphs, guided by dependency grammars. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> is a simpli- fied example of the automatically built semantic knowledge graph corresponding to the restaurant domain. The experiments showed that considering inter-slot relations is crucial for generating a more coherent and compete slot set, resulting in a better SLU model, while enhancing the interpretability of semantic slots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SLU Modeling by Matrix Factorization</head><p>For two aspects of SLU modeling: semantic de- coding and behavior prediction, we plan to apply MF to both tasks by treating learned concepts as semantic slots and human behaviors respectively.</p><p>Considering the benefits brought by MF tech- niques, including 1) modeling the noisy data, 2) modeling hidden information, and 3) modeling the dependency between observations, the disser- tation applies an MF approach to SLU modeling for SDSs. In our model, we use U to denote the set of input utterances, F as the set of observed feature patterns, and S as the set of semantic con- cepts we would like to predict (slots or human be- haviors). The pair of an utterance u â U and a feature/concept x â {F +S}, u, x, is a fact. The input to our model is a set of observed facts O, and the observed facts for a given utterance is denoted by {{u, x â O}. The goal of our model is to es- timate, for a given utterance u and a given feature pattern/concept x, the probability, p(M u,x = 1), where M u,x is a binary random variable that is true if and only if x is the feature pattern/domain- specific concept in the utterance u. We introduce a series of exponential family models that estimate the probability using a natural parameter Î¸ u,x and the logistic sigmoid function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(M u,x = 1 | Î¸ u,x ) = Ï(Î¸ u,x )<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">= 1 1 + exp (âÎ¸ u,x )</formula><p>.</p><p>We construct a matrix M |U |Ã(|F |+|S|) as observed facts for MF by integrating a feature model and a relation propagation model below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Feature Model</head><p>First, we build a binary feature pattern matrix F f based on the observations, where each row refers to an utterance and each column refers to a feature pattern (a word or a phrase). In other words, F f carries the basic word/phrase vector for each utter- ance, which is illustrated as the left part of the ma- trix in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(b)</ref>. Then we build a binary matrix F s based on the induced semantic concepts from Section 4.1, which also denotes the slot/behavior features for all utterances (right part of the matrix in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(b)</ref>).</p><p>For building the feature model M F , we concate- nate two matrices and obtain M F = [ F f F s ], which refers to the upper part of the matrix in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1(b)</ref> for training utterances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Relation Propagation Model</head><p>It is shown that the structure of semantic concepts helps decide domain-specific slots and further im- proves the SLU performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2015b</ref>). With the learned structure from Section 4.2, we can model the relations between semantic con- cepts, such as inter-slot and inter-behavior rela- tions. Also, the relations between feature patterns can be modeled in the similar way. We construct two knowledge graphs to model the structure:</p><p>â¢ Feature knowledge graph is built as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G f = V f , E f f , where V f = {f i â F } and E f f = {e ij | f i , f j â V f }.</formula><p>â¢ Semantic concept knowledge graph is built as G s = V s , E ss , where V s = {s i â S} and E ss = {e ij | s i , s j â V s }.</p><p>The structured graph can model the relation between the connected node pair (x i , x j ) as r(x i , x j ). Here we compute two matrices R s = [r(s i , s j )] |S|Ã|S| and R f = [r(f i , f j )] |F |Ã|F | to represent concept relations and feature relations respectively. With the built relation models, we combine them as a relation propagation matrix M R 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M R = R f 0 0 R s . (2)</formula><p>The goal of this matrix is to propagate scores be- tween nodes according to different types of rela- tions in the constructed knowledge graphs (Chen and Metze, 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Integrated Model</head><p>With a feature model M F and a relation propaga- tion model M R , we integrate them into a single matrix.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M = M F Â· (M R + I) (3) = F f R f + F f 0 0 F s R s + F s ,</formula><p>where M is final matrix and I is the identity ma- trix in order to remain the original values. The matrix M is similar to M F , but some weights are enhanced through the relation propagation model. The feature relations are built by F f R f , which is the matrix with internal weight propagation on the feature knowledge graph (the blue arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1(b)</ref>). Similarly, F s R s models the semantic concept correlations, and can be treated as the ma- trix with internal weight propagation on the se- mantic concept knowledge graph (the pink arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(b)</ref>). The propagation model can be treated as running a random walk algorithm on the graphs. By integrating with the relation propagation model, the relations can be propagated via the knowledge graphs, and the hidden information may be modeled based on the assumption that mu- tual relations usually help inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2015b)</ref>. Hence, the structure information can be automatically involved in the matrix. In conclu- sion, for each utterance, the integrated model not only predicts the probabilities that semantic con- cepts occur but also considers whether they are domain-specific.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Model Learning</head><p>The proposed model is parameterized through weights and latent component vectors, where the parameters are estimated by maximizing the log likelihood of observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Collins et al., 2001</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Î¸ * = arg max Î¸ uâU p(Î¸ | M u ) (4) = arg max Î¸ uâU p(M u | Î¸)p(Î¸) = arg max Î¸ uâU ln p(M u | Î¸) â Î» Î¸ ,</formula><p>where M u is the vector corresponding to the utter- ance u from M u,x in (1), because we assume that each utterance is independent of others.</p><p>To avoid treating unobserved facts as designed negative facts, we consider our positive-only data as implicit feedback. Bayesian Personalized Rank- ing (BPR) is an optimization criterion that learns from implicit feedback for MF, which uses a vari- ant of the ranking: giving observed true facts higher scores than unobserved (true or false) facts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rendle et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Riedel et al. (2013)</ref> also showed that BPR learns the implicit relations and improves a relation extraction task.</p><p>To estimate the parameters in (4), we create a dataset of ranked pairs from M in (3): for each utterance u and each observed fact f + = u, x + , where M u,x â¥ Î´, we choose each semantic con- cept x â such that f â = u, x â , where M u,x &lt; Î´, which refers to the semantic concept we have not observed in utterance u. That is, we con- struct the observed data O from M . Then for each pair of facts f + and f â , we want to model p(f + ) &gt; p(f â ) and hence Î¸ f + &gt; Î¸ f â accord- ing to (1). BPR maximizes the summation of each ranked pair, where the objective is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">uâU ln p(M u | Î¸) = f + âO f â âO ln Ï(Î¸ f + â Î¸ f â ). (5)</formula><p>The BPR objective is an approximation to the per utterance AUC (area under the ROC curve), which directly correlates to what we want to achieve -well-ranked semantic concepts per ut- terance, which denotes the better estimation of se- mantic slots or human behaviors.</p><p>To maximize the objective in (5), we employ a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rendle et al., 2009</ref>). For each randomly sampled ob- served fact u, x + , we sample an unobserved fact u, x â , which results in |O| fact pairs f â , f + . For each pair, we perform an SGD update using the gradient of the corresponding objective func- tion for matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gantner et al., 2011</ref>).</p></div>
