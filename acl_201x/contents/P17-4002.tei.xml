			<abstract>
				<p>We present RobotReviewer, an open-source web-based system that uses machine learning and NLP to semi-automate biomedical evidence synthesis, to aid the practice of Evidence-Based Medicine. RobotReviewer processes full-text journal articles (PDFs) describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It appraises the reliability of RCTs and extracts text describing key trial characteristics (e.g., descriptions of the population) using novel NLP methods. RobotReviewer then automatically generates a report synthesising this information. Our goal is for RobotRe-viewer to automatically extract and syn-thesise the full-range of structured data needed to inform evidence-based practice.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Motivation</head><p>Decisions regarding patient healthcare should be informed by all available evidence; this is the phi- losophy underpinning Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sackett, 1997)</ref>. But realizing this aim is difficult, in part because clinical trial results are primarily disseminated as free-text journal ar- ticles. Moreover, the biomedical literature base is growing exponentially ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bastian et al., 2010)</ref>. It is now impossible for a practicing clinician to keep up to date by reading primary research arti- cles, even in a narrow specialty <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Moss and Marcus, 2017)</ref>. Thus healthcare decisions today are often made without full consideration of the existing ev- idence.</p><p>Systematic reviews (SRs) are an important tool for enabling the practice of EBM despite this data deluge. SRs are reports that exhaustively identify and synthesise all published evidence pertinent to a specific clinical question. SRs include an as- sessment of research biases, and often a statistical  meta-analysis of trial results. SRs inform all lev- els of healthcare, from national policies and guide- lines to bedside decisions. But the expanding pri- mary research base has made producing and main- taining SRs increasingly onerous ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bastian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wallace et al., 2013)</ref>. Identifying, extract- ing, and combining evidence from free-text arti- cles describing RCTs is difficult, time-consuming, and laborious. One estimate suggests that a sin- gle SR requires thousands of person hours (Allen and Olkin, 1999); and a recent analysis suggests it takes an average of nearly 70 weeks to publish a review ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borah et al., 2017)</ref>. This incurs huge fi- nancial cost, particularly because reviews are per- formed by highly-trained persons. To keep SRs current with the literature then we must develop new methods to expedite evidence synthesis. Specifically, we need tools that can help identify, extract, assess and summarize evidence relevant to specific clinical questions from free- text articles describing RCTs. Toward this end, this paper describes RobotReviewer (RR; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  1</ref>), an open-source system that automates aspects of the data-extraction and synthesis steps of a sys- tematic review using novel NLP models. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview of RobotReviewer (RR)</head><p>RR is a web-based tool which processes journal ar- ticle PDFs (uploaded by end-users) describing the conduct and results of related RCTs to be synthe- sised. Using several machine learning (ML) data- extraction models, RR generates a report summa- rizing key information from the RCTs, including, e.g., details concerning trial participants, interven- tions, and reliability. Our ultimate goal is to au- tomate the extraction of the full range of variables necessary to perform evidence synthesis. We list the current functionality of RR and future extrac- tion targets in <ref type="table">Table 1.</ref> RR comprises several novel ML/NLP compo- nents that target different sub-tasks in the evidence synthesis process, which we describe briefly in the following section. RR provides access to these models both via a web-based prototype graphi- cal interface and a REST API service. The lat- ter provides a mechanism for integrating our mod- els with existing software platforms that process biomedical texts generally and that facilitate re- views specifically (e.g., Covidence 2 ). We provide a schematic of the system architecture in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. We have released the entire system as open source via the GPL v 3.0 license. A live demonstration version with examples, a video, and the source code is available at our project website. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tasks and Models</head><p>We now briefly describe the tasks RR currently au- tomates and the ML/NLP models that we have de- veloped and integrated into RR to achieve this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Risks of Bias (RoB)</head><p>Critically appraising the conduct of RCTs (from the text of their reports) is a key step in evidence synthesis. If a trial does not rigorously adhere to a well-designed protocol, there is a risk that the re- sults exhibit bias. Appraising such risks has been formalized into the Cochrane 4 Risk of Bias (RoB) tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Higgins et al., 2011</ref>). This defines several 'domains' with respect to which the risk of bias is to be assessed, e.g., whether trial participants were adequately blinded.</p><p>EBM aims to make evidence synthesis transpar- ent. Therefore, it is imperative to provide sup- port for one's otherwise somewhat subjective ap- praisals of risks of bias. In practice, this entails extracting quotes from articles supporting judge- ments, i.e. rationales ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zaidan et al., 2007</ref>). An automated system needs to do the same. We have therefore developed models that jointly (1) cat- egorize articles as describing RCTs at 'low' or 'high/unknown' risk of bias across domains, and, (2) extract rationales supporting these categoriza- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhang et al., 2016</ref>).</p><p>We have developed two model variants for au- tomatic RoB assessment. The first is a multi- task (across domains) linear model ( ). The model induces sentence rankings (w.r.t. to how likely they are to support assessment for a given domain) which directly inform the overall RoB prediction through 'interaction' fea- tures (interaction of n-gram features with whether identified as rationale [yes/no]).</p><p>To assess the quality of extracted sentences, we conducted a blinded evaluation by expert sys- tematic reviewers, in which they assessed the quality of manually and automatically extracted sentences. Sentences extracted using our model were scored comparably to those extracted by hu- man reviewers . However, the accuracy of the overall classification of arti- cles as describing high/unclear or low risk RCTs achieved by our model remained 5-10 points lower than that achieved in published (human authored) SRs (estimated using articles that had been inde- pendently assessed in multiple SRs).</p><p>We have recently improved overall document classification performance using a novel variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) adapted for text classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang and Wallace, 2015)</ref>. Our model, the 'rationale-augmented CNN' (RA-CNN), explicitly identifies and up- weights sentences likely to be rationales. RA- CNN induces a document vector by taking a weighted sum over sentence vectors (output from a sentence-level CNN), where weights are set to reflect the predicted probability of sentences being rationales. The composite document vector is fed through a softmax layer for overall article classifi- cation. This model achieved gains of 1-2% abso-  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Schematic of RR document processing. A set of PDFs are uploaded, processed and run through models; the output from these are used to construct a summary report. RR incorporates these linear and neural strate- gies using a simple ensembling strategy. For bias classification, we average the predicted probabili- ties of RCTs being at low risk of bias from the lin- ear and neural models. To extract corresponding rationales, we induce rankings over all sentences in a given document using both models, and then aggregate these via Borda count (de Borda, 1784).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">PICO</head><p>The Population, Interventions/Comparators and Outcomes (PICO) together define the clinical question addressed by a trial. Characterising and representing these is therefore an important aim for automating evidence synthesis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Extracting PICO sentences</head><p>Past work has investigated identifying PICO ele- ments in biomedical texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boudin et al., 2010)</ref>. But these efforts have largely considered only article abstracts, lim- iting their utility: not all clinically salient data is always available in abstracts. One exception to this is a system called ExaCT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kiritchenko et al., 2010)</ref>, which does operate on full-texts, although  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Typical variables required for an evidence synthesis (Centre for <ref type="bibr">Reviews and Dissemination, 2009)</ref>, and current RR functionality. Text: extracted text snippets describing the variable (e.g. 'The randomization schedule was produced using a statistical computer package'). Structured: translation to e.g., standard bias scores or medical ontology concepts.</p><p>assumes HTML/XML inputs, rather than PDFs. ExaCT was hindered by the modest amount of available training data (∼160 annotated articles).</p><p>Scarcity of training data is an important prob- lem in this domain. We have thus taken a distant supervision (DS) approach to train PICO sentence extraction models, deriving a corpus of tens of thousands of 'pseudo-annotated' full-text PDFs. DS is a training regime in which noisy labels are induced from existing structured resources via rules ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mintz et al., 2009</ref>). Here, we exploited a training corpus derived from an existing database of SRs using a novel training paradigm: super- vised distant supervision ( .</p><p>Briefly, the idea is to replace the heuristics usu- ally used in DS to derive labels from the avail- able structured resource with a functioñ f ˜ θ that maps from instances˜Xinstances˜ instances˜X and DS derived labels˜Ylabels˜ labels˜Y to higher precision labels</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y; ˜ f ˜ θ ( ˜ X , ˜ Y) → Y.</formula><p>Cru- cially, the˜Xthe˜ the˜X representations include features de- rived from the available DS; such features will thus not be available for test instances. Parameters˜θ Parameters˜ Parameters˜θ are to be estimated using a small amount of di- rect supervision. Once a higher precision label set Y is induced viã f ˜ θ , we can train a model as usual, training the final classifier f θ using (X , Y). Fur- ther, we can incorporate the predicted probability distribution over true labels Y estimated by˜f˜θby˜ by˜fby˜f˜ by˜f˜θ di- rectly in the loss function used to train f θ . This approach results in improved model performance, at least for our case of PICO sentence extraction from full-text articles ( .</p><p>Text describing PICO elements is identified in RR using this strategy; the results are displayed both as tables and as annotations on individual ar- ticles (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3 and 4, respectively)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">PICO embeddings</head><p>We have begun to explore learning dense, low- dimensional embeddings of biomedical abstracts specific to each PICO dimension. In contrast to monolithic document embedding approaches, such as doc2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Le and Mikolov, 2014</ref>), PICO embeddings are an example of disentangled rep- resentations.</p><p>Briefly, we have developed a neural approach which assumes access to manually generated free- text aspect summaries (here, one per PICO ele- ment) with corresponding documents (abstracts). The objective is to induce vector representations (via an encoder model) of abstracts and aspect summaries that satisfy two desiderata. (1) The em- bedding for a given abstract/aspect should be close to its matched aspect summary; (2) but far from the embeddings of aspect summaries for other ab- stracts, specifically those which differ with respect to the aspect in question.</p><p>To train this model, we used data recorded for previously conducted SRs to train our em- bedding model.</p><p>Specifically we collected 30,000+ abstract/aspect summary pairs stored in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). We have demonstrated that the induced aspect representations improve performance an in- formation retrieval task for EBM: ranking RCTs relevant to a given systematic review. 5</p><p>Figure 5: PICO embeddings. Here, a mouse-over event has occurred on the point corresponding to Humiston et al. in the intervention embedding space, triggering the display of the three uni-/bi- grams that most excited the encoder model.</p><p>For RR, we incorporate these models to induce abstract representations and then project these down to two dimensions using a PCA model pre- trained on the CDSR. We then present a visual- isation of study positions in this reduced space, thus revealing relative similarities and allowing one, e.g., to spot apparently outlying RCTs. To facilitate interpretation, we display the uni and bi- grams most activated for each study by filters in the learned encoder model on mouse-over. <ref type="figure">Figure  5</ref> shows such an example. We are actively work- ing to refine our approach to further improve the interpretability of these embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Study design</head><p>RCTs are regarded as the gold standard for pro- viding evidence on of the effectiveness of health interventions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chalmers et al., 1993</ref>) Yet these ar- ticles form a small minority of the available medi- cal literature. We employ an ensemble classifier, combining multiple CNN models, Support Vec- tor Machines (SVMs), and which takes account of meta-data obtained from PubMed. Our evaluation on an independent dataset has found this approach <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Under review: preprint available at http: //www.byronwallace.com/static/articles/ PICO-vectors-preprint.pdf. achieves very high accuracy (area under the Re- cevier Operating Characteristics curve = 0.987), outperforming previous ML approaches and man- ually created boolean filters. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>We have presented RobotReviewer, an open- source tool that uses state-of-the-art ML and NLP to semi-automate biomedical evidence synthesis. RR incorporates the underlying trained models with a prototype web-based user interface, and a REST API that may be used to access the mod- els. We aim to continue adding functionality to RR, automating the extraction and synthesis of additional fields: particularly structured PICO data, outcome statistics, and trial participant flow. These additional data points would (if extracted with sufficient accuracy) provide the information required for statistical synthesis.</p><p>For example, for assessing bias, RR is competi- tive with, but modestly inferior to the accuracy of a conventional manually produced systematic re- view ( ) We therefore recom- mended that RR be used as a time-saving tool for manual data extraction, or that one of two humans in the conventional data-extraction process be re- placed by the automated process.</p><p>However, there is an increasing need for meth- ods that trade a small amount of accuracy for in- creased speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tricco et al., 2015</ref>). The oppor- tunity cost of maintaining current rigor in SRs is vast: reviews do not exist for most clinical ques- tions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Smith, 2013)</ref>, and most reviews are out of date soon after publication ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shojania et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>RR used in a fully automatic workflow (without manual checks) might improve upon relying on the source articles alone, particularly given those in clinical practice are unlikely to have time to read the full texts.
