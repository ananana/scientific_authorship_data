				<p>Through a particular choice of a predicate (e.g., &quot;x violated y&quot;), a writer can subtly connote a range of implied sentiment and presupposed facts about the entities x and y: (1) writer&apos;s perspective: projecting x as an &quot;antagonist&quot; and y as a &quot;victim&quot;, (2) entities&apos; perspective: y probably dislikes x, (3) effect: something bad happened to y, (4) value: y is something valuable, and (5) mental state: y is distressed by the event. We introduce connotation frames as a representation formalism to organize these rich dimensions of connotation using typed relations. First, we investigate the feasibility of obtaining connotative labels through crowdsourcing experiments. We then present models for predicting the connotation frames of verb predicates based on their distributional word representations and the interplay between different types of connotative relations. Empirical results confirm that connotation frames can be induced from various data sources that reflect how language is used in context. We conclude with analytical results that show the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in online news media.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>People commonly express their opinions through subtle and nuanced language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Thomas et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010)</ref>. Often, through seemingly objective statements, the writer can in- fluence the readers' judgments toward an event and their participants. Even by choosing a particular predicate, the writer can indicate rich connotative information about the entities that interact through the predicate. More specifically, through a simple   statement such as "x violated y", the writer can convey:</p><p>(1) writer's perspective: the writer is projecting x as an "antagonist" and y as a "victim", elic- iting negative perspective from readers toward x (i.e., blaming x) and positive perspective to- ward y (i.e., sympathetic or supportive toward y). (2) entities' perspective: y most likely feels neg- atively toward x as a result of being violated. (3) effect: something bad happened to y. (4) value: y is something valuable, since it does not make sense to violate something worthless. In other words, the writer is presupposing a positive value of y as a fact. (5) mental state: y is most likely unhappy about the outcome. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>

In this paper, we present an empirical study of how to represent and induce the connotative interpretations that can be drawn from a verb predicate, as illustrated above.</p><p>We introduce connotation frames as a represen- tation framework to organize the rich dimensions of the implied sentiment and presupposed facts. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of a connotation frame for the predicate violate. We define four different typed relations: P(x → y) for perspective of x towards y, E(x) for effect on x, V(x) for value of x, and S(x) for mental state of x. These relation- ships can all be either positive (+), neutral (=), or negative (-).</p><p>Our work is the first study to investigate frames as a representation formalism for connotative meanings. This contrasts with previous com- putational studies and resource development for frame semantics, where the primary focus was al- most exclusively on denotational meanings of lan- guage ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). Our formalism draws inspirations from the earlier work of frame semantics, however, in that we investi- gate the connection between a word and the related world knowledge associated with the word <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fillmore, 1976)</ref>, which is essential for the readers to interpret many layers of the implied sentiment and presupposed value judgments.</p><p>We also build upon the extensive amount of lit- erature in sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pang and Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu and Zhang, 2012)</ref>, especially the recent emerg- ing efforts on implied sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feng et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Greene and Resnik, 2009)</ref>, entity- entity sentiment inference ), assuming it is an entity that can have a mental state. opinion role induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wiegand and Ruppenhofer, 2015)</ref> and effect analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Choi and Wiebe, 2014)</ref>. However, our work is the first to organize various aspects of the connotative information into coher- ent frames.</p><p>More concretely, our contributions are threefold: (1) a new formalism, model, and annotated dataset for studying connotation frames from large-scale natural language data and statistics, (2) new data- driven insights into the dynamics among different typed relations within each frame, and (3) an ana- lytic study showing the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in journalism.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in §2, we provide the definitions and data-driven in- sights for connotation frames. In §3, we introduce models for inducing the connotation frames, fol- lowed by empirical results, annotation studies, and analysis on news media in §4. We discuss related work in §5 and conclude in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Connotation Frame</head><p>Given a predicate v, we define a connotation frame F(v) as a collection of typed relations and their po- larity assignments: (i) perspective P v (a i → a j ): a directed sentiment from the entity a i to the entity a j , (ii) value V v (a i ): whether a i is presupposed to be valuable, (iii) effect E v (a i ): whether the event denoted by the predicate v is good or bad for the entity a i , and (iv) mental state S v (a i ): the likely mental state of the entity a i as a result of the event. We assume that each typed relation can have one of the three connotative polarities ∈ {+, −, =}, i.e., positive, negative, or neutral. Our goal in this paper is to focus on the general connotation of the predi- cate considered out of context. We leave contextual interpretation of connotation as future work.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Media Bias in Connotation Frames: Obama, for example, is portrayed as someone who attacks or criticizes others by the right-leaning sources, whereas the left-leaning sources portray Obama as the victim of harsh acts like "attack" and "criticize".</p><p>relations for the verbs suffer, guard, and uphold, along with example sentences. For instance, for the verb suffer, the writer is likely to have a positive perspective towards the agent (e.g., being support- ive or sympathetic toward the "17-year-old girl" in the example shown on the right) and a negative perspective towards the theme (e.g., being negative towards 'botched abortion").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data-driven Motivation</head><p>Since the meaning of language is ultimately contex- tual, the exact connotation will vary depending on the context of each utterance. Nonetheless, there still are common shifts or biases in the connota- tive polarities, as we found from two data-driven analyses. First, we looked at words from the Subjectivity Lexicon ( ) that are used in the argument positions of a small selection of predi- cates in Google Syntactic N-grams <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Goldberg and Orwant, 2013)</ref>. For this analysis, we assumed that the word in the subject position is the agent while the object is the theme. We found 64% of the words in the agent position of suffer are positive, and 94% of the words in the theme position are negative, which is consistent with the polarities of the writer's perspective towards these arguments, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. For guard, 57% of the sub- jects and 76% of the objects are positive, and in the case of uphold, 56% of the subjects and 72% of the objects are positive.</p><p>We also investigated how media bias can po- tentially be analyzed through connotation frames. From the Stream Corpus 2014 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(KBA, 2014)</ref>, we selected all articles from news outlets with known political biases, 2 and compared how they use polarised words such as "accuse", "attack", and "criticize" differently in light of P(w → agent) and P(w → theme) relations of the connota- tion frames. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows interesting contrasts. Obama, for example, is portrayed as someone who attacks or criticizes others according to the right- leaning sources, whereas the left-leaning sources portray Obama as the victim of harsh acts like "at- tack" or "criticize". 3 Furthermore, by knowing the perspective relationships P(w → a i ) associated with a predicate, we can make predictions about how the left-leaning and right-leaning sources feel about specific people or issues. For example, be- cause left-leaning sources frequently use McCain, Trump, and Limbaugh in the subject position of attack, we might predict that these sources have a negative sentiment towards these entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Dynamics between Typed Relations</head><p>Given a predicate, the polarity assignments of typed relations are interdependent. For example, if the writer feels positively towards the agent but nega- tively towards the theme, then it is likely that the agent and the theme do not feel positively towards each other. This insight is related to that of Wiebe and Deng (2014), but differs in that the polarities are predicate-specific and do not rely on knowledge of prior sentiment towards the arguments. This and other possible interdependencies are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. These interdependencies serve as general guidelines of what properties we expect to depend on one another, especially in the case where the po- larities are non-neutral. We will promote these in- ternal consistencies in our factor graph model ( §3) as soft constraints.</p><p>There also exist other interdependencies that we will use to simplify our task. First, the directed Perspective Triad: If A is positive towards B, and B is positive towards C, then we expect A is also positive towards C. Similar dynamics hold for the negative case.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pw→a 1 = ¬ (Pw→a 2 ⊕ Pa 1 →a 2 )</formula><p>Perspective -Effect: If a predicate has a positive effect on the Subject, then we expect that the interaction between the Subject and Object was positive. Similar dynamics hold for the negative case and for other perspective relations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ea 1 = Pa 2 →a 1</formula><p>Perspective -Value: If A is presupposed as valuable, then we expect that the writer also views A positively. Similar dynamics hold for the negative case.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Va 1 = Pw→a 1</formula><p>Effect -Mental State: If the predicate has a positive effect on A, then we expect that A will gain a positive mental state. Similar dynamics hold for the negative case. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Potential Dynamics among Typed Relations: we propose models that parameterize these dynamics using log-linear models (frame-level model in §3).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Sa 1 = Ea 1</formula><p>sentiments between the agent and the theme are likely to be reciprocal, or at least do not directly conflict with + and − simultaneously. Therefore, we assume that P(a 1 → a 2 ) = P(a 2 → a 1 ) = P(a 1 ↔ a 2 ), and we only measure for these binary relationships going in one direction. In addition, we assume the predicted 4 perspective from the reader r to an argument P(r → a) is likely to be the same as the implied perspective from the writer w to the same argument P(w → a). So, we only try to learn the perspective of the writer. Lifting these assumptions will be future work.</p><p>For simplicity, our model only explores the po- larities involving the agent and the theme roles. We will assume that these roles are correlated to the subject and object positions, and henceforth refer to them as the "Subject" and "Object" of the event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Modeling Connotation Frames</head><p>Our task is essentially that of lexicon induction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akkaya et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feng et al., 2013</ref>) in that we want to induce the connotation frames of pre- viously unseen verbs. For each predicate, we infer a connotation frame composed of 9 relationship aspects that represent: perspective {P(w → o), P(w → s), P(s → o)}, effect {E(o), E(s)}, value {V(o), V(s)}, and mental state {S(o), S(s)} po- larities.</p><p>We propose two models: an aspect-level model that makes the prediction for each typed relation independently based on the distributional represen- tation of the context in which the predicate appears ( §3.1), and a frame-level model that makes the pre-</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Aspect-Level</head><p>Our aspect-level model predicts labels for each of these typed relations separately. As input, we use the 300-dimensional dependency-based word em- beddings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Levy and Goldberg (2014)</ref>. For each aspect, there is a separate MaxEnt (maximum en- tropy) classifier used to predict the label of that as- pect on a given word-embedding, which is treated as a 300 dimensional input vector to the classi- fier. The MaxEnt classifiers learn their weights using LBFGS on the training data examples with re-weighting of samples to maximize for the best average F1 score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Frame-Level</head><p>Next we present a factor graph model <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>) of the connotation frames that parameterize the dynamics between typed relations. Specifically, for each verb predicate, 5 the factor graph contains 9 nodes representing the different aspects of the connotation frame. All these variables take polarity values from the set {−, =, +}.</p><p>We define Y i := {P wo , P ws , P so , E o , E s , V o , V s , S o , S s } as the set of relational aspects for the i th verb. The factor graph for Y i , is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, and we will describe the factor potentials in more detail in the rest of this section. The proba- bility of an assignment of polarities to the nodes in Y i is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P (Y i ) ∝ ψ PV (P ws , V s ) ψ PV (P wo , V o ) ψ PE (P so , E s ) ψ PE (P so , E o ) ψ ES (E s , S s ) ψ ES (E o , S o )</formula><p>ψ PT (P wo , P ws , P so )</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y∈Y i ψ emb (y)</formula><p>Embedding Factors We include unary factors on all nodes to represent the results of the aspect-level classifier. Incorporating this knowledge as factors, as opposed to fixing the variables as observed, af- fords us the flexibility of representing noise in the labels as soft evidence. The potential function ψ emb is a log-linear function of a feature vector f, which is a one-hot feature vector representing the polarity of a node (+,−,or =). For example, with the node representing the value of the object (V o ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ψ emb (V o ) = e w Vo ·f (Vo)</formula><p>The potential ψ emb is defined similarly for the other 8 remaining nodes. All weights were learned using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over training data.</p><p>Interdependency Factors We include interde- pendency factors to promote the properties defined by the dynamics between relations ( §2.2). The po- tentials for Perspective Triad, Perspective-Value, Perspective-Effect, and Effect-State Relationships (ψ PT , ψ PV , ψ PE , ψ ES respectively) are all defined using log-linear functions of one-hot feature vec- tors that encode the combination of polarities of the neighboring nodes. The potential for ψ PT is therefore:</p><p>ψ PT (P wo , P ws , P so ) = e w P T ·f (Pwo,Pws,Pso) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We consider only verb predicates here.</p><p>And we define the potentials for ψ PV , ψ PE , and ψ ES for subject nodes as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ψ PV (P ws , V s ) = e w P V,s ·f (Pws,Vs) ψ PE (P so , E s ) = e w P E,s ·f (Pso,</formula><note type="other">Es) ψ ES (E s , S s ) = e w ES,s ·f (Es,Ss)</note><p>and we define the potentials for the object nodes similarly. As with the unary seed factors, weights were learned using SGD over training data. Belief Propagation We use belief propagation to induce the connotation frames of previously un- seen verbs. In the belief propagation algorithm, messages are iteratively passed between the nodes to their neighboring factors and vice versa. Each message µ, containing a scalar for each value x ∈ {−, 0, +}, is defined from each node v to a neighboring factor a as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">µ v→a (x) ∝ a * ∈N (v) a µ a * →v (x)</formula><p>and from each factor a to a neighboring node v as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">µ a→v ∝ x ,x v =x ψ(x ) v * ∈N (a) v µ v * →a (x v * )</formula><p>At the conclusion of message passing, the probabil- ity of a specific polarity associated with node v be- ing equal to x is proportional to a∈N (v) µ a→v (x). Our factor graph does not contain any loops, so we are able to perform exact inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We first describe crowd-sourced annotations ( §4.1), then present the empirical results of predicting con- notation frames ( §4.2), and conclude with qualita- tive analysis of a large corpus ( §4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data and Crowdsourcing</head><p>In order to understand how humans interpret conno- tation frames, we designed an Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) annotation study. We gathered a set of transitive verbs commonly used in the New York Times corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sandhaus, 2008)</ref>, selecting the 2400 verbs that are used more than 200 times in the cor- pus. Of these, AMT workers annotated the 1000 most frequently used verbs. Annotation Design In a pilot annotation exper- iment, we found that annotators have difficulty thinking about subtle connotative polarities when shown predicates without any context. Therefore, we designed the AMT task to provide a generic context as follows. We first split each verb predi- cate into 5 separate tasks that each gave workers a different generic sentence using the verb. To cre- ate generic sentences, we used Google Syntactic N-grams ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Goldberg and Orwant, 2013)</ref> to come up with a frequently seen Subject-Verb-Object tuple which served as a simple three-word sentence with generic arguments. For each of the 5 sentences, we asked 3 annotators to answer questions like "How do you think the Subject feels about the event de- scribed in this sentence?" In total, each verb has 15 annotations aggregated over 5 different generic sentences containing the verb.</p><p>In order to help the annotators, some of the ques- tions also allowed annotators to choose sentiment using additional classes for "positive or neutral" or "negative or neutral" for when they were less confident but still felt like a sentiment might ex- ist. When taking inter-annotator agreement, we count "positive or neutral" as agreeing with either "positive" or "neutral" classes. Annotator agreement <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows agreements and data statistics. The non-conflicting (NC) agree- ment only counts opposite polarities as disagree- ment. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> From this study, we can see that non-expert annotators are able to see these sort of relationships based on their understanding of how language is used. From the NC agreement, we see that annota- tors do not frequently choose completely opposite polarities, indicating that even when they disagree, their disagreements are based on the degree of con- notations rather than the polarity itself. The average Krippendorff alpha for all of the questions posed to the workers is 0.25, indicating stronger than ran- dom agreement. Considering the subtlety of the implicit sentiments that we are asking them to an- notate, it is reasonable that some annotators will pick up on more nuances than others. Overall, the percent agreement is encouraging that the connota- tive relationships are visible to human annotators.</p><p>Aggregating Annotations We aggregated over crowdsourced labels (fifteen annotations per verb) to create a polarity label for each aspect of a verb. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Final distributions of the aggregated labels are <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Annotators were asked yes/no questions related to Value, so this does not have a corresponding NC agreement score. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We take the average to obtain scalar value between [−1., <ref type="bibr">1.]</ref> for each aspect of a verb's connotation frame.    inter-annotator agreement. The strict agreement counts agree- ment over 3 classes ("positive or neutral" was counted as agreeing with either + or neutral), while non-conflicting (NC) agreement also allows agreements between neutral and -/+ (no direct conflicts). Distribution shows the final class distribution of -/+ labels created by averaging annotations.</p><p>included in the right-hand columns of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. Notably, the distributions are skewed toward pos- itive and neutral labels. The most skewed conno- tation frame aspect is the value V(x) which tends to be positive, especially for the subject argument. This makes some intuitive sense since, as the sub- ject actively causes the predicate event to occur, they most likely have some intrinsic potential to be valuable. An example of a verb where the subject was labelled as not valuable is "contaminate". In the most generic case, the writer is using contami- nate to frame the subject as being worthless (and even harmful) with regards to the other event par- ticipants. For example, in the sentence "his touch contaminated the food," it is clear that the writer considers "his touch" to be of negative value in the context of how it impacts the rest of the event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Connotation Frame Prediction</head><p>Using our crowdsourced labels, we randomly di- vided the annotated verbs into training, dev, and held-out test sets of equal size (300 verbs each). For evaluation we measured average accuracy and F1 score over the 9 different Connotation Frame relationship types for which we have annotations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P(w → o), P(w → s), P(s → o), V(o), V(s), E(o), E(s), S(o)</formula><p>, and S(s). Baselines To show the non-trivial challenge of learning Connotation Frames, we include a simple majority-class baselines. The MAJORITY classi- fier assigns each of the 9 relationships the label of the majority of that relationship type found in the training data. Some of these relationships (in particular, the Value of subject/object) have skewed distributions, so we expect this classifier to achieve a much higher accuracy than random but a much lower overall F1 score.</p><p>Additionally, we add a GRAPH PROP baseline that is comparable to algorithms like graph prop- agation or label propagation which are often used for (sentiment) lexicon induction. We use a factor graph with nodes representing the polarity of each typed relation for each verb. Binary factors con- nect nodes representing a particular type of relation for two similar verbs (e.g. P(w → o) for verbs persuade and convince). These binary factors have hand-tuned potentials that are proportional to the cosine similarity of the verbs' embeddings, encour- aging similar verbs to have the same polarity for the various relational aspects. We use words in the training data as the seed set and use loopy belief propagation to propagate polarities from known nodes to the unknown relationships.</p><p>Finally, we use a 3-NEAREST NEIGHBOR base- line that labels relationships for a verb based on the predicate's 300-dimensional word embedding representation, using the same embeddings as in our aspect-level. 3-NEAREST NEIGHBOR labels each verb using the polarities of the three closest verbs found in the training set. The most similar verbs are determined using the cosine similarity between word embeddings.</p><p>Results As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, aspect-level and frame-level models consistently outperform all three baselines -MAJORITY, 3-NN, GRAPH PROP in the development set across the different types of relationships. In particular, the improved F1 scores show that these models are able to per- form better across all three classes of labels even in the most skewed cases. The frame-level model also frequently improves the F1 scores of the la- bels from what they were in the aspect-level model. The summarized comparison of the classifiers' per- formance test set is shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. As with the development set, aspect-level and frame-level are both able to outperform the baselines. Fur- thermore, the frame-level formulation is able to make improvement over the results of the aspect- level classification, indicating that the modelling of inter-dependencies between relationships did help correct some of the mistakes made.</p><p>One point of interest about the frame-level re- sults is whether the learned weights over the consis- tency factors match our initial intuitions about inter- dependencies between relationships. The weights learned in our algorithm do tell us something in- teresting about the degree to which these inter- dependencies are actually found in our data. We show the heat maps for some of the learned weights in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. In 3a, we show the weights of one of the embedding factors, and how the polari- ties are more strongly weighted when they match the relation-level output. In the rest of the figure, we show the weights for the other perspective rela- tionships when P(w → o) is negative (3b), neutral (3c), and positive (3d), respectively. Based on the expected interdependencies, when P(w → o) : −, the model should favor P(w → s) = P(s → o) and when P(w → o) : +, the model should favor P(w → s) = P(s → o). Our model does, in fact, learn a similar trend, with slightly higher weights along these two diagonals in the maps 3b and 3d. Interestingly, when P(w → o) is neutral, weights slightly prefer for the other two perspectives to re- semble one another, but with highest weights being when other perspectives are also neutral.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Analysis of a Large News Corpus</head><p>Using the connotation frame, we present measured implied sentiment in online journalism.</p><p>Data From the Stream Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(KBA, 2014)</ref>, we select 70 million news articles. We extract subject-verb-object relations for this subset us- ing the direct dependencies between noun phrases   and verbs as identified by the BBN Serif sys- tem, obtaining 1.2 billion unique tuples of the form (url,subject,verb,object,count).We also ex- tracted subject-verb-object tuples from news arti- cles found in the Annotated English Gigaword Cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Napoles et al., 2012)</ref>, which contains nearly 10 million articles. From the Gigaword corpus we extracted a further 120 million unique tuples.</p><p>Estimating Entity Polarities Using connotation frames, we can also measure entity-to-entity sen- timent at a large scale. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, for example, presents the polarity of entities "Democrats" and "Republicans" towards a selected set of nouns, by computing the average estimated polarity (using our lexicon) over triples where one of these entities appears as part of the subject (e.g. "Democrats" or "Republican party"). Apart from nouns that both entities are positive ("business", "constitution") or negative ("the allegations","veto threat") towards, we can also see interesting examples in which Democrats feel more positively (below the line: "nancy pelosi", "unions", "gun control", etc.) and ones where Republicans are more positive ("the pipeline", "gop leaders", "budget cuts", etc.) Also, both entities are neutral towards "idea" and "the proposal", which probably owes to the fact that ideas or proposals can be good or bad for either entity depending on the context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Most prior work on sentiment lexicons focused on the overall polarity of words without taking into account their semantic arguments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baccianella et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Velikovich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kamps et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Takamura et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adreevskaia and Bergler, 2006</ref>). Sev- eral recent studies began exploring more specific and nuanced aspects of sentiment such as connota- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feng et al., 2013</ref>), good and bad effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Choi and Wiebe, 2014)</ref>, and evoked sentiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mohammad and Turney, 2010)</ref>. Drawing inspirations from them, we present connotation frames as a unifying representation framework to encode the rich di- mensions of implied sentiment, presupposed value judgements, and effect evaluation, and propose a factor graph formulation that captures the interplay among different types of connotation relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Goyal et al. (2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">2010b</ref>) investigated how characters <ref type="bibr">(protagonists, villains, victims)</ref> in chil- dren's stories are affected by certain predicates, which is related to the effect relations studied in this work. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Klenner et al. (2014)</ref> similarly investi- gated the relation between the polarity of the verbs and arguments, our work introduces new perspec- tive types and proposes a unified representation and inference model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wiegand and Ruppenhofer (2015)</ref> also looked at perspective-based relationships in- duced by verb predicates with a focus on opinion roles. Building on this concept, our framework also incorporates information about the perspec- tives' polarities as well as information about other typed relations. There have been growing interests for modeling framing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Greene and Resnik, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hasan and Ng, 2013)</ref>, biased language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Recasens et al., 2013</ref>) and ideology detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Yano et al., 2010)</ref>. All these tasks are relatively less studied, and we hope our connotation frame lexicon will be useful for them.</p><p>Sentiment inference rules have been explored by the recent work of  and . In contrast, we make a novel conceptual connection between inferred sentiments and frame semantics, organized as con- notation frames, and present a unified model that in- tegrates different aspects of the connotation frames. Finally, in a broader sense, what we study as con- notation frames draws a connection to schema and script theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Schank and Abelson, 1975)</ref>. Unlike most prior work that focused on directly observable actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Frermann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bethard et al., 2008)</ref>, we focus on implied sentiments that are framed by predicate verbs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented a novel system of connotative frames that define a set of implied sentiment and presupposed facts for a predi- cate. Our work also empirically explores differ- ent methods of inducing and modelling these con- notation frames, incorporating the interplay be- tween relations within frames. Our work sug- gests new research avenues on learning connota- tion frames, and their applications to deeper under- standing of social and political discourse. All the learned connotation frames and annotations will be shared at http://homes.cs.washington. edu/ ˜ hrashkin/connframe.html.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example connotation frame of "violate" as a set of typed relations: perspective P(x → y), effect E(x), value V(x), and mental state S(x).</figDesc></figure>
