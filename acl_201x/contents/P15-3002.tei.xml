				<p>This paper presents a method to improve the translation of polysemous nouns, when a previous occurrence of the noun as the head of a compound noun phrase is available in a text. The occurrences are identified through pattern matching rules, which detect XY compounds followed closely by a potentially coreferent occurrence of Y , such as &quot;Nordwand. .. Wand&quot;. Two strategies are proposed to improve the translation of the second occurrence of Y : re-using the cached translation of Y from the XY compound, or post-editing the translation of Y using the head of the translation of XY. Experiments are performed on Chinese-to-English and German-to-French statistical machine translation, over the WIT3 and Text+Berg corpora respectively, with 261 XY /Y pairs each. The results suggest that while the overall BLEU scores increase only slightly, the translations of the targeted polysemous nouns are significantly improved.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Words tend to be less ambiguous when consid- ered in context, which partially explains the suc- cess of phrase-based statistical machine transla- tion (SMT) systems. In this paper, we take ad- vantage of this observation, and extend the dis- ambiguation potential of n-grams to subsequent occurrences of their individual components. We assume that the translation of a noun-noun com- pound, noted XY , displays fewer ambiguities than the translations of its components X and Y . Therefore, on a subsequent occurrence of the head of XY , assumed to refer to the same entity as XY , we hypothesize that its previously-found transla- tion offers a better and more coherent translation than the one proposed by an SMT system that is not aware of the compound.</p><p>Our claim is supported by results from ex- periments on Chinese-to-English (ZH/EN) and German-to-French (DE/FR) translation presented in this paper. In both source languages, noun-noun compounds are frequent, and will enable us to dis- ambiguate subsequent occurrences of their head.</p><p>For instance, in the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the Chinese compound refers to 'high heels', and the subsequent mention of the referent using only the third character () should be translated as 'heels'. However, the character by itself could also be translated as 'shoe' or 'footwear', as observed with a baseline SMT system that is not aware of the XY /Y coreference.</p><p>Although the XY /Y configuration may not be very frequent in texts, errors in its translation are particularly detrimental to the understanding of a text, as they often conceal the coreference link between two expressions. Moreover, as we will show, such issues can be quite reliably corrected, and the proposed approach can later generalize to other configurations of noun phrase coreference.

In Section 2 we present the main components of our proposal: first, the rules for identifying XY /Y pairs, and then two alternative methods for improving the co- herence of the translation of a subsequent mention Y , one based on post-editing and the other one based on caching, which builds upon initial exper- iments presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mascarell et al. (2014)</ref>. In Section 3, we present our experimental setting. In Section 4, we evaluate our proposal on ZH/EN and DE/FR translation, demonstrating that the transla- tion of nouns is indeed improved, mainly by au- tomatic or human comparisons with the reference translation. We conclude with a brief discussion of related studies (Section 5) and with perspectives for future work (Section 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Description of the Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Overview</head><p>We propose to use the translation of a compound XY to improve the translation of a subsequent oc- currence of Y , the head of the XY noun phrase, in the following way, represented schematically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (details for each stage are given below).</p><p>First, the presence of XY /Y patterns is detected either by examining whether a compound XY is followed by an occurrence of Y , or, conversely, by examining for each Y candidate whether it ap- pears as part of a previous compound XY . Dis- tance constraints and additional filtering rules are implemented to increase the likelihood that XY and Y are actually co-referent, or at least refer to entities of the same type.</p><p>Second, each sentence is translated by a base- line SMT system, and the translation of the head Y of each compound XY is identified using the word alignment from the SMT decoder. This transla- tion is used as the translation of a subsequent oc- currence of Y either by caching the correspond- ing source/target word pair in the SMT or by post- editing the baseline SMT output. For instance, if the Chinese pair (, ) is identified, where the first compound can unambiguously be translated into English by 'vegetable', then the translation of a subsequent occurrence of is enforced to 'veg- etable'. This has the potential to improve over the baseline translation, because when considered in- dividually, could also be translated as 'dish', 'greens', 'wild herbs', etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Identifying XY /Y Pairs</head><p>Chinese and German share a number of similar- ities regarding compounds. Although Chinese texts are not word-segmented, once this opera- tion is performed, multi-character words in which all characters have individual meanings -such as the above-mentioned ('vegetable') -are fre- quent. Similarly, in German, noun-noun com- pounds such as 'Bundesamt' ('Bund' + 'Amt', for Federal Bureau) or Nordwand ('Nord' + 'Wand', for North face) are frequent as well. While the identification of XY noun-noun compounds is straightforward with morpho-syntactic analysis tools, the identification of a subsequent mention of the head noun, Y , and especially the decision whether this Y refers or not to the same entity XY , are more challenging issues. In other words, the main difficulty is to separate true XY /Y pairs from false positives.</p><p>To detect truly coreferent XY /Y pairs we nar- row down the set of detected cases using hand- written rules that check the local context of Y . For example, only the cases where Y is preceded by demonstrative pronouns (e.g. or mean- ing 'this' and 'that' in Chinese, or 'diese' in Ger- man), possessive pronouns and determiners ('der', 'die', 'das' in German) are considered. Since other words can occur between the two parts (like classifiers in Chinese or adjectives), there are ad- ditional distance constraints: the pronoun or de- terminer must be separated by fewer than three words. Since the rules use morphological infor- mation and word boundaries, they are preceded by word segmentation 1 and tagging 2 for Chinese and morphological analysis for German. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> For exam- ple, in the input sentence from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we deter- mine that the noun phrase fits our condition for extraction as Y because as there are words before it which fulfill the condition for acceptance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Enforcing the Translation of Y</head><p>Two language-independent methods have been de- signed to ensure that the translations of XY and Y are a consistent: post-editing and caching. The second one builds upon an earlier proposal tested only on DE/FR with subjective evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mascarell et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>In the post-editing method, for each XY /Y pair, the translations of XY and Y by a baseline SMT system (see Section 3) are first identified through word alignment. We verify if the trans- lations of Y in both noun phrases are identical or different. Both elements comprising the com- pound structure XY /Y are identified, for the stan- dard cases, with only one possible XY referring to one Y . The translation of both words are provided by the baseline SMT system, and our system sub- sequently verifies if the translations of Y in both noun phrases are identical or different. We keep them intact in the first case, while in the second case we replace the translation of Y by the transla- tion of XY or by its head noun only, if it contains several words. In the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, XY is translated into 'high heel' and Y into 'shoes', which is a wrong translation of in this context. Using the consistency constraint, our method post- edits the translation of Y replacing it with 'heel', which is the correct word.</p><p>Several differences from the ideal case pre- sented above must be handled separately. First, it may occur that several XY are likely co-referent with the same Y . In this case, if their transla- tions differ, given that we cannot resolve the co- reference, we do not post-edit Y . <ref type="bibr">4</ref> If the trans- lations of the several occurrences of XY are the same, but consist of one word, we still do not post- edit Y . We only change it if the translations con- sist of several words, ensuring that XY is a com- pound noun phrase. Second, if the compound XY is not translated (out-of-vocabulary word), we do not post-edit Y . 5 Third, sometimes the alignment of Y is empty in the target sentence (alignment er- ror or untranslated word), in which case we apply post-editing as above on the word preceding Y , if it is aligned.</p><p>In the caching method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mascarell et al., 2014</ref>), once an XY compound is identified, we obtain the translation of the Y part of the compound through the word alignment given by the SMT decoder. Next, we check that this translation ap- pears as a translation of Y in the phrase table, and if so, we cache both Y and the obtained transla- tion. We then enforce the cached translation every time a coreference Y to XY is identified. Note that this is different from the probabilistic caching proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tiedemann (2010)</ref>, because in our case the cached translation is deterministically en- forced as the translation of Y .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Settings</head><p>The experiments are carried out on two differ- ent parallel corpora: the WIT 3 Chinese-English dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cettolo et al., 2012</ref> Our baseline SMT system is the Moses phrase- based decoder ( , trained over tokenized and true-cased data. The language mod- els were built using SRILM (Stolcke et al., 2011) at order 3 (i.e. up to trigrams) using the default smoothing method (i.e. Good-Turing). Optimiza- tion was done using Minimum Error Rate Training <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Och, 2003)</ref> as provided with Moses.</p><p>The effectiveness of proposed systems is mea- sured in two ways. First, we use BLEU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>) for overall evaluation, to verify whether our systems provide better translation for entire texts. Then, we focus on the XY /Y pairs and count the number of cases in which the trans- lations of Y match the reference or not, which can be computed automatically using the alignments.</p><p>However, the automatic comparison of a sys- tem's translation with the reference is not entirely informative, because even if the two differ, the sys- tem's translation can still be acceptable. There- fore, we analyzed these "undecided" situations manually, with three human annotators (among the authors of the paper). The annotators rated sepa- rately the system's translations of Y and the refer- ence ones as 'good', 'acceptable' or 'wrong'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis of Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Automatic Comparison with a Reference</head><p>The BLEU scores obtained by the baseline SMT, the caching and post-editing methods, and an or- acle system are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>. The scores are in the same range as the baseline scores found by other teams on these datasets (Cettolo et al., 2012, <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> for ZH/EN), and much higher on DE/FR than ZH/EN.</p><p>Our methods have a small positive effect on ZH/EN translation, and a small negative effect on DE/FR one. Given the sparsity of XY /Y pairs with respect to the total number of words, hence the small number of changed words, these re- sults meet our prior expectations. Indeed, we also computed the oracle BLEU scores for both lan- guage pairs, i.e. the scores when all Y members of XY /Y pairs are (manually) translated exactly as in the reference (last line of  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>: BLEU scores of our methods.</p><p>We now turn to the reference-based evaluation of the translations of Y in the 261 XY /Y pairs, comparing the baseline SMT with each of our methods. These results are represented as four contingency tables -two language pairs and two methods against the baseline -gathered together as percentages in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Among these values, we focus first on the total of pairs where one of our systems agrees with the reference while the base- line system does not (i.e., improvements due to the system), and the converse case (degradations). The higher the difference between the two values, the more beneficial our method.</p><p>For ZH/EN and the post-editing system, among the 222 extracted pairs, there were 45 improve- ments (20.3%) of the system with respect to the CACHING POST-EDITING = ref = ref = ref = ref ZH/EN BASELINE = ref 59.3 4.1 42.3 4.5 = ref 13.8 22.8 20.3 32.9</p><p>DE/FR BASELINE = ref 70.1 10.3 73.9 5.0 = ref 4.3 15.2 3.5 17.5 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Comparison of each approach with the baseline, for the two language pairs, in terms of Y nouns which are identical or different from a reference translation ('ref'). All scores are percentages of the totals. Numbers in bold are improvements over the baseline, while those in italics are degradations.</p><p>baseline, and only 10 degradations (4.5%). There were also 94 pairs (42.3%) for which the baseline and the post-edited system were equal to the ref- erence. The remaining 73 pairs (32.9%) will be analyzed manually in the next section. Therefore, from a pure reference-based view, the post-edited system has a net improvement of 15.8% (absolute) over the baseline in dealing with the XY /Y pairs. A similar pattern is observed with the other method, namely caching, again on ZH/EN trans- lation: 13.8% improvements vs. 4.1% degrada- tions. The difference (i.e. the net improvement) is slightly smaller in this case with respect to the post-editing method.</p><p>For DE/FR translation, both methods appear to score fewer improvements than degradations. There are more than 70% of the pairs which are translated correctly by the baseline and by both systems, which indicates that the potential for im- provement is much smaller for DE/FR than for ZH/EN.</p><p>While the pattern of improvement between ZH/EN and DE/FR is similar for post-editing and for caching, for both language pairs the post- editing method has a larger difference between improvements and degradations than the caching method. This can be explained by a lower cov- erage of the latter method, since it only enforces a translation when it appears as one of the trans- lation candidates for Y in the phrase table <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mascarell et al., 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Manual Evaluation of Undecided Cases</head><p>When both the baseline and one of our systems generate translations of Y which differ from the reference, it is not possible to compare the trans- lations without having them examined by human subjects. This was done for the 73 such cases of the ZH/EN post-editing system. Three of the authors, working independently, considered each translation from each system (in separate batches) with respect to the reference one, and rated its meaning on a 3-point scale: 2 (good), 1 (accept- able) or 0 (wrong). To estimate the inter-rater agreement, we computed the average absolute de- viation <ref type="bibr">6</ref> and found a value of 0.15, thus denoting very good agreement. Below, we group '2' and '1' answers into one category, called "acceptable", and compare them to '0' answers, i.e. wrong trans- lations.</p><p>When both the baseline and the post-edited translations of Y differ from the reference, they can either be identical (49 cases) or different (24). In the former case, of course, neither of the sys- tems outperforms the other. The interesting obser- vation is that the relatively high number of such cases (49) is due to situations where the reference translation of noun Y is by a pronoun (40), which the systems have currently no possibility to gen- erate from a noun in the source sentence. Manual evaluation shows that the systems' translations are correct in 36 out of 40 cases. This large number shows that the "quality" of the systems is actu- ally higher than what can be inferred from <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> only. Conversely, in the 9 cases when the refer- ence translation of Y is not a pronoun, only about half of the translations are correct.</p><p>In the latter case, when baseline and post-edited translations differ from the reference and among themselves (24 cases), it is legitimate to ask which of the two systems is better. Overall, 10 baseline translations are correct and 14 are wrong, whereas 23 post-edited translations are correct (or at least acceptable) and only one is wrong. The post- edited system thus clearly outperforms the base- line in this case. Similarly to the observation above, we note that among the 24 cases considered here, almost all (20) involve a reference translation of Y by a pronoun. In these cases, the baseline system translates only about half of them with a correct noun (9 out of 20), while the post-edited system translates correctly 19 out of 20.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>We briefly review in this section several previous studies from which the present one has benefited. Our idea is built upon the one-sense-per-discourse hypothesis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gale et al., 1992)</ref> and its application to machine translation is based on the premise that consistency in discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carpuat, 2009</ref>) is desir- able. The initial compound idea was first pub- lished by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mascarell et al. (2014)</ref>, in which the co- reference of compound noun phrases in German (e.g. Nordwand/Wand) was studied and used to improve DE/FR translation by assuming that the last constituent of the compound Y should share the same translation as that of Y in XY .</p><p>Several other approaches focused on enforcing consistent lexical choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tiedemann (2010)</ref> pro- posed a cache-model to enforce consistent trans- lation of phrases across the document. How- ever, caching is sensitive to error propagation, that is, when a phrase is incorrectly translated and cached, the model propagates the error to the fol- lowing sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gong et al. (2011)</ref> later ex- tended Tiedemann's proposal by initializing the cache with phrase pairs from similar documents at the beginning of the translation and by also ap- plying a topic cache, which was introduced to deal with the error propagation issue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xiao et al. (2011)</ref> defined a three step procedure that enforces the consistent translation of ambiguous words, achiev- ing improvements for EN/ZH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ture et al. (2012)</ref> encouraged consistency for AR/EN MT by intro- ducing cross-sentence consistency features to the translation model, while <ref type="bibr">Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff (2009)</ref> enforced similar translations to sen- tences having a similar graph representation.</p><p>Our work is an instance of a recent trend aim- ing to go beyond sentence-by-sentence MT, by us- ing semantic information from previous sentences to constrain or correct the decoding of the cur- rent one. In this paper, we compared caching and post-editing as ways of achieving this goal, but a document-level decoder such as Docent <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hardmeier et al., 2012</ref>) could be used as well. In other studies, factored translation models (  have been used with the same pur- pose, by incorporating contextual information into labels used to indicate the meaning of ambiguous discourse connectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Meyer and Popescu-Belis, 2012</ref>) or the expected tenses of verb phrase trans- lations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Loaiciga et al., 2014</ref>). Quite naturally, there are analogies between our work and stud- ies of pronoun translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hardmeier and Federico, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Guillou, 2012)</ref>, with the notable difference that pronominal anaphora resolution remains a challenging task. Finally, our work and its perspectives contribute to the general objective of using discourse-level information to improve MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hardmeier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Meyer, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Perspectives</head><p>We presented a method to enforce the consistent translation of coreferences to a compound, when the coreference matches the head noun of the com- pound. Experimental results showed that baseline SMT systems often translate coreferences to com- pounds consistently for DE/FR, but much less so for ZH/EN. For a significant number of cases in which the noun phrase Y had multiple meanings, our system reduced the frequency of mistransla- tions in comparison to the baseline, and improved noun phrase translation.</p><p>In this work, we considered XY /Y pairs, hy- pothesizing that when they are coreferent, they should have consistent translations. In the future, we will generalize this constraint to complex noun phrases which are not compounds. More gener- ally, we will explore the encoding of coreference constraints into probabilistic models that can be combined with SMT systems, so that coreference constraints are considered in the decoding process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Compound post-editing method illustrated on ZH/EN.

			<note place="foot" n="4"> Upon manual examination, we found that using the most recent XY was not a reliable candidate for the antecedent. 5 In fact, we can use the translation of Y as a translation candidate for XY. Our observations show that this helps to improve BLEU scores, but does not affect the specific scoring of Y in Section 4.</note>
