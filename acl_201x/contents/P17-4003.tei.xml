			<abstract>
				<p>Recently, conversational robots are widely used in mobile terminals as the virtual assistant or companion. The goals of prevalent conversational robots mainly focus on four categories, namely chitchat , task completion, question answering and recommendation. In this paper, we present a Chinese intelligent conversational robot, Benben, which is designed to achieve these goals in a unified architecture. Moreover, it also has some featured functions such as diet map, implicit feedback based conversation, interactive machine reading, news recommendation, etc. Since the release of Benben at June 6, 2016, there are 2,505 users (till Feb 22, 2017) and 11,107 complete human-robot conversations, which totally contain 198,998 single turn conversation pairs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The research of conversational robot can be traced back to 1950s, when Alan M. Turing presented the Turing test to answer the proposed question "Can machine think?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Turing, 1950)</ref>. It then be- comes an interesting and challenging research in artificial intelligence. Conversational robot can be applied to many scenarios of human-computer interaction, such as question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Crutzen et al., 2011</ref>), negotiation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Rosenfeld et al., 2014</ref>), e-commence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Goes et al., 2011</ref>), tutoring ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Pilato et al., 2005</ref>), etc. Recently, with the widespread of mobile terminals, it is also applied as the virtual assistant, such as Apple Siri <ref type="bibr">1</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: The technical structure of Benben.</p><p>make users acquire information and services with the terminals more conveniently. The goals of the prevalent conversational robot- s can be grouped into four categories. First is chit-chat which is usually designed for responding greeting, emotional and entertainment messages. Second is task completion aiming to assist users to complete some specific tasks, such as restau- rant and hotel reservation, flight inquiry, tourist guide, web search, etc. Third is question answer- ing that is to satisfy the need of information and knowledge acquisition. Fourth is recommendation that can actively recommend personalized content through the user interest profiling and conversa- tion history. Despite the success of the existing conversational robots, they tend to only focus on one or several goals and hardly achieve all of them in a unified framework.</p><p>In this paper, we present a Chinese intelligen- t conversational robot, Benben, which is based on massive Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech- niques and takes all of the goals in design. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the technical structure of Ben- ben. The bottom layer contains the basic tech- niques of NLP, such as Chinese word segmenta- tion, part-of-speech tagging, word sense disam- biguation, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, semantic role labelling and semantic de-  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Architecture</head><p>In this section, we will introduce the architecture of Benben. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the simplified architec- ture of Benben. It mainly consists of four compo- nents: 1) language understanding, 2) conversation state tracking, 3) domain selection and process- ing and 4) response generation. As can be seen, the architecture of Benben can be corresponded to the classic architecture of spoken dialogue sys- tems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Young et al., 2013)</ref>. Concretely, the natu- ral language understanding, dialogue managemen- t and natural language generation in spoken dia- logue systems are corresponding to the 1), 2) and 3), 4) components of the Benben architecture, re- spectively. We will next detail each component in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Language Understanding</head><p>The user input can be either text or speech. There- fore, the first step is to understand both the speech transcription and text. In Benben, the LTP toolk- it ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Che et al., 2010</ref>) is utilized to the basic lan- guage processing, including Chinese word seg- mentation, part-of-speech tagging, word sense dis- ambiguation, named entity recognition, dependen- cy parsing, semantic role labelling and semantic <ref type="bibr">5</ref> http://www.ltp-cloud.com dependency parsing. The results of these process- ing are finally taken as the lexical, syntactic and semantic features and transferred to different rep- resentations to the following processing steps.</p><p>We obtain the results of sentence-level sen- timent analysis by using our proposed ap- proach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Tang et al., 2015)</ref>. The results are then used in two aspects. One is to directly generate consoling responses and the other is to take the sentiment as an implicit feedback of users to opti- mize the long-term goal of conversations.</p><p>We utilize the proposed weakly-supervised ap- proach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fu and Liu, 2013)</ref> to recognize the inten- tion of users. User intention can be either used as clues for response generation or features for do- main selection. For example, if a user says:"I want to go to Beijing.", he/she may want to book an air- plane or train ticket or further reserve a hotel room in Beijing.</p><p>We also design a scheme to filter out the sen- tences that contain vulgar, obscene or sensitive words. A classifier is trained to automatically identify these sentences with manually collated lexicons. Meanwhile, the rejection scheme is al- so needed as Benben should cope with the inputs that are out of its responding scope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Conversation State Tracking</head><p>After the language understanding step, an input sentence is transferred to several feature represen- tations. These feature representations are then tak- en as the inputs of the conversation state track- ing and domain selection. The conversation state tracker records the historical content, the curren- t domain and the historically triggered domains, the sequences of the states of confirmation, clar- ification, filtration, rejection, etc., and their com- binations. Given the feature representations of an input, the multi-domain state tracker will produce a probability distribution of the states over mul- tiple domains, which is then used to domain s- election. The trackers of confirmation, clarifica- tion, filtration, rejection, etc., estimate their trig- gered probabilities, respectively. These probabili- ties are directly sent to the response generation as their current states or triggered confidences. It is worth noting that the conversations may come to a stalemate state, which indicates that the users are not interesting to the current conversation topic or they are unsatisfied to the responses generated by Benben. Once the stalemate state is detected, Ben- ben will transfer the current conversation topic to another topic to sustain the conversation. Meanwhile, as can be seen from <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, there is an iterative interaction among conversation s- tate tracking, domain selection and domain pro- cessing. The interactive loop denotes that the state tracking module provides the current state distri- bution of multiple domains for the domain selec- tion. The triggered domains are then processing to update the conversation state as well as generate the intermediate results for response generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Domain Selection</head><p>The domain selection module is to trigger one or more domains to produce the intermediate results for response generation. It takes the feature rep- resentations from language understanding and the current multi-domain state distribution from con- versation state tracking as inputs and estimates the triggered domain distribution using a convolution- al neural network.</p><p>In Benben, we proposed a topic augmented con- volutional neural network to integrate the contin- uous word representations and the discrete top- ic information into a unified framework for do- main selection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows the framework of the proposed topic augmented convolutional neu- ral network for domain selection. The word em- bedding matrix and the topic matrix are obtained using the word2vec <ref type="bibr">6</ref> and Labeled LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ramage et al., 2009</ref>), respectively. The two representation- s of the input conversation utterance are combined in the full connection layer and output the domain triggered distribution. At last, the domains whose triggered probabilities are larger than a threshold are selected to execute the following domain pro- cessing step. Note that after the domain selection step, there may be one or more triggered domains. If there is no domain to be triggered, the conversa- tion state is updated and then sent to the response generation module.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Domain Processing</head><p>Once a domain is selected, the corresponding pro- cessing step is triggered. We will next details the processing manners of the four domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chit-Chat</head><p>The chit-chat processing consists of two compo- nents. First is the retrieval based model for gen- erating chit-chat conversations. Here, we have indexed 3 million single turn post-response pairs collected from the online forum and microblog   conversations, using Lucene toolkit <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . Second, the use of "&lt;EOS&gt;" to initialize the sequence to se- quence (Seq2Seq) learning based response gen- eration models usually leads to vague or non- committal responses, such as "I don't know.", "Me too.", etc. To address the problem, we used an op- timized approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Zhu et al., 2016)</ref>, namely learn- ing to start (LTS) model, to utilize a specific neural network to learn how to generate the first word of a response. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> is the framework of the pro- posed LTS model. 5 million post and comment pairs that are released by the short text conversa- tion in NTCIR-12 8 are used to train the LTS mod- el.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Completion</head><p>The domain of task completion also has sub- domains, such as restaurant and hotel reservation, airplane and train ticket booking, bus and metro line guidance, etc. For each sub-domain, the task completion process is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. As can be seen, after recognizing the user intention, a con- ditional random field (CRF) model is utilized to identify the values, in the user input, to fill the semantic slots according to the characteristics of the sub-domain. For the same semantic slot, there may be different forms of values can be filled in. Therefore, we also proposed a value normalization scheme for the semantic slots. The conversation state is then updated after a slot has been filled. In a task progress, the task completion is an in- teractive process between terminals and users so that it needs a multi-turn conversation controller. In Benben, the multi-turn conversation is jointly  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Question Answering</head><p>The question answering (QA) domain has two modes, namely factoid QA and interactive QA. After the intention recognition of user input, the question classification module routes the user questions into the factoid QA or interactive QA. For the factoid QA, we retrieve the candidate para- graphs, sentences, infobox messages from the on- line encyclopedia, and QA pairs from a large s- cale archived community QA repository, which are collected from a community QA website. As Benben currently processes the Chinese conver- sations, the Baidu Encyclopedia 9 and Baidu Zhi- dao 10 are selected as the online encyclopedia and the community QA website, respectively. The an- swer extraction module then extract the candidate answers from the retrieved paragraphs, sentences, infobox messages and QA pairs. The answer se- lection is to rank the candidate answers and the top 1 answer is sent to the user as a response. The in- teractive QA is similar to the task completion and they share the common processes of slot normal- ization, slot filling and clarification. An example interactive QA is the weather forecast and inquiry as the weather is related to the date and location. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows the process of the question answer- ing in Benben.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation</head><p>The recommendation in Benben has two func- tions. The first is to satisfy the users' informa- tion need on specific content, such as news. The second is to break the stalemate in conversation.</p><p>Taking the news recommendation as an exam- ple, Benben can respond to the requirement of news reading in some specific topics, such as s- ports, fashion, movie, finance, etc. For example, users say: "Show me the most recent news about movies." as well as they can also say "Once more" to see another movie news. Besides the query- ing mode, when a stalemate is detected during a conversation, Benben will recommend a recent news, according to the user profiling information, by a random alternation to the conversation top- ic transferring to break the stalemate. Note that the news recommendation is also in an interactive way, which means that Benben will ask the user whether he/she wants to read a news of a specific topic in an euphemism way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Response Generation</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the response generation takes the conversation states and the intermedi- ate results as input to generate text or speech re- sponses to users. The filtration, rejection, confir- mation and clarification responses are generated by considering the corresponding states that ob- tained from the conversation state tracking. The transferred topic and recommendation responses are generated to break the stalemate in conversa- tions. It is worth noting that there may be more than one triggered domains in domain selection and processing steps. Therefore, the intermedi- ate results may contain multiple outputs from d- ifferent domains. These outputs are actually the generated responses from the corresponding do- mains. However, in each turn of a conversation, there is only one response that should be respond- ed to users. Hence, the response quality estimation module is proposed to generate a unique response to users. The quality estimation process considers the states, the output confidences and the response qualities of the domains. For example, if the trig- gered probability of QA is higher than other do- mains and the confidence of the generated answer is larger than a threshold, the answer is more like- ly to be a response to users. The module will al- so identify an answer type to check whether the generated answer is matched to the predicted type or not. For example, the expected answer type of the question "When was the Titanic first on?" is "Date". If the QA domain outputs a location or a human name, the answer type is mismatched so that the answer should not be a response to users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Featured Functions of Benben</head><p>Diet Map based Conversation: The diet map is a database that contains the geographical distribu- tion of diet in China. It is constructed by min- ing the location and diet pairs from a microblog service in China, named Sina Weibo. The diet map not only includes the related diet and location information, but also distinguishes the breakfast, lunch, dinner as well as the gender of users. These aspects can be seen as the slots in conversations. Based on the diet map, we develop a function for querying the location specific diet through chat- ting with Benben.</p><p>Implicit Feedback based Conversation: We find that users may express their emotion, opin- ion, sentiment, etc., on the inputs during the con- versation process. These can be seen as the im- plicit feedback from users. We thus explore the implicit feedback in the conversation to optimize the long-term goal of conversation generation and model the implicit feedback as a reward shaping scheme towards a basic reward function in a rein- forcement learning framework.</p><p>Interactive Machine Reading: Given a docu- ment or a paragraph about a specific topic or event, Benben can continuously talk to users about the given content which is our proposed interactive machine reading function. Benben will first reads and understands the given material using the pro- posed approach  and users can ask several factoid questions according to the materi- al content. Note that as these questions are con- text related, there are many anaphora and ellipsis phenomenons. We thus utilize the proposed ap- proaches ( ) for anaphora and zero-anaphora resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Implementation</head><p>There are three implementations of Benben. 1) First is the webpage version for PC or mobile phone(The link is http://iqa.8wss.com/dialogue- test). Users can open the link and type to chat with Benben in Chinese. 2) Second is the Nao robot version. We carry the Benben service in a cloud server and link a Nao robot to the service. Users thus can chat with Benben in speech. The ASR and TTS are implemented by calling the ser- vices from the voice cloud 11 of iFLYTEK 12 . Be- sides the conversation, the Nao robot version can be also controlled by speech instructions of spo- ken language to execute some actions. Please see the video in Youtube <ref type="bibr">13</ref> 3) Third, Benben is also carried in WeChat <ref type="bibr">14</ref> App, which is the most con- venient platform as it allows to chat with Benben in text and speech as well as images and emoticon- s. The quick response (QR) code is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig- ure 7</ref>. Please scan the QR code using the WeChat App and chat with Benben.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present a Chinese conversation- al robot, Benben, which is designed to achieve the goals of chit-chat, task completion, question an- swering and recommendation in human-robot con- versations. In the current version, Benben is im- plemented in three platforms, namely PC, mobile phone and Nao robot. In the future, we plan to ap- ply it to other scenarios such as vehicle, home fur- nishing, toys, etc. Meanwhile, we plan to transfer Benben from Chinese version to English version.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Language</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
