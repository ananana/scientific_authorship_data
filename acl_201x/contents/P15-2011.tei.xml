				<p>Simplification of lexically complex texts, by replacing complex words with their simpler synonyms, helps non-native speakers, children, and language-impaired people understand text better. Recent lexical simplification methods rely on manually simplified corpora, which are expensive and time-consuming to build. We present an unsupervised approach to lexical simplification that makes use of the most recent word vector representations and requires only regular corpora. Results of both automated and human evaluation show that our simple method is as effective as systems that rely on simplified corpora.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Lexical complexity makes text difficult to under- stand for various groups of people: non-native speakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007)</ref>, chil- dren <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(De Belder and Moens, 2010)</ref>, people with intellectual disabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Feng, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Saggion et al., 2015)</ref>, and language-impaired people such as autistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Martos et al., 2012</ref>), aphasic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carroll et al., 1998)</ref>, and dyslexic <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Rello, 2012</ref>) peo- ple. Automatic simplification that replaces com- plex words with their simpler synonyms is thus needed to make texts more understandable for ev- eryone.</p><p>Lexical simplification systems still predomi- nantly use a set of rules for substituting long and infrequent words with their shorter and more fre- quent synonyms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">De Belder and Moens, 2010)</ref>. In generating the substitution rules (i.e., finding simple synonyms of a complex word), most systems refer to lexico-semantic re- sources like WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>. The non- existence of lexicons like WordNet for a vast num- ber of languages diminishes the impact of these simplification methods.</p><p>The emergence of the Simple Wikipedia 1 shifted the focus towards the data-driven ap- proaches to lexical simplification, ranging from unsupervised methods leveraging either the meta- data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yatskar et al., 2010)</ref> or co-occurrence statis- tics of the simplified corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Biran et al., 2011</ref>) to supervised methods learning substitutions from the sentence-aligned corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Horn et al., 2014</ref>). Using simplified corpora improves the simplifica- tion performance, but reduces method applicabil- ity to the few languages for which such corpora exist.</p><p>The research question motivating this work re- lates to achieving comparable simplification per- formance without resorting to simplified corpora or lexicons like WordNet. Observing that "sim- ple" words appear in regular (i.e., "complex", not simplified) text as well, we exploit recent ad- vances in word vector representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) to find suitable simplifications for complex words. We evaluate the performance of our resource-light approach (1) automatically, on two existing lexical simplification datasets and (2) manually, via human judgements of grammatical- ity, simplicity, and meaning preservation. The ob- tained results support the claim that effective lex- ical simplification can be achieved without using simplified corpora.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Systems for lexical simplification are still domi- nantly rule-based, i.e., they rely on a set of sub- stitutions, each consisting of a complex word and its simpler synonym, which are in most cases ap- plied regardless of the context in which the com- plex word appears. Constructing substitution rules involves identifying synonyms, usually in Word-Net, for a predefined set of complex words <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carroll et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bautista et al., 2009)</ref>, and then choosing the "simplest" of these synonyms, typ- ically using some frequency-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">De Belder and Moens, 2010)</ref> or length- based heuristics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bautista et al., 2009</ref>). The main shortcomings of the rule-based systems include low recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(De Belder and Moens, 2010)</ref> and mis- classification of simple words as complex (and vice versa) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Shardlow, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The paradigm shift from knowledge-based to data-driven simplification came with the creation of Simple Wikipedia, which, aligned with the "original" Wikipedia, constitutes a large compara- ble corpus to learn from. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yatskar et al. (2010)</ref> used the edit history of Simple Wikipedia to recognize lexical simplifications. They employed a proba- bilistic model to discern simplification edits from other types of content changes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biran et al. (2011)</ref> presented an unsupervised method for learning substitution pairs from a corpus of comparable texts from Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia, al- though they exploited the (co-)occurrence statis- tics of the simplified corpora rather than its meta- data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Horn et al. (2014)</ref> proposed a supervised framework for learning simplification rules. Using a sentence-aligned simplified corpus, they gener- ated the candidate rules for lexical simplification. A context-aware binary classifier, trained and eval- uated on 500 Wikipedia sentences (annotated via crowdsourcing), then decides whether a candidate rule should be applied or not in a certain context.</p><p>The main limitation of the aforementioned methods is the dependence on simplified corpora and WordNet. In contrast, we propose a resource- light approach to lexical simplification that re- quires only a sufficiently large corpus of regular text, making it applicable to the many languages lacking these resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Resource-Light Lexical Simplification</head><p>At the core of our lexical simplification method, which we name LIGHT-LS, is the observation that "simple" words, besides being frequent in simpli- fied text, are also present in abundance in regu- lar text. This would mean that we can find sim- pler synonyms of complex words in regular cor- pora, provided that reliable methods for measuring (1) the "complexity" of the word and (2) semantic similarity of words are available. LIGHT-LS sim- plifies only single words, but we fully account for this in the evaluation, i.e., LIGHT-LS is penalised for not simplifying multi-word expressions. In this work, we associate word complexity with the com- monness of the word in the corpus, and not with the length of the word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Simplification Candidate Selection</head><p>We employ GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), a state-of-the-art model of distributional lexical se- mantics to obtain vector representations for all corpus words. The semantic similarity of two words is computed as the cosine of the angle be- tween their corresponding GloVe vectors. For each content word (noun, verb, adjective, or ad- verb) w, we select as simplification candidates the top n words whose GloVe vectors are most sim- ilar to that of word w. In all experiments, we used 200-dimensional GloVe vectors pretrained on the merge of the English Wikipedia and Gigaword 5 corpus. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For each content word w, we select n = 10 most similar candidate words, excluding the morphological derivations of w.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Goodness-of-Simplification Features</head><p>We rank the simplification candidates according to several features. Each of the features captures one aspect of the suitability of the candidate word to replace the original word. The following are the descriptions for each of the features. Semantic similarity. This feature is computed as the cosine of the angle between the GloVe vector of the original word and the GloVe vector of the simplification candidate. Context similarity. Since type-based distri- butional lexico-semantic models do not discern senses of polysemous words, considering only se- mantic similarity between the original and can- didate word may lead to choosing a synonym of the wrong sense as simplification of the complex word. The simplification candidates that are syn- onyms of the correct sense of the original word should be more semantically similar to the context of the original word. Therefore, we compute this feature by averaging the semantic similarities of the simplification candidate and each content word from the context of the original word:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">csim(w, c) = 1 |C(w)| w ∈C(w) cos(v w , v w )</formula><p>where C(w) is the set of context words of the orig- inal word w and v w is the GloVe vector of the word w. We use as context a symmetric window of size three around the content word. Difference of information contents. The primary purpose of this feature is to determine whether the simplification candidate is more informative than the original word. Under the hypothesis that the word's informativeness correlates with its com- plexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin and Unthank, 2006</ref>), we choose the candidate which is less informative than the original word. The complexity of the word is es- timated by its information content (ic), computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ic(w ) = − log freq(w) + 1 w ∈C freq(w ) + 1</formula><p>where freq(w ) is the frequency of the word w in a large corpus C, which, in our case, was the Google Book Ngrams corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Michel et al., 2011</ref>). The final feature value is the difference between the information contents of the original word and the simplification candidate, approximating the com- plexity reduction (or gain) that would be intro- duced should the simplification candidate replace the original word. Language model features. The rationale for hav- ing language model features is obvious -a sim- plification candidate is more likely to be a com- patible substitute if it fits into the sequence of words preceding and following the original word. Let w −2 w −1 ww 1 w 2 be the context of the original word w. We consider a simplification candidate c to be a good substitute for w if w −2 w −1 cw 1 w 2 is a likely sequence according to the language model. We employed the Berkeley language model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pauls and Klein, 2011)</ref> </p><note type="other">to compute the likelihoods. Since Berkeley LM contains only bi- grams and trigrams, we retrieve the likelihoods for ngrams w −1 c, cw 1 , w −2 w −1 c, cw 1 w 2 , and w −1 cw 1 , for each simplification candidate c.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Simplification Algorithm</head><p>The overall simplification algorithm is given in Al- gorithm 1. Upon retrieving the simplification can- didates for each content word (line 4), we compute each of the features for each of the simplification candidates (lines 5-8) and rank the candidates ac- cording to feature scores (line 9). We choose as the best candidate the one with the highest aver- age rank over all features (line 12). One impor- tant thing to notice is, that even though LIGHT-LS Algorithm 1: Simplify(tt) 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">subst ← ∅ 2:</formula><p>for each content token t ∈ tt do 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">all ranks ← ∅ 4:</formula><p>scs ← most similar (t) <ref type="bibr">5:</ref> for each feature f do</p><note type="other">6: scores ← ∅ 7: for each sc ∈ scs do 8: scores ← scores ∪ f (sc) 9: rank ← rank numbers(scores) 10:</note><p>all ranks ← all ranks ∪ rank <ref type="bibr">11:</ref> avg rank ← average(all ranks) <ref type="bibr">12:</ref> best ← argmax sc (avg rank ) <ref type="bibr">13:</ref> if ic(best) &lt; ic(tt) do <ref type="bibr">14:</ref> bpos ← in pos(best, pos(tt)) <ref type="bibr">15:</ref> subst ← subst ∪ (tt, bpos) <ref type="bibr">16:</ref> return subst has no dedicated component for deciding whether simplifying a word is necessary, it accounts for this implicitly by performing the simplification only if the best candidate has lower information content than the original word (lines 13-15). Since simplification candidates need not have the same POS tag as the original word, to preserve gram- maticality, we transform the chosen candidate into the morphological form that matches the POS-tag of the original word (line 14) using the NodeBox Linguistics tool. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the effectiveness of LIGHT-LS auto- matically on two different datasets but we also let humans judge the quality of LIGHT-LS's simplifi- cations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Replacement Task</head><p>We first evaluated LIGHT-LS on the dataset crowdsourced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Horn et al. (2014)</ref> where manual simplifications for each target word were collected from 50 people. We used the same three evalua- tion metrics as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Horn et al. (2014)</ref>: (1) precision is the percentage of correct simplifications (i.e., the system simplification was found in the list of man- ual simplifications) out of all the simplifications made by the system; (2) changed is the percentage of target words changed by the system; and (3) ac- curacy is the percentage of correct simplifications out of all words that should have been simplified. LIGHT-LS's performance on this dataset is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> along with the performance of the supervised system by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Horn et al. (2014)</ref> and the unsupervised system by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biran et al. (2011)</ref>, which both used simplified corpora. The results show that LIGHT-LS significantly outperforms the unsupervised system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biran et al. (2011)</ref> and performs comparably to the supervised system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Horn et al. (2014)</ref>, which requires sentence- aligned simplified corpora. The unsupervised sys- tem of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biran et al. (2011)</ref> achieves precision sim- ilar to that of LIGHT-LS but at the cost of chang- ing only about 5% of complex words, which re- sults in very low accuracy. Our method numeri- cally outperforms the supervised method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Horn et al. (2014)</ref>, but the difference is not statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Ranking Task</head><p>We next evaluated LIGHT-LS on the SemEval- 2012 lexical simplification task for English , which focused on ranking a target word (in a context) and three candidate replace- ments, from the simplest to the most complex. To account for the peculiarity of the task where the target word is also one of the simplification can- didates, we modified the features as follows (oth- erwise, an unfair advantage would be given to the target word): (1) we excluded the semantic sim- ilarity feature, and (2) we used the information content of the candidate instead of the difference of information contents.</p><p>We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of can- didates. The performance of LIGHT-LS together with results of the best-performing system (Jauhar and Specia, 2012) from the SemEval-2012 task and two baselines (random and frequency-based) is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. LIGHT-LS significantly out- performs the supervised model by Jauhar and Spe- cia (2012) with p &lt; 0.05, according to the non- parametric stratified shuffling test <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Yeh, 2000</ref>). An interesting observation is that the competitive frequency-based baseline highly correlates with our information content-based feature (the higher the frequency, the lower the information content).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Human Evaluation</head><p>Although automated task-specific evaluations pro- vide useful indications of a method's performance, they are not as reliable as human assessment of simplification quality. In line with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wubben et al., 2012)</ref>, we let human evaluators judge the gram- maticality, simplicity, and meaning preservation of the simplified text. We compiled a dataset of 80 sentence-aligned pairs from Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia and simplified the original sentences with LIGHT-LS and the publicly available system of Biran et al. (2011). We then let two annota- tors (with prior experience in simplification an- notations) grade grammaticality and simplicity for the manual simplification from Simple Wikipedia and simplifications produced by each of the two systems (total of 320 annotations per annotator). We also paired the original sentence with each of the three simplifications (manual and two sys- tems') and let annotators grade how well the sim- plification preserves the meaning of the original sentence (total of 240 annotations per annotator). We averaged the grades of the two annotators for the final evaluation. All grades were assigned on a Likert (1-5) scale, with 5 being the highest grade, i.e., all fives indicate a very simple and completely grammatical sentence which fully preserves the meaning of the original text. The inter-annotator agreement, measured by Pearson correlation coef- ficient, was the highest for grammaticality (0.71), followed by meaning preservation (0.62) and sim- plicity (0.57), which we consider to be a fair agree- ment, especially for inherently subjective notions of simplicity and meaning preservation. The results of human evaluation are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. In addition to grammaticality (Gr), sim- plicity (Smp), and meaning preservation (MP), we measured the percentage of sentences with at least one change made by the system (Ch). The re- sults imply that the sentences produced by LIGHT- Original sentence The contrast between a high level of education and a low level of political rights was particularly great in Aarau, and the city refused to send troops to defend the Bernese border.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Biran et al.

LIGHT-LS simpl.</p><p>The contrast between a high level of education and a low level of political rights was especially great in Aarau, and the city asked to send troops to protect the Bernese border.  <ref type="formula">(2011)</ref> produces sentences which preserve meaning bet- ter than the sentences produced by LIGHT-LS, but this is merely because their system performs no simplifications in over 80% of sentences, which is something that we have already observed on the replacement task evaluation. Furthermore, annota- tors found the sentences produced by this system to be more complex than the original sentences. On the contrary, LIGHT-LS simplifies almost 70% of sentences, producing significantly simpler text while preserving grammaticality and, to a large ex- tent, the original meaning. In order to allow for a more revealing com- parison of the two systems, we additionally eval- uated each of the systems only on sentences on which they proposed at least one simplification (in 70% of sentences for LIGHT-LS and in only 17.5% of sentences for the system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biran et al. (2011)</ref>). These results, shown in the last two rows of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, demonstrate that, besides simplicity and grammaticality, LIGHT-LS also performs bet- ter in terms of meaning preservation. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> we show the output of both systems for one of the few example sentences in which both systems made at least one change.</p><p>Since LIGHT-LS obtained the lowest average grade for meaning preservation, we looked deeper into the causes of changes in meaning introduced by LIGHT-LS. Most changes in meaning stem from the inability to discern synonymy from relat- edness (or even antonymy) using GloVe vectors. For example, the word "cool" was the best simpli- fication candidate found by LIGHT-LS for the tar- get word "warm" in the sentence "Water temper- atures remained warm enough for development".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We presented LIGHT-LS, a novel unsupervised approach to lexical simplification that, unlike ex- isting methods, does not rely on Simple Wikipedia and lexicons like WordNet, which makes it ap- plicable in settings where such resources are not available. With the state-of-the-art word vec- tor representations at its core, LIGHT-LS requires nothing but a large regular corpus to perform lexi- cal simplifications.</p><p>Three different evaluation settings have shown that LIGHT-LS's simplifications based on multiple features (e.g., information content reduction, con- textual similarity) computed on regular corpora lead to performance comparable to that of systems using lexicons and simplified corpora.</p><p>At the moment, LIGHT-LS supports only single-word simplifications but we plan to extend it to support multi-word expressions. Other lines of future research will focus on binding LIGHT-LS with methods for syntax-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhu et al., 2010)</ref> and content-based (Glavaš andŠtajnerandˇandŠtajner, 2013) text simplification.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="true"><head>Table 1 : Performance on the replacement task</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Model
