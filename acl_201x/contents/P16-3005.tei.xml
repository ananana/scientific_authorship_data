				<p>Works on Twitter community detection have yielded new ways to extract valuable insights from social media. Through this technique, Twitter users can be grouped into different types of communities such as those who have the same interests, those who interact a lot, or those who have similar sentiments about certain topics. Computationally, information is represented as a graph, and community detection is the problem of partitioning the graph such that each community is more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. It has been shown that incorporating sentiment analysis can improve community detection when looking for sentiment-based communities. However , such works only perform sentiment analysis in isolation without considering the tweet&apos;s various contextual information. Examples of these contextual information are social network structure, and conversational , author, and topic contexts. Disregarding these information poses a problem because at times, context is needed to clearly infer the sentiment of a tweet. Thus, this research aims to improve detection of sentiment-based communities on Twitter by performing contextual sentiment analysis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Twitter, as a micro-blogging platform, has become an avenue for people to voice out their opinions online. This gives concerned entities, like policy- makers or brand managers, the chance to hear peo- ple out in an unprecedented way. However, to effectively utilize this source of information, the massive amount of tweets must first be processed to be more easily understood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kavanaugh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>One such way to achieve this is through com- munity detection, which is a domain-independent, graph-based problem that can be applied to many different disciplines including social media analy- sis. Its definition is that it is the problem of looking for groups of vertices that are more densely con- nected to each other than to the rest of the graph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Papadopoulos et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tang and Liu, 2010)</ref>. Hence, due to its domain-independence, setting up the input graph properly according to the desired application is important ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darmon et al., 2014</ref>). When applied to Twitter, a wide array of commu- nities can be found, such as communities of users with similar interests ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lim and Datta, 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lim and Datta, 2012a</ref>), communities of users who in- teract frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amor et al., 2015</ref>), communities of geographically-nearby users ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al., 2015)</ref>, or communities of users with similar sen- timents towards a certain topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cao et al., 2015</ref>), among many other possibilities.</p><p>Finding these communities can yield insights like (1) the different kinds of conversations going on, (2) who participates in them, and (3) what they are talking about. These kinds of insights could be valuable to entities such as policy-makers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amor et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, most works on Twitter community detection are focused on finding communities within social networks based on explicit relation- ships between users, such as following-follower relationships ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Java et al., 2007)</ref>, or mention/re- tweet relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pearce et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al., 2012</ref>). An often-overlooked source of infor- mation are the actual contents of the users' tweets. In some cases, this may not be important. But when looking for communities of users who share similar sentiments, this could potentially improve community detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Deitrick and Hu, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deitrick and Hu (2013)</ref> utilized sentiment analysis to improve community detec- tion. In addition to the usual graph edges rep- resenting follower-following relations, they added more edge weights between users who expressed the same sentiments towards the same topic. That is, whenever two users tweet with the same sen- timent polarity (positive or negative) containing the same hashtag (treated as the topic), their edge weight is incremented, indicating a stronger rela- tionship between these users. They showed that doing this technique improves community detec- tion according to the modularity score, and this in turn, facilitates better sentiment analysis.</p><p>However, works like that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deitrick and Hu (2013)</ref> perform sentiment analysis of a tweet in an isolated manner. That is, various contextual in- formation available for a tweet are totally disre- garded. Examples of these include conversational (tweets preceding the target tweet in the conver- sation thread), author (tweets recently posted by the author preceding the target tweet) and topic (recent tweets about the same topic posted before the target tweet) context <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ren et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vanzo et al., 2014)</ref>. Another example of contextual information is social network structure, wherein connections between users help determine senti- ment polarities by utilizing social theories such as balance theory ("an enemy of my enemy is my friend") and homophily ("birds of the same feather flock together") ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">West et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tan et al., 2011</ref>). The aforementioned studies have shown that incorporating contextual information can im- prove sentiment analysis.</p><p>Thus, in looking for sentiment-based Twitter communities wherein there are stronger connec- tions between users having similar sentiments, it may be beneficial to take a contextual approach to sentiment analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Twitter Community Detection</head><p>This section compares and contrasts different works on Twitter community detection. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> is a summary of all reviewed works and a compar- ison of these works in terms of desired community type and edge construction scheme. The commu- nity detection algorithms and evaluation metrics used by these works are also discussed in this sec- tion.</p><p>It can be observed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Twitter Community Detection Works and their Desired Community Types, and Edge Con- struction Scheme search works aimed to identify different types of communities. These communities are: (1) so- cial network-based (who are in the same social groups?), (2) interaction-based (who frequently interact with each other through re-tweets and mentions?), (3) topic-based (who talk about the same things?), and (4) sentiment-based (who feel the same way about certain topics?).</p><p>It is important to note the different types of communities the works aimed to extract, because they largely influence how the community detec- tion problem is set-up. Since community detection is a domain-independent problem that applies to any graph structure, performing Twitter commu- nity detection requires that relevant information be represented appropriately through the vertices and edges in a graph. With the input graph laid out, researchers can then select appropriate com- munity detection algorithms to be used. Lastly, researchers can then choose appropriate metrics for evaluating their approach. These three aspects are discussed in more detail in the following sub- sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Edge Construction</head><p>As previously mentioned, the desired community types largely influence the representation of in- formation as a graph, consisting of vertices and edges. Although in theory this might not always be the case, most reviewed works used vertices to represent users, and consequently, edges to rep- resent relationships between the users. The works only differed in terms of what kind of relationships the edges represented.</p><p>For works that aimed to identify social groups, that is, communities of people who generally fol- lowed each other within their own communities, edges have generally been used to represent a "fol- low" relationship ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amor et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lim and Datta, 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lim and Datta, 2012a</ref>). On Twit- ter, users "follow" other users to "subscribe" to their tweets and be able to see them as they get published. It is important to note that the "follow" relationship is not necessarily two-way. That is, if user A follows user B, it is possible that user B does not follow user A. Given the explicit "fol- low" relationships on Twitter, some works have represented "follow" networks on Twitter in a straightforward manner by using directed edges to represent these "follow" relationships. As dis- cussed earlier, the goal of these works is usu- ally to find social groups or cliques within the graph that represent social circles (since people who are friends in real life tend to follow each other) or people with similar interests (since peo- ple also follow users they may not know person- ally, but whom they are interested in). This type of edge construction, since it is straightforward and based on explicit "follow" relationships, is usually used in combination with other edge construction schemes, wherein the "follow" relationships deter- mine the existence of edges, while other informa- tion are used to increment edge weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Deitrick and Hu, 2013</ref>).</p><p>For works that aimed to identify communities of people that interacted with each other frequently, main relationships involved are the "re-tweet" and "mention" relationships ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amor et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darmon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al., 2015)</ref>. When user A re-tweets a tweet by user B, user A is essen- tially re-publishing the said tweet and propagating it to his/her own followers. On the other hand, a mention happens when user A tags user B in a tweet. This either happens when user A simply wants to call user B's attention to his/her tweet, or when user A is replying to one of user B's tweets. Note that it is possible for users to mention multi- ple users in a single tweet. Having said that, men- tions or re-tweets between users have been used to either increment existing edge weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amor et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darmon et al., 2014)</ref>, or to establish the existence of new edges altogether ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al., 2015</ref>) in works that sought interaction-based communities. An example of such a work is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amor et al. (2015)</ref>, where they found what they called conversation communities: groups of con- versations with people talking about a topic of in- terest.</p><p>For works that aimed to identify communities of people who were interested in similar top- ics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darmon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deitrick and Hu, 2013)</ref>, hashtags have been used to establish or strengthen edges between users. Hashtags are a way for Twitter users to tag their tweet as talking about a certain topic. These are arbitrarily defined and purely user-generated tags in the form '#hashtag'. Users sometimes tend to copy other hashtags instead of creating their own, resulting into popular, trending hashtags. With this in mind, the idea of topic-based community detec- tion is to look for communities of users who talk about similar topics identified through the hash-tags. For example, if user A tweets with the hash- tag '#ClimateChange', and user B also tweets with the same hashtag, then either more weight is added to an existing edge between them ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darmon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deitrick and Hu, 2013)</ref>, or a new edge be- tween the users is created on this basis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>For works that aimed to identify communities of people sharing similar sentiments, the idea is to establish stronger relationships between users who feel the same sentiment polarity toward the same topic (identified through the hashtag) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deitrick and Hu, 2013)</ref>. For example, if user A tweets "We are in a bad situation. #Cli- mateChange" and user B tweets "Our world is dy- ing. #ClimateChange", then user A and user B's edge should be added more weight because their tweets both express negative sentiments about cli- mate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Deitrick and Hu, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, different community types warrant different edge construction schemes. However, it is important to note that works on Twitter commu- nity detection do not necessarily utilize just one of the aforementioned schemes. Rather, researchers oftentimes experiment with and combine differ- ent edge construction and weighting schemes to see which configuration produces the best output ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deitrick and Hu, 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Algorithms</head><p>The reviewed works on community detection have used a variety of algorithms, each being appro- priate to different scenarios or constraints. For example, some of the algorithms can handle di- rected and weighted graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Xie, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lancichinetti et al., 2011</ref>), while some can detect overlapping communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Xie, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lancichinetti et al., 2011</ref>), while some execute relatively quickly for large graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Xie, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008)</ref>. These are examples of factors that the researchers took into consideration when choosing their algorithms. A more detailed discussion of each work follows.</p><p>Deitrick and Hu (2013) chose the Speaker Listener Propagation Algorithm, or SLPA, (Xie, 2012) and the Infomap algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008)</ref> for community detection as they both work with weighted and directed graphs, and they both execute relatively quickly on large graphs. In addition, SLPA can identify overlap- ping communities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darmon et al. (2014)</ref> chose the Order Statistics Local Optimization Method, or OSLOM, (Lanci- chinetti et al., 2011) for community detection be- cause of its ability to work with weighted and di- rected graphs, and its ability to identify overlap- ping communities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al. (2015)</ref> chose the Fast-Greedy Optimization of Modularity, or FGM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Clauset et al., 2004</ref>) for its ability to handle complex social graphs from Twitter, and the Varied Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, or VDBSCAN, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liu et al., 2007)</ref> for its ability to ob- tain spatial clusters at certain points in time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amor et al. (2015)</ref> chose the Markov Stability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Delvenne et al., 2010</ref>) due to its mechanism of modeling information flow. The primary goal of their research was to understand the Twitter dis- cussion on the care.data program in terms of infor- mation flow and the roles that Twitter users play. Hence, their selection of Markov Stability fits their goals.</p><p>Lastly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cao et al. (2015)</ref> chose to use Heirar- chical Agglomerative Clustering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jain and Dubes, 1988</ref>) based on sentiment distance. Since they were focused on looking for communities with similar sentiments, the clustering method is appro- priate for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Evaluation</head><p>To evaluate their approaches, researchers of re- lated works have used quantitative and/or quali- tative analysis. Quantitative analysis usually en- tails optimizing some metric, like the well-known modularity score <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Newman, 2006</ref>), which indi- cates how well-formed the communities are as op- posed to randomly generated communities. Other works have also performed experiments in which they pre-determined the communities beforehand, treating the community detection problem as a "classification" problem of placing vertices in their proper communities. As such, these works have used precision and recall to evaluate their ap- proach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakillah et al., 2015)</ref>. However, the man- ual pre-determination of communities beforehand can be a difficult task, so this kind of evaluation methodology is not too popular, making metric optimization as the more common evaluation ap- proach. Exact numerical results of these studies are not discussed here because direct comparison of results is not appropriate due to differences in datasets and types of communities being detected.  On the other hand, researchers also use quali- tative analyses in the form of case studies. Usu- ally, this comes in the form of a discussion on the insights acquired from the community detec- tion approach. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amor et al. (2015)</ref> discussed in their work how their approach was able to reveal insights into who were concerned about the care.data program in the UK (political activists, media, UK healthcare professionals, and US healthcare professionals) and what they were concerned about (data privacy, impact on patient welfare, etc). Other works like that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cao et al. (2015)</ref> also involved interviewing domain experts and asking them to evaluate whether community detection results would be useful to them or others in the field whose tasks involve analyzing social media data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Contextual Sentiment Analysis</head><p>This section compares and contrasts different works on Contextual Sentiment Analysis. Shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> is a summary of reviewed works and a comparison of these works in terms of level of sen- timent analysis and context types considered. The algorithms and evaluation metrics used by these works are also discussed in the section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sentiment Analysis Types</head><p>It can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> that for the reviewed works, there are two levels of sentiment analy- sis: document-level and person-level. A docu- ment is essentially a collection of sentences. In the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ren et al. (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vanzo et al. (2014), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tan et al. (2011)</ref>, having Twitter as the domain, a document refers to a tweet. While in the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">West et al. (2014)</ref> with Wikipedia discussions and US Congress speeches as the domain, a docu- ment refers to a person's post and speech respec- tively. Document-level sentiment analysis usually involves utilizing lexical information found in the text.</p><p>On the other hand, person-level sentiment anal- ysis focuses on determining the overall sentiment of a person towards a particular person on topic, as opposed to focusing on each individual docu- ment a person generates. For example, say it is desirable to determine user A's sentiment towards Obama based on his/her tweets. Person-level sen- timent analysis would then require consideration of all user A's tweets about Obama, instead of just determining the conveyed sentiment in each tweet. For most related works, document-level sentiment analysis is performed as a sub-task of person-level sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(West et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tan et al., 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Context Types</head><p>In addition to using textual information for senti- ment analysis, the reviewed works utilized a vari- ety of contextual information. The principle is that these provide more knowledge needed to perform more accurate sentiment analysis.</p><p>For document-level sentiment analysis (tweet- level in this case), context types used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ren et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vanzo et al. (2014)</ref> are conversa- tional, author and topic. Having Twitter as the domain, conversational context was defined as the most recent l tweets preceeding a target tweet in the conversation it belongs to. Author context was defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ren et al. (2016)</ref> as the most recent l tweets posted by a user before the target tweet. Lastly, topic context was defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ren et al. (2016)</ref> as the most recent l tweets posted before the target tweet that shares at least one hashtag with the target tweet. The rationale is that the tex- tual information found in a single tweet may be ambiguous, and thus, insufficient to clearly deter- mine its sentiment polarity. Therefore, taking into account the aforementioned contexts can fill in the said gap.</p><p>For person-level sentiment analysis, social net-work structure has been used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">West et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tan et al. (2011)</ref> as contextual information. These works rely on theories about social behavior such as balance theory ("an enemy of my enemy is my friend") and homophily ("birds of the same feather flock together") to complement document- level sentiment analysis based on the document text. The idea is that information gained from people's connections or interactions can help de- termine a person's sentiment towards a topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Tan et al., 2011</ref>) or another user <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(West et al., 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Metholodgy</head><p>Ren et al. <ref type="formula">(2016)</ref>, with document-level sentiment analysis as the goal, represented words found in the target tweet and in contextual tweets (conver- sational, author, and topic, as explained in the previous sub-section) through word embeddings. They then train a convolutional neural network to classify the target tweet's sentiment polarity given these input features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vanzo et al. (2014)</ref>, with document-level senti- ment analysis as the goal, use a Markovian for- mulation of the Support Vector Machine model to classify a target tweet given the preceding tweets in its conversational context. They repre- sent tweets through bag of words, a distributed lexical semantic model, a user sentiment incli- nation profile, and various combinations of these three. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">West et al. (2014)</ref>, with person-level sentiment analysis (towards another person) as the goal, use a scheme they call "triangle balance" in which they minimize a cost function that applies penalties for going against the sentiment model and for going against the social theories they used. The set- ting of cost parameters was done through machine learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tan et al. (2011)</ref>, with person-level sentiment analysis (towards a topic) as the goal, use a factor- graph model for estimating the probability of each polarity for a given person. They experiment on learning and no-learning approaches in setting the necessary parameters.</p><p>Since the determination of sentiment polarities is generally a classification problem, most of the reviewed works evaluated their results through metrics common to classification tasks like preci- sion, recall, F-measure, accuracy, and ROC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>Based on the review of related works, it can be seen that the desired community types largely dic- tate the edge construction scheme used in the in- put graphs. Furthermore, it has been shown that using sentiment analysis to modify edge weights when performing community detection can im- prove the detection of sentiment-based communi- ties <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Deitrick and Hu, 2013</ref>). The idea is that users who feel the same about a particular topic should have a stronger connection.</p><p>However, one possible improvement over the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Deitrick and Hu, 2013</ref>) is to perform contextual sentiment analysis. This is because various contextual information, such as conversa- tional, author, and topic context, along with social network structure, have been shown to improve sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ren et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vanzo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">West et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tan et al., 2011</ref>). The assumption is that the improvement in sentiment analysis will improve the modification of edge weights (and therefore, the representation of con- nection between users) and consequently, improve sentiment-based community detection. Evalua- tion can be through quantitative analysis by using well-known metrics in community detection, such as modularity, or through qualitative analysis by performing case studies. Analysis of the results can provide insight on which contextual informa- tion provide the most improvement in the task of sentiment-based community detection on Twitter.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2" validated="false"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Contextual Sentiment Analysis Works
