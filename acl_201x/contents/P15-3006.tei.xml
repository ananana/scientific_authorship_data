				<p>We have constructed two research resources of Japanese lexical simplification. One is a simplification system that supports reading comprehension of a wide range of readers, including children and language learners. The other is a dataset for evaluation that enables open discussions with other systems. Both the system and the dataset are made available providing the first such resources for the Japanese language.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Lexical simplification is a technique that substi- tutes a complex word or phrase in a sentence with a simpler synonym. This technique supports the reading comprehension of a wide range of read- ers, including children <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Belder and Moens, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kajiwara et al., 2013</ref>) and language learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Eom et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Moku et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The recent years have seen a great activity in this field of inquiry, especially for English: At the SemEval-2012 workshop, many systems were par- ticipating in the English lexical simplification task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Specia et al., 2012)</ref>, for which also an evalua- tion dataset was constructed. Other resources for statistical learning of simplified rules were built, drawing on the Simple English Wikipedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Horn et al., 2014</ref>), e.g. several paral- lel corpora aligning standard and simple English ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kauchak, 2013)</ref> 1,2 and eval- uation datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Specia et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Belder and Moens, 2012)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> .</p><p>On the other hand, there have been no published resources on Japanese lexical simplification so far.</p><p>Such resources had to be created and made pub- lic, for the sake of readers in need of reading as- sistance, as well as to accelerate the research on this topic. Therefore, we have constructed and published a Japanese lexical simplification system (SNOW S3) and a dataset for evaluation of the sys- tem (SNOW E4). These resources are available at the following URL:</p><p>http://www.jnlp.org/SNOW</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Previous Work</head><p>Two datasets for evaluation of English lexical simplification have been published. Both were constructed by transforming a lexical substitution dataset, which was constructed in an English lex- ical substitution task of <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2007 workshop (McCarthy and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Navigli, 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">McCarthy Substitution Dataset</head><p>The English lexical substitution task of SemEval- 2007 requires that the system finds words or phrases that one can substitute for the given target word in the given content. These target words are content words, and their details are shown in <ref type="table">Table  1</ref>. These contexts are selected from the English In- ternet Corpus, which is a balanced and web-based corpus of English <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Sharoff, 2006</ref>). This dataset consists of 2,010 sentences, 201 target words each with 10 sentences as contexts. Five annotators who are native English speakers proposed at most three appropriate substitutions for each of the tar- get words within their contexts. When an appro- priate paraphrasable word did not occur, the anno- tator propose paraphrasable phrases.</p><p>An example from this dataset is provided be- low. As a paraphrase of the adjective "bright" in this context, three annotators proposed "intelli- gent", another three annotators proposed "clever", and one annotator proposed "smart".</p><p>Context: During the siege, G. Robertson had ap-</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Specia Simplification Dataset</head><p>The English lexical simplification task of SemEval-2012 requires that the system ranks the target word and its several paraphrases according to how simple they are in the context. Simple means that the word is easy to understand for many people, including children and non-natives. This dataset was annotated by fluent but non- native English speakers (college freshmen). The Trial dataset used four annotators, and the Test dataset used five annotators. These annotators ranked target words and their several paraphrases according to how simple they were in contexts from the lexical substitution dataset described in Section 2.1. Next, the ranks received from each annotator were integrated into the dataset. Finally, the gold-standard annotations were generated by averaging the annotations from all annotators.</p><p>An example from this dataset is provided below. When the following ranking was obtained from four annotators in a context, the ranks of "clear" were 1, 2, 1, 4, and the average rank was 2. Sim- ilarly, the average rank of each word calculated. Thus, the rank of "light" is 3.25, that of "bright" is 2.5, that of "luminous" is 4, and that of "well-lit" is 3.25. The final integrated ranking is obtained by rearranging the average ranks of these words in the ascending order, as shown below.</p><p>1: {clear}{light}{bright}{luminous}{well-lit} 2: {well-lit}{clear}{light}{bright}{luminous} 3: {clear}{bright}{light}{luminous}{well-lit} 4: {bright}{well-lit}{luminous}{clear}{light} Gold: {clear}{bright}{light,well-lit}{luminous}</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">De Belder Simplification Dataset</head><p>De Belder and Moens (2012) also created a simpli- fication dataset. They deleted enough simple tar- get words included in the Basic English combined word list 5 from the lexical substitution dataset de- scribed in the Section 2.1 at first. As a result of deleting, the number of target words narrowed down from 201 to 43. Five annotators ranked these 43 target words and their several paraphrases ac- cording to how simple they were in the context.</p><p>These annotators were recruited using the Ama- zon Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . De Belder and Moens re- quested annotators who were located in the U.S. and had completed at least 95% of their previous assignments correctly.</p><p>In the end, the rank from each annotator was in- tegrated into the dataset. In this dataset, the noisy channel model was used in order to take account of the rank and reliability of each annotator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Constructing Japanese Lexical Substitution Dataset</head><p>We have constructed a dataset for evaluation of Japanese lexical simplification. First, a Japanese lexical substitution dataset was constructed using the same method as McCarthy and Navigli (2007).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Selecting Target Words</head><p>We define target words as the list of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) that are common to two Japanese word dictionaries (IPADIC-2.7.0 7 and JUMANDIC-7.0 8 ) in order to select the standard target words at first. Next, the following words were deleted from these words.</p><p>• Words that are already simple enough • Words that have no substitutions • Words that are a part of a compound word • Words that are a part of an idiomatic phrase • Low frequency words</p><p>We define simple words as words in Basic Vo- cabulary to <ref type="bibr">Learn (Kai and Matsukawa, 2002</ref>), which is a receptive vocabulary for elementary school students. Words that are not registered</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P p 1 ,p 2 2P p 1 \p 2 p 1 [p 2 |P | (1) P j (rank i (w j ) rank i )(rank ave (w j ) rank ave ) q P j (rank i (w j ) rank i ) 2 P j (rank ave (w j ) rank ave ) 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>in SNOW D2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Yamamoto and Yoshikura, 2013)</ref> are defined as words that have no substitutions. Low frequency words are defined as words that occurred less than 10 times over the 15 years in Japanese newspapers 9 .</p><p>In the end, 250 words (nouns and verbs 75 each, adjectives and adverbs 50 each) were chosen as a target words at random.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Providing Paraphrases</head><p>An annotator provided several paraphrases for each target word in 10 contexts. These contexts were randomly selected from newspaper article. When providing a paraphrase, an annotator could refer to a dictionary but was not supposed to ask the other annotators for an opinion. When an an- notator could not think of a paraphrase, they were permitted to supply no entry.</p><p>Five annotators for every fifty sentences were recruited using crowdsourcing service <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . On av- erage, each of these annotators contributed 5.38 paraphrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Merging All Annotations</head><p>Each annotator's result was evaluated, and all the results were merged into one dataset. Five new annotators for every fifty sentences were recruited through the crowdsourcing service. We adopted the paraphrases that more than three annotators rated appropriate by answering the question, "Is this paraphrase appropriate?" in the affirmative. When an annotator rated a paraphrase as inappro- priate, they were shown the following two criteria. An average of 4.50 lexical paraphrases were ac- cepted. However, 170 sentences (17 target words) that all paraphrases have been evaluated to be in- appropriate were discarded.</p><p>Since we have sets of paraphrases for each tar- get word and annotator, pairwise agreement was calculated between each pair of sets (p 1 , p 2 2 P ) from each possible pairing (P ) according to the Equation (1), following previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(McCarthy and Navigli, 2007)</ref>. Inter-annotator agree- ment is 66.4%.</p><p>An English translation of an example from the dataset is provided below. As a paraphrase of the noun "appeal" in this context, one annotator proposed "advocate", another annotator proposed "exert", and three annotators proposed "promote".</p><p>Context: You can appeal for proud batting power. Gold-Standard: advocate 1; promote 3; exert 1;</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Ranking Paraphrases</head><p>These target words and their several paraphrases were ranked according to how simple they were in the context from the dataset that we built (as discussed in Section 3) in order to transform it into a dataset for evaluation of lexical simplification. The same annotators as those mentioned in section 3.3 worked on this task. Finally, the total number of annotators is 500. Some 250 annotators provided paraphrases, others evaluated and ranked these paraphrases.</p><p>Inter-annotator agreement was calculated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, follow- ing previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Belder and Moens, 2012</ref>). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is defined as in the Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2)</ref>, where rank i is the average rank of the words given by annotator i. To extend this equation to one annotator versus other anno- tators, we define the rank assigned by the rank ave to be the average of the ranks given by the other annotators. This agreement is 33.2% 11 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Merging All Rankings</head><p>All annotators' work results were merged into one dataset. The rank of each word was decided based all % noun % verb % adj % adv % 1. # context pairs 10,485 -2,835 -3,240 -2,250 -2,160 - 2. # <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1. with same list  1,593 15  789 28  348 11  168  7  288 13  3. # 2. with different rankings  948 60  344 44  262 75  129 77  213 74  4. # 3. with different top word  463 49  214 62  130 50  51 40  68 32   Table 2</ref>: Context dependency ratio on the average of the rank from each annota- tor, following the previous research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Specia et al., 2012)</ref>. The same rank is assigned to words that have the same average. In this study, the same annotator performed both the evaluation of para- phrases and their ranking. Therefore, any word that an annotator judged as an inappropriate para- phrase was not ranked. The minimum rank is as- signed to these words that were not ranked at the time of the calculation of the average rank. An English translation of an example from the dataset is provided below. When the following ranking was obtained from five annotators in a context, the ranks of "appeal" were 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, and the average rank was 2.2. Similarly, the aver- age rank of "promote" is 2.2, that of "advocate" is 2.6, and that of "exert" is 3. The final inte- grated ranking is obtained by rearranging the av- erage ranks of these words in the ascending order.</p><p>1: {appeal}{promote}{advocate}{exert} 2: {advocate}{appeal}{promote}{exert} 3: {promote}{exert}{advocate} #appeal 4: {exert}{appeal}{advocate}{promote} 5: {promote}{appeal}{advocate} #exert Gold: {appeal, promote}{advocate}{exert}</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Properties of the dataset</head><p>In 1,616 (69.4%) of the sentences, a target word can be replaced by one or more simpler words. In 420 (18.0%) of the cases, there is also one or more words that are equally complex. In 1,945 (83.5%) of the cases, there are words that are more com- plex. The average number of substitutions is 5.50. The average number of levels of difficulty is 4.94. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows how the relative simplicity of the target words and their paraphrases is context de- pendent. Only 15.2% of all context-pairs which share the target word have the same list of para- phrases. This shows that the meaning of many tar- get words changed slightly in different contexts. In addition, 59.5% of combinations with the same list of paraphrases have different ranks of diffi- culty. This shows that the difficulty of a word <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>: Outline of lexical simplification system also changes slightly in different contexts. Among these, 48.8% is even different in the simplest word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Constructing Japanese Lexical Simplification System</head><p>We have also constructed a lexical simplification system using four typical mechanisms of lexical simplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Shardlow, 2014)</ref> shown in Figure1. We expect the standard system to be used as a baseline of Japanese lexical simplification. We also expect that the system can support the read- ing comprehension of a wide range of readers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Identification of Complex Words</head><p>An input sentence is first analyzed by the Japanese morphological analyzers MeCab-0.993 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kudo et al., 2004</ref>) <ref type="bibr">12</ref> and IPADIC-2.7.0, and content words that are not included in the list of simple words are extracted as complex words. These complex words are not part of a compound word or an id- iomatic phrase. In this study, simple words are defined as the Basic Vocabulary to Learn; compound words are defined as the lists of entries from Japanese Wikipedia <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and the Compound Verb Lexicon 14 ; finally, idiomatic phrases are defined as the list of Japanese idiomatic phrases made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Sato (2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Substitution Generation</head><p>Several paraphrases are enumerated as candidates of a simple word for each complex word. These lexical paraphrases were selected from several Japanese lexical paraphrasing databases such as SNOW D2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Yamamoto and Yoshikura, 2013</ref>), Precision Recall F-measure 0.89 0.08 0.15 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Performance of the system Noun Verb Adjective Adverb 62 65 3 0  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kajiwara and Yamamoto, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Word Sense Disambiguation</head><p>If, given the context of the sentence, the list of suggested paraphrases for a complex word con- tains words that are improper in this context, these improper paraphrases are removed from the list. An input sentence receives a predicate-argument structure analysis using the Japanese predicate- argument structure analyzer SynCha-0.3 (Iida and Poesio, 2011) 17 , and the predicate (verb or adjec- tive), the arguments (nouns) and grammatical rela- tions (case makers such as "ga (subject)", "o (ob- ject)", "ni (indirect object)") are extracted as a set of the form {predicate, relation, argument}.</p><p>Either the predicate or one of the arguments is identified as a complex word. A list is of candidate substitutions is generated for that word, followed by a list of sets of the form {predicate, relation, argument}, where the candidate substitutions are used instead of the complex word (so there will be as many of these sets as there are candidate sub- stitutions). These new sets are checked against the Kyoto University Case Frame <ref type="bibr">18</ref> . If the set is found there, the candidate substitution counts as a legiti- mate substitution; if the set is not found, the candi- date substitution is not counted as a legitimate sub- stitution. Kyoto University Case Frame is the list of predicate and argument pairs that have a case relationship, and it is built automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006</ref>) from Web texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Synonym Ranking</head><p>All candidate words are given a degree of diffi- culty. The simplest word is used to replace the complex word in the input sentence, and the out- put sentence is generated.</p><p>In this study, Lexical Properties of Japanese <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amano and Kondo, 2000</ref>) is used for determin- ing the degree of difficulty. <ref type="bibr">15</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Evaluation of the System by the Dataset</head><p>The performance of the lexical simplification sys- tem that was discussed in this section is estimated using the evaluation dataset that was constructed as discussed in Section 4. The performance of the system is shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. In 146 sentences, the system converted a target word into another word; in 130 sentences, that output word was sim- pler than the target word defined by the evaluation dataset appropriately. In addition, the system con- verted 652 words in total, but only 146 words of these were the target words.</p><p>The details as to the parts of speech of the target words that got simplified appropriately are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 4</ref>. The system simplifies only the pred- icates and arguments extracted by the predicate- argument structure analysis. However, adverbs are not simplified since they are included in neither predicates nor arguments. In addition, an adjective may become a predicate, but it may also become part of a noun phrase by modifying a noun. The system simplifies only predicate adjectives.</p><p>An English translation of an example of several system outputs is provided below.</p><p>• It is {distributed -&gt; dealt} to a {caller -&gt; visitor} from foreign countries.</p><p>• {Principal -&gt; President} Takagi of the bank presented an idea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Final Remarks</head><p>We built a Japanese lexical simplification system and a dataset for evaluation of Japanese lexical simplification. Subsequently, we have published these resources on the Web. The system can support the reading comprehen- sion of a wide range of readers, including children and language learners. Since we have developed a standard system, we expect the system to be used as a baseline system of lexical simplification.</p><p>Furthermore, the dataset enables us to figure out system performance. This solves the problems of cost and reproducibility associated with the con- ventional manual evaluation and accelerates re- search on this topic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A paraphrase is inappropriate if the sentence becomes unnatural as a result of the substi- tution of this paraphrase for the target word. 2.
