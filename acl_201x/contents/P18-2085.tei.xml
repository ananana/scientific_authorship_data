				<p>We report an empirical study on the task of negation scope extraction given the negation cue. Our key observation is that certain useful information such as features related to negation cue, long distance dependencies as well as some latent structural information can be exploited for such a task. We design approaches based on conditional random fields (CRF), semi-Markov CRF, as well as latent-variable CRF models to capture such information. Extensive experiments on several standard datasets demonstrate that our approaches are able to achieve better results than existing approaches reported in the literature.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Negation is an important linguistic phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Morante and Sporleder, 2012)</ref>, which reverts the assertion associated with a proposition. Broadly speaking, the part of the sentence being negated is called negation scope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Huddleston et al., 2002</ref>). Automatic negation scope detection is a vital but challenging task that has various applications in areas such as text mining ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Szarvas et al., 2008)</ref>, and sentiment analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wiegand et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Councill et al., 2010</ref>). Negation scope detection task commonly involves a negation cue which can be one of the following 3 types -either a single word (e.g., not), affixes (e.g., im-, -less) or multi- ple words (e.g., no longer) expressing negation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> presents two real examples for such a task, where the first example involves discontin- uous negation scope of an affix cue. The second example shows a discontinuous negation cue and its corresponding discontinuous negation scope.</p><p>Most existing approaches tackled the negation scope detection problem from a boundary detec- He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came .</p><p>There is neither money nor credit in it , and yet one would wish to tidy it up . tion perspective, aiming to identify whether each word token in the sentence belongs to the nega- tion scope or not. To perform sequence labeling, various approaches have been proposed based on models such as support vector machines (SVMs) (with heuristic rules) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">de Albornoz et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Packard et al., 2014</ref>), condi- tional random fields (CRF) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lapponi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chowdhury and Mahbub, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">White, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zou et al., 2015</ref>) and neural networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fancellu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Qian et al., 2016</ref>). These models typically either make use of external resources for extract- ing complex syntax and grammar features, or are based on neural architectures such as long short- term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract automatic fea- tures.</p><p>We observe that there are some useful fea- tures that can be explicitly and implicitly captured and modelled in the learning process for negation scope extraction. We use the term partial scope to refer to a continuous text span that is part of dis- continuous scope, and use the term gap to refer to the text span between two pieces of partial scope.</p><p>From the first example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we can ob- serve that, with the negation cue as a prefix in a word, the partial scope before, after and in the middle of the negation cue differ in terms of com- position of words and their associated syntactic roles in the sentence. Furthermore, the type of cue  <ref type="table">that  he  heard  cries  but  is  unable  to  state  from  what direction they  came  .

Moreover, two pieces of partial scope separated by a gap might have some long distance dependencies. For instance, in the first sentence of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, "He" as the first partial scope is the subject phrase of the token "is" which is the first word of the second partial scope with a long gap in between. Similarly, the second example shows that a dis- continuous negation cue involves multiple words, neither and nor, which shows the importance of cue features and some long distance dependencies among text spans.</p><p>Furthermore, besides explicit features that we are able to define, we believe there exist some implicit linguistic patterns within the scope for a given negation cue. While it is possible to manu- ally design linguistic features to extract such pat- terns, approaches that can automatically capture such implicit patterns in a domain and language independent manner can be more attractive. How to design models that can effectively capture such features mentioned above remains a research ques- tion to be answered.</p><p>In the paper, we design different models to cap- ture such useful features based on the above moti- vations, and report our empirical findings through extensive experiments. We release our code at http://statnlp.org/research/st.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approaches</head><p>Based on the observations described earlier, we aim to capture three types of features by design- ing different models based on CRF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negation Cue</head><p>The linear CRF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) model (which we refer to as Linear in this paper), as il- lustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> , is used to capture negation cue related features. The probability of predicting a possible output y, the label sequence capturing negation scope, given an input sentence x is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(y|x) = exp (w T f (x, y)) y ∈Y(x) exp(w T f (x, y ))</formula><p>where f (x, y) is a feature function defined over the (x, y) pair. The negation cue related features mainly involve cue type, position of the cue, as well as relative positions of each partial scope. For example, the cue type refers to the string form of the cue, which could be a single word, an affix (prefix or suffix), or a multi-word expression.</p><p>We follow a standard approach to assign tags to words. Specifically, O and I are used to indicate whether a word appears outside or inside the nega- tion scope respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long Distance Dependencies</head><p>We use the semi-CRF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004</ref>) model (referred to as Semi) to capture long dis- tance dependencies. The semi-CRF is an exten- sion to the linear-CRF. The difference is that the output y may not be a sequence of individual words. Rather, it is now a sequence of spans, where each span consists of one or more words. The semi-CRF model is more expressive than the linear-CRF model as such a model is able to cap- ture features that are defined at the span level, al- lowing longer-range dependencies to be captured.</p><p>Since the Semi approach is capable of model- ing a span (which can be a gap or partial scope), we are able to model the features between two sep- arate text spans. We propose three variants for the Semi model, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, to capture different types of long distance features. The Semi i model regards a piece of partial scope as a span in order to capture long distance dependencies be- tween two gaps. The Semi o model treats a gap as a span to capture long distance dependencies between two pieces of partial scope. The Semi io model regards both partial scope and gaps as spans to capture both types of long distance dependen- cies mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implicit Patterns</head><p>The latent variable CRF model, denoted as La- tent, is used to model implicit patterns. The prob- ability of predicting a possible output y, which is the label sequence capturing negation scope infor- mation, given an input sentence x is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p(y|x) = h exp (w T f (x, y, h)) y ∈Y(x) h exp(w T f (x, y , h ))</formula><p>where h is a latent variable encoding the implicit pattern.</p><p>We believe such latent pattern information can be learned from data without any linguistic guid- ance. The Latent model is capable of capturing this type of implicit signals. For example, as illus- trated as Latent io in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, each position has O 0 , O 1 , I 0 and I 1 as latent tags. This way, we can construct features of forms such as "He/O i - declares/I j " that capture the underlying interac- tions between the words and the latent tag patterns.</p><p>In order to investigate the relation between la- tent variables and tags, we proposed another two latent models. The Latent i only considers latent variables on I tags (for partial scope), while La- tent o only takes latent variables on O tags (for gaps).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Main Results</head><p>The main results on the CDS-CO corpus are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. P A ., R A . and F 1A . are precision, recall and F 1 measure under version A, while P B ., R B ., F 1B . are for version B. Note that none of the prior works reported results under version B. Moreover, c refers to the cue type features, r refers to relative position of partial scope with respect to the cue.</p><p>We focus on Linear models first, where Linear (-c -r) is the baseline without features c and r for comparisons. By adding c, the Linear (-r) model improves the performance by 9.9 and 10.6 in terms of F 1 scores for both versions of evaluation meth- ods at the scope level respectively. By adding r solely, the Linear (-c) model increases the perfor- mance by 6.5 and 7.9 on F 1 scores of both ver- sions. By adding both c and r, the Linear model increases the performance by 15.3 and 18.2 on F 1 scores at the scope level, outperforming previous This person is alone and can not be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy .</p><p>He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr. War- ren , nor I , nor the girl has once set eyes upon him. works. These improvements demonstrate the im- portance of the negation cue features.</p><p>Compared with the Linear model, Semi models achieve better results. Specifically, Semi o model achieves the best result on F 1B at the scope level among all the models and achieves the highest re- sult on F 1 at the token level.</p><p>The Latent io model outperforms all the other models in terms of F 1A at scope level and a com- petitive result in terms of F 1B .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analysis</head><p>By analyzing predictions that are incorrect in Lin- ear model that are correct in the Semi models, we have some interesting observations explaining why Semi models work better. The first type of observation is that the Semi models tend to pre- dict more correct scope tokens, which improves results at scope level and token level. The second type is that Semi models recover some missing re- mote partial scope, which shows the importance of capturing long distance dependencies. For in- stance, in the first example of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the Semi models recover the subject phrase "This person" as the first partial scope. The third type happens on discontinuous cues as well as multiple short gaps as shown in the second example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. The Linear model fails to predict "Mr. Waren ," and "I ,'' as two pieces of partial scope between three cue words which are also gaps. These observations in- dicate that Semi models are capable of capturing long distance features and can correct some wrong predictions made by the Linear model.</p><p>Similarly, by analyzing predictions that are in- correct in Linear model that are correct in the La- tent models, we observe that Latent models tend to make more accurate predictions. We found that there is only 1 incorrect prediction from the La- tent io that is corrected by the Linear model. This indicates that the Latent io model is able to fix er- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al. (2010)</ref> - - 81.8 - - 64.0 - - 89.8    rors for the Linear model without producing other wrong predictions. This analysis implies that the Latent models are able to capture some latent pat- terns to some extent. The performance of the La- tent o model is lower than the performance of La- tent io and Latent i, indicating that latent vari- ables on tag I captures more information. Let us focus on the token-level performance of our model. We obtained satisfactory precision scores, but comparatively low recall scores. Mean- while, at the scope level, our precision scores are comparable to the previous works, but our recall scores are consistently better, indicating our mod- els are capable of successfully recovering more gold scope information from the test data. Our further analysis shows that our models tend to predict negation scope that is significantly shorter than the gold scope for those instances that involve some long negation scope. We find that around 1/3 of the word tokens appearing inside any nega- tion scope come from such instances. These facts make token-level recall of our models compara- tively low.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">System Abstract Full Paper Clinical F 1T F 1A P CS F 1T F 1A P CS F 1T F 1A P CS</formula><p>In addition, we inspect the top 200 features with highest feature weights, and we find that around 45% of them are related to POS tags with label transition (the string form concatenating current tag and next tag), indicating POS tag features play an important role in the learning process for our models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experiments on Model Robustness</head><p>To understand the robustness of our model, we ad- ditionally conducted two sets of experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BioScope</head><p>The BioScope corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Szarvas et al., 2008</ref>) con- tains three data collections from medical domains: Abstract, Full <ref type="bibr">Paper and Clinical. NLTK (Bird and Loper, 2004</ref>) is used to perform tokeniza- tion and POS tagging for preprocessing. <ref type="bibr">Following (Morante and Daelemans, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Qian et al., 2016)</ref>, we perform 10-fold cross validation on Ab-  stract, whereas the results on Full Paper and Clin- ical are obtained by training on the full Abstract dataset and testing on Full Paper and Clinical re- spectively. The latter experiment can help us un- derstand the robustness of the model by applying the learned model to different types of text within the same domain. The Semi io model mostly outperforms the other models. Comparing against all the prior works, our models are able to achieve better results on Abstract under both token-level and scope-level F 1 as well as P CS 2 . Moreover, we also ob- tain significantly higher results in terms of scope- level F 1 on Full Paper and Clinical, indicating the good robustness of our approaches. Note that the P CS score on Full Paper is not as satisfac- tory as on Clinical. This is largely because the model is trained on Abstract, but Full Paper con- tains much longer sentences with longer negation scope, which presents a challenge for our model as discussed in the previous sections. On the other hand, the baseline systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al., 2010;</ref>) adopt features from syntactic trees, which allow them to capture long-distance syntac- tic dependencies.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">System Product Review F 1T F 1A F 1B P CS (</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CNeSP</head><p>To understand how well our model works on another language other than English, we also conducted an experiment on the Product Review collection from the CNeSP corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zou et al., 2015)</ref>. We used Jieba (Sun, 2012) and Stanford tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Toutanova and Manning, 2000</ref>) to per- form Chinese word segmentation and POS tag- ging. Following the data splitting scheme de- scribed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zou et al., 2015)</ref>, we performed 10- fold cross-validation and the results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. Our model obtains a significantly higher P CS score than the model reported in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zou et al., 2015)</ref>. The results further confirm the robustness of our model, showing it is language independent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>The negation scope extraction task has been stud- ied within the NLP community through the Bio- Scope corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Szarvas et al., 2008</ref>) in biomed- ical domain, usually together with the negation cue detection task. The negation scope detection task has mostly been regarded as a boundary de- tection task. <ref type="bibr">Morante et al.
