			<abstract>
				<p>Many NLP tools for English and German are based on manually annotated articles from the Wall Street Journal and Frankfurter Rundschau. The average readers of these two newspapers are middle-aged (55 and 47 years old, respectively), and the annotated articles are more than 20 years old by now. This leads us to speculate whether tools induced from these resources (such as part-of-speech taggers) put older language users at an advantage. We show that this is actually the case in both languages, and that the cause goes beyond simple vocabulary differences. In our experiments, we control for gender and region.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One of the main challenges in natural language processing (NLP) is to correct for biases in the manually annotated data available to system en- gineers. Selection biases are often thought of in terms of textual domains, motivating work in do- main adaptation of NLP models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Daume III and Marcu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ben-David et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daume III, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dredze et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2011</ref>, inter alia). Domain adaptation prob- lems are typically framed as adapting models that were induced on newswire to other domains, such as spoken language, literature, or social media.</p><p>However, newswire is not just a domain with particular conventions. It is also a source of infor- mation written by and for particular people. The reader base of most newspapers is older, richer, and more well-educated than the average popu- lation. Also, many newspapers have more read- ers in some regions of their country. In addition, newswire text is much more canonical than other domains, and includes fewer neologisms and non- standard language. Both, however, are frequent in the language use of young adults, who are the main drivers of language change <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Holmes, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nguyen et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the most widely used manually annotated resources for English and Ger- man, namely the English Penn Treebank and the TIGER Treebank for German. The English tree- bank consists of manually annotated Wall Street Journal articles from 1989. The TIGER Treebank consists of manually annotated Frankfurter Rund- schau articles from the early 1990s. Both newspa- pers have regionally and demographically biased reader bases, e.g., with more old than young read- ers. We discuss the biases in §2.</p><p>In the light of recent research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Volkova et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hovy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jørgensen et al., 2015)</ref>, we ex- plore the hypothesis that these biases transfer to NLP tools induced from these resources. As a re- sult, these models perform better on texts written by certain people, namely those whose language is closer to the training data. Language dynamics being what they are, we expect English and Ger- man POS taggers to perform better on texts written by older people. To evaluate this hypothesis, we collected English and German user reviews from a user review site used by representative samples of the English and German populations. We anno- tated reviews written by users whose age, gender, and location were known with POS tags. The re- sulting data set enables us to test whether there are significant performance differences between ages, genders, and regions, while controlling for the two respective other, potentially confounding, factors.</p><p>Contribution We show that age bias leads to significant performance differences in off-the- shelf POS taggers for English and German. We also analyze the relevant linguistic differences be- tween the age groups, and show that they are not solely lexical, but instead extend to the grammat- ical level. As a corollary, we also present several new evaluation datasets for English and German that allow us to control for age, gender, and loca- tion. According to a study conducted by the newspa- per itself, 2 its readers are found in "comfortable" higher jobs, well-educated, and on average in their mid-forties. While the paper is available interna- tionally, most of its users come from the Rhine- Main region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Trustpilot Corpus</head><p>The Trustpilot Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hovy et al., 2015a)</ref> con- sists of user reviews scraped from the multi- lingual website trustpilot.com. The re- viewer base has been shown to be representative of the populations in the countries for which large reviewer bases exist, at least wrt. age, gender, and geographical spread ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hovy et al., 2015a</ref>). The lan- guage is more informal than newswire, but less creative than social media posts. This is similar to the language in the reviews section of the English Web Treebank. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> For the experiments below, we annotated parts of the British and German sections 1 http://www.let.rug.nl/ ˜ bplank/ metadata/genre_files_updated.html 2 http://www.fr-online.de/ wir-ueber-uns/studie-wer-sind-unsere-leser-, 4353508,4356262.html 3 https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ LDC2012T13 of the Trustpilot Corpus with the tag set proposed in Petrov et al. (2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">POS annotations</head><p>We use an in-house interface to annotate the En- glish and German data. For each of the two lan- guages, we annotate 600 sentences. The data is sampled in the following way: we first extract all reviews associated with a location, split and to- kenize the review using the NLTK tokenizer for the respective language, and discard any sentences with fewer than three or more than 100 tokens. We then map each review to the NUTS region corre- sponding to the location. If the location name is ambiguous, we discard it.</p><p>We then run two POS taggers (TreeTagger 4 , and a model implemented in CRF++ 5 ) to obtain log- likelihoods for each sentence in the English and German sub corpora. We normalize by sentence length and compute the average score for each re- gion under each tagger.</p><p>We single out the two regions in England and Germany with the highest, respectively lowest, av- erage log-likelihoods from both taggers. We do this to be able to control for dialectal variation. In each region, we randomly sample 200 reviews written by women under 35, 200 reviews written by men under 35, 200 reviews written by women over 45, and 200 reviews written by men over 45. This selection enables us to study and control for gender, region, and age.</p><p>While sociolinguistics agrees on language change between age groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barke, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schler et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barbieri, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rickford and Price, 2013)</ref>, it is not clear where to draw the line. The age groups selected here are thus solely based on the availability of even-sized groups that are sepa- rated by 10 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Training data and models</head><p>As training data for our POS tagging models, we use manually annotated data from the Wall Street Journal (English Penn Treebank) and Frankfurter Rundschau (TIGER). We use the training and test sections provided in the CoNLL 2006-7 shared tasks, but we convert all tags to the universal POS tag set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Petrov et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>Our POS taggers are trained using TreeTagger with default parameters, and CRF++ with default parameters and standard POS features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Owoputi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hovy et al., 2015b</ref>). We use two dif- ferent POS tagger induction algorithms in order to be able to abstract away from their respective inductive biases. Generally, TreeTagger (TREET) performs better than CRF++ on German, whereas CRF++ performs best on English.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: POS accuracy on different demographic groups for English and German. Significant dif- ferences per tagger in bold <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the accuracies for both algo- rithms on the three demographic groups (age, gen- der, region) for German and English. We see that there are some consistent differences between the groups. In both languages, results for both taggers are better for the older group than for the younger one. In three out of the four cases, this difference is statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05, according to a bootstrap-sample test. The difference between the genders is less pronounced, although we do see CRF++ reaching a significantly higher accuracy for women in German. For regions, we find that while the models assign low log-likelihood scores to some regions, this is not reflected in the accu- racy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results</head><p>As common in NLP, we treat American (train- ing) and British English (test data) as variants. It is possible that this introduces a confounding fac- tor. However, since we do not see marked effects for gender or region, and since the English results closely track the German data, this seems unlikely. We plan to investigate this in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis</head><p>The last section showed the performance differ- ences between various groups, but it does not tell us where the differences come from. In this sec- tion, we try to look into potential causes, and ana- lyze the tagging errors for systematic patterns. We focus on age, since this variable showed the largest differences between groups.</p><p>Holmes <ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref> argues that people between 30 and 55 years use standard language the most, because of societal pressure from their workplace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nguyen et al. (2014)</ref> made similar observations for Twitter. Consequently, both young and retired people often depart from the standard linguistic norms, young people because of innovation, older people because of adherence to previous norms. Our data suggests, however, that young people do so in ways that are more challenging for off-the- shelf NLP models induced on age-biased data. But what exactly are the linguistic differences that lead to lower performance for this group?</p><p>The obvious cause for the difference between age groups would be lexical change, i.e., the use of neologisms, spelling variation, or linguistic change at the structural level in the younger group.</p><p>The resulting vocabulary differences between age groups would result in an increased out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate in the younger group, which in turn negatively affects model performance.</p><p>While we do observe an unsurprising corre- lation between sentence-level performance and OOV-rate, the young reviewers in our sample do not use OOV words more often than the older age group. Both groups differ from the training data roughly equally. This strongly suggests that age-related differences in performance are not a result of OOV items.</p><p>In order to investigate whether the differ- ences extend beyond the vocabulary, we compare the tag bigram distributions, both between the two age groups and between each group and the training data. We measure similarity by KL divergence between the distributions, and inspect the 10 tag bigrams which are most prevalent for either group. We use Laplace smoothing to For the English age groups, we find that a) the two Trustpilot data sets have a smaller KL diver- gence with respect to each other (1.86e − 6) than either has with the training data (young: 3.24e−5, old.: 2.36e−5, respectively). We do note however, b), that the KL divergence for the older groups is much smaller than for the younger group. This means that there is a cross-domain effect, which is bigger, measured this way, than the difference in age groups. The age group difference in KL diver- gence, however, suggests that the two groups use different syntactic constructions.</p><p>Inspecting the bigrams which are most preva- lent for each group, we find again that a) the Trustpilot groups show more instances involving verbs, such as PRON-VERB, VERB-ADV, and VERB-DET, while the English Penn Treebank data set has a larger proportion of instances of nominal constructions, such as NOUN-VERB, NOUN-ADP, and NOUN-NOUN.</p><p>On the other hand, we find that b) the younger group has more cases of verbal constructions and the use of particles, such as PRT-VERB, VERB- PRT, PRON-PRT, and VERB-ADP, while the older group-similar to the treebank-shows more instances of nominal constructions, i.e., again NOUN-VERB, ADJ-NOUN, NOUN-ADP, and NOUN-NOUN.</p><p>The heatmaps in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> show all pairwise comparisons between the three distributions. In the interest of space and visibility, we select the 10 bigrams that differ most from each other between the two distributions under comparison. The color indicates in which of the two distributions a bigram is more prevalent, and the degree of shading indicates the size of the difference.</p><p>For German, we see similar patterns.</p><p>The Trustpilot data shows more instances of ADV- ADV, PRON-VERB, and ADV-VERB, while the TIGER treebank contains more NOUN-DET, NOUN-ADP, and NOUN-NOUN.</p><p>Again, the younger group is more dissimilar to the CoNLL data, but less so than for English, with CONJ-PRON, NOUN-VERB, VERB- VERB, and PRON-DET, while the older group shows more ADV-ADJ, ADP-NOUN, NOUN-ADV, and ADJ-NOUN.</p><p>In all of these cases, vocabulary does not factor into the differences, since we are at the POS level. The results indicate that there exist fundamental grammatical differences between the age groups, which go well beyond mere lexical differences. These findings are in line with the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Johannsen et al. (2015)</ref>, who showed that entire (delexicalized) dependency structures correlate with age and gender, often across several languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Tagging Error Analysis</head><p>Analyzing the tagging errors of our model can give us an insight into the constructions that differ most between groups.</p><p>In German, most of the errors in the younger group occur with adverbs, determiners, and verbs. Adverbs are often confused with adjectives, be- cause adverbs and adjectives are used as modi- fiers in similar ways. The taggers also frequently confused adverbs with nouns, especially sentence- initially, presumably largely because they are cap- italized. Sometimes, such errors are also due to spelling mistakes and/or English loanwords. De- terminers are often incorrectly predicted to be pro- nouns, presumably due to homography: in Ger- man, der, die, das, etc. can be used as determin- ers, but also as relative pronouns, depending on the position. Verbs are often incorrectly predicted to be nouns. This last error is again mostly due to capitalization, homographs, and, again, English loanwords. Another interesting source is sentence- initial use of verbs, which is unusual in canoni- cal German declarative sentences, but common in informal language, where pronouns are dropped, i.e, " <ref type="bibr">[Ich]</ref> Kann mich nicht beschweren" ([I] Can't complain).</p><p>Errors involving verbs are much less frequent in the older group, where errors with adjectives and nouns are more frequent.</p><p>For English, the errors in the younger and older group are mostly on the same tags (nouns, adjectives, and verbs). Nouns often get mis- tagged as VERB, usually because of homography due to null-conversion (ordering, face, needs). Adjectives are also most commonly mis-tagged as VERB, almost entirely due to homography in participles (-ed, -ing). We see more emoticons (labeled X) in the younger group, and some of them end up with incorrect tags (NOUN or ADV). There are no mis-tagged emoticons in the older group, who generally uses fewer emoticons (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hovy et al. (2015a)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this position paper, we show that some of the common training data sets bias NLP tools towards the language of older people. I.e., there is a statis- tically significant correlation between tagging per- formance and age for models trained on CoNLL data. A study of the actual differences between age groups shows that they go beyond the vocabu- lary, and extend to the grammatical level.</p><p>The results suggest that NLP's focus on a lim- ited set of training data has serious consequences for model performance on new data sets, but also demographic groups. Due to language dynam- ics and the age of the data sets, performance de- grades significantly for younger speakers. Since POS tagging is often the first step in any NLP pipeline, performance differences are likely to in- crease downstream. As a result, we risk disadvan- taging younger groups when it comes to the bene- fits of NLP.</p><p>The case study shows that our models are sus- ceptible to the effects of language change and de- mographic factors. Luckily, the biases are not in- herent to the models, but reside mostly in the data. The problem can thus mostly be addressed with more thorough training data selection that takes demographic factors into account. It does high- light, however, that we also need to develop more robust technologies that are less susceptible to data biases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Tag bigrams with highest differences between distributions in English data.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="4,73.35,62.81,145.14,150.18" type="bitmap" /></figure>
