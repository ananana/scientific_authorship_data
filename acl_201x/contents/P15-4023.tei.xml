				<p>To better organize and understand online news information, we propose Storybase 1 , a knowledge base for news events that builds upon Wikipedia current events and daily Web news. It first constructs stories and their timelines based on Wikipedi-a current events and then detects and links daily news to enrich those Wikipedia stories with more comprehensive events. We encode events and develop efficient event clustering and chaining techniques in an event space. We demonstrate Storybase with a news events search engine that helps find historical and ongoing news stories and inspect their dynamic timelines.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Users are often overwhelmed by the flood of infor- mation, especially frequently daily updated news. Search engines effectively find news snippets and related Web pages, or group similar pages in clus- ters. However, it remains difficult to coherently connect isolated information nuggets to form the big picture, or to accurately track the flow of in- formation to show the evolution of events. For ex- ample, current news search engines or aggregation sites, such as Google or Yahoo news, show only isolated daily news events, without linking them to historical events or show storylines.</p><p>Most existing knowledge bases such as DBpe- dia and Freebase are designed for managing gen- eral named entities or concepts and often lack cov- erage or representation for temporally evolving news events. For example, as of this writing, Free- base has not treated "2014 Ferguson unrest" as an "event", let alone show its sub events or timelines. As such, we propose building a knowledge base, namely Storybase, that stores news events in a se- 1 http://breckenridge.ist.psu.edu:8000/storybase mantic coherent schema that could explicitly dis- play their evolving timelines. We define a story as a set of topically or causally related and tempo- rally ordered news events, usually corresponding to a Wikipedia article such as "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370". An event is defined as something im- portant happening at some time in some place, re- ported by a set of news articles, which is encoded by named entities, actors and actions used as the main points in a plot.</p><p>Building an event knowledge base from scratch is challenging, since it is difficult to obtain a gold standard for events and their timelines. We found that Wikipedia current events 2 provide high- quality manually edited news events. To scale up, we link daily news sources and fit them into ex- isting stories or create new stories, by efficien- t event detection and storyline construction tech- niques in a semantic space which is encoded with news events' entities, actors, and actions. From April 1, 2013 to March 1, 2015, we have collect- ed 1,256 stories consisting of 35,362 news events from Wikipedia current events, and 35,166,735 daily news articles. Experimental evaluation com- pares our methods for event clustering and chain- ing with multiple baselines. We build a news event search engine based on Storybase to show news s- tories and their event chains.</p><p>Our main contributions include:</p><p>• A news event knowledge base, Storybase, with a search interface for news storylines;</p><p>• The introduction of Wikipedia current events as resources for building event knowledge bases and as datasets for event detection and storyline construction;</p><p>• New approaches for event clustering and chaining with experimental comparisons to other baselines.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Overall process of building Storybase 2 Overview and Definitions <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the overall process for building S- torybase. Input is daily crawled web news arti- cles and Wikipedia current events. This generates the storylines and builds the Storybase using five steps system: preprocessing, categorization, event encoding, clustering, and chaining. Details are in Section 4. A news event search engine is built to provide a query based interface to search and visu- alize the Storybase, which is shown in Section 5.</p><p>We now define concepts that will be frequently referred to.</p><p>• A event identifies something (non-trivial) happening in a certain place at a certain time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al., 1999</ref>); it is a set of news articles on the same news report.</p><p>• A story is a set of topical related news events.</p><p>• A storyline is a series of temporally ordered events of the same story.</p><p>• Actors in an event are named entities that make or receive actions.</p><p>• Actions are verbs that connect actors.</p><p>For example, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, "Pro-Russian militants seize the regional prosecutor's office in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk" is an even- t reported by a set of articles from different news sites. "2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine" repre- sents a story that consists of temporally evolving events, which forms a storyline. "Pro-Russian mil- itants" and "the regional prosecutor's office" are actors while "seize" is the action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Collection</head><p>Wikipedia current events list manually edited dai- ly news events since 1998, which provide rich semantics and structure for news stories and events such as story names, event categories (not Wikipedia categories), and links to Wikipedia con- cepts, as shown by <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. For example, we</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Event category Story</head><p>Figure 2: Examples of Wikipedia current events can observe that the event "Pro-Russian militants seize the regional prosecutor's office in the east- ern Ukrainian city of Donetsk" belongs to the sto- ry "2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine" and the category "Armed conflicts and attacks", contain- ing links to Wikipedia concepts "Eastern Ukraini- an" and "Donetsk". Thus, we construct a storyline for "2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine" by con- necting all events under it.</p><p>The category labels provide a natural way to classify news events. However, since the Wikipedia events are edited by various users, the category labels are not always consistent. For ex- ample, one may use "Armed conflicts and attack- s" while others might use "Attack and conflict". After canonicalization using Levenshtein distance and grouping similar labels using word based Jac- card similarity, we manually clean all the labels into 12 categories, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Although Wikipedia provides high quality man- ually edited news events, it covers only a smal- l number of events every day, usually less than 30. Thus, to scale up Storybase and make the stories more comprehensive, starting from April 1, 2013, we crawl daily news articles from a large number of sources from various news publishers, provided by GDELT 3 project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Leetaru and Schrodt, 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Building Storybase</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Preprocess and Categorization</head><p>To extract and parse Wikipedia current events, we implement two template based extractors for events between January 2003 and April 2006 and those events after April 2006 respectively due to their difference in templates. The news articles linked at the end of each event description are also crawled. We use boilerpipe 4 to extract the title and main text content of each news article. We extrac- t the first three sentences in the main content for summarization. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1  conflict, attack  2  disaster, accident  3  international relations  4  politics and elections  5  law and crime  6  business and economy  7  science and technology  8  sports  9</ref> arts and culture 10 health, medicine, environment 11 education 12 deaths <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Categories of events in Storybase</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID Category</head><p>We maintain an N-to-1 mapping for each cate- gory listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For example, any category label in {"Armed conflicts and attacks", "conflict- s and attacks", "Armed conflicts", "Attacks and conflicts", "Attacks and armed conflicts"} will be mapped to Category 1. For an event not belonging to existing stories, we label its category using the majority of their k-nearest (k=10) neighbors based on the cosine similarity of event descriptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Event Encoding</head><p>We encode an event as a vector containing named entities, actors and actions. Named entities such as people and locations in news reports contain important information of the event. Core entities that play important roles in an event are called actors, which are usually people or organizations that make or receive actions. We use the Stanford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) for the named entity recognition and extract all Wikipedia con- cepts appearing in news content. Entities that are subjects or objects in the title and description are treated as actors. If no entities are found, we then use the CAMEO dictionaries 5 for actor and action extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Event Clustering and Chaining</head><p>Event clustering groups together news on the same event.</p><p>Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) (Van Durme and Lall, 2010) is used for fast similarity comparison. We first do dedupli- cation on all articles on the same date using 84 bits sim-Hashing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Charikar, 2002</ref>). We then use modified sim-Hashing on the vector space of event described in Section 4.2, rather than shingling or bag-of-words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Paulev et al., 2010</ref>  Event chaining links an event to an existing story or determines if it is the starting event of a new story. While LSH could give high-purity event clusters, it might not be able to determine whether two events with distance larger than θ are topically related, or belong to the same story. Intu- itively, an event should bring some novelty and p- reserve some common information compared with the previous ones in the story, causing a trade- off between relevance and novelty, which could be measured by some textual similarity. Adding an event should also keep the storyline coherent. To model coherence, we investigate two features, the Connecting-Dots coherence score <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Shahaf and Guestrin, 2010)</ref> and KL-divergence. We use the gradient boosting tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Friedman, 2001</ref>) to learn if an event belongs to a story by using the above fea- tures of relevance/novelty and coherence, all based on storylines constructed from Wikipedia current events. For a story {e 1 ,...,e m }, (e i , {e 1 , ..., e i−1 }) are positive pairs; (e − , {e 1 , ..., e i−1 }) are negative pairs, i = 2, ..., m, where e − is an event randomly sampled from other stories in the same date of e i .</p><p>For all GDELT news on date t, we first detect all events using event clustering. For an event that has not been merged into events of the previous date, we use the model to decide which story it belongs to. If none, the event will be served as the first event of a new story with an empty story name. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Storybase Demonstration</head><p>We demonstrate Storybase by building a news event search engine that can retrieve and visual- ize the stories. In the backend, we implemented various facilities, such as ranking functions (B- M25, cosine similarity, and inner product) and re- fining metrics (popularity and recency). The rank- ing functions compute relevance between queries and stories while a story is represented by the story name and all event descriptions. Popularity mea- sures the impact of stories on Web. For simplic- ity, we implement popularity as the accumulative number of unique news reports for all events of a story. Recency measures the timeliness or fresh- ness, which is an important and helpful feature for sorting and filtering news stories, and is im- plemented by simply sorting stories based on the date of their latest event.</p><p>The front page gives a category navigation list in the left, a search box in the middle, and the re- cent stories behind the box. A category links to the recent events from the category, as shown by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 3</ref>. The demo contains three views: storyline, story, and event. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> shows a screenshot of the storyline view returned by querying "Crimea". The results are organized at the story level, where we show a thumbnail of the event chain for each story. The description, category, and date of an event are presented in the event box. By clicking the story name, it will direct to a story view page that chronologically lists all its events where the story name links to the corresponding Wikipedia article. Clicking "more" for each event links to the event view page that lists all the news articles of the event. At the upper right corner there is drop- down menu which allow users to set the ranking functions and refine metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the event clustering and chain- ing in an experimental dataset constructed us- ing Wikipedia current events from 01/01/2013 to 01/31/2015, which contains 652 stories covering 9004 events with 8,944 news articles.</p><p>We first explore whether our event clustering can effectively and efficiently cluster news arti- cles of the same event. To construct the dataset, we select the events that link to more than 4 news articles, which in total gives us 55 events from 229 news articles. We then compare our method with the state-of-art clustering algorithm- s including K-means <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hartigan and Wong, 1979)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996)</ref>, and the state-of- art LSH methods including min-Hashing (Broder, 1997) and sim-Hashing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Charikar, 2002</ref>). We use the cluster module provided by sklearn 6 . For both K-means and DBSCAN, we use TFIDF based Eu- clidean distance in bag-of-word space. For K- means, we set the number of clusters to 55. For Methods Precision Recall F1 K-means 76.2% 73.1% 74.6% DBSCAN 77.9% 74.6% 76.2% Min-Hashing 82.1% 51.2% 63.1% Sim-Hashing 80.1% 50.2% 61.7% Event-Hashing 79.6% 76.8% 78.2%  We set θ as 5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the average precision, recal- l, and F1 scores over all clusters. Our method (Event-Hashing) outperforms both distance-based and LSH based clustering algorithms in terms of effectiveness, suggesting that our event represen- tation using entities, actors, and actions is a more promising approach than bag-of-word ones. Our method is somewhat slower than min-Hashing and sim-Hashing because of the extra computing on the event space. It is worth noting that min- Hashing and sim-Hashing have higher precisions than ours, but at the cost of a big loss in recall.</p><p>We then evaluate the effectiveness of the even- t chaining for constructing storylines. We use the 458 stories starting in range <ref type="bibr">[01/01/2013, 02/28/2014]</ref> for training and the other 194 stories for testing. We define accuracy of a construct- ed storyline as the fraction of the correctly linked events. For testing, each story is initialized by its first event. Thresholds of the three baseline mea- sures are tuned in the training set. As shown by <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, our learning based model combining the three features significantly outperforms the base- lines in average accuracy over the testing stories.</p><p>A small scale evaluation on the effectiveness and efficiency of the news event search engine is also performed. First, we evaluate the ranking per- formance for different ranking functions on a test query set including 10 different queries using pre- cision at k (P@k). The query set contains "Unit- Method P@3 P@5 P@10 <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">AvgTimePerQuery  Inn. Pro.  57  66  69  133ms  BM25  100  94  92  104ms  Cosine  100  94  96  136ms   Table 4</ref>: Performance comparisons of ranking methods on event search</p><p>ed States", "Russia", "China", "Barack Obama", "European Union", "President of the United S- tates", "Car bomb", "North Korea", "South Kore- a", "President of Russia". We choose these queries because they appear frequently in the news articles and are very likely to be searched by users. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the performance of three ranking functions. The P@k scores for BM25 and cosine similarity is higher than inner product. This happens because the inner product does not do normalization thus favors the longer documents which should be less relevant in our setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Little work has been reported on the building of event knowledge bases with the exception of EVIN ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kuzey and Weikum, 2014</ref>). However, their main focus is on extracting named events from news articles in an offline setting for knowledge base population (Ji and Grishman, 2011), but not building storylines for new events from large scale daily news streams. Topic detection and tracking (TDT) that ad- dresses event-based organization of news has been widely studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Yang et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allan, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Petrovi´cPetrovi´c et al., 2012</ref>). Furthermore, there is a rich literature on bursty event detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kleinberg, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fung et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">He et al., 2007)</ref>, where an "event" is a set of word features that co-occur in certain time windows in text streams. There is also an emerging interest in building news timelines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Li and Li, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yan et al., 2011</ref>), event chains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Shahaf and Guestrin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tannier and Moriceau, 2013</ref>), or topic model based storylines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed et al., 2011)</ref>. It is worth noting that some work uses similar event encoding based on actors and actions for po- litical events <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(O'Connor et al., 2013)</ref>. Our work is different from existing work in both the repre- sentation of an "event" and event detection tech- niques. We use a three-layer (story-event-article) representation to organize the storylines and de- velop efficient clustering and chaining methods on the event space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We presented Storybase, an event knowledge base for news stories containing rich temporal and semantic information and described a storyline based news event search engine. Experimental re- sults demonstrated that our proposed methods are effective and efficient for event detection and s- toryline based search. Future work could include enriching properties of a story using Wikipedia in- fobox and better summarizing events and stories.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: Screenshot of category "Conflict"</figDesc><graphic url="image-3.png" coords="3,307.56,62.81,217.69,127.14" type="bitmap" /></figure>
