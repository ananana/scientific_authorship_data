				<p>Count-based distributional semantic models suffer from sparsity due to unobserved but plausible co-occurrences in any text collection. This problem is amplified for models like Anchored Packed Trees (APTs), that take the grammatical type of a co-occurrence into account. We therefore introduce a novel form of distributional inference that exploits the rich type structure in APTs and infers missing data by the same mechanism that is used for semantic composition.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Anchored Packed Trees (APTs) is a recently pro- posed approach to distributional semantics that takes distributional composition to be a process of lexeme contextualisation . A lexeme's meaning, characterised as knowledge concerning co-occurrences involving that lexeme, is represented with a higher-order dependency- typed structure (the APT) where paths associated with higher-order dependencies connect vertices associated with weighted lexeme multisets. The central innovation in the compositional theory is that the APT's type structure enables the precise alignment of the semantic representation of each of the lexemes being composed. Like other count- based distributional spaces, however, it is prone to considerable data sparsity, caused by not observ- ing all plausible co-occurrences in the given data. Recently,  introduced a sim- ple unsupervised algorithm to infer missing co- occurrence information by leveraging the distribu- tional neighbourhood and ease the sparsity effect in count-based models.</p><p>In this paper, we generalise distributional in- ference (DI) in APTs and show how precisely the same mechanism that was introduced to sup- port distributional composition, namely "offset- ting" APT representations, gives rise to a novel form of distributional inference, allowing us to in- fer co-occurrences from neighbours of these rep- resentations. For example, by transforming a rep- resentation of white to a representation of "things that can be white", inference of unobserved, but plausible, co-occurrences can be based on find- ing near neighbours (which will be nouns) of the "things that can be white" structure. This further- more exposes an interesting connection between distributional inference and distributional compo- sition. Our method is unsupervised and maintains the intrinsic interpretability of APTs 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Offset Representations</head><p>The basis of how composition is modelled in the APT framework is the way that the co-occurrences are structured. In characterising the distribu- tional semantics of some lexeme w, rather than just recording a co-occurrence between w and w within some context window, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Padó and Lapata (2007)</ref> and record the dependency path from w to w . This syntagmatic structure makes it possible to appropriately offset the semantic repre- sentations of each of the lexemes being composed in some phrase. For example many nouns will have distributional features starting with the type amod, which cannot be observed for adjectives or verbs. Thus, when composing the adjective white with the noun clothes, the feature spaces of the two lexemes need to be aligned first. This can be achieved by offsetting one of the constituents, which we will explain in more detail in this sec- tion.</p><p>We will make use of the following nota-tion throughout this work. A typed distribu- tional feature consists of a path and a lexeme such as in amod:white. Inverse paths are de- noted by a horizontal bar above the dependency relation such as in dobj:prefer and higher- order paths are separated by a dot such as in amod.compound:dress. Offset representations are the central compo- nent in the composition process in the APT frame- work. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the APT representations for the adjective white (left) and the APT for the noun clothes (right), as might have been observed in a text collection. Each node holds a multiset of lex- emes and the anchor of an APT reflects the current perspective of a lexeme at the given node. An off- set representation can be created by shifting the anchor along a given path. For example the lex- eme white is at the same node as other adjectives such as black and clean, whereas nouns such as shoes or noise are typically reached via the amod edge.</p><p>Offsetting in APTs only involves a change in the anchor, the underlying structure remains un- changed. By offsetting the lexeme white by amod the anchor is shifted along the amod edge, which results in creating a noun view for the adjective white. We denote the offset view of a lexeme for a given path by superscripting the offset path, for example the amod offset of the adjective white is denoted as white amod . The offsetting procedure changes the starting points of the paths as visi- ble in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> between the anchors for white and white amod , since paths always begin at the anchor. The red dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> reflects that anchor shift. The lexeme white amod represents a proto- typical "white thing", that is, a noun that has been modified by the adjective white. We note that all edges in the APT space are bi-directional as ex- emplified in the coloured amod and amod edges in the APT for white, however for brevity we only show uni-directional edges in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>By considering the APT representations for the lexemes white and clothes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, it be- comes apparent that lexemes with different parts of speech are located in different areas of the semantic space. If we want to compose the adjective-noun phrase white clothes, we need to offset one of the two constituents to align the fea- ture spaces in order to leverage their distributional commonalities. This can be achieved by either creating a noun offset view of white, by shift- ing the anchor along the amod edge, or by cre- ating an adjective offset representation of clothes by shifting its anchor along amod. In this work we follow  and always offset the dependent in a given relation. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows a subset of the features of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> as would be represented in a vectorised APT. Vectorising the whole APT lexicon results in a very high- dimensional and sparse typed distributional space. The features for white amod (middle column) high- light the change in feature space caused by offset- ting the adjective white. The features of the off- set view white amod , are now aligned with the noun clothes such that the two can be composed. Com- position can be performed by either selecting the union or intersection of the aligned features.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Offsetting white by amod creates an offset view, white amod , representing a noun, and has the consequence of aligning the feature space with clothes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Qualitative Analysis of Offset Representations</head><p>Any offset view of a lexeme is behaviourally iden- tical to a "normal" lexeme. It has an associ- ated part of speech, a distributional representation which locates it in semantic space, and we can find neighbours for it in the same way that we find neighbours for any other lexeme. In this way, a single APT data structure is able to provide many different views of any given lexeme. These views reflect the different ways in which the lexeme is used. For example law nsubj is the nsubj off- set representation of the noun law. This lexeme is a verb and represents an action carried out by the law. This contrasts with law dobj , which is the dobj offset representation of the noun law. It is also a verb, however represents actions done to the law. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> lists the 10 nearest neighbours for a number of lexemes, offset by amod, dobj and nsubj respectively. For example, the neighbourhood of the lexeme ancient in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows that the offset view for ancient amod is a prototypical representation of an "ancient thing", with neighbours easily associated with the property ancient. Furthermore, <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>  illustrates that nearest neighbours of offset views are often other offset representations. This means that for example actions carried out by a mother tend to be similar to actions carried out by a father or a parent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Offset Inference</head><p>Our approach generalises the unsupervised algo- rithm proposed by , henceforth "standard DI", as a method for inferring missing knowledge into an APT representation. Rather than simply inferring potentially plausible, but un- observed co-occurrences from near distributional neighbours, inferences can be made involving off- set APTs. For example, the adjective white can be offset so that it represents a noun -a proto- typical "white thing". This allows inferring plau- sible co-occurrences from other "things that can be white", such as shoes or shirts. Our algorithm therefore reflects the contextualised use of a word. This has the advantage of being able to make flex- ible and fine grained distinctions in the inference process. For example if the noun law is used as a subject, our algorithm allows inferring plausi- ble co-occurrences from "other actions carried out by the law". This contrasts the use of law as an object, where offset inference is able to find co- occurrences on the basis of "other actions done to the law". This is a crucial advantage over the method of  which only supports inference on uncontextualised lexemes.</p><p>A sketch of how offset inference for a lexeme w works is shown in Algorithm 1. Our algorithm requires a distributional model M , an APT repre- sentation for the lexeme w for which to perform offset inference, a dependency path p, describing the offset for w, and the number of neighbours k.</p><p>The offset representation of w is then enriched with the information from its distributional neigh- bours by some merge function. We note that if the offset path p is the empty path, we would recover the algorithm presented by . Our algorithm is unsupervised, and agnostic to the input distributional model and the neighbour re- trieval function.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Algorithm 1 Offset Inference 1: procedure OFFSET INFERENCE(M , w, p, k) 2:</formula><p>w ← offset(w, p)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connection to Distributional Composition</head><p>An interesting observation is the similarity be- tween distributional inference and distributional composition, as both operations are realised by the same mechanism -an offset followed by infer- ring plausible co-occurrence counts for a single lexeme in the case of distributional inference, or for a phrase in the case of composition. The merg- ing of co-occurrence dimensions for distributional inference can also be any of the operations com- monly used for distributional composition such as pointwise minimum, maximum, addition or multi- plication.</p><p>This relation creates an interesting dynamic be- tween distributional inference and composition when used in a complementary manner as in this work. The former can be used as a process of co- occurrence embellishment which is adding miss-Offset Representation Nearest Neighbours ancient amod civilzation, mythology, tradition, ruin, monument, trackway, tomb, antiquity, folklore, deity red amod blue amod , black amod , green amod , dark amod , onion, pepper, red, tomato, carrot, garlic economic amod political amod , societal amod , cohabiting, economy, growth, cohabitant, globalisation, competitiveness, globalization, prosperity government dobj overthrow, party dobj , authority dobj , leader dobj , capital dobj , force dobj , state dobj , official dobj , minister dobj , oust problem dobj difficulty dobj , solve, coded, issue dobj , injury dobj , overcome, question dobj , think, loss dobj , relieve law dobj violate, rule dobj , enact, repeal, principle dobj , unmake, enforce, policy dobj , obey, flout researcher nsubj physician nsubj , writer nsubj , theorize, thwart, theorise, hypothesize, surmise, student nsubj , worker nsubj , apprehend mother nsubj wife nsubj , father nsubj , parent nsubj , woman nsubj , re-married, remarry, girl nsubj ,breastfeed, family nsubj , disown law nsubj rule nsubj , principle nsubj , policy nsubj , criminalize, case nsubj , contract nsubj , prohibit, proscribe, enjoin, charge nsubj <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: List of the 10 nearest neighbours of amod, dobj and nsubj offset representations.</p><p>ing information, however with the risk of introduc- ing some noise. The latter on the other hand can be used as a process of co-occurrence filtering, that is leveraging the enriched representations, while also sieving out the previously introduced noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>For our experiments we re-implemented the stan- dard DI method of  for a direct comparison. We built an order 2 APT space on the basis of the concatenation of ukWaC, Wackype- dia and the BNC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2009)</ref>, pre-parsed with the Malt parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nivre et al., 2006</ref>). We PPMI transformed the raw co-occurrence counts prior to composition, using a negative SPPMI shift of log 5 (Levy and Goldberg, 2014b). We also experimented with composing normalised counts and applying the PPMI transformation after com- position as done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Weeds et al. (2017)</ref>, however found composing PPMI scores to work better for this task. We evaluate our offset inference algorithm on two popular short phrase composition benchmarks by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mitchell and Lapata (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mitchell and Lapata (2010)</ref>, henceforth ML08 and ML10 re- spectively. The ML08 dataset consists of 120 dis- tinct verb-object (VO) pairs and the ML10 dataset contains 108 adjective-noun (AN), 108 noun-noun (NN) and 108 verb-object pairs. The goal is to compare a model's similarity estimates to human provided judgements. For both tasks, each phrase pair has been rated by multiple human annotators on a scale between 1 and 7, where 7 indicates max- imum similarity. Comparison with human judge- ments is achieved by calculating Spearman's ρ between the model's similarity estimates and the scores of each human annotator individually. We performed composition by intersection and tuned the number of neighbours by a grid search over {0, 10, 30, 50, 100, 500, 1000} on the ML10 develop- ment set, selecting 10 neighbours for NNs, 100 for ANs and 50 for VOs for both DI algorithms. We calculate statistical significance using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Steiger (1980)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the effect of the number of neigh- bours for AN, NN and VO phrases, using offset inference, on the ML10 development set. Interest- ingly, NN compounds exhibit an early saturation effect, while VOs and ANs require more neigh- bours for optimal performance. One explanation for the observed behaviour is that up to some threshold, the neighbours being added contribute actually missing co-occurrence events, whereas past that threshold distributional inference de- grades to just generic smoothing that is simply compensating for sparsity, but overwhelming the representations with non-plausible co-occurrence information. A similar effect has also been ob- served by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Erk and Pado (2010)</ref> in an exemplar- based model.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows that both forms of distributional in- ference significantly outperform a baseline with- out DI. On average, offset inference outperforms the method of  by a statistically significant margin on both datasets. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Comparison of DI algorithms. ‡ denotes statistical significance at p &lt; 0.01 in comparison to the method without DI, * denotes statistical significance at p &lt; 0.01 in compar- ison to standard DI and † denotes statistical significance at p &lt; 0.05 in comparison to standard DI. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref> shows that offset inference substantially outperforms comparable sparse models by  on ML08, achieving a new state-of- the-art, and matches the performance of the state- of-the-art neural network model of <ref type="bibr">Hashimoto et al. (2014)</ref> on ML10, while being fully inter- pretable.  </p></div>
