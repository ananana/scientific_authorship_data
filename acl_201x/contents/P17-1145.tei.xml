				<p>This paper presents a new graph-based approach that induces synsets using syn-onymy dictionaries and word embeddings. First, we build a weighted graph of synonyms extracted from commonly available resources, such as Wiktionary. Second, we apply word sense induction to deal with ambiguous words. Finally, we cluster the disambiguated version of the ambiguous input graph into synsets. Our meta-clustering approach lets us use an efficient hard clustering algorithm to perform a fuzzy clustering of the graph. Despite its simplicity, our approach shows excellent results, outperforming five competitive state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-score on three gold standard datasets for English and Russian derived from large-scale manually constructed lexical resources.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A synset is a set of mutual synonyms, which can be represented as a clique graph where nodes are words and edges are synonymy relations. Synsets represent word senses and are building blocks of WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Miller, 1995)</ref> and similar resources such as thesauri and lexical ontologies. These re- sources are crucial for many natural language pro- cessing applications that require common sense reasoning, such as information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gong et al., 2005</ref>) and question answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kwok et al., 2001</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhou et al., 2013</ref>). However, for most lan- guages, no manually-constructed resource is avail- able that is comparable to the English WordNet in terms of coverage and quality. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kiselev et al. (2015)</ref> present a comparative anal- ysis of lexical resources available for the Russian language concluding that there is no resource com- pared to WordNet in terms of coverage and qual- ity for Russian. This lack of linguistic resources for many languages urges the development of new methods for automatic construction of WordNet- like resources. The automatic methods foster con- struction and use of the new lexical resources. Wikipedia 1 , Wiktionary 2 , OmegaWiki 3 and other collaboratively-created resources contain a large amount of lexical semantic information- yet designed to be human-readable and not for- mally structured. While semantic relations can be automatically extracted using tools such as DKPro JWKTL <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and Wikokit <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , words in these re- lations are not disambiguated. For instance, the synonymy pairs (bank, streambank) and (bank, banking company) will be connected via the word "bank", while they refer to the different senses. This problem stems from the fact that articles in Wiktionary and similar resources list undis- ambiguated synonyms. They are easy to disam- biguate for humans while reading a dictionary ar- ticle, but can be a source of errors for language processing systems.</p><p>The contribution of this paper is a novel ap- proach that resolves ambiguities in the input graph to perform fuzzy clustering. The method takes as an input synonymy relations between potentially ambiguous terms available in human-readable dic- tionaries and transforms them into a machine read- able representation in the form of disambiguated synsets. Our method, called WATSET, is based on a new local-global meta-algorithm for fuzzy graph clustering. The underlying principle is to discover the word senses based on a local graph cluster-ing, and then to induce synsets using global sense clustering. We show that our method outperforms other methods for synset induction. The induced resource eliminates the need in manual synset con- struction and can be used to build WordNet-like semantic networks for under-resourced languages. An implementation of our method along with in- duced lexical resources is available online. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Methods based on resource linking surveyed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gurevych et al. (2016)</ref> gather various existing lex- ical resources and perform their linking to obtain a machine-readable repository of lexical semantic knowledge. For instance, BabelNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012</ref>) relies in its core on a linking of WordNet and Wikipedia. UBY ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gurevych et al., 2012</ref>) is a general-purpose specification for the representation of lexical-semantic resources and links between them. The main advantage of our approach compared to the lexical resources is that no manual synset encoding is required.</p><p>Methods based on word sense induction try to induce sense representations without the need for any initial lexical resource by extracting semantic relations from text. In particular, word sense in- duction (WSI) based on word ego networks clus- ters graphs of semantically related words <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pantel and Lin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dorow and Widdows, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Véronis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hope and Keller, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pelevina et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Panchenko et al., 2017a)</ref>, where each cluster corresponds to a word sense. An ego network consists of a single node (ego) to- gether with the nodes they are connected to (alters) and all the edges among those alters <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Everett and Borgatti, 2005</ref>). In the case of WSI, such a net- work is a local neighborhood of one word. Nodes of the ego network are the words which are seman- tically similar to the target word.</p><p>Such approaches are able to discover homony- mous senses of words, e.g., "bank" as slope ver- sus "bank" as organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Di Marco and Navigli, 2012</ref>). However, as the graphs are usu- ally composed of semantically related words ob- tained using distributional methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Lenci, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Biemann and Riedl, 2013)</ref>, the re- sulting clusters by no means can be considered synsets. Namely, (1) they contain words related not only via synonymy relation, but via a mix- ture of relations such as synonymy, hypernymy, co-hyponymy, antonymy, etc. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Heylen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Panchenko, 2011)</ref>; (2) clusters are not unique, i.e., one word can occur in clusters of different ego net- works referring to the same sense, while in Word- Net a word sense occurs only in a single synset.</p><p>In our synset induction method, we use word ego network clustering similarly as in word sense induction approaches, but apply them to a graph of semantically clean synonyms.</p><p>Methods based on clustering of synonyms, such as our approach, induce the resource from an ambiguous graph of synonyms where edges a extracted from manually-created resources. Ac- cording to the best of our knowledge, most experiments either employed graph-based word sense induction applied to text-derived graphs or relied on a linking-based method that al- ready assumes availability of a WordNet-like re- source. A notable exception is the ECO approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gonçalo Oliveira and Gomes (2014)</ref>, which was applied to induce a WordNet of the Por- tuguese language called Onto.PT. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We compare to this approach and to five other state-of-the-art graph clustering algorithms as the baselines.</p><p>ECO <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gonçalo Oliveira and Gomes, 2014</ref>) is a fuzzy clustering algorithm that was used to induce synsets for a Portuguese WordNet from several available synonymy dictionaries. The algorithm starts by adding random noise to edge weights. Then, the approach applies Markov Clustering (see below) of this graph several times to esti- mate the probability of each word pair being in the same synset. Finally, candidate pairs over a certain threshold are added to output synsets. <ref type="bibr">MaxMax (Hope and Keller, 2013</ref>) is a fuzzy clustering algorithm particularly designed for the word sense induction task. In a nutshell, pairs of nodes are grouped if they have a maximal mu- tual affinity. The algorithm starts by converting the undirected input graph into a directed graph by keeping the maximal affinity nodes of each node. Next, all nodes are marked as root nodes. Finally, for each root node, the following procedure is re- peated: all transitive children of this root form a cluster and the root are marked as non-root nodes; a root node together with all its transitive children form a fuzzy cluster.</p><p>Markov Clustering (MCL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(van Dongen, 2000</ref>) is a hard clustering algorithm for graphs based on simulation of stochastic flow in graphs.</p></div>

At each itera- tion, the labels of all the nodes are updated accord- ing to the majority labels among the neighboring nodes. The algorithm has a meta-parameter that controls graph weights that can be set to three val- ues: (1) top sums over the neighborhood's classes; (2) nolog downgrades the influence of a neighbor- ing node by its degree or by (3) log of its degree.</p><p>Clique Percolation Method (CPM) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Palla et al., 2005</ref>) is a fuzzy clustering algorithm for unweighted graphs that builds up clusters from k-cliques corresponding to fully connected sub- graphs of k nodes. While this method is only com- monly used in social network analysis, we decided to add it to the comparison as synsets are essen- tially cliques of synonyms, which makes it natural to apply an algorithm based on clique detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The WATSET Method</head><p>The goal of our method is to induce a set of unam- biguous synsets by grouping individual ambigu- ous synonyms. An outline of the proposed ap- proach is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The method takes a dictionary of ambiguous synonymy relations and a text corpus as an input and outputs synsets. Note that the method can be used without a background corpus, yet as our experiments will show, corpus- based information improves the results when uti- lizing it for weighting the word graph's edges.</p><p>A synonymy dictionary can be perceived as a graph, where the nodes correspond to lexical en- tries (words) and the edges connect pairs of the nodes when the synonymy relation between them holds. The cliques in such a graph naturally form densely connected sets of synonyms correspond- ing to concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gfeller et al., 2005</ref>). Given the fact that solving the clique problem exactly in a graph is NP-complete ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bomze et al., 1999)</ref> and that these graphs typically contain tens of thou- sands of nodes, it is reasonable to use efficient hard graph clustering algorithms, like MCL and CW, for finding a global segmentation of the graph. However, the hard clustering property of these algorithm does not handle polysemy: while one word could have several senses, it will be assigned to only one cluster. To deal with this limitation, a word sense induction procedure is used to induce senses for all words, one at the time, to produce a disambiguated version of the graph where a word is now represented with one or many word senses. The concept of a disambiguated graph is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Biemann, 2012)</ref>. Finally, the disambiguated word sense graph is clustered globally to induce synsets, which are hard clusters of word senses.</p><p>More specifically, the method consists of five steps presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: (1) learning word embeddings; (2) constructing the ambiguous weighted graph of synonyms G; (3) inducing the word senses; (4) constructing the disambiguated weighted graph G by disambiguating of neigh- bors with respect to the induced word senses; (5) global clustering of the graph G .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Learning Word Embeddings</head><p>Since different graph clustering algorithms are sensitive to edge weighting, we consider distribu- tional semantic similarity based on word embed- dings as a possible edge weighting approach for our synonymy graph. As we show further, this approach improves over unweighted versions and yields the best overall results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Construction of a Synonymy Graph</head><p>We construct the synonymy graph G = (V, E) as follows. The set of nodes V includes every lexeme appearing in the input synonymy dictionaries. The set of undirected edges E is composed of all edges (u, v) ∈ V × V retrieved from one of the input synonymy dictionaries. We consider three edge weight representations:</p><p>• ones that assigns every edge the constant weight of 1;</p><p>• count that weights the edge (u, v) as the number of times the synonymy pair appeared in the input dictionaries;</p><p>• sim that assigns every edge (u, v) a weight equal to the cosine similarity of skip-gram word vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>As the graph G is likely to have polysemous words, the goal is to separate individual word senses using graph-based word sense induction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Local Clustering: Word Sense Induction</head><p>In order to facilitate global fuzzy clustering of the graph, we perform disambiguation of its ambigu- ous nodes as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. First, we use a graph-based word sense induction method that is similar to the curvature-based approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dorow and Widdows (2003)</ref>. In particular, removal of the nodes participating in many triangles tends to separate the original graph into several connected components. Thus, given a word u, we extract a network of its nearest neighbors from the syn- onymy graph G. Then, we remove the original word u from this network and run a hard graph clustering algorithm that assigns one node to one and only one cluster. In our experiments, we test Chinese Whispers and Markov Clustering. The expected result of this is that each cluster repre- sents a different sense of the word u, e.g.:</p><p>bank 1 {streambank, riverbank, . . . } bank 2 {bank company, . . . } bank 3 {bank building, building, . . . } bank 4 {coin bank, penny bank, . . . } We denote, e.g., bank 1 , bank 2 and other items as word senses referred to as senses(bank). We de- note as ctx(s) a cluster corresponding to the word sense s. Note that the context words have no sense labels. They are recovered by the disambiguation approach described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Disambiguation of Neighbors</head><p>Next, we disambiguate the neighbors of each in- duced sense. The previous step results in split- ting word nodes into (one or more) sense nodes. However, nearest neighbors of each sense node are still ambiguous, e.g., (bank 3 , building ? ). To re- cover these sense labels of the neighboring words, we employ the following sense disambiguation ap- proach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Faralli et al. (2016)</ref>. For each word u in the context ctx(s) of the sense s, we find the most similar sense of that wordûwordˆwordû to the context. We use the cosine similarity measure be- tween the context of the sense s and the context of each candidate sense u of the word u:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ u = arg max u ∈ senses(u) cos(ctx(s), ctx(u )). A context ctx(·)</formula><note type="other">is represented by a sparse vec- tor in a vector space of all ambiguous words of all contexts. The result is a disambiguated context ctx(s) in a space of disambiguated words derived from its ambiguous version ctx(s):</note><p>ctx(s) = {û : u ∈ ctx(s)}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Global Clustering: Synset Induction</head><p>Finally, we construct the word sense graph G = (V , E ) using the disambiguated senses instead of the original words and establishing the edges be- tween these disambiguated senses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V = u∈V senses(u), E = s∈V {s} × ctx(s).</formula><p>Running a hard clustering algorithm on G pro- duces the desired set of synsets as our final result. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the process of disambiguation of an input ambiguous graph on the example of the word "bank". As one may observe, disam- biguation of the nearest neighbors is a necessity to be able to construct a global version of the sense- aware graph. Note that current approaches to WSI, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Véronis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Biemann, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hope and Keller, 2013)</ref>, do not perform this step, but per- form only local clustering of the graph since they do not aim at a global representation of synsets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Local-Global Fuzzy Graph Clustering</head><p>While we use our approach to synset induction in this work, the core of our method is the "local- global" fuzzy graph clustering algorithm, which can be applied to arbitrary graphs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). This method, summarized in Algorithm 1, takes an undirected graph G = (V, E) as the input and outputs a set of fuzzy clusters of its nodes V . This is a meta-algorithm as it operates on top of two hard clustering algorithms denoted as Cluster local and Cluster global , such as CW or MCL. At the first phase of the algorithm, for each node its senses are induced via ego network clustering (lines 1- 7). Next, the disambiguation of each ego network is performed <ref type="figure">(lines 8-15)</ref>. Finally, the fuzzy clus- ters are obtained by applying the hard clustering algorithm to the disambiguated graph (line 16). As a post-processing step, the sense labels can be re- moved to make the cluster elements subsets of V .</p></div>

As a lexical ontology for Russian, we use RuWordNet 10 (Loukachevitch et al., 2016), containing both general vocabulary and domain- specific synsets related to sport, finance, eco- nomics, etc. Up to a half of the words in this re- source are multi-word expressions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kiselev et al., 2015)</ref>, which is due to the coverage of domain- specific vocabulary.

The resource is constructed using crowdsourcing and mostly cov- ers general vocabulary. Particularly, non-expert users are allowed to edit synsets in a collaborative way loosely supervised by a team of project cu- rators. Due to the ongoing development of the re-source, we selected as the gold standard only those synsets that were edited at least eight times in or- der to filter out noisy incomplete synsets.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Statistics of the gold standard datasets.</p></div>

While the hard clustering algorithms are able to discover clusters which correspond to synsets composed of unambigous words, they can produce wrong results in the presence of lexical ambiguity (one node belongs to several synsets).</p><p>In our experiments, we rely on our own implemen- tation of MaxMax and ECO as reference imple- mentations are not available. For CW <ref type="bibr">17</ref>    <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Tables 3 and 4.</ref> and CPM 19 , available implementations have been used. During the evaluation, we delete clusters equal or larger than the threshold of 150 words as they hardly can represent any meaningful synset. The notation WATSET[MCL, CW top ] means using MCL for local clustering and Chinese Whispers in the top mode for global clustering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Impact of Graph Weighting Schema</head><p>Figure 3 presents an overview of the evaluation re- sults on both datasets. The first step, common for all of the tested synset induction methods, is graph construction. Thus, we started with an analysis of three ways to weight edges of the graph introduced in Section 3.2: binary scores (ones), frequencies (count), and semantic similarity scores (sim) based on word vector similarity. Results across vari- ous configurations and methods indicate that us- ing the weights based on the similarity scores pro- vided by word embeddings is the best strategy for all methods except MaxMax on the English datasets. However, its performance using the ones weighting does not exceed the other methods us- ing the sim weighting. Therefore, we report all further results on the basis of the sim weights. The edge weighting scheme impacts Russian more for most algorithms. The CW algorithm however re- mains sensitive to the weighting also for the En- glish dataset due to its randomized nature. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> https://networkx.github.io <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> and 4 present evaluation results for both languages. For each method, we show the best configurations in terms of F-score. One may note that the granularity of the resulting synsets, es- pecially for Russian, is very different, ranging from 4 000 synsets for the CPM k = 3 method to 67 645 induced by the ECO method. Both ta- bles report the number of words, synsets and syn- onyms after pruning huge clusters larger than 150 words. Without this pruning, the MaxMax and CPM methods tend to discover giant components obtaining almost zero precision as we generate all possible pairs of nodes in such clusters. The other methods did not show such behavior. WATSET robustly outperforms all other meth- ods according to F-score on both English datasets <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 3</ref>) and on the YARN dataset for Russian <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 4)</ref>. Also, it outperforms all other meth- ods according to recall on both Russian datasets. The disambiguation of the input graph performed by the WATSET method splits nodes belonging to several local communities to several nodes, significantly facilitating the clustering task other- wise complicated by the presence of the hubs that wrongly link semantically unrelated nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Comparative Analysis</head><p>Interestingly, in all the cases, the toughest com- petitor was a hard clustering algorithm-MCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(van Dongen, 2000</ref>). We observed that the "plain" MCL successfully groups monosemous words, but   isolates the neighborhood of polysemous words, which results in the recall drop in comparison to WATSET. CW operates faster due to a simplified update step. On the same graph, CW tends to produce larger clusters than MCL. This leads to a higher recall of "plain" CW as compared to the "plain" MCL, at the cost of lower precision.</p><p>Using MCL instead of CW for sense induc- tion in WATSET expectedly produces more fine- grained senses. However, at the global clustering step, these senses erroneously tend to form coarse- grained synsets connecting unrelated senses of the ambiguous words. This explains the generally higher recall of WATSET <ref type="bibr">[MCL, ·]</ref>. Despite the randomized nature of CW, variance across runs do not affect the overall ranking: The rank of differ- ent versions of CW (log, nolog, top) can change, while the rank of the best CW configuration com- pared to other methods remains the same.</p><p>The MaxMax algorithm shows mixed results. On the one hand, it outputs large clusters uniting more than hundred nodes. This inevitably leads to a high recall, as it is clearly seen in the re- sults for Russian because such synsets still pass under our cluster size threshold of 150 words. Its synsets on English datasets are even larger and get pruned, which results in low recall. On the other hand, smaller synsets having at most 10-15 words were identified correctly. MaxMax appears to be extremely sensible to edge weighting, which also complicates its practical use.</p><p>The CPM algorithm showed unsatisfactory re- sults, emitting giant components encompassing thousands of words. Such clusters were automat- ically pruned, but the remaining clusters are rela- tively correctly built synsets, which is confirmed by the high values of precision. When increasing the minimal number of elements in the clique k, recall improves, but at the cost of a dramatic pre- cision drop. We suppose that the network structure assumptions exploited by CPM do not accurately model the structure of our synonymy graphs.</p><p>Finally, the ECO method yielded the worst re- sults because the most cluster candidates failed to pass through the constant threshold used for esti- mating whether a pair of words should be included in the same cluster. Most synsets produced by this method were trivial, i.e., containing only a single word. The remaining synsets for both languages have at most three words that have been connected by a chance due to the edge noising procedure used in this method resulting in low recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>On the absolute scores. The results obtained on all gold standards ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3)</ref> show similar trends in terms of relative ranking of the methods. Yet ab- solute scores of YARN and RuWordNet are sub- stantially different due to the inherent difference of these datasets. RuWordNet is more domain- specific in terms of vocabulary, so our input set of generic synonymy dictionaries has a limited cov- erage on this dataset. On the other hand, recall calculated on YARN is substantially higher as this resource was manually built on the basis of syn- onymy dictionaries used in our experiments.</p><p>The reason for low absolute numbers in evalua- tions is due to an inherent vocabulary mismatch between the input dictionaries of synonyms and the gold datasets. To validate this hypothesis, we performed a cross-resource evaluation presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>. The low performance of the cross- evaluation of the two resources supports the hy- pothesis: no single resource for Russian can obtain high recall scores on another one. Surprisingly, even BabelNet, which integrates most of available lexical resources, still does not reach a recall sub- stantially larger than 0.5. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Note that the results of this cross-dataset evaluation are not directly com- parable to results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> since in our experi- ments we use much smaller input dictionaries than those used by BabelNet.</p><p>On sparseness of the input dictionary. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref> presents some examples of the obtained synsets of various sizes for the top WATSET configuration on both languages. As one might observe, the qual- <ref type="bibr">20</ref> We used BabelNet 3.7 extracting all 3 497 327 synsets that were marked as Russian.</p><p>ity of the results is highly plausible. However, one limitation of all approaches considered in this pa- per is the dependence on the completeness of the input dictionary of synonyms. In some parts of the input synonymy graph, important bridges be- tween words can be missing, leading to smaller- than-desired synsets. A promising extension of the present methodology is using distributional mod- els to enhance connectivity of the graph by cau- tiously adding extra relations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a new robust approach to fuzzy graph clustering that relies on hard graph cluster- ing. Using ego network clustering, the nodes be- longing to several local communities are split into several nodes each belonging to one community. The transformed "disambiguated" graph is then clustered using an efficient hard graph clustering algorithm, obtaining a fuzzy clustering as the re- sult. The disambiguated graph facilitates cluster- ing as it contains fewer hubs connecting unrelated nodes from different communities. We apply this meta clustering algorithm to the task of synset in- duction on two languages, obtaining the best re- sults on three datasets and competitive results on one dataset in terms of F-score as compared to five state-of-the-art graph clustering methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Disambiguation of an ambiguous input graph using local clustering (WSI) to facilitate global clustering of words into synsets.</figDesc><graphic url="image-3.png" coords="4,72.00,62.81,226.77,273.74" type="bitmap" /></figure>
