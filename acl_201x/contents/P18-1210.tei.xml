				<p>Theories of discourse coherence posit relations between discourse segments as a key feature of coherent text. Our prior work suggests that multiple discourse relations can be simultaneously operative between two segments for reasons not predicted by the literature. Here we test how this joint presence can lead participants to endorse seemingly divergent conjunctions (e.g., but and so) to express the link they see between two segments. These apparent divergences are not symptomatic of participant naïveté or bias, but arise reliably from the concurrent availability of multiple relations between segments-some available through explicit signals and some via inference. We believe that these new results can both inform future progress in theoretical work on discourse coherence and lead to higher levels of performance in discourse parsing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A question that remains unresolved in work on discourse coherence is the nature and number of re- lations that can hold between clauses in a coherent text <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Halliday and Hasan, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Stede, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Our earlier work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rohde et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rohde et al., , 2016</ref> showed that, in the presence of explicit discourse adverbials, people also infer additional discourse relations that they take to hold jointly with those associated with the adverbials. For example, in:</p><p>(1) It's too far to walk. Instead let's take the bus.</p><p>people infer a RESULT relation in the context of the adverbial instead, which itself signals that the bus stands in a SUBSTITUTION relation to walking. We showed this using crowdsourced conjunction- insertion experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Rohde et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Rohde et al., , 2016</ref>, in which participants were asked to insert into the gap between two discourse segments, a conjunction that best expressed how they took the segments to be re- lated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rohde et al. (2017)</ref> also asked participants to select any other conjunctions that they took to con- vey the same sense as their "best" choice. (More details of these experiments are given in Section 3.)</p><p>All three studies showed participants selecting conjunctions whose sense differed from that of the explicit discourse adverbial. But <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rohde et al. (2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rohde et al. ( , 2016</ref> also showed participants often selecting con- junctions that signal different coherence relations than those selected by other participants. And <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rohde et al. (2017)</ref> showed participants often identi- fying very different conjunctions as conveying the same meaning. For example, in passage (2), with the discourse adverbial in other words, one large fraction of participants chose to insert OR, while another large fraction inserted SO. Since the two are neither synonymous nor representative of the same relation, either the participants have come up with different analyses of the passages (Section 2) or something more surprising is at work.</p><p>(2) Unfortunately, nearly 75,000 acres of tropical forest are converted or deforested every day ______ in other words an area the size of Central Park disappears every 16 minutes. <ref type="bibr">[SO∼OR]</ref> Rohde et al. (2017) noted other cases where dif- ferent pairs of conjunctions (e.g., BECAUSE and BUT, BUT and OR, and BECAUSE and OR) ap- pear systematically across participants and across passages for particular adverbials, and speculated on what these odd pairings may reveal, but did not provide any empirical evidence for why this happens. Here we present such evidence from an experiment on three discourse adverbials (in other words, otherwise, and instead).</p><p>After describing related work on multiple dis- course relations (Section 2) and then our experi- mental methodology (Section 3), we step through results for these three adverbials. As a final piece of evidence, we manipulate the presence and ab- sence of a fourth adverbial, after all, in order to demonstrate that inference of the relation(s) be- tween segments in a passage is not always driven by the presence of such an adverbial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>This is not the first work on discourse coherence to acknowledge the possibility of multiple relations holding between given discourse segments.</p><p>For example, the developers of Rhetorical Struc- ture Theory acknowledged that even experienced RST analysts may interpret a text differently in terms of the relations they take to hold <ref type="bibr">(Mann and Thompson, 1988, p. 265)</ref>. But while RST allows for multiple alternative analyses of a text in terms of discourse relations, in practice, researchers work- ing in the RST framework standardly produce a single analysis of a text, with a single relational labeling, selecting the analysis that is "most plau- sible in terms of the perceived goals of the writer" ( <ref type="bibr">Mann et al., 1989, pp. 34-35)</ref>. If that single an- alysis is later mapped into a different structure to support further processing -e.g., a binary branch- ing tree structure -the mapping does not change the chosen relational labeling.</p><p>Multiple relations may additionally hold in theo- ries of discourse coherence that posit multiple lev- els of text analysis. For example, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Grosz and Sidner (1986)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Moore and Pollack (1992)</ref> char- acterized text as having both an informational struc- ture (relating information conveyed by discourse segments) and an intentional structure (relating the functions of those segments with respect to what the speaker is trying to accomplish through the text). The kinds of relations at the two levels are different, as can be seen in the following example from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Moore and Pollack, 1992,</ref>  At the level of intentions, (3a) aims to provide EVI- DENCE for the claim in (3b), while at an informa- tional level, (3a) serves as the CAUSE of the situa- tion in (3b). RST would force annotators to choose only the analysis that best reflected the perceived goals of the writer. Additionally, multiple relations can hold where there are distinct explicit signals for distinct dis- course relations holding between a pair of segments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cuenca and Marin, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fraser, 2013)</ref>, as in: where the conjunction so signals a RESULT relation and the adverbial instead signals that taking the bus stands in an SUBSTITUTION relation to walking.</p><p>Finally, a fourth way in which the previous lit- erature has taken multiple discourse relations to hold is when a single phrase or lexico-syntactic construction jointly signals multiple discourse re- lations as holding over a text -for example, since as a subordinating conjunction may, in particular contexts, signal both a TEMPORAL relation and a CAUSAL relation, rather than just one or the other ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Miltsakaki et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>We are aware of only two resources that allow more than one discourse relation to be annotated between two segments -the Penn Discourse Tree- Bank (PDTB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Prasad et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Prasad et al., , 2014</ref>) and, more recently, the BECauSE Corpus 2.0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Dunietz et al., 2017)</ref>. The PDTB allows multiple discourse re- lations of the third and fourth types noted above. It also allows them to be annotated if there is no explicit connective between a pair of segments but annotators see more than one sense relation as link- ing them, as in the following variant of (4): Here a RESULT relation can be associated with an implicit token of so between the clauses, while a SUBSTITUTION relation can be associated with an implicit token of instead. The above are the main cases in which PDTB annotates multiple relations. Relevant to this paper, the PDTB does not anno- tate implicit conjunction relations where there is already an explicit discourse adverbial. Thus the PDTB would either ignore the implicit RESULT re- lation for (1) or (incorrectly) annotate instead in (1) as conveying both <ref type="bibr">SUBSTITUTION and RESULT.</ref> Moreover, while the PDTB has been used in training many (but not all) discourse parsers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Marcu, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Feng and Hirst, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xue et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xue et al., , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014)</ref>, discourse parsing has for the most part ig- nored its annotations of multiple concurrent rela- tions between clauses, except in the case of distinct explicit connectives expressing distinct relations. Instead, they have arbitrarily taken just a single re- lation to hold, even though the relations are simply recorded in an a priori canonical order. This prac- tice is problematic because, for example, there may well be a difference in the properties of segments where two relations are jointly seen to hold, ver- sus those segments in which only one or the other holds. This can result in unwanted noise in the data and lower the reliability of whatever is induced.</p><p>While our previous studies showed another source of multiple discourse relations holding con-currently between discourse segments, the work reported here explains how, in the context of mul- tiple relations, participants can take very different conjunctions to be conveying the same relation, and what can change participants' selection of a con- junction to mark the relation they infer alongside that conveyed by an explicit discourse adverbial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>A locally crowdsourced conjunction-insertion task provided a proxy for labelling relations between adjacent discourse segments within a passage.</p><p>Our materials consisted of passages containing an explicit discourse adverbial, preceded by a gap, which effectively separated the passage into two segments. The passages consisted of 16 with in other words, 16 with instead, 16 with after all, and 48 with otherwise. Participants were asked to read each passage and choose the conjunction(s) that best expressed how the two segments link together. The presentation of conjunction choices varied in order for each participant, but always consisted of AND, BECAUSE, BUT, OR, SO, NONE. While the task admittedly encourages participants to se- lect one (or more) conjunctions, our prior work has shown that participants are very willing to use NONE if no conjunction is appropriate. We there- fore take their insertion of a conjunction as their en- dorsement of the relation signaled by that conjunc- tion. To further control data quality, we included 6 catch trials with an expected correct conjunction like "To be ______ not to be".</p><p>Three of the explicit discourse adverbials that we chose are anaphoric: in other words, other- wise, and instead ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Webber et al., 2000</ref>). Unlike conjunctions such as AND, BECAUSE, BUT, OR and SO, they are not constrained by structure as to what they establish discourse relations with. So a conjunction-insertion task can be used to assess links between the segments (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Scholman and Demberg 2017)</ref>. Our three anaphoric adverbials share a core meaning of 'otherness' via their lexical semantics and flexibility in the relations they can participate in, making them a fruitful set to com- pare. The fourth adverbial, after all, allows us to test a hypothesis that the inferred connection be- tween clauses is not driven by the adverbial alone.</p><p>These particular adverbials were selected be- cause they had yielded unexpected combinations of conjunction insertions in our prior work (e.g., OR/SO with in other words). This is in con- trast to adverbials like therefore and neverthe- less, for which participants' conjunction combi- nations could be attributed to variation in the speci- ficity of the conjunctions (SO/AND for therefore, BUT/AND for nevertheless). For our selection of a set of conjunctions to use as proxies for relation labels, we included all the coordinating conjunc- tions in English, as well as the subordinating con- junction BECAUSE as EXPLANATION relations are frequent.</p><p>All participants (N=28) were monolingual na- tive English speakers who were selected following a pre-test to measure their ability to consistently insert conjunctions that captured the underlying co- herence relations in a series of passages. All gave informed consent. They each received £50 for their time. Each participant saw one of two randomly ordered lists. Passages were presented in batches of 34, one batch per day for three days.</p><p>The materials were simplified variants of natu- rally occurring passages. Some were also manipu- lated systematically, in ways aimed at altering the availability of different coherence relations. Pas- sages are available via the "dataset" link on the paper in the ACL anthology, and predictions about them are laid out in Sections 4.1-4.4. The in other words passages of the current ex- periment tested two linked hypotheses: The first is that OR∼SO response splits arise from two com- ponents of the lexical semantics of the adverbial itself: its sense of an evoked alternative and its sense of a consequence via restatement, whereby the truth of the second segment holds because it provides a reformulated restatement of the first seg- ment's content. For passage <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>, this corresponds to the deforestation of 75,000 acres of tropical forest entailing the disappearance of an area the size of Central Park every 16 minutes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">In other words Dataset</head><p>The second hypothesis is that the prevalence of and substitutability between SO and OR in (2) de- pends on the immediately adjacency of the two seg- ments. This was suggested by participant choices of BUT (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>), as well as the observation that in other words does not always license OR via its lexical semantics and SO via entailment, as shown in <ref type="formula">(6)</ref>, where BUT has become more avail- able. Note that none of the relations conveyed by these conjunctions (CONTRAST or CONCESSION for BUT, DISJUNCTION for OR, CONSEQUENCE for SO) are already conveyed by the adverbial itself, which for in other words) would be RESTATEMENT. We tested these hypotheses by creating mini- mal pairs of 16 passages containing in other words. The pairs varied in the presence/absence of a meta- linguistic comment intervening between the origi- nal description and its reformulation, as in <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>-(8). For each passage, participants identified their preferred conjunction and then any others that they took to convey the same sense. Half the partici- pants saw a given passage with no intervening meta- linguistic comment, half with.</p><p>If our hypotheses are confirmed, it will show that manipulating the immediately preceding seg- ment can shift participants' preference from rela- tions associated with OR and SO (ALTERNATIVE and CONSEQUENCE) to relations of CONTRAST or CONCESSION. This would then be evidence that adjacency affects what coherence relations partici- pants take to be available.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 2)</ref>. Given that otherwise has several different functions (de- scribed below), we hypothesize that different re- sponse splits arise from the lexical semantics of otherwise, combined with inference as to the func- tion of the otherwise clause in a given passage.</p><p>One function of otherwise is in ARGUMENTA- TION. Here, an otherwise clause provides a reason for a given claim, as in <ref type="formula">(9)</ref>. Another function is in ENUMERATION, when the speaker first gives some preferred or more salient options, the otherwise clause introduces other alternative options, as in (10). A third use is in expressing an EXCEPTION to a generalization. Here, the main clause expresses a generalization, while otherwise clause specifies an exception (disjunctive alternative) to it, as in (11).</p><p>(9) Proper placement of the testing device is an important issue ______ otherwise the test results will be inaccu- rate.</p><p>(10) A baked potato, plonked on a side plate with sour cream flecked with chives, is the perfect accompani- ment ______ otherwise you could serve a green salad and some good country bread.</p><p>(11) Mr. Lurie and Mr. Jarmusch actually catch a shark, a thrashing 10-footer ______ otherwise the action is light.</p><p>Results presented in (Rohde et al., 2017) for passages like (9) showed participant judgments of OR and BECAUSE, but not BUT. Passages like (10) yielded pairings of OR and BUT, but not BECAUSE. Lastly, passages like (11) yielded re- sponse splits between BUT and the less specific AND <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Knott, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Note that due to overlaps in conjunction choice, some conjunctions cannot be unambiguously as- sociated with a single use of otherwise: While BECAUSE may unambiguously signal that a parti- cipant has inferred ARGUMENTATION, OR might indicate inference of either ARGUMENTATION or ENUMERATION. Thus we probe both participant choices of connectives and (via paraphrase) the use of otherwise that they take to hold.</p><p>We chose 16 passages for each use of otherwise, based on our own category judgments. For each passage, we asked participants to select the con- junction that best expressed how its two segments were related, and then any other connectives that they took to express the same thing.</p><p>A paraphrase task was then used as further ev- idence for the relation participants inferred in the otherwise passages. After completing a given ses- sion's batch of passages, participants were asked to select which of three options they took to be a valid paraphrase of the passage. Each use of other- wise was assigned a distinct paraphrase to link the left-hand and right-hand segments (LHS, RHS).</p><p>• ARGUMENTATION: "A reason for LHS is RHS."</p><p>• EXCEPTION: "Generally RHS. An excep- tion is when LHS."</p><p>• ENUMERATION: "There's more than one good option for goal. They are: LHS, RHS."</p><p>We also allowed participants to choose a second paraphrase if they thought it appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Instead Dataset</head><p>Rohde et al. (2016) report a range of participant choices in conjunction-insertion passages involv- ing instead <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 3</ref>). For passages on the left of the figure, participants uniformly chose BUT, while the passage on the far right yielded a strong preference for SO. Elsewhere, some chose BUT and some chose SO. (For the current experiment, we ignore the fact that AND can contingently sub- stitute for either BUT or SO as a connective in text <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Knott, 1996)</ref> Neither the inter-participant split between BUT and SO in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rohde et al., 2016</ref>) nor the intra- participant split between them ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rohde et al., 2017)</ref> can be explained in terms of instead itself, since instead simply conveys that what follows is an al- ternative to an unrealised situation in the context ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Prasad et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Webber, 2013)</ref>. The current experiment tests the hypothesis that this BUT∼SO split is a consequence of inference from properties of the segments themselves.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we created 16 mini- mal pairs of passages containing instead, one of which emphasized the information structural par- allelism between the clauses, as in (13a), and an- other variant (13b) that de-emphasized that par- allelism in favor of a causal link implied by a downward-entailing construction such as too X (Webber, 2013). For each passage, half the partici- pants saw the parallelism variant in the conjunction- insertion task, while half saw the causal variant.</p><p>(13) a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">After all Dataset</head><p>In (Rohde et al., 2017), we reported a BECAUSE∼BUT response split for passages containing after all. We speculated that this may be because a passage such as (14) below presents an argument in which the second segment serves as a REASON (hence, BECAUSE) for the first segment, but also serves to CONTRAST with it (hence, BUT).</p><p>(14) Yes, I suppose there's a certain element of danger in it ______ (after all) there's a certain amount of danger in living, whatever you do.</p><p>We hypothesize that the BECAUSE∼BUT split cannot be a consequence of the adverbial after all, which the Cambridge Dictionary indicates is "used to add information that shows that what you have just said is true". 1 If REASON and/or CONTRAST  are being conveyed, it can't be a consequence of after all. As such, this response split must depend on the reasoning that supports the inference of co- herence between the two segments, separate from the adverbial itself.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P no_intervening</formula><p>We test the hypothesis that the response split is independent of the presence or absence of after all. Starting with 16 passages that originally contained after all, we created a variant of each passage with- out the adverbial. The conjunction insertion task was the same as with the other datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">In other words: Inference and adjacency</head><p>Section 4.1 lays out the joint hypotheses that in- ferred relations in passages with in other words reflect two components of the lexical semantics of the adverbial (leading to the OR∼SO split) and that the presence of intervening material before in other words reduces the availability of those relations, favoring BUT instead. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> shows the predicted pattern: The no-intervening-content condition primarily yields OR/SO responses (with variation across passages on the OR-vs.-SO preference) with a relative in- crease in BUT responses in the intervening-content condition. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Passage B corresponds to the pair of examples (2)/(6), and passage C reflects (7)/(8).</p><p>For the analysis here and in Section 5.3, a rele- vant first-choice conjunction was chosen and the binary outcome of its insertion was modeled with a mixed-effect logistic regression. Here, the insertion of OR indeed varied with the presence/absence of intervening material (β = −1.569, p &lt; 0.005).</p><p>We posit that increases in BUT associated with the intervening content indicate either an interrup- tion of the meta-linguistic tangent or an intention to signal a contrast with the negative affect of the tangent itself (e.g., "I don't know where. . . ", "frus- trating way of putting it", "how this is measured is unclear"). We speculate that the presence of BE- CAUSE in passages with intervening content may arise when that content implies that the situation is somehow surprising, which in turn merits ex- planation (e.g., "it's an UNUSUAL role for her", "their ability to actually work sensitively is perhaps QUESTIONABLE", "it's STRANGE to think of a planet being born"). These hypotheses will them- selves need to be tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Otherwise: Inference from semantic features of segments</head><p>As noted in Section 4.2, passages containing oth- erwise were used to test how semantic properties of the segments themselves influenced conjunction choice.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 5</ref>), the effect is uniformly strong, with all passages showing BECAUSE or OR as        Figure 7: Distribution of first and second choice conjunctions for ENUMERATION otherwise.

Any hypotheses, however, would require further experimentation to test. For example, in passage M (see <ref type="formula">(15)</ref>) and P (see <ref type="formula">(16)</ref>), participants rarely identified any conjunction as conveying the same sense as BUT. However, when their top choice was BECAUSE, they also selected OR as conveying the same sense. As noted above, BECAUSE and OR predominate with otherwise used in ARGUMENTATION. This raises the question of why passages M and P lead some participants to infer ARGUMENTATION and other participants, either EXCEPTION or ENUMERATION.</p><p>(15) Democrats insist that the poor should be the priority, and that tax relief should be directed at them _____ otherwise they lack a cogent vision of the needs of a new economy.</p><p>(16) He said that the proposed bill would give states more flexibility in deciding whether they wanted to use the Federal money for outright grants to municipalities or to set up loan programs _____ otherwise it left last fall's Congressional legislation unchanged.</p><p>Finally, though the pattern for ENUMERATION <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 7)</ref> is harder to see, combinations of BUT, OR and AND predominate as participants' top choices, with a few tokens of BECAUSE and SO, but too few to analyse as anything but noise.</p><p>The above results reflect researcher-assigned use labels. However, the confusion matrix in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows that on the whole, participants agree with that assignment. The column labelled Multiple is for cases where participants offered two para- phrases. For ARGUMENTATION, at least one para- phrase always corresponded to EXCEPTION, while for ENUMERATION, it did so for most of these to- kens (9/14). We comment on this below.</p><p>While there was less agreement when partici- pants offered multiple paraphrases for researcher- assigned EXCEPTION, there may be too few to- kens here to draw any kind of conclusion. In any case, the results for ARGUMENTATION and ENU- MERATION agree both across participants (in what paraphrase they choose when they don't choose the researcher-assigned label) and within partici- pants (in what pairs of paraphrases they gave for the original passage).</p><p>The above results support our hypothesis that variability in participants' choice of conjunctions follows from both the lexical semantics of other- wise and the relation that participants infer between the segments in the passage.</p></div>

Section 4.3). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref> shows that in all cases, the parallel variant yielded more BUT re- sponses, whereas the non-parallel (causal) variant yielded significantly more SO responses (main ef- fect of (non-)parallelism: β=−7.0008, p&lt;0.001).  b. Smugglers' overland passages nowadays are too visible _____ instead they use the seas to transport their goods.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial with_adverbial no_adverbial</formula><p>One possible explanation is that participants var- ied in the role they assigned to the positive claim in the second segment of (18a) -either as a reason for the negative claim in the first segment (BECAUSE), as a contrast with that claim (BUT), or as its result (SO). Although manipulating the segment to en- hance either parallelism or causality can change participant responses, it is clear that parallelism alone doesn't guarantee contrast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.4</head><p>After all: Adverb adds little to inference <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 9</ref> shows participant choice of conjunction when after all is present and when it is absent. Their choice is largely the same for passages A-F and K-N, with and without the adverbial. As for passage O, since AND can contingently substitute for BUT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Knott, 1996)</ref>, the response pattern can be considered the same as well. A by-passage cor- relation between the rate of BUT and BECAUSE responses across the two conditions confirms this similarity (R 2 =.70, F(1,13)=30.98, p&lt;0.001). The outlier is passage G: <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> There was a testy moment driving over the George Wash- ington Bridge when the toll-taker charged him $24 for his truck and trailer _____ after all it was New York.</p><p>With after all, the majority of participants chose BUT as best expressing how the two segments are connected, while without it, the majority chose BE- CAUSE. Whatever explanation we gave here would be pure speculation. We trust that the fact that the other 14 passages demonstrate the predicted effect provides sufficient evidence that splits in partici- pant responses are not simply a result of the pres- ence of a discourse adverbial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>While our previous work showed that multiple dis- course relations can hold between two segments -relations at the same semantic level, simultane- ously available to a reader -we provided no evi- dence as to what influences the particular relations that are taken to be available. Our current experi- ments have provided some such evidence. Specif- ically, we have shown that participant responses to systematically manipulated passages involving discourse adverbials can be explained in terms of both the lexical semantics of discourse adverbials and properties of the passages that contain them. As the conjunctions chosen by participants con- vey senses that differ from those of the discourse adverbials, we also provided evidence for the simul- taneous availability of multiple coherence relations that arise from both explicit signals and inference. We hope the reader is now convinced that, in both psycholinguistic research on discourse coherence and computational work on discourse parsing, one needs to identify and examine evidence for coher- ence involving more than one discourse relation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 4 )</head><label>4</label><figDesc>It's too far to walk.

(2016) report surprising response splits amongst BECAUSE∼BUT∼OR for otherwise in their conjunction-insertion data (Figure 2). Given that otherwise has several different functions (described below), we hypothesize that different response splits arise from the lexical semantics of otherwise, combined with inference as to the function of the otherwise clause in a given passage. One function of otherwise is in ARGUMENTATION. Here, an otherwise clause provides a reason for a given claim, as in (9). Another function is in ENUMERATION, when the speaker first gives some preferred or more salient options, the otherwise clause introduces other alternative options, as in (10). A third use is in expressing an EXCEPTION to a generalization. Here, the main clause expresses a generalization, while otherwise clause specifies an exception (disjunctive alternative) to it, as in (11).</figDesc></figure>
