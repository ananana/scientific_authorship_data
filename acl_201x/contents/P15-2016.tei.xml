				<p>A wide array of natural dialogue discourse can be found on the internet. Previous attempts to automatically determine disagreement between interlocutors in such dialogue have mostly relied on n-gram and grammatical dependency features taken from respondent text. Agreement-disagreement classifiers built upon these baseline features tend to do poorly, yet have proven difficult to improve upon. Using the Internet Argument Corpus, which comprises quote and response post pairs taken from an online debate forum with human-annotated agreement scoring, we introduce semantic environment features derived by comparing quote and response sentences which align well. We show that this method improves classifier accuracy relative to the baseline method namely in the retrieval of disagreeing pairs, which improves from 69% to 77%.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>To achieve robust text understanding, natural lan- guage processing systems need to automatically extract information that is expressed indirectly. Here we focus on identifying agreement and dis- agreement in online debate posts. Previous work on this task has used very shallow linguistic anal- ysis: features are surface-level ones, such as n- grams, post initial unigrams, bigrams and tri- grams (which aim at learning the discourse func- tions of discourse markers, e.g., well, really, you know), repeated sequential use of punctuation signs (e.g., !!, ?!). When automatically detecting (dis)agreement, these features fall short, reaching around 65% accuracy on a balanced dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbott et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Misra and Walker, 2013)</ref>. Adding extra-linguistic features, such as the structure of the post threads and stance of the post's author on other subjects, boosts performance to 75% <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hasan and Ng, 2013)</ref>. In this work, we leverage richer linguistic models to increase performance.</p><p>Agreement may be explicitly marked. In ex- ample (1) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, the response-initial bigram I agree is a strong cue of agreement that surface features can learn, but there are more complex ex- amples that surface features cannot capture. In ex- ample (2), the response-initial word Yes is not indi- cating agreement, despite being in general a good cue for it. Instead it is necessary to capture the po- larity mismatch between the first sentence in the quote and the first sentence in the response (God doesn't take away sinful desires vs. Yes, God does take away sinful desires) to infer that the response disagrees with the quote. There may also be mis- matches of modality, as demonstrated in the third example (saw vs. may have believed). Here we also see an example of an explicit agreement word which is negated (that does not make it true) in a way that most surface features fail to capture.</p><p>Some discourse-level parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Joty et al., 2013</ref>) has been utilized in agreement detection, but most previous work does not take discourse structure into account: the response post is simply taken as a whole as the reply to the quote. To overcome this issue, we take advantage of the considerable progress in monolingual alignment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Thadani et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Yao et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Sultan et al. 2014</ref>) which allows us to align sentences of the quote to sentences in the response. This approach is rem- iniscent of the one used for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Dagan et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Giampiccolo et al. 2007</ref>) where, given two short passages, sys- tems identify whether the second passage follows from the first one according to the intuitions of an intelligent human reader. One common approach used in RTE was to align the two passages, and reason based on the alignment obtained.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1 CCW LAWS ARE FOR TRACKING GUN OWN- ERS WHO EXERCISE THIER RIGHTS!!!  I agree. What is the point? Felons with firearms do  not bother with CCW licenses.  2.5</ref> 2 God doesn't take away sinful desires. You've never had sinful desires? I know I have. People assume that when you become a Christian some manner of shield gets put up around you and shields you from "worldly" things. I believe that's wrong, I actually believe that life as a Christian is very hard. We often pawn it off as the end of our troubles to "convert" people. I don't believe it.</p><p>Yes, God does take away sinful desires. (If you ask Him.) I'm not saying that it doesn't take any work on your part, though. When you have a sinful de- sire, you allow a thought to become more than just a stray idea. You foster and encourage the thought and it becomes a desire. God takes away the de- sires, helps you deal with your "stray thoughts", and shows you how to keep them from becoming desires. -1.7</p><p>3 Your idea about science is a philosophy of science.</p><p>[...] The Apostles saw Jesus walk on water. There was no 'measure' by your version of science, but what they saw remains true.</p><p>Many people once believed that the earth is flat: perhaps some still do.</p><p>[...] The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water: that does NOT make it true.</p><p>-2</p><p>4 does life end here? end where? ambiguously phrased. if "here" = "death", then yes! by definition, yes! -1.4</p><p>5 Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?</p><p>Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause's force's in action.</p><p>[...] But since it is un- derstood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone.</p><p>2.8 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: QR pairs from the Internet Argument Corpus.</p><p>Here, similarly, once we have identified sen- tences in the response which align well with sen- tences in the quote, it becomes easier to extract deep semantic features such as polarity and modal- ity mismatch between sentences as well as em- beddings under modality, negation, or attitude verbs. For instance, in example (2) in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the first sentence in the quote gets aligned with high probability to the first sentence in the response, which enables us to identify the polarity mismatch (doesn't vs. does). In example (3), the italicized sentences are the most well-aligned, enabling us to identify that the response's author embeds under modality the event of Jesus walking on water and thus does not take it as a fact, whereas the quote's author does take it as a fact.</p><p>Our experiments demonstrate that our linguis- tic model based on alignment significantly out- performs a baseline bag-of-words model in the recall of disagreeing quote-response (QR) pairs. Such linguistic models will transfer more easily to any debate dialogue, independent of the structural information of post threads and author's stance which might not always be recoverable.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>We used the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC), a corpus of quote-response pairs annotated for agreement via Mechanical Turk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Walker et al., 2012)</ref>. Agreement scores span from -5 (strong dis- agreement) and +5 (strong agreement). The distri- bution is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>. Because the original data skews toward disagreement, following Abbott et al. (2011), we created a balanced set, discarding "neutral" pairs between -1 and +1. We split the data into training, development and test sets. 1 <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Ta- ble 2</ref> shows the category counts in the training set.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Features</head><p>In this section, we detail the features of our model. We use the maximum entropy model as imple- mented in the Stanford CoreNLP toolset <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Manning and Klein, 2003</ref>). Many of the features make use of the typed dependencies from the CoreNLP toolset <ref type="table">(de Marneffe et</ref>  Typed Dependencies and MPQA. In addi- tion to all dependencies from the response be- ing used as features, dependencies were supple- mented with MPQA sentiment values ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Wilson et al., 2005)</ref>. A dependency like (agree,I) would also yield the sentiment-dependency feature (pos- itive,I), whereas (wrong, you) would also yield (negative,you).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Punctuation. The presence of special punctu- ation such as repeated exclamation points (!!), question marks (??), and interrobang strings (?!)</head><p>were tracked as binary features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Alignment+ Features</head><p>Our features utilize focal sentences: not only well- aligned sentences from the quote and response, but also the first sentence of the response in general.</p><p>Tracking certain features in initial and aligned sen- tences proved more informative than doing the same without discerning location. Alignment scoring comes from running the Ja- cana aligner ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Yao et al., 2013</ref>) pairwise on every sentence from each QR pair. Pairs of quote and response sentences with alignment scores above a threshold tuned on the development set are then analyzed for feature extraction. The sentence pair with the maximum alignment score for each post pair is also analyzed regardless of its meeting the threshold.</p><p>Post Length. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Misra and Walker (2013)</ref>, we track various length features such as word count, sentence count, and average sentence length, including differentials of these measures between quote and response. Short responses (rel- ative to both word-wise and sentence-wise counts) tend to correlate with agreement, while longer re- sponses tend to correlate with disagreement.</p><p>Emoticons. Emoticons are a popular way of communicating sentiment in internet text. Many emoticons in the corpus are in forum-specific code, such as emoticon rolleyes. We also detect a wider array of common emoticons as regular ex- pressions beginning with colons, semicolons, or equals signs, such as :-D, ;), and =).</p><p>Speech Acts. To account for phenomena such as commands (e.g., please read carefully, try again, and define evil) and the rhetorical use of multi- ple questions in a row, we use punctuation, depen- dencies, and phrase-level analysis to automatically detect and count interrogative and imperative sen- tences. A phrase-structure tree headed by SQ or a sentence-final question mark means a sentence is considered interrogative; if a sentence's root is la- beled VB and has no subject relation, it is deemed an imperative. The features in the classifier are counts of the instances of interrogatives and im- peratives in the response.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Accuracy, precision (P), recall (R) and F1 scores for both categories (agreement and disagree- ment) on the test set.</p><p>Personal Pronouns. The presence of first, sec- ond, and third person pronouns in the response are each tracked as binary features. The inclusion of personal pronouns in a post tends to indicate a more emotional or personal argument, especially second person pronouns.</p><p>Explicit Truth Values. Rather than simply re- lying on n-gram-based tracking of explicit state- ments of agreement, we include as features polar (positive or negative) and modal (modal or non- modal) context of instances of the words agree, disagree, true, false, right, and wrong found in the response, parallel to the agreement and denial tracking in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Misra and Walker (2013)</ref>. Polar con- text is determined by the presence or absence of negation modifiers (e.g., not, never) in the depen- dencies; modal context is determined by the pres- ence of modal auxiliaries (e.g., might, could) and adverbs (e.g., possibly).</p><p>Sentiment Scoring. Expanding on the use of MPQA sentiment values, we use the posi- tive/negative/neutral and strong/weak classifica- tions of the words in the MPQA lexicon to cal- culate sentiment scores of the posts and focal sen- tences (well-aligned sentences from the quote and response as well as the first sentence of the re- sponse). The scoring assigns a value to each MPQA word in the quote or response: the posi- tive/negative label of a word means a positive or negative score and the strong/weak label deter- mines the weight: whether the word is worth +/-2 or +/-1. The sum of these values is computed as the sentiment score. A score is generated for both the response and quote in their entireties as well as for focal sentences.</p><p>Discourse Markers. Initial 1, 2 and 3-grams are tracked relative to focal sentences. This picks up on discourse markers (such as well and but) with- out having to explicitly code for each marker we want to track. Punctuation. As in the baseline, the presence of special punctuation like !! and ?! are used as bi- nary features.</p><p>Factuality Comparison. Given aligned words from well-aligned sentences in the quote and re- sponse (e.g., God doesn't take away sinful de- sires and Yes, God does take away sinful desires), we analyze the polarity, modality, and any sub- sequent contradiction of both the quote and re- sponse instances. As with the analysis of explicit truth value words, polarity and modality are de- termined according to the presence or absence of negation and modal modifiers (auxiliaries and ad- verbs) in the dependencies. Contradictions are tracked as phrases marked with known contradic- tory adverbs and conjunctions (e.g., however..., but...). An aligned word pair is analyzed if it in- volves content words, or if the words serve as the root of their sentence's dependency structure re- gardless of part of speech. The features generated indicate the part of speech of the word in the quote and whether there is (1) a polarity match/clash, (2) a modality match/clash, or (3) any contradiction phrases immediately following the word or sen- tence in the quote or response.</p><p>97 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> compares the results obtained with the baseline features and the alignment+ features. The alignment+ features lead to an overall improve- ment, but a statistically significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05, McNemar's test) is only achieved for classifying disagreeing pairs. The baseline model underclassifies for disagreement and overclassi- fies for agreement, but the alignment+ model does well on both. As most cases of high alignment do, indeed, correspond with disagreement, these fea- tures are better in picking up on disagreement in general. The ROC curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref> shows that the alignment+ classifier consistently has a higher sensitivity (true-positive) rate than the baseline. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows for both feature sets (baseline and alignment+) the correct (gray bar) and incor- rect (black bar) classifications on the test set, by agreement score. The agreement score is predic- tive of the correctness of the system (confirmed by a logistic regression predicting system accuracy given strength of agreement score, p &lt; 0.001): the stronger the (dis)agreement score, the more accu- rate the system is. The alignment+ features help classify accurately the less strong (dis)agreements.</p><p>Examples <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> are incorrectly classified by the baseline but correctly by the alignment+ classifier. In (4), the strongest feature in the baseline is the unigram yes, but the align- ment+ features compare does life end here? to end where?, and the fact that the aligned sentence in the response is a question suggests disagreement. Example (5) shows that superficial features like a response-initial yes are not always enough, even when the pair is indeed in agreement. Here the alignment+ model aligns the italic sentences (Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb? and [...]the word channel cannot be called teleo- logical), finding them to be in agreement and thus getting the correct classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>The incorporation of alignment-based features shows promise in improving agreement classifica- tion. Further ablation testing is needed to deter- mine the full extent to which alignment features contribute, and not only better whole-post features on their own. However, given that many pairs do not have sentences which align at all, alignment features cannot classify on their own without some more basic features to fill in the gaps.  Following previous work, we focused on pairs judged as being in strong (dis)agreement. How do systems fare when uncertain cases are present in the training data? This has not been investi- gated. One aspect of language interpretation, how- ever, is its inherent uncertainty. In future work, we will use the full IAC corpus, and instead of drawing a binary distinction between strong agree- ments and disagreements, have a three-way classi- fication where unclear instances are also catego- rized.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Agreement score distribution of the dataset, before and after balancing.-5 is high disagreement, +5 is high agreement.</figDesc></figure>
