				<p>In this paper we present a novel framework for morpheme segmentation which uses the morpho-syntactic regularities preserved by word representations, in addition to orthographic features, to segment words into morphemes. This framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. We also analyze the deficiencies of available benchmarking datasets and introduce our own dataset that was created on the basis of compositionality. We validate our algorithm across different datasets and languages and present new state-of-the-art results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Morpheme segmentation is a core natural lan- guage processing (NLP) task used as an inte- gral component in related-fields such as infor- mation retrieval (IR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zieman and Bleich, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kurimo et al., 2007)</ref>, automatic speech recog- nition (ASR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kurimo et al., 2006</ref>), and machine translation (MT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lee, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Virpioja et al., 2007</ref>). Most previ- ous works have relied solely on orthographic fea- tures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harris, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goldsmith, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Creutz and Lagus, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, 2005</ref>, neglecting the under- lying semantic information. This has led to an over-segmentation of words because a change of the surface form pattern is a necessary but insuffi- cient indication of a morphological change. For example, the surface form of "freshman", hints that it should be segmented to "fresh-man", al- though "freshman" does not describe semantically the compositional meaning of "fresh" and "man".</p><p>To compensate for this lack of semantic knowl- edge, previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schone and Jurafsky, 2000</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Narasimhan et al., 2015</ref>) have incorporated semantic knowledge lo- cally by checking the semantic relatedness of possibly morphologically related pair of words. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Narasimhan et al. (2015)</ref> check for semantic relat- edness using cosine similarity in word represen- tations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mikolov et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>. A limitation of such an approach is the inherent "sample noise" in specific word repre- sentations (exacerbated in the case of rare words). Moreover, limitation to local comparison enforces modeling morphological relations via semantic re- latedness, although it has been shown that differ- ence vectors model morphological relations more accurately ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>). To address this issue, we introduce a new framework (MORSE), the first to bring semantics into morpheme seg- mentation both on a local and a vocabulary-wide level. That is, when checking for the morpho- logical relation between two words, we not only check for the semantic relatedness of the pair at hand (local), but also check if the difference vec- tors of pairs showing similar orthographic change are consistent (vocabulary-wide).</p><p>In summary, MORSE clusters pairs of words which only vary by an affix; for example, pairs such as ("quick", "quickly") and ("hopeful", "hopefully") get clustered together. To verify the cluster of a specific affix from a semantic corpus- wide standpoint, we check for the consistency of the difference vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>). To evaluate it from an orthographic corpus-wide per- spective, we check for the size of each cluster of an affix. To evaluate each pair in a cluster locally from a semantic standpoint, we check if a pair of words in a valid affix cluster are morphologically related by checking if its difference vector is con- sistent with other members in the cluster and if the words in the pair are semantically related (i.e. close in the vector space). The reason for local evaluations is exemplified by ("on","only") which belongs to the cluster of a valid affix ("ly"), al- though they are not (obviously) morphologically related. We would expect such a pair to fail the last two local evaluation methods.</p><p>Our proposed segmentation algorithm is evalu- ated using benchmarking datasets from the Mor- pho Challenge (MC) for multiple languages and a newly introduced dataset for English which com- pensates for lack of discriminating capabilities in the MC dataset. Experiments reveal that our pro- posed framework not only outperforms the widely used approach, but also performs better than pub- lished state-of-the-art results.</p><p>The central contribution of this work is a novel framework that performs morpheme segmentation resulting in new state-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge this is the first unsupervised approach to consider the vocabulary-wide seman- tic knowledge of words and their affixes in addi- tion to relying on their surface forms. Moreover we point out the deficiencies in the MC datasets with respect to the compositionality of morphemes and introduce our own dataset free of these defi- ciencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Extensive work has been done in morphology learning, with tasks such as morphological anal- ysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baayen et al., 1993)</ref>, morphological reinflec- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cotterell et al., 2016)</ref>, and morpheme seg- mentation. Given the less complex nature of mor- pheme segmentation in comparison to the other tasks, most systems developed for morpheme seg- mentation have been unsupervised or minimally supervised (mostly for parameter tuning).</p><p>Unsupervised morpheme segmentation traces back to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harris, 1970)</ref>, which falls under the framework of Letter Successor Variety (LSV) which builds on the hypothesis that predictabil- ity of successor letters is high within morphemes and low otherwise. The most dominant pieces of work on unsupervised morpheme segmentation, Morfessor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Creutz and Lagus, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, 2005</ref> and Linguistica <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Goldsmith, 2000</ref>) adopt the Min- imum Description Length (MDL) principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rissanen, 1998)</ref>: they aim to minimize describing the lexicon of morphs as well as minimizing the description of an input corpus. Morfessor has a widely used API and has inspired a large body of following work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kohonen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grönroos et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>The unsupervised original implementation was later adapted ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kohonen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grönroos et al., 2014</ref>) to allow for minimal supervision. An- other work on minimally supervised morpheme segmentation is <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sirts and Goldwater, 2013</ref>) which relies on Adaptor Grammars (AGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Johnson et al., 2006</ref>). AGs learn latent tree structures over an in- put corpus using a nonparametric Bayesian model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sirts and Goldwater, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for morpheme segmentation. In this supervised method, the morpheme segmentation task is modeled as a sequence-to-sequence learn- ing problem, whereby the sequence of labels de- fines the boundaries of morphemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ruokolainen et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ruokolainen et al., , 2014</ref>. In contrast to the previ- ously mentioned generative approaches of MDL and AG, this method takes a discriminative ap- proach and allows for the inclusion of a larger set of features. In this approach, CRF learns a condi- tional probability of a segmentation given a word ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ruokolainen et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ruokolainen et al., , 2014</ref>).</p><p>All these morpheme segmenters rely solely on orthographic features of morphemes. Semantics were initially introduced to morpheme segmenters by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schone and Jurafsky, 2000</ref>), using LSA to generate word representations and then evaluate if two words are morphologically related based on semantic relatedness, as well as deterministic orthographic methods. Similarly, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2002</ref>) use edit distance and mutual information as metrics for semantic and orthographic validity of a morphological relation between two words. Re- cent work in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Narasimhan et al., 2015)</ref>, inspired by the log-linear model in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Poon et al., 2009</ref>) incorpo- rates semantic relatedness into the model via word representations. Other systems such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">( ¨ Ustün and Can, 2016</ref>) rely solely on evaluating two words from a semantic standpoint by the use of a two- layer neural network.</p><p>MORSE introduces semantic information into its morpheme segmenters via distributed word rep- resentations while also relying on orthographic features. Inspired by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Soricut and Och, 2015)</ref>, instead of merely evaluating semantic relat- edness, we are the first to evaluate the morpholog- ical relationship via the difference vector of mor- phologically related words. Comparing the differ- ence vectors of multiple pairs across the corpus following the same morphological relation, gives MORSE a vocabulary-wide evaluation of morpho- logical relations learned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System</head><p>The key limitation of previous frameworks that rely solely on orthographic features is the result- ing over-segmentation. As an example, MDL- based frameworks segment "sing" to "s-ing" due to the high frequency of the morphemes: "s" and "ing". Our framework combines semantic relat- edness with orthographic relatedness to eliminate such error. For the example mentioned, MORSE validates morphemes such as "s" and "ing" from an orthographic perspective, yet invalidates the re- lation between "s" and "sing" from a local and vocabulary-wide semantic perspective. Hence, MORSE will segment "jumping" as "jump-ing", and perform no segmentations on "sing".</p><p>To bring in semantic understanding into MORSE, we rely on word representations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mikolov et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). These word representations capture the semantics of the vocabulary through statistics over the con- text in which they appear. Moreover, morpho- syntactic regularities have been shown over these word representations, whereby pairs of words sharing the same relationship exhibit equivalent difference vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>). For ex- ample, it is expected in the vector space of word representations that w jumping´wjumping´ jumping´w jump « w playing´wplaying´ playing´w play , but w sing´wsing´ sing´w s ff w playing´wplaying´ playing´w play . As a high level description, we first learn all possible affix transformations (morphological rules) in the language from pairs of words from an orthographic standpoint. For example, the pair ("jump", "jumping") corresponds to the valid affix transformation φ suffix Ý ÝÝ Ñ "ing" (where φ represents the empty string), and the pair ("slow", "slogan") corresponds to the invalid rule "w" suffix Ý ÝÝ Ñ "gan". Then we invalidate the rules, such as "w" suffix Ý ÝÝ Ñ "gan", that do not conform to the linear relation in the vector space. We also invalidate pairs of words which, due to randomness, are orthograph- ically related via a valid rule although they are not morphologically related, such as ("on", "only").</p><p>Now we formalize the objects we learn in MORSE and the scores (orthographic and se- mantic) used for validation. This constitutes the training stage. Finally, we formalize the inference stage, where we use these objects and scores to perform morpheme segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Training Stage</head><p>Objects:</p><p>• Rule set R made of all possible affix trans- formations in a language.

The score is evaluated as: score loc sem ((w 1 , w 2 ) P SS r ) = cos( w 1 , w 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Inference Stage</head><p>In this stage we perform morpheme segmentation using the knowledge gained from the first stage.</p><p>We begin with some notation: let R add = {r : r P R, r = aff 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r Ý Ñ aff 2 , aff 1 = φ, aff 2 ‰ φ }, R rep = {r : r P R, r = aff 1 r Ý Ñ aff 2 , aff 1 ‰ φ, aff 2 ‰ φ }.</formula><p>In other words, we divide the rules to those where an affix is added (R add ) and to those where an affix is replaced (R rep ).</p><p>Given a word w to segment, we search for r ˚ , the solution to the following optimization prob- lem <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . The search space is limited to the rules that include w in their support set, a fairly small search space and the corresponding computation readily tractable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">max r ÿ t 1 score t 1 ppw 1 , wq P SS r q ` ÿ t 2</formula><p>score t 2 prq s. t. r P R add score r sem prq ą t r sem score r orth prq ą t r orth score w sem ppw 1 , wq P SS r q ą t w sem score loc sem ppw 1 , wq P SS r q ą t loc sem</p><p>Where t 1 = {w sem, loc sem}, t 2 = {r sem, r orth}, and t r sem , t r orth , t w sem , t loc sem are hyper- parameters of the system. Now given r ˚ = φ suffix Ý ÝÝ Ñ suf, w 1 is defined as w 1 r ˚ Ý Ñ w. Thus the algorithm segments w Ñ w 1 -suf. We treat prefixes simi- larly. Next, the algorithm iterates over w 1 . <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref> shows the segmentation process of the word "un- healthy" based on the sequentially retrieved r ˚ .</p><p>The reason we restrict our rule set to R add in the optimization problem is to avoid rules such as "er" suffix Ý ÝÝ Ñ "ing" like in ("player", "playing") leading to false segmentations such as "playing" Ñ "player- ing". Yet we cannot completely restrict our search to R add due to rules such as "y" Ñ "ies" in words like ("sky", "skies"). To be able to segment words such as "skies", we'd have to consider rules in R rep <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Illustration of the iterative process of segmentation in MORSE but only after searching in R add . Thus if the first optimization problem was unfeasible, we repeat it while replacing R add with R rep . The program ter- minates when both optimization problems are in- feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We conduct a variety of experiments to assess the performance of MORSE, and compare it with prior works. First, the performance is assessed in- trinsically on the task of morpheme segmentation and against the most widely used morpheme seg- menter: Morfessor 2.0. We evaluate the perfor- mance across three languages of varying morphol- ogy levels: English, Turkish, Finnish, with Finnish being the richest in morphology and English be- ing the poorest. Second, we show the inadequa- cies of benchmarking gold datasets for this task and describe a new dataset that we create to ad- dress the inadequacy. Third, in order to highlight the effect of including semantic information, we compare MORSE against Morfessor on a set of words which should not be segmented from a se- mantic perspective although orthographically they seem to be segmentable (such as "freshman").</p><p>In all of our experiments (unless specified oth- erwise), we report precision and recall (and corre- sponding F1 scores) with locations of morpheme boundaries being considered positives and the rest of the locations considered negatives. It should be noted that we disregard starting and ending posi- tions of words, since they form trivial boundaries (Virpioja et al., 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Setup</head><p>Both systems, Morfessor and MORSE, were trained on the same monolingual corpus: Wikipedia 2 (as of September 20, 2016) to con- trol for affecting factors within the experiment. For each language considered, the respective Wikipedia dump was preprocessed using an available code <ref type="bibr">3</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Morpho Challenge Dataset</head><p>As our first intrinsic experiment, we consider the Morpho Challenge (MC) gold segmentations available online <ref type="bibr">5</ref> .</p><p>For every language, two datasets are supplied: training and development. For the purpose of our experiments, all systems use the development dataset as a test dataset, and the training dataset is used for tuning MORSE's hyperparameters. MC dataset sizes are reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Semantically Driven Dataset</head><p>There are a variety of weaknesses in the MC dataset, specifically related to whether the seg- mentation is semantically appropriate or not. We introduce a new semantically driven dataset (SD17) for morpheme segmentation along with the methodology used for creation; this new dataset is publicly available in the canonical <ref type="bibr">6</ref> and non-canonical 7 versions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cotterell and Vieira, 2016)</ref>. Non-compositional segmentation: One of the key requirements of morpheme segmentation is the compositionality of the meaning of the word from the meaning of its morphemes. This require- ment is violated on multiple occasions in the MC dataset. One example from <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> is segment- ing the word "business" into "busi-ness", which falsely assumes that "business" means the act of being busy. Such a segmentation might be consis- tent with the historic origin of the word, but with</p></div>

Not only does such a weakness contribute to false segmentations, but it also favors segmentation methods following the MDL princi- ple.</p><p>Trivial instances: The second weakness in the MC dataset is due to abundance of trivial in- stances. These instances lack discriminating ca- pability since all methods can easily predict them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker, 2001</ref>). These instances are comprised of genetive cases (such as teacher's) as well as hy- phenated words (such as turning-point). For gene- tive cases, segmenting at the apostrophe leads to perfect precision and recall, and thus such in- stances are deemed trivial. In the case of hyphen- ated words, segmenting at the hyphen is a correct segmentation with a very high probability. In the MC tuning dataset, in 43 times out of 46, the hy- phen was a correct indication of segmentation.</p><p>Other issues exist in the Morpho Challenge dataset although less abundantly. There are in- stances of wrong segmentations possibly due to human error. One example of such instance is "turning-point" segmented to "turning -point" in- stead of "turn ing -point". Another issue, which is hard to avoid, is ambiguity of segmentation boundaries. Take for example the word "strafed", the segmentations "straf-ed" and "strafe-d" are equally justified. In such situations, the MC dataset favors complete affixes rather than com- plete lemmas. This also favors MDL-based seg- menters. We note that the MC dataset also pro- vides segmentations in a canonical version such as "strafe-ed", yet for the sake of a fair compar- ison with Morfessor and all previously evaluated systems on the MC dataset, we consider only the former version of segmentations.  Due to these reasons, we create a new dataset SD17 for English gold morpheme segmentations with compositionality guiding the annotations. We select 2000 words randomly from the 10K most frequent words in the English Wikipedia dump and have them annotated by two proficient English speakers. The segmentation criterion was to seg- ment the word to the largest extent possible while preserving its compositionality from the segments. The inter-annotator agreement reached 91% on a word level. Based on post annotation discussions, annotators agreed on 99% of the words, and words not agreed on were eliminated along with words containing non-alpha characters to avoid trivial in- stances.</p><p>SD17 is used to evaluate the performance of both Morfessor and MORSE. We claim that the performance on SD17 is a better indication of the performance of a morpheme segmenter. By the use of SD17 we expect to gain insights on the ex- tent to which morpheme segmentation is a func- tion of semantics in addition to orthography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Handling Compositionality</head><p>We have hypothesized that following the MDL principle (such as Morfessor) leads to over- segmentation. This over-segmentation happens specifically when the meaning of the word does not follow from the meaning of its morphemes. Examples include words such as "red head", "duck face", "how ever", "s ing". A subset of these words are defined by linguists as exocentric compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bauer, 2008)</ref>. MORSE does not suf- fer from this issue owing to its use of a semantic model.</p><p>We use a collection of 100 English words which appear to be segmentable but actually are not (ex- ample: "however"). Such a collection will high- light a system's capability of distinguishing fre- quent letter sequences from the semantic contri- bution of this letter sequence in a word. We make this collection publicly available <ref type="bibr">8</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>We compare MORSE with Morfessor, and place the performance alongside the state-of-the-art published results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Morpho Challenge Dataset</head><p>As demonstrated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, MORSE performs better than Mofessor on English and Turkish, and worse on Finnish. Considering English first, us- ing MORSE instead of Morfessor, resulted in a 6% absolute increase in F1 scores. This sup- ports our claim for the need of semantic cues in morpheme segmentation, and also validates the method used in this paper. Since English is a less systematic language in terms of the orthographic structure of words, semantic cues are of greater need, and hence a system which relies on seman- tic cues is expected to perform better; indeed this is the case. Similarly, MORSE performs better on Turkish with a 7% absolute margin in terms of F1 score. On the other hand, Morfessor sur- passes MORSE in performance on Finnish by a large margin as well, especially in terms of recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Discussion</head><p>We hypothesize that the richness of morphol- ogy in Finnish led to suboptimal performance of MORSE. This is because richness in morphology leads to word level sparsity which directly leads to: (1) Degradation of quality of word represen- tations (2) Increased vocabulary size exacerbat- ing the issue of limited vocabulary (recall MORSE was limited to a vocabulary of 1M). In a language with productive morphology, limiting its vocabu- lary results in a lower chance of finding morpho- logically related word pairs. This negatively im-pacts the training stage of MORSE which relies on the availability of such pairs. In order to detect the suffix "ly" from the word "cheerfully" MORSE needs to come across "cheerful" as well. Coming across "cheerful" is now a lower probability event due to high sparsity. This is not as much of an is- sue for Morfessor under the MDL principle, since it might detect "ly" just by coming across multi- ple words ending with "ly" even without encoun- tering the base forms of those words. We show how the detection of rules is affected by consid- ering the number of candidate rules detected as well as the number of candidate morphologically related word pairs detected. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, the number of detected candidate rules and candi- date related words decreases with the increase in morphology in a language. This confirms our hy- pothesis; we note that this issue can be directly at- tributed to the limited vocabulary size in MORSE. With the increase in processing power, and thus larger vocabulary coverage, MORSE is expected to perform better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Semantically Driven Dataset</head><p>The performance of MORSE and Morfessor on SD17 is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>. The use of MC data (which does not adhere to the composition- ality principle) to tune MORSE to be evaluated on SD17 (which does adhere to the composition- ality principle) is not optimal. Thus, we evalu- ate MORSE on SD17 using 5-fold cross valida- tion, where 80% of the dataset is used to tune and 20% is used to evaluate. Precision, Recall, and F1 scores are averaged and reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> using the label MORSE-CV.</p><p>Based on the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, we make the following observations. Comparing MORSE-CV to MORSE reflects the fundamental difference be- tween SD17 and MC datasets. Knowing the ba- sis of construction of SD17 and the fundamen- tal weaknesses in MC datasets, we attribute the performance increase to the lack of composition- ality in MC dataset. Comparing MORSE-CV to Morfessor, we observe a significant jump in per- formance (an increase of 24%). In comparison, the increase on the MC dataset (6%) shows that the Morpho Challenge dataset underestimates the performance gap between Morfessor and MORSE due its inherent weaknesses.</p><p>Since MORSE is equipped with the capability to retrieve full morphemes even when not present   in full orthographically, a capability that Morfes- sor lacks, we evaluated both systems on the canon- ical version of SD17. The results are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>. We notice that evaluating on the canoni- cal form of SD17 gives a further edge for MORSE over Morfessor. For evaluation on the canonical version of SD17, we switch to morpheme-level evaluation instead of boundary-level as a more suitable method for Morfessor. Morpheme-level evaluation is distinguished from boundary-level evaluation in that we evaluate the detection of mor- phemes instead of the boundary locations in the segmented word.</p><p>We next compare MORSE against published state-of-the-art results <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . As one can see in Ta- ble 7 MORSE significantly performs better than published state-of-the-art results, most notably ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Narasimhan et al., 2015</ref>) referred to as LLSM in the   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Handling Compositionality</head><p>We compare the performance of MORSE and Morfessor on a set of words made up of mor- phemes which don't compose the meaning of the word. Since all the boundaries in this dataset are negative, to evaluate both systems (with MORSE tuned on SD17), we only report the number of seg- ments generated. The more segments a system generates, the worse is its performance. We find that MORSE generates 7 false mor- phemes whereas Morfessor generates 43 false morphemes. This shows MORSE's robustness to such examples through its semantic knowl- edge and validates our claim that Morfessor over- segments on such examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>One of the benefits of MORSE against other frameworks such as MDL is its ability to identify the lemma within the segmentation. The lemma would be the last non-segmented word in the iter- ative process of segmentation. Hence, an advan- tage of our framework is its easy adaptability into a lemmatizer and even a stemmer.</p><p>Another key aspect which is not present in some of the competitive systems is the need for a small tuning dataset. This is a point in favor of com- pletely unsupervised systems such as Morfessor. On the other hand, these hyperparameters could allow for flexibility. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows how preci- sion and recall changes as a function of the hy- perparameter selection <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . As one would expect, increasing the hyperparameters, in general, leads <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The five published state-of-the-art results are on different datasets <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Only a subset of the hyperparameters is used for display purposes to a stricter search space and thus increases preci- sion and decreases recall. Putting these results in perspective, the user of MORSE is given the capa- bility of controlling for precision and recall based on the needs of the downstream task.</p><p>Moreover, to check for the level of dependency of MORSE on a set of gold morpheme segmen- tations for tuning, we check for the variation in performance with respect to size of tuning data. For the purpose of this experiment we take an 80- 20 split of SD17 and vary the size of the tuning set. We notice that the performance (81.90% F1) reaches a steady state at 20% (« 300 gold seg- mentations) of the tuning data. This reflects the minimal dependency on a tuning dataset.</p><p>Regarding the training stage, homomorphs are treated as one rule and allomorphs are treated as separate rules. For example, ("tall", "taller") and ("fast", "faster") are wrongly considered to have the same morphological relation, besides ("cat", "cats") and ("butterfly", "butterflies") are wrongly considered to have different morpholog- ical relations. The separate clustering of the dif- ferent forms of a homomorph leads to the under- estimation of the respective orthographic scores. Moreover, the clustering of allomorphs together would lead to the underestimation of the seman- tic score of the rule as well as the underestimation of the vocabulary-wide semantic score of word pairs in the support set of this rule. This does not significantly affect the performance of MORSE, since the tuned thresholds are able to distinguish between the low scores of an invalid rule and the mediocre underestimated scores of allomorphs and homomorphs.</p><p>As for the inference stage of MORSE, the greedy inference approach limits its performance. In other words, a wrong segmentation at the be-ginning will propagate and result in consequent wrong segmentations. Also, MORSE's limitation to concatenative morphology decreases its effi- cacy on languages that include non-concatenative morphology. This opens the stage for further re- search on a more optimal inference stage and a more global modeling of orthographic morpholog- ical transformations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we have presented MORSE, a first morpheme segmenter to consider semantic struc- ture at this scale (local and vocabulary-wide). We show its superiority over state-of-the-art algo- rithms using intrinsic evaluation on a variety of languages. We also pinpointed the weaknesses in current benchmarking datasets, and presented a new dataset free of these weaknesses. With a rel- ative increase in performance reaching 24% abso- lute increase over Morfessor, this work proves the significance of semantic cues as well as validates a new state-of-the-art morpheme segmenter. For future work, we plan to address the limitations of MORSE: minimal supervision, greedy inference, and concatenative orthographic model. Moreover, we plan to computationally optimize the training stage for the sake of wider adoption by the com- munity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Precision (left) and Recall (right) of MORSE as a function of the hyperparameters: t r sem , t w sem</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="8,72.00,62.81,226.77,141.73" type="bitmap" /></figure>
