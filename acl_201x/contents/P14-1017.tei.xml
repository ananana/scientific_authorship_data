				<p>Consider a person trying to spread an important message on a social network. He/she can spend hours trying to craft the message. Does it actually matter? While there has been extensive prior work looking into predicting popularity of social-media content, the effect of wording per se has rarely been studied since it is often confounded with the popularity of the author and the topic. To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics. Still, humans can answer this question better than chance (but far from perfectly), and the computational methods we develop can do better than both an average human and a strong competing method trained on non-controlled data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>How does one make a message "successful"? This question is of interest to many entities, including political parties trying to frame an issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chong and Druckman, 2007)</ref>, and individuals attempting to make a point in a group meeting. In the first case, an important type of success is achieved if the national conversation adopts the rhetoric of the party; in the latter case, if other group members repeat the originating individual's point.</p><p>The massive availability of online messages, such as posts to social media, now affords re- searchers new means to investigate at a very large scale the factors affecting message propagation, also known as adoption, sharing, spread, or vi- rality. According to prior research, important fea- tures include characteristics of the originating au- thor (e.g., verified Twitter user or not, author's messages' past success rate), the author's social network (e.g., number of followers), message tim- ing, and message content or topic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Artzi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakshy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borghol et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Guerini et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guerini et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hansen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hong et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lakkaraju et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Milkman and Berger, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ma et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Petrovi´cPetrovi´c et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Romero et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Suh et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sun et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tsur and Rappoport, 2012)</ref>. Indeed, it's not surprising that one of the most retweeted tweets of all time was from user BarackObama, with 40M followers, on November 6, 2012: "Four more years. [link to photo]".</p><p>Our interest in this paper is the effect of alterna- tive message wording, meaning how the message is said, rather than what the message is about. In contrast to the identity/social/timing/topic features mentioned above, wording is one of the few fac- tors directly under an author's control when he or she seeks to convey a fixed piece of content. For example, consider a speaker at the ACL business meeting who has been tasked with proposing that Paris be the next ACL location. This person can- not on the spot become ACL president, change the shape of his/her social network, wait until the next morning to speak, or campaign for Rome instead; but he/she can craft the message to be more hu- morous, more informative, emphasize certain as- pects instead of others, and so on. In other words, we investigate whether a different choice of words affects message propagation, controlling for user and topic: would user BarackObama have gotten significantly more (or fewer) retweets if he had used some alternate wording to announce his re- election?</p><p>Although we cannot create a parallel universe <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Topic-and author-controlled (TAC) pairs. Topic control = inclusion of the same URL.</p><p>author tweets #retweets natlsecuritycnn t1: FIRST ON CNN: After Petraeus scandal, Paula Broadwell looks to recapture 'normal life.' http://t.co/qy7GGuYW n1 = 5 t2: First on CNN: Broadwell photos shared with Security Clearance as she and her family fight media portrayal of her [same URL] n2 = 29 ABC t1: Workers, families take stand against Thanksgiving hours: http://t.co/J9mQHiIEqv n1 = 46 t2: Staples, Medieval Times Workers Say Opening Thanksgiving Day Crosses the Line [same URL] n2 = 27 cactus music t1: I know at some point you've have been saved from hunger by our rolling food trucks friends. Let's help support them! http://t.co/zg9jwA5j n1 = 2 t2: Food trucks are the epitome of small independently owned LOCAL businesses! Help keep them going! Sign the petition [same URL] n2 = 13 in which BarackObama tweeted something else 1 , fortunately, a surprising characteristic of Twitter allows us to run a fairly analogous natural exper- iment: external forces serendipitously provide an environment that resembles the desired controlled setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(DiNardo, 2008)</ref>. Specifically, it turns out to be unexpectedly common for the same user to post different tweets regarding the same URL - a good proxy for fine-grained topic 2 -within a relatively short period of time. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Some example pairs are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>; we see that the paired tweets may differ dramatically, going far beyond word-for-word substitutions, so that quite interest- ing changes can be studied. Looking at these examples, can one in fact tell from the wording which tweet in a topic-and author-controlled pair will be more successful?</p><p>The answer may not be a priori clear. For example, for the first pair in the table, one person we asked found t 1 's invocation of a "scandal" to be more attention-grabbing; but another person preferred t 2 because it is more informative about the URL's content and includes "fight media portrayal". In an Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) experiment ( §4), we found that humans achieved an average accuracy of 61.3%: not that high, but better than chance, indicating that it is somewhat possible for humans to predict greater message spread from different deliveries of the same information.</p><p>Buoyed by the evidence of our AMT study that wording effects exist, we then performed a battery of experiments to seek generally-applicable, non- 1 Cf. the Music Lab "multiple universes" experiment to test the randomness of popularity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Salganik et al., 2006</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Although hashtags have been used as coarse-grained topic labels in prior work, for our purposes, we have no assur- ance that two tweets both using, say, "#Tahrir" would be at- tempting to express the same message but in different words. In contrast, see the same-URL examples in <ref type="table">Table 1.</ref> 3 Moreover, Twitter presents tweets to a reader in strict chronological order, so that there are no algorithmic-ranking effects to compensate for in determining whether readers saw a tweet. And, Twitter accumulates retweet counts for the en- tire retweet cascade and displays them for the original tweet at the root of the propagation tree, so we can directly use Twitter's retweet counts to compare the entire reach of the different versions.</p><p>Twitter-specific features of more successful phras- ings. §5.1 applies hypothesis testing (with Bonfer- roni correction to ameliorate issues with multiple comparisons) to investigate the utility of features like informativeness, resemblance to headlines, and conformity to the community norm in lan- guage use. §5.2 further validates our findings via prediction experiments, including on completely fresh held-out data, used only once and after an array of standard cross-validation experiments. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We achieved 66.5% cross-validation accuracy and 65.6% held-out accuracy with a combination of our custom features and bag-of-words. Our clas- sifier fared significantly better than a number of baselines, including a strong classifier trained on the most-and least-retweeted tweets that was even granted access to author and timing metadata.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The idea of using carefully controlled experiments to study effective communication strategies dates back at least to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hovland et al. (1953)</ref>. Recent studies range from examining what characteris- tics of New York Times articles correlate with high re-sharing rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Milkman and Berger, 2012</ref>) to looking at how differences in description affect the spread of content-controlled videos or images ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borghol et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lakkaraju et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Simmons et al. (2011)</ref> examined the variation of quotes from different sources to examine how tex- tual memes mutate as people pass them along, but did not control for author. Predicting the "success" of various texts such as novels and movie quotes has been the aim of additional prior work not al- ready mentioned in §1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ashok et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Louis and Nenkova, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pitler and Nenkova, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McIntyre and Lapata, 2009</ref>). To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale studies exploring wording effects in a both topic-and author-controlled setting. Em- ploying such controls, we find that predicting the more effective alternative wording is much harder than the previously well-studied problem of pre-dicting popular content when author or topic can freely vary.</p><p>Related work regarding the features we consid- ered is deferred to §5.1 (features description).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Our main dataset was constructed by first gath- ering 1.77M topic-and author-controlled (hence- forth TAC) tweet pairs 5 differing in more than just spacing. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We accomplished this by crawling time- lines of 236K user ids that appear in prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kwak et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yang and Leskovec, 2011</ref>) via the Twitter API. This crawling process also yielded 632K TAC pairs whose only difference was spacing, and an additional 558M "unpaired" tweets; as shown later in this paper, we used these extra corpora for computing language models and other auxiliary information. We applied non- obvious but important filtering -described later in this section -to control for other external fac- tors and to reduce ambiguous cases. This brought us to a set of 11,404 pairs, with the gold-standard labels determined by which tweet in each pair was the one that received more retweets according to the Twitter API. We then did a second crawl to get an additional 1,770 pairs to serve as a held-out dataset. The corresponding tweet IDs are available online at http://chenhaot.com/pages/ wording-for-propagation.html. (Twit- ter's terms of service prohibit sharing the actual tweets.) Throughout, we refer to the textual content of the earlier tweet within a TAC pair as t 1 , and of the later one as t 2 . We denote the number of retweets received by each tweet by n 1 and n 2 , respectively. We refer to the tweet with higher (lower) n i as the "better (worse)" tweet. Using "identical" pairs to determine how to compensate for follower-count and timing ef- fects. In an ideal setting, differences between n 1 and n 2 would be determined solely by dif- ferences in wording. But even with a TAC pair, retweets might exhibit a temporal bias because of the chronological order of tweet presentation (t 1 might enjoy a first-mover advantage ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borghol et al., 2012</ref>) because it is the "original"; alternatively, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> No data collection/processing was conducted at Google. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The total excludes: tweets containing multiple URLs; tweets from users posting about the same URL more than five times (since such users might be spammers); the third, fourth, or fifth version for users posting between three and five tweets for the same URL; retweets (as identified by Twitter's API or by beginning with "RT @"); non-English tweets. &gt;5K f'ers,&lt;12hrs otherwise (b) Avg. n2 vs. n1 for iden- tical TAC pairs, highlighting our chosen time-lag and fol- lower thresholds. Bars: stan- dard error. Diagonal line: The ideal case where n 2 " n 1 when t 1 " t 2 is best approximated when t 2 oc- curs within 12 hours of t 1 and the author has at least 10,000 or 5,000 followers. (b): in our chosen setting (blue circles), n 2 indeed tends to track n 1 , whereas otherwise (black squares), there's a bias towards retweeting t 1 . t 2 might be preferred because retweeters consider t 1 to be "stale"). Also, the number of followers an author has can have complicated indirect effects on which tweets are read (space limits preclude discussion).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p Epn2|n1q " n1.</formula><p>We use the 632K TAC pairs wherein t 1 and t 2 are identical 7 to check for such confounding effects: we see how much n 2 deviates from n 1 in such settings, since if wording were the only explanatory factor, the retweet rates for identical tweets ought to be equal. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a) plots how the time lag between t 1 and t 2 and the author's follower-count affect the following deviation esti- mate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D " ÿ 0ďn 1 ă10 | p Epn 2 |n 1 q ´ n 1 |,</formula><p>where p Epn 2 |n 1 q is the average value of n 2 over pairs whose t 1 is retweeted n 1 times. (Note that the number of pairs whose t 1 is retweeted n 1 times decays exponentially with n 1 ; hence, we condi- tion on n 1 to keep the estimate from being domi- nated by pairs with n 1 " 0, and do not consider n 1 ě 10 because there are too few such pairs to es- timate p Epn 2 |n 1 q reliably.) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a) shows that the setting where we (i) minimize the confound- ing effects of time lag and author's follower-count and (ii) maximize the amount of data to work with is: when t 2 occurs within 12 hours after t 1 and the author has more than 5,000 followers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>(b) confirms that for identical TAC pairs, our cho- sen setting indeed results in n 2 being on average close to n 1 , which corresponds to the desired set- ting where wording is the dominant differentiating factor. 8</p><p>Focus on meaningful and general changes. Even after follower-count and time-lapse filtering, we still want to focus on TAC pairs that (i) ex- hibit significant/interesting textual changes (as ex- emplified in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and as opposed to typo cor- rections and the like), and (ii) have n 2 and n 1 suf- ficiently different so that we are confident in which t i is better at attracting retweets. To take care of (i), we discarded the 50% of pairs whose similar- ity was above the median, where similarity was tf-based cosine. 9 For (ii), we sorted the remain- ing pairs by n 2 ´ n 1 and retained only the top and bottom 5%. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Moreover, to ensure that we do not overfit to the idiosyncrasies of particular authors, we cap the number of pairs contributed by each author to 50 before we deal with (ii).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Human accuracy on TAC pairs</head><p>We first ran a pilot study on Amazon Mechan- ical Turk (AMT) to determine whether humans can identify, based on wording differences alone, which of two topic-and author-controlled tweets is spread more widely. Each of our 5 AMT tasks involved a disjoint set of 20 randomly-sampled TAC pairs (with t 1 and t 2 randomly reordered); subjects indicated "which tweet would other peo- ple be more likely to retweet?", provided a short justification for their binary response, and clicked a checkbox if they found that their choice was a "close call". We received 39 judgments per pair in aggregate from 106 subjects total (9 people com- pleted all 5 tasks). The subjects' justifications were of very high quality, convincing us that they all did the task in good faith <ref type="bibr">11</ref> . Two examples for <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We also computed the Pearson correlation between n1 and n2, even though it can be dominated by pairs with smaller n1. The correlation is 0.853 for "ą 5K f'ers, ă12hrs", clearly higher than the 0.305 correlation for "otherwise". <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Idf weighting was not employed because changes to fre- quent words are of potential interest. Urls, hashtags, @- mentions and numbers were normalized to <ref type="bibr">[url]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[hashtag]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[at]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[num]</ref> before computing similarity. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> For our data, this meant n2´n1n2´n2´n1 ě 10 or ď ´15. Cf. our median number of retweets: 30. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> We also note that the feedback we got was quite pos- itive, including: "...It's fun to make choices between close tweets and use our subjective opinion. Thanks and best of the third TAC pair in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> were: "[t 1 makes] the cause relate-able to some people, therefore show- ing more of an appeal as to why should they click the link and support" and, expressing the opposite view, "I like [t 2 ] more because [t 1 ] starts out with a generalization that doesn't affect me and try to make me look like I had that experience before".</p><p>If we view the set of 3900 binary judgments for our 100-TAC-pair sample as constituting in- dependent responses, then the accuracy for this set is 62.4% (rising to 63.8% if we exclude the 587 judgments deemed "close calls"). However, if we evaluate the accuracy of the majority response among the 39 judgments per pair, the number rises to 73%. The accuracy of the majority response generally increases with the dominance of the ma- jority, going above 90% when at least 80% of the judgments agree (although less than a third of the pairs satisfied this criterion).</p><p>Alternatively, we can consider the average ac- curacy of the 106 subjects: 61.3%, which is bet- ter than chance but far from 100%. (Variance was high: one subject achieved 85% accuracy out of 20 pairs, but eight scored below 50%.) This re- sult is noticeably lower than the 73.8%-81.2% re- ported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Petrovi´cPetrovi´c et al. (2011)</ref>, who ran a sim- ilar experiment involving two subjects and 202 tweet pairs, but where the pairs were not topic-or author-controlled. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We conclude that even though propagation pre- diction becomes more challenging when topic and author controls are applied, humans can still to some degree tell which wording attracts more retweets. Interested readers can try this out themselves at http://chenhaot.com/ retweetedmore/quiz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>We now investigate computationally what word- ing features correspond to messages achieving a broader reach. We start ( §5.1) by introducing a set of generally-applicable and (mostly) non-Twitter- specific features to capture our intuitions about what might be better ways to phrase a message. We then use hypothesis testing ( §5.1) to evaluate the importance of each feature for message prop- luck with your research" and "This was very interesting and really made me think about how I word my own tweets. Great job on this survey!". We only had to exclude one person (not counted among the 106 subjects), doing so because he or she gave the same uninformative justification for all pairs. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The accuracy range stems from whether author's social features were supplied and which subject was considered. </p><note type="other">: Notational conventions for tables in §5.1.</note><p>One-sided paired t-test for feature efficacy ÒÒÒÒ: pă1e-20 ÓÓÓÓ: pą1-1e-20 ÒÒÒ : pă0.001 ÓÓÓ : pą0.999 ÒÒ : pă0.01 ÓÓ : pą0.99 Ò : pă0.05 Ó : pą0.95˚: 95˚: passes our Bonferroni correction</p><p>One-sided binomial test for feature increase (Do authors prefer to 'raise' the feature in t 2 ?)

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Features: efficacy and author preference</head><p>What kind of phrasing helps message propaga- tion? Does it work to explicitly ask people to share the message? Is it better to be short and concise or long and informative? We define an array of fea- tures to capture these and other messaging aspects. We then examine (i) how effective each feature is for attracting more retweets; and (ii) whether au- thors prefer applying a given feature when issuing a second version of a tweet.</p><p>First, for each feature, we use a one-sided paired t-test to test whether, on our 11K TAC pairs, our score function for that feature is larger in the bet- ter tweet versions than in the worse tweet versions, for significance levels α " .05, .01, .001, 1e-20. Given that we did 39 tests in total, there is a risk of obtaining false positives due to multiple test- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dunn, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)</ref>. To account for this, we also report significance re- sults for the conservatively Bonferroni-corrected ("BC") significance level α = 0.05/39=1.28e-3.</p><p>Second, we examine author preference for ap- plying a feature. We do so because one (but by no means the only) reason authors post t 2 after having already advertised the same URL in t 1 is that these authors were dissatisfied with the amount of atten- tion t 1 got; in such cases, the changes may have been specifically intended to attract more retweets. We measure author preference for a feature by the percentage of our TAC pairs 13 where t 2 has more "occurrences" of the feature than t 1 , which we de- note by "%pf 2 ą f 1 q". We use the one-sided bi- nomial test to see whether %pf 2 ą f 1 q is signifi- cantly larger (or smaller) than 50%.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ÒÒÒÒ * YES (54%) verb ÒÒÒÒ * YES (56%) noun ÒÒÒÒ * -- adjective ÒÒÒ Ò * YES (51%) adverb ÒÒÒ Ò * YES (55%) proper noun ÒÒÒ Ò * NO-(45%) number ÒÒÒÒ * NO-(48%) hashtag Ò ÒÒÒ -- @-mention ÓÓÓ Ó * YES (53%)</formula><p>Not surprisingly, it helps to ask people to share. (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>; the notation for all tables is ex- plained in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.) The basic sanity check we performed here was to take as features the number of occurrences of the verbs 'rt', 'retweet', 'please', 'spread', 'pls', and 'plz' to capture explicit re- quests (e.g. "please retweet").</p><p>Informativeness helps. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 4)</ref> Messages that are more informative have increased social ex- change value <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Homans, 1958)</ref>, and so may be more worth propagating. One crude approxima- tion of informativeness is length, and we see that length helps. 14 In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Simmons et al. (2011)</ref> found that shorter versions of memes are more likely to be popular. The difference may result from TAC-pair changes being more drastic than the variations that memes undergo. A more refined informativeness measure is counts of the parts of speech that correspond to content.

( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref>) We expect that provocative or sensationalistic tweets are likely to make people react. We found it difficult to model provocativeness directly. As a rough approximation, we check whether the changes in t 2 with respect to t 1 (which share the same topic and author) involve words or parts-of-speech that are associated with high retweet rate in a very large separate sample of unpaired tweets (retweets and replies discarded). Specifically, for each word w that appears more than 10 times, we compute the probability that tweets containing w are retweeted more than once, denoted by rspwq. We define the rt score of a tweet as max wPT rspwq, where T is all the words in the tweet, and the rt score of a particular POS tag z in a tweet as max wPT &amp;tagpwq"z rspwq.</p><p>Include positive and/or negative words.

Recall that we use binomial tests to determine author preference for applying a feature more in t 2 . Our preference statistics show that au- thor preferences in many cases are aligned with feature efficacy. But there are several notable ex- ceptions: for example, authors tend to increase the use of @-mentions and 2nd person pronouns even though they are ineffective. On the other hand, they did not increase the use of effective ones like proper nouns and numbers; nor did they tend to increase their rate of sentiment-bearing words. Bearing in mind that changes in t 2 may not always be intended as an effort to improve t 1 , it is still in- teresting to observe that there are some contrasts between feature efficacy and author preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Predicting the "better" wording</head><p>Here, we further examine the collective efficacy of the features introduced in §5.1 via their perfor- mance on a binary prediction task: given a TAC pair (t 1 , t 2 ), did t 2 receive more retweets?</p><p>Our approach. We group the features introduced in §5.1 into 16 lexicon-based features <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3</ref>, 8, 9, 10), 9 informativeness features <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 4</ref>), 6 language model features (Table 5, 6), 6 rt score features <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 7)</ref>, and 2 readability features (Ta- ble 11). We refer to all 39 of them together as effective? author-preferred? indefinite articles (a,an) ÒÒÒ Ò * -- definite articles (the) --- YES (52%) custom features. We also consider tagged bag-of- words ("BOW") features, which includes all the unigram (word:POS pair) and bigram features that appear more than 10 times in the cross-validation data. This yields 3,568 unigram features and 4,095 bigram features, for a total of 7,663 so-called 1,2-gram features. Values for each feature are nor- malized by linear transformation across all tweets in the training data to lie in the range r0, 1s. 18 For a given TAC pair, we construct its feature vector as follows. For each feature being consid- ered, we compute its normalized value for each tweet in the pair and take the difference as the fea- ture value for this pair. We use L2-regularized lo- gistic regression as our classifier, with parameters chosen by cross validation on the training data. (We also experimented with SVMs. The perfor- mance was very close, but mostly slightly lower.)</p><p>A strong non-TAC alternative, with social infor- mation and timing thrown in. One baseline re- sult we would like to establish is whether the topic and author controls we have argued for, while intuitively compelling for the purposes of trying to determine the best way for a given author to present some fixed content, are really necessary in practice. To test this, we consider an alterna- tive binary L2-regularized logistic-regression clas- sifier that is trained on unpaired data, specifically, on the collection of 10,000 most retweeted tweets (gold-standard label: positive) plus the 10,000 least retweeted tweets (gold-standard label: neg- ative) that are neither retweets nor replies. Note that this alternative thus is granted, by design, roughly twice the training instances that our clas- sifiers have, as a result of having roughly the same number of tweets, since our instances are pairs. Moreover, we additionally include the tweet au- thor's follower count, and the day and hour of posting, as features. We refer to this alternative classifier as TAC+ff+time. (Mnemonic: "ff" is used in bibliographic contexts as an abbreviation (a) Cross-validation and heldout accuracy for various feature sets.

To sanity-check whether our classifier provides any improvement over the simplest meth- ods one could try, we also report the performance of the majority baseline, our request-for-sharing features, and our character-length feature.</p><p>Performance comparison. We compare the ac- curacy (percentage of pairs whose labels were cor- rectly predicted) of our approach against the com- peting methods. We report 5-fold cross validation results on our balanced set of 11,404 TAC pairs and on our completely disjoint heldout data 19 of 1,770 TAC pairs; this set was never examined dur- ing development, and there are no authors in com- mon between the two testing sets. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(a) summarizes the main results. While</p><p>TAC+ff+time outperforms the majority base- line, using all the features we proposed beats</p><p>TAC+ff+time by more than 10% in both cross- validation (66.5% vs 55.9%) and heldout valida- tion (65.6% vs 55.3%). We outperform the aver- age human accuracy of 61% reported in our Ama- zon Mechanical Turk experiments (for a different data sample); TAC+ff+time fails to do so. The importance of topic and author con- trol can be seen by further investigation of TAC+ff+time's performance. First, note that <ref type="bibr">19</ref> To construct this data, we used the same criteria as in §3: written by authors with more than 5000 followers, posted within 12 hours, n2´n1n2´n2´n1 ě 10 or ď ´15, and cosine simi- larity threshold value the same as in §3, cap of 50 on number of pairs from any individual author.</p><p>it yields an accuracy of around 55% on our alternate-version-selection task, 20 even though its cross-validation accuracy on the larger most-and least-retweeted unpaired tweets averages out to a high 98.8%. Furthermore, note the superior per- formance of unigrams trained on TAC data vs TAC+ff+time -which is similar to our uni- grams but trained on a larger but non-TAC dataset that included metadata. Thus, TAC pairs are a use- ful data source even for non-custom features. (We also include individual feature comparisons later.)</p><p>Informativeness is the best-performing custom feature group when run in isolation, and outper- forms all baselines, as well as TAC+ff+time; and we can see from <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(a) that this is not due just to length. The combination of all our 39 custom features yields approximately 63% accu- racy in both testing settings, significantly outper- forming informativeness alone (pă0.001 in both cases). Again, this is higher than our estimate of average human performance.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the TAC-trained BOW fea- tures (unigram and 1,2-gram) show impressive predictive power in this task: many of our custom features can be captured by bag-of-word features, in a way. Still, the best performance is achieved <ref type="bibr">20</ref> One might suspect that the problem is that TAC+ff+time learns from its training data to over- rely on follower-count, since that is presumably a good feature for non-TAC tweets, and for this reason suffers when run on TAC data where follower-counts are by construction non-informative. But in fact, we found that removing the follower-count feature from TAC+ff+time and re-training did not lead to improved performance. Hence, it seems that it is the non-controlled nature of the alternate training data that explains the drop in performance.</p><p>by combining our custom and 1,2-gram features together, to a degree statistically significantly bet- ter than using 1,2-gram features alone.</p><p>Finally, we remark on our Bonferroni correc- tion. Recall that the intent of applying it is to avoid false positives. However, in our case, <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 2(a)</ref> shows that our potentially "false" posi- tives -features whose effectiveness did not pass the Bonferroni correction test -actually do raise performance in our prediction tests.</p><p>Size of training data. Another interesting obser- vation is how performance varies with data size. For n " 1000, 2000, . . . , 10000, we randomly sampled n pairs from our 11,404 pairs, and com- puted the average cross-validation accuracy on the sampled data. <ref type="figure">Figure 2(b)</ref> shows the averages over 50 runs of the aforementioned procedure. Our cus- tom features can achieve good performance with little data, in the sense that for sample size 1000, they outperform BOW features; on the other hand, BOW features quickly surpass them. Across the board, the custom+1,2-gram features are consis- tently better than the 1,2-gram features alone.</p><p>Top features. Finally, we examine some of the top-weighted individual features from our ap- proach and from the competing TAC+ff+time classifier. The top three rows of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 12</ref> show the best custom and best and worst unigram features for our method; the bottom two rows show the best and worst unigrams for TAC+ff+time. Among custom features, we see that community and per- sonal language models, informativeness, retweet scores, sentiment, and generality are represented. As for unigram features, not surprisingly, "rt" and "retweet" are top features for both our approach and TAC+ff+time. However, the other unigrams for the two methods seem to be a bit different in spirit. Some of the unigrams determined to be most poor only by our method appear to be both surprising and yet plausible in retrospect: "icymi" (abbreviation for "in case you missed it") tends to indicate a direct repetition of older information, so people might prefer to retweet the earlier ver- sion; "thanks" and "sorry" could correspond to personal thank-yous and apologies not meant to be shared with a broader audience, and similarly @-mentioning another user may indicate a tweet intended only for that person. The appearance of <ref type="bibr">[hashtag]</ref> in the best TAC+ff+time unigrams is consistent with prior research in non-TAC settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Suh et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Petrovi´cPetrovi´c et al., 2011</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 12</ref>: Features with largest coefficients, de- limited by commas.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we conducted the first large-scale topic-and author-controlled experiment to study the effects of wording on information propagation.</p><p>The features we developed to choose the bet- ter of two alternative wordings posted better per- formance than that of all our comparison algo- rithms, including one given access to author and timing features but trained on non-TAC data, and also bested our estimate of average human perfor- mance. According to our hypothesis tests, help- ful wording heuristics include adding more infor- mation, making one's language align with both community norms and with one's prior messages, and mimicking news headlines.

ing the success of books. The diminished effect of 
hashtag inclusion with respect to what has been re-
ported previously (Suh et al., 2010; Petrovi´cPetrovi´c et al., 
2011) presumably stems from our topic and author 
controls. 
Be like the community, and be true to yourself 
(in the words you pick, but not necessarily in 
how you combine them). (Table 5) Although dis-
tinctive messages may attract attention, messages 
that conform to expectations might be more eas-
ily accepted and therefore shared. Prior work has 
explored this tension: Lakkaraju et al. (2013), in a 
content-controlled study, found that the more up-
voted Reddit image titles balance novelty and fa-
miliarity; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) 
(henceforth DCKL'12) showed that the memora-
bility of movie quotes corresponds to higher lexi-
cal distinctiveness but lower POS distinctiveness; 
and Sun et al. (2013) observed that deviating from 
one's own past language patterns correlates with 
more retweets.
