			<abstract>
				<p>Any given verb can appear in some syntactic frames (Sally broke the vase, The vase broke) but not others (*Sally broke at the vase, *Sally broke the vase to John). There is now considerable evidence that the syntactic behaviors of some verbs can be predicted by their meanings, and many current theories posit that this is true for most if not all verbs. If true, this fact would have striking implications for theories and models of language acquisition, as well as numerous applications in natural language processing. However, empirical investigations to date have focused on a small number of verbs. We report on early results from VerbCorner, a crowd-sourced project extending this work to a large, representative sample of English verbs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Verbs vary in terms of which syntactic frames they can appear in <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. In principle, this could be an unpredictable fact about the verb that must be acquired, much like the phonological form of the verb.</p><p>However, most theorists posit that there is a sys- tematic relationship between the semantics of a verb and the syntactic frames in which it can ap- pear ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Levin and Hovav, 2005</ref>). For instance, it is argued that verbs like break, which describe a Frame hit like break NP V NP x x x NP V - - x NP that S - x - NP V at NP x - - <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Some of the syntactic frames available for hit, like, and break.</p><p>caused change of state, can appear in both the NP V NP form (Sally broke the vase) and the NP V form (The vase broke). Verbs such as hit and like do not describe a change of state and so can- not appear in both forms. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Similarly, only verbs that describe propositional attitudes, such as like, can take a that complement (John liked that Sally broke the vase).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">The Semantic Consistency Hypothesis</head><p>This account has a natural consequence, which we dub the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis: There is some set of semantic features such that verbs that share the same syntactic behavior are identi- cal along those semantic features. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Note that on certain accounts, this is a strong tendency rather than a strict necessity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goldberg, 1995)</ref>. It is widely recognized that a principled re- lationship between syntax and semantics would have broad implications. It is frequently invoked in theories of language acquisition. For instance, Pinker <ref type="bibr">(1984,</ref><ref type="bibr">1989)</ref> has described how this cor- respondence could solve long-standing puzzles about how children learn syntax in the first place. Conversely, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gleitman (1990)</ref> has shown such a syntax-semantics relationship could solve signif- icant problems in vocabulary acquisition. In fact, both researchers argue that a principled relation- ship between syntax and semantics is necessary for language to be learnable at all.</p><p>In computational linguistics and natural lan- guage processing, some form of the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis is often included in lin- guistic resources and utilized in applications. We describe in detail one such resource, VerbNet, which is highly relevant to our investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">VerbNet</head><p>VerbNet ( <ref type="bibr">Kipper et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">based on Levin, 1993)</ref> lists over 6,000 verbs, categorized into 280 classes according to the syntactic frames they can appear in. That is, all verbs in the same class ap- pear in the same set of syntactic frames. Impor- tantly, in addition to characterizing the syntactic frames associated with each class, VerbNet also characterizes the semantics of each class.</p><p>For instance, class 9.7, which comprises a couple dozen verbs, allows 7 different syntactic frames. The entry for one frame is shown below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Syntactic Frame NP V NP PP.DESTINATION Example Jessica sprayed the wall. Syntax AGENT V THEME {+LOC|+DEST CONF} DESTINATION Semantics MOTION(DURING(E), THEME) NOT(PREP(START(E), THEME, DESTINATION)) PREP(END(E), THEME, DESTINATION) CAUSE(AGENT, E)</formula><p>Importantly, the semantics listed here is not just for the verb spray but applies to all verbs from the Spray Class whenever they appear in that syntac- tic frame -that is, VerbNet assumes the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis.</p><p>VerbNet and its semantic features have been used in a variety of NLP applications, such as se- mantic role labeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Swier and Stevenson, 2004</ref>), inferencing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zaenen et al., 2008)</ref>, verb classifica- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Joanis et al., 2008)</ref>, and information extrac- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Maynard et al., 2009)</ref>. It has also been em- ployed in models of language acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Parisien and Stevenson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barak et al., 2012</ref>). In gen- eral, there has been interest in the NLP literature in using these syntactially-relevant semantic fea- tures for shallow semantic parsing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Empirical Status of the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis</head><p>Given the prominence of the Semantic Consis- tency Hypothesis in both theory and practice, one might expect that it was on firm empirical foot- ing. That is, ideally there would be some database of semantic judgments for a comprehensive set of verbs from each syntactic class. In princi- ple, these judgments would come from naive an- notators, since researchers' intuitions about sub- tle judgments may be unconsciously clouded by theoretical commitments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Gibson and Fedorenko, 2013)</ref>. The Semantic Consistency Hypothesis would be supported if, within that database, predi- cates with the same syntactic properties were sys- tematically related semantically.</p><p>No such database exists, whether consisting of the judgments of linguists or naive annotators. Most theoretical studies report researcher judg- ments for only a handful of examples; how many additional examples were considered by the re- searcher goes unreported. In any case, to our knowledge, of the 280 syntactic verb classes listed by VerbNet, only a handful have been studied in any detail.</p><p>The strongest evidence comes from experimen- tal work on several so-called alternations (the pas- sive, causative, locative, and dative alternations). Here, there does appear to be a systematic seman- tic distinction between the two syntactic frames in each alternation, at least most of the time. This has been tested with a reasonable sample of the relevant verbs and also in both children and adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ambridge et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pinker, 1989)</ref>. However, the relevant verbs make up a tiny fraction of all English verbs, and even for these verbs, the syn- tactic frames in question represent only a fraction of the syntactic frames available to those verbs. This is not an accidental oversight. The limit- ing factor is scale: with many thousands of verbs and over a hundred commonly-discussed seman- tic features and syntactic frames, it is not feasi- ble for a single researcher, or even team of re- searchers, to check which verbs appear in which syntactic frames and carry which semantic en- tailments. Collecting data from naive subjects is even more laborious, particularly since the aver- age Man on the Street is not necessarily equipped with metalinguistic concepts like caused change of state and propositional attitude. The VerbCorner Project is aimed at filling that empirical gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">VerbCorner</head><p>The VerbCorner Project 3 is devoted to collecting semantic judgments for a comprehensive set of verbs along a comprehensive set of theoretically- relevant semantic dimension. These data can be used to test the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis.</p><p>Independent of the validity of that hypothesis, the semantic judgments themselves should prove use- ful for any study of linguistic meaning or related application.</p><p>We address the issue of scale through crowd- sourcing: Recruiting large numbers of volunteers, each of whom may provide only a few annota- tions. Several previous projects have success- fully crowd-sourced linguistic annotations, such as Phrase Detectives, where volunteers have con- tributed 2.5 million judgments on anaphoric rela- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Poesio et al., 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Integration with VerbNet</head><p>One significant challenge for any such project is first classifying verbs according to the syntactic frames they can appear in. Thus, at least initially, we are focusing on the 6,000+ verbs already cata- loged in VerbNet. As such, the VerbCorner Project is also verifying and validating the semantics cur- rently encoded in VerbNet. VerbNet will be edited as necessary based on the empirical results.</p><p>Integration with VerbNet has additional bene- fits, since VerbNet itself is integrated with a vari- ety of linguistic resources, such as PropBank and Penn TreeBank. This amplifies the impact of any VerbCorner-inspired changes to VerbNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Tasks</head><p>We selected semantic features of interest based on those most commonly cited in the linguistics lit- erature, with a particular focus on those that -ac- cording to VerbNet -apply to many predicates.</p><p>Previous research has shown that humans find it easier to reason about real-world scenarios than make abstract judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cosmides and Tooby, 1992)</ref>. Thus, for each feature (e.g., MOVEMENT), we converted the metalinguistic judgment ("Does this verb entail movement on the part of some en- tity?") into a real-world problem.</p><p>For example, in "Simon Says Freeze," a task designed to elicit judgments about movement, the Galactic Overlord (Simon) decrees "Galactic Stay Where You Are Day," during which nobody is al- lowed to move from their current location. Par- ticipants read descriptions of events and decide whether anyone violated the rule.</p><p>In "Explode on Contact," designed to elicit judgments about physical contact, objects and people explode when they touch one another. The participant reads descriptions of events and de- cides whether anything has exploded.</p><p>Note that each task is designed to elicit judg- ments about entailments -things that must be true rather than are merely likely to be true. If John greeted Bill, they might have come into contact (e.g., by shaking hands), but perhaps they did not. Previous work suggests that it is the semantic en- tailments that matter, particularly for explaining the syntactic behavior of verbs (Levin, 1993).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Items</head><p>The exact semantics associated with a verb may depend on its syntactic frame. Thus Sally rolled the ball entails that somebody applied force to the ball (namely: Sally), whereas The ball rolled does not. Thus, we investigate the semantics of each verb in each syntactic frame available to it (as de- scribed by VerbNet). Below, the term item is the unit of annotation: a verb in a frame.</p><p>In order to minimize unwanted effects of world knowledge, the verb's arguments are replaced with nonsense words or randomly chosen proper names (Sally sprayed the dax onto the blicket). The use of novel words is explained by the story for each task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">The Phases</head><p>Given the sheer scale of the project, data- collection is expected to take several years at least. Thus, data-collection has been broken up into a se- ries of phases. Each phase focuses on a small num- ber of classes and/or semantic entailments. This ensures that there are meaningful intermediate re- sults that can be disseminated prior to the comple- tion of the entire project. This manuscript reports the results of Phase 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The full data and annotations will be released in the near future and may be available now by re- quest. Below, we summarize the main findings thus far.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Description of Phase 1</head><p>In Phase 1 of the project, we focused on 11 verb classes <ref type="table">(Table 3</ref>) comprising 641 verbs and seven different semantic entailments <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. While six of these entailments were chosen from among those features widely believed to be relevant for syntax, one was not: A Good World, which inves- tigated evaluation (Is the event described by the verb positive or negative?). Although evaluation  of events is an important component of human psychology, to our knowledge no researcher has suggested that it is relevant for syntax. As such, this task provides a lower bound for how much se- mantic consistency one might expect within a syn- tactic verb class. In all, we collected 162,564 judgments from 1,983 volunteers <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Inter-annotator Agreement</head><p>Each task had been iteratively piloted and re- designed until inter-annotator reliability was ac- ceptable, as described in a previous publication. However, these pilot studies involved a small num- ber of items which were coded by all annota- tors. How good was the reliability in the crowd- sourcing context?</p><p>Because we recruited large numbers of an- notators, most of whom annotated only a few items, typical measures of inter-annotator agree- ment such as Cohen's kappa are not easily calcu- lated. Instead, for each item, we calculated the most common (modal) response. We then con- sidered what proportion of all annotations were accounted for by the modal response: a mean of 100% would indicate that there was no disagree- ment among annotators for any item.</p><p>As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, for every task, the modal response covered the bulk responses, rang- ing from a low of 72% for EVALUATION to a high of 93% for PHYSICAL CONTACT. Since there were typically 4 or more possible answers per item, inter-annotator agreement was well above chance. This represents good performance given that the annotators were entirely untrained.</p><p>In many cases, annotator disagreement seems to be driven by syntactic constructions that are only marginally grammatical. For instance, inter- annotator agreement was typically low for class 63. VerbNet suggests two syntactic frames for class 63, one of which (NP V THAT S) appears to be marginal (?I control that Mary eats). In fact, annotators frequently flagged these items as un- grammatical, which is a valuable result in itself for improving VerbNet.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Calculating consistency</head><p>We next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis. As noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic en- tailments. Even a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syn- tactic frames. Thus, calculating consistency of a class must take differing frames into account.</p><p>There are many sophisticated rubrics for calcu- lating consistency. However, for expository pur- poses here, we use one that is intuitive and easy to interpret. First, we determined the annotation for each item (i.e., each verb/frame combination) by majority vote. We then considered how many verbs in each class had the same annotation in any given syntactic frame.</p><p>For example, suppose a class had 10 verbs and 2 frames. In the first frame, 8 verbs received the same annotation and 2 received others. The con- sistency for this class/frame combination is 80%. In the second frame, 6 verbs received the same annotation and 4 verbs received others. The con- sistency for this class/frame combination is 60%. The consistency for the class as a whole is the av- erage across frames: 70%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Results</head><p>Mean consistency averaged across classes is shown for each task in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. As expected, consistency was lowest for EVALUATION, which is not expected to necessarily correlate with syn- tax. Interestingly, consistency for EVALUATION was nonetheless well above floor. This is per- haps not surprising: two sentences that have the same values for PHYSICAL CHANGE, APPLICA- TION OF FORCE, PHYSICAL CONTACT, CHANGE OF MENTAL STATE, MENTAL STATE, and LO- CATION CHANGE are, on average, also likely to be both good or both bad.</p><p>Consistency was much higher for the other tasks, and in fact was close to ceiling for most of them. It remains to be seen whether the items that deviate from the mode represent true differences in semantics or reflect merely noise. One way of ad- dressing this question is to collect additional anno- tations for those items that deviate from the mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Verb semantics</head><p>For each syntactic frame in each class, we deter- mined the most common annotation. This is sum- marized in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The semantic annotation de- pended on syntactic frame nearly 1/4 of the time. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> These frequently matched VerbNet's seman- tics, though not always. For instance, annota- tors judged that class 18.1 verbs in the NP V NP PP.INSTRUMENT entailed movement on the part of the instrument (Sally hit the ball with the stick) -something not reflected in VerbNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>Results of Phase 1 provide support for the Seman- tic Consistency Hypothesis, at least as a strong bias. More work will be needed to determine the strength of that bias. The findings are largely con- sistent with VerbNet's semantics, but changes are indicated in some cases.</p><p>We find that inter-annotator agreement is suf- ficiently high that annotation can be done effec- tively using the modal response with an average of 6-7 responses per item. We are currently in- vestigating whether we can achieve better reliabil- ity with fewer responses per item by taking into account an individual annotator's history across items, as recent work suggests is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Passonneau and Carpenter, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rzhetsky et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Whitehill et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>Thus, crowd-sourcing VerbNet semantic entail- ments appears to be both feasible and productive. Data-collection continues. Phase 2, which added over 10 new verb classes, is complete. Phase 3, which includes both new classes and new entail- ments, has been launched.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Respectively: Task, semantic feature tested, number of annotations, mean number of annotations
