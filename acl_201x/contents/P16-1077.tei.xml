				<p>We revisit Levin&apos;s theory about the correspondence of verb meaning and syntax and infer semantic classes from a large syntactic classification of more than 600 German verbs taking clausal and non-finite arguments. Grasping the meaning components of Levin-classes is known to be hard. We address this challenge by setting up a multi-perspective semantic characterization of the inferred classes. To this end, we link the inferred classes and their English translation to independently constructed semantic classes in three different lexicons-the German wordnet GermaNet, VerbNet and FrameNet-and perform a detailed analysis and evaluation of the resulting German-English classification (avail-able at www.ukp.tu-darmstadt. de/modality-verbclasses/).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Verbs taking clausal and non-finite arguments add a further meaning component to their embedded argument. For example, the embedded argument is realized as that-clause in (1) and (2), but un- derstand in (1) marks it as factual and hope in (2) as uncertain. The verb pretend in (3) realizes its embedded argument as non-finite construction and marks it as non-factual.</p><p>(1) He understands that his computer has a hardware problem.</p><p>(2) She hopes that her experience will help others.</p><p>(3) He pretends to take notes on his laptop, but really is updating his Facebook profile.</p><p>The entities expressed by embedded clausal and non-finite arguments are also called "abstract ob- ject" (AO) in the rest of this paper (follow- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asher (1993)</ref>); we will use the linguistic term "modality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hacquard, 2011)</ref> to subsume the meanings (such as factuality, non-factuality and uncertainty) denoted by AO-selecting verbs.</p><p>As AO-selecting verbs can change the mean- ing of a text in important ways, text understand- ing systems should be sensitive to them. In par- ticular, classifications of AO-selecting verbs ac- cording to semantic criteria are important knowl- edge sources for a wide range of NLP applications, such as event tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Saurí et al., 2005</ref>), com- mited belief tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Prabhakaran et al., 2010)</ref>, reported speech tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krestel et al., 2008)</ref>, the detection of uncertainty ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Szarvas et al., 2012)</ref> and future-oriented content <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eckle-Kohler et al., 2008)</ref>, textual entailment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lotan et al., 2013)</ref>, or determining the degree of factuality of a given text <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">de Marneffe et al., 2012)</ref>. Accordingly, various semantic classifications of AO-selecting verbs have been developed, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Karttunen, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Karttunen, 2012)</ref>, some of them explicitly in the context of NLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nairn et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Saurí, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>However, these classifications are constructed manually and often quite limited in coverage. Consequently, extending or adapting them to spe- cific domains or other languages is a major issue.</p><p>We propose to address this issue by exploiting the relationship between the syntactic behavior of verbs and their meaning following Levin's theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Levin, 1993)</ref>. This has not been done yet for verbs signaling modality, as far as we are aware. For the particular category of AO-selecting verbs, Levin's theory allows constructing verb classifi- cations in a purely syntax-driven way, i.e. in- ducing semantic classes from syntactically defined classes, and thus possibly also extending given classes using large corpora. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> While the appeal of Levin's hypotheses is clear, we are aware of a major difficulty, making our approach a challenging research problem: it is very hard to grasp the precise meaning compo- nents which are to be associated with a syntactic "Levin" class. At the same time, it is vital to have a good semantic characterization of the meaning components in order to apply such classes to NLP tasks in an informed way.</p><p>We address these issues and make the follow- ing contributions: (i) We consider a purely syn- tactic classification of more than 600 German AO- selecting verbs and induce semantic classes based on findings from formal semantics about corre- spondences between verb syntax and meaning. This yields an initial description of the mean- ing components associated with the classes, along with a tentative class name. (ii) In a second step, we refine and extend the semantic characteriza- tion of the verb classes by translating it to English and linking it to existing semantic classes in lexi- cal resources at the word sense level: we consider the coarse semantic fields in the German wordnet GermaNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002</ref>), the verb classes in the English lexicon VerbNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kipper et al., 2008)</ref>, and the semantic frames in the English lexicon FrameNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baker et al., 1998</ref>). As a re- sult, we obtain a detailed semantic characteriza- tion of the verb classes, as well as insights into the validity of Levin's theory across the related languages German and English. (iii) We also per- form a task-oriented evaluation of the verb classes in textual entailment recognition, making use of insights from the previous two steps. The results suggest that the verb classes might be a promising resource for this task, for German and for English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>This section summarizes related work about the correspondence between verb meaning and syntax and discusses related work on modality in NLP.</p><p>Syntactic Reflections of Verb Meaning Se- mantic verb classifications that are grounded in lexical-syntactic properties of verbs are particu- larly appealing, because they can automatically be recovered in corpora based on syntactic fea- tures. The most well known verb classification based on correspondences between verb syntax and verb meaning is Levin's classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Levin, 1993)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Levin (2015a)</ref>, verbs that share common syntactic argument alternation pat- terns also have particular meaning components in common, thus they can be grouped into a seman- tic verb class. For example, verbs participating in the dative alternation 2 can be grouped into a se- mantic class of verbs sharing the particular mean- ing component "change of possession", thus this shared meaning component characterizes the se- mantic class. Recent work on verb semantics pro- vides additional evidence for this correspondence of verb syntax and meaning: <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hartshorne et al. (2014)</ref> report that the syntactic behavior of some verbs can be predicted based on their meaning.</p><p>VerbNet is a broad-coverage verb lexicon orga- nized in verb classes based on Levin-style syn- tactic alternations: verbs with common subcat- egorization frames and syntactic alternation be- havior that also share common semantic roles are grouped into VerbNet classes. VerbNet not only includes the verbs from the original verb classifi- cation by Levin, but also more than 50 additional verb classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kipper et al., 2006</ref>) automatically acquired from corpora ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004</ref>). These classes contain many AO-selecting verbs that were not covered by Levin's classifica- tion. However, VerbNet does not provide infor- mation about the modal meaning of AO-selecting verbs and does not reflect fine-grained distinctions between various kinds of modality.</p><p>There is also some criticism in previous work regarding the validity of Levin's approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker and Ruppenhofer (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schnorbusch (2004)</ref> both discuss various issues with Levin's original classification, in particular the difficulty to grasp the meaning components, which are to be associ- ated with a Levin class.</p><p>While approaches to exploit the syntactic be- havior of verbs for the automatic acquisition of se- mantic verb classes from corpora have been de- veloped in the past, they were used to recover only small verb classifications: Schulte im Walde (2006)'s work considered a semantically balanced set of 168 German verbs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Merlo and Stevenson (2001)</ref> used 60 English verbs from three particular semantic classes.</p><p>In contrast to previous work, we consider a large set of more than 600 German AO-selecting verbs and focus on their modal meaning (i.e., expressing factuality or uncertainty). Related Work on Modality in NLP Previous work in NLP on the automatic (and manual) anno- tation of modality has often tailored the concept of modality to particular applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Szarvas et al. (2012)</ref> introduce a taxonomy of different kinds of modality expressing uncertainty, such as deontic, bouletic, abilitative modality, and use it for detect- ing uncertainty in an Information Extraction set- ting. Their uncertainty cues also include verbs.</p><p>Saurí and Pustejovsky (2012) use discrete val- ues in a modality continuum ranging from uncer- tain to absolutely certain in order to automatically determine the factuality of events mentioned in text. Their automatic approach is based on the FactBank corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009)</ref>, a corpus of newswire data with manually annotated event mentions. For the factuality annotation of the event mentions, the human annotators were in- structed to primarily base their decision on lexi- cal cues. For example, they used verbs of belief and opinion, perception verbs, or verbs expressing proof. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nissim et al. (2013)</ref> introduce an annota- tion scheme for the cross-linguistic annotation of modality in corpora. Their annotation scheme de- fines two dimensions which are to be annotated (called layers): factuality (characterizing the em- bedded proposition or concept) and speaker's at- titude (characterizing the embedding predicate). Their annotation scheme starts from a fixed set of modal meanings and aims at finding previously unknown triggers of modality. However, some modal meanings are not distinguished, in partic- ular those involving future-orientation. A classi- fication approach grounded in syntax -as in our work -can be considered as complementary: it starts from the syntactic analysis of a large set of trigger words, and induces a broad range of modal meanings based on correspondences be- tween verbs syntax and meaning.</p><p>Our semantic classification for AO-selecting verbs covers a wide range of different kinds of modality in text, thus considerably extending pre- vious work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Inferring Semantic Verb Classes</head><p>In this section, we infer semantic verb classes from the syntactic alternation behavior of a large dataset of German AO-selecting verbs. The research hy- potheses underlying our method can be summa- rized as follows: There are correspondences be- tween verb syntax and meaning: certain syntac- tic alternations correspond to particular meaning components (Levin, 2015a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">German Subcategorization Lexicon</head><p>We consider a set of 637 AO-selecting verbs given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Eckle-Kohler, 1999</ref>). These verbs are a subset of a subcategorization lexicon (i.e., pairs of lemma and subcategorization frame) that has automati- cally been extracted from large newspaper cor- pora using a shallow regular expression grammar covering more than 240 subcategorization frames (short: subcat frames). All the subcat frames ex- tracted for a given verb were manually checked and only the correct ones were included in the fi- nal lexicon, because high quality lexical informa- tion was crucial in the target application Lexical Functional Grammar parsing. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Eckle-Kohler (1999) specified the alternation behavior of each AO-selecting verb regarding dif- ferent types of clausal and non-finite arguments, yielding a syntactic signature for each verb (e.g., 111101 for the verb einsehen (realize) using the encoding in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, top to bottom correspond- ing to left to right). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For this, each verb was in- spected regarding its ability to take any of the con- sidered clausal and non-finite constructions as ar- gument -either on the basis of the automatically acquired subcat frames or by making use of lin- guistic introspection. Linguistic introspection is necessary to reliably identify non-possible argu- ment types, since missing subcat frames that were not extracted automatically are not sufficient as ev- idence.</p><p>Although there are 64 possible syntactic signa- tures according to basic combinatorics, in the data only 46 signatures were found, which group the verbs into 46 classes. While Eckle-Kohler (1999) points out a few semantic characteristics of these classes, most of them lack a semantic characteri- zation. Our goal is to address this gap and to in- fer shared meaning components for all the classes. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Clausal and infinitival arguments distin- guished in the syntactic classification; possibility of each type is encoded as 1 (possible) or 0 (not possible).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Findings from Formal Semantics</head><p>We employ the following findings on correspon- dences between verb meaning and syntax in order to infer semantic classes from the syntactic signa- tures. This gives also rise to tentative names (la- bels) for the corresponding meaning components. Factuals: the that-wh and the that-wh/if al- ternation. Verbs that are able to alternatively take that and wh-clauses coerce the embedded interrog- ative and declarative clauses into factual AOs, cor- responding to a particular fact <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ginzburg, 1996)</ref>. Among the verbs showing the that-wh alternation are the well-known factive verbs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970</ref>) (e.g., She proves that she exists. vs. She proves who she is. vs. He proves whether he can mine gold.).</p><p>There is a further distinction among these verbs regarding the ability to take an embedded if/whether-question: <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schwabe and Fittler (2009)</ref> show that the that-wh/if alternation is connected to objective verbs entailing the existence of an in- dependent witness, whereas the that-wh alterna- tion (i.e., an if/whether-question is not possible) occurs with non-objective verbs (e.g., He regrets whom he ended up with. vs. He regrets whether he ended up playing this game.).</p><p>"Aspectuals": the inability to take that- clauses and to-infinitives in the past tense. Recently, linguistic research has increasingly addressed particular semantic aspects of to- infinitives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kush (2011)</ref> has investigated AOs that can neither be realized as that-clause nor as to- infinitive in the past tense (e.g., She hesitates to answer. vs. She hesitates to have answered. 7 vs.</p><p>She hesitates that ...) These AOs are selected by control verbs 8 and can be characterized as men- tal actions. Kush (2011) points out that the verbs selecting those AOs have an aspectual meaning in common.</p><p>Future orientation: to-infinitives in the present tense and the inability to take to- infinitives in the past tense. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Laca (2013)</ref> has in- vestigated verbs across English and Spanish that embed future-oriented AOs. Only future-oriented AOs can be used with future-oriented adverbials, such as tomorrow, and these AOs are often real- ized as non-finite constructions, e.g., to-infinitives. She points out that not only control verbs take future-oriented AOs, but also verbs expressing at- titudes of preference. This finding implies that such future-oriented AOs are typically incompati- ble with past-oriented adverbials (e.g., yesterday) and verb forms in the past tense (e.g., She plans having finished the assignment yesterday.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Mapping to Meaning Components</head><p>We automatically infer semantic classes based on a manually constructed mapping between the syn- tactic signatures from Eckle-Kohler (1999) and the meaning components grounded in syntax summa- rized in Section 3.2. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We constructed this mapping in two steps: In a first step, the signatures are aligned to the meaning components from Section 3.2 based on substrings of the signatures: future-orientation matches thesignature #verbs -examples meaning components semantic characterization <ref type="table">(#linked verbs)</ref> 010 --- 36 (6%) -wagen (dare), zögern (hesitate), weigern (refuse)</p><p>aspectual: verbs expressing the ability of doing an action VN (2): consider-29.9, wish-62; FN (2): pur- pose, cogitation</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">110 0-- 195 (31%) -anbieten (offer), empfehlen (recom- mend), fordern (demand)</formula><p>future-oriented: verbs marking AOs as anticipated, planned VN (89): force-59, forbid-67, wish-62, promote- 102, urge-58.1, order-60, admire-31.2, order-60, promise-37.13 ; FN <ref type="formula">(43)</ref>  nature, these slots are left underspecified. Merging the signatures in this way yields 8 partially under- specified signatures which correspond to the final semantic classes. This procedure covers more than 99% of the 637 verbs under investigation: only 5 verbs showed idiosyncratic syntactic behavior, 4 of those are verbs that can take an AO as sub- ject (e.g., bedeuten (mean)). As a consequence of the automatic part of this procedure, every verb is assigned to exactly one class -a simplification which we plan to resolve as part of future work. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> provides an overview and a characteri- zation of these classes, also showing the final sig- natures and their substrings which correspond to the meaning components. The non-factual class is derived from the wh-factual class: the only differ- ence is the inability to take a wh-clause (e.g. He hopes, when he will succeed.).</p><p>While the descriptions of the meaning compo- nents and the class names are inspired from re- search in linguistics (typically a very deep anal- ysis of only few verbs), transferring them to our verb resource -which is of much larger scale -in- evitably leads to outlier verbs in the classes, e.g., verbs that do not strictly match the class label. Examples include verbs such asüberlegenas¨asüberlegen (con- sider) in the wh/if-factual class (not covering the future-oriented meaning component) or schaden (harm) as non-factual rather than as wh-factual. For this reason, and also because of the assignment of highly polysemous verbs to only one class, the definitions of meaning components and the class names should rather be considered as loose, pro- viding a first tentative semantic characterization of the modality classes.</p><p>In sum, this section presented an inventory of modal meaning components that we primar- ily synthesized from research in linguistics. The classification work is strictly grounded in syntac- tic properties of the verbs and was not targeted a priori at modal meanings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Linking to Semantic Classes</head><p>Our first set of experiments aims at refining the initial semantic characterization of the classes by linking them to independently constructed seman- tic classifications at the word sense level. Specif- ically, we consider three different semantic classi- fications from computational lexicons, which have been created by linguistic experts: (i) the so-called semantic fields in GermaNet, grouping verb senses into 15 coarse classes, such as perception, emo- tion, (ii) the verb classes given in VerbNet, and (iii) the Frame-semantic frames in FrameNet. As the GermaNet and FrameNet classes are based on different lexicographic and linguistic theories, we expect an additional semantic characterization from the linking. The VerbNet classes, which also follow Levin's hypotheses, however, are used to investigate if the syntax-semantics correspon- dence is maintained across the related languages German and English.</p><p>For this linking experiment, we used the UBY framework (   <ref type="bibr">10</ref> , containing standardized versions of the above lexicons, as well as a linking between VerbNet and FrameNet on the word sense level.</p><p>Approach In order to link our classes to verb senses in GermaNet and VerbNet, we developed an automatic linking method based on subcat frame similarity. Recognizing subcat frame sim- ilarity requires a common standardized format for the otherwise incomparable frames. UBY pro- vides such a standardized format which has been presented in detail by Eckle- . It represents subcat frames uniformly across German and English, and at a fine-grained level of individual syntactic arguments. Our link- ing approach is based on the following hypothe- sis: Two verb senses with equivalent lemmas are equivalent, if they have similar subcat frames. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Our method interprets the pairs of verb and sub- 10 http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/uby/ 11 This approach is applicable for GermaNet, because Ger- maNet contains fine-grained syntactic subcat frames. cat frame listed in our classification <ref type="bibr">12</ref> as senses. While we do not claim that this hypothesis is suf- ficient in general, i.e., for all verb senses, we found that it is valid for the subset of senses belonging to the class of AO-selecting verbs.</p><p>The cross-lingual linking of our classes to Verb- Net senses requires an additional translation step, which we describe first.</p><p>Manual Translation While UBY also provides translations between German and English verb senses, e.g., as part of the Interlingual Index from EuroWordnet (ILI), we found that many of the translations were not present in our target lexicon VerbNet. Therefore, the main author of this pa- per, a native speaker of German with a good pro- ficiency in English, translated the AO-compatible verbs (i.e., word senses) manually using Linguee <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and dictionaries. This took about 7 hours.</p><p>For 23 German verbs, we could not find any equivalent lexicalized translation, because these verbs express very fine-grained semantic nuances. For example, we did not find an equivalent English verb for a few verbs in the aspectual class but only a translation consisting of an adjective in combina- tion with to be. Examples include be easy (leicht- fallen), be willing (sich bereitfinden), be capable (vermögen), which have German equivalents that are lexicalized as verbs. As a result, we arrived at translations for 614 out of 637 German verbs. These 614 German verbs are translated to 413 En- glish verbs, indicating that the English translation has a more general meaning in many cases.</p><p>Automatic Verb Sense Linking Our algorithm links a German verb sense (or its English transla- tion) with a GermaNet (or VerbNet) sense, if the subcat frames of both verb senses have the same number of arguments and if the arguments have certain features in common. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> For example, to cre- ate a link to GermaNet, features such as the com- plementizer of clausal arguments and the case of noun phrase arguments have to agree. In a similar way, the linking to VerbNet is based on a compar- ison of German subcat frames and English subcat frames -which are represented uniformly across German and English. In Section A.2, we provide more details about the algorithm.</p><p>Results According to a manual evaluation of a random sample of 200 sense pairs, the automatic verb sense linking yielded an accuracy of 89.95% for the linking to GermaNet, and 87.54% for the linking to VerbNet (κ agreement on the sample annotated by two annotators was 0.7 and 0.8, re- spectively). The main types of errors in the linking to GermaNet and VerbNet are due to specific syn- tactic features of the subcat frames which diverge and are not considered in the automatic linking. The differences regarding these specific features are due to cross-lingual differences (VerbNet, e.g., verb phrase arguments with ing-form) and diverg- ing linguistic analyses of particular constructions (GermaNet, e.g., constructions with es (it)), see also Eckle- .</p><p>By linking the verbs in our classification to semantic classes in GermaNet, VerbNet and FrameNet, we obtain a three-way semantic char- acterization of our classes. The linking to the GermaNet semantic fields covers 270 (43%) of the source verbs. Of these, 219 (81%) are linked to the three semantic fields cognition, communi- cation and social. Fewer verbs (32 (12%)) are linked to the semantic fields emotion, percep- tion, change. Semantic fields not among the tar- get classes are consumption, competition, contact, body and weather. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarizes the linking to VerbNet and FrameNet and shows how many verbs from each source class could be linked to any of the classes in VerbNet or FrameNet. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> As the class distribution of the verb subsets covered by our linking-based evaluation is similar as for the original classes, we consider our evaluation as valid, although less than 50% of all verbs could be evaluated this way.</p><p>The target classes in VerbNet and FrameNet re- veal meaning components that are on the one hand unique for individual classes, and on the other hand shared across several German classes.</p><p>The future-oriented class contains object con- trol verbs (e.g., force-59, forbid-67 in VerbNet, and request, preventing in FrameNet). The wh/if- factual class is unique regarding the cognition and perception verbs (e.g., discover-84, see-30.1-1, and perception-experience). The future-directed <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Based on the percentage of source class members linked to any of the target classes, we only display target classes with an overlap of at least 1.8% due to space constraints.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analysis of Frequency and Polysemy</head><p>In order to assess the usefulness of the verb re- source for NLP tasks, we determined the lemma frequency of all verbs in the 8 classes in SDeWaC <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Faaß and Eckart, 2013)</ref>, a cleaned version of the German DeWaC corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baroni and Kilgarriff, 2006)</ref>. A ranking of the verbs according to their lemma frequency showed that 89% of the verbs occur more than 50 times in SDeWaC. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We also analyzed the frequency distribution of the 8 verb classes in two other German corpora belonging to different genres, and also for En- glish, see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: 17 encyclopedic text (the Ger- man Wikipedia <ref type="bibr">18</ref> ), German newspaper text (the Tiger corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brants et al., 2004)</ref>), and the English <ref type="bibr">16</ref> In the verb resource we provide for download, we included this frequency information in order to enable frequency-based filtering.</p><p>17 Details of the computation of the verb lemma frequency lists are given in the appendix A.1.</p><p>18 www.wikipedia.de, dump of 2009-06-18</p><p>Reuters-21578 corpus. 19 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows that the large verb classes constitute a substantial propor- tion of verb occurrences across different genres. This suggests that the verb classes might be useful features for various text classification tasks.</p><p>We performed a further analysis of the poly- semy of the German and English verbs in our classes relative to several fine and coarse word sense inventories. Regarding GermaNet, there are 2.28 senses per verb (1.53 for all GermaNet verbs), whereas WordNet lists 5.11 senses per verb (2.17 for all WordNet verbs). In VerbNet, we find 1.74 senses per verb (1.42 for all Verb- Net verbs), and in FrameNet 1.96 (1.52 for all FrameNet verbs). This analysis shows that the task of automatic sense linking is particularly hard for the category of AO-selecting verbs we consider. Whether the polysemy is an issue for any applica- tion where the verb classes are used as features is not a priori clear and depends on the task at hand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Textual Entailment Experiment</head><p>For an extrinsic evaluation, we investigated the usefulness of the German and the English verb classes as features in recognizing textual entail- ment (RTE). In RTE, the task is to determine whether for a pair of text fragments -the text T and the hypothesis H -the meaning of H is en- tailed by T ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dagan et al., 2006</ref>); for non-entailing pairs, sometimes a further category "unknown" is used as a label.</p><p>We employed a simple classification-based ap- proach to RTE and trained and evaluated a Naive Bayes classifier on the test sets of three RTE benchmarks, using 10-fold cross validation: the English RTE-3 data (  and their German translation 20 (the development sets and the test sets each consist of 800 pairs), and an expanded version of the English RTE-3 data from the Sagan Textual Entailment Test Suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Castillo, 2010)</ref> consisting of 2974 pairs. While the Ger- man dataset provides a two-way classification of the T-H pairs, the two English datasets provide a three-way classification, also using the "unknown" label. We used the DKPro TC framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Daxenberger et al., 2014</ref>) for classification and applied POS tagging and lemmatization as preprocessing.</p><p>As a baseline feature, we use the word over- lap measure between two T-H pairs (no stopword filtering, no lemmatization, no normalization of overlap score), which is quite competitive on the RTE-3 data, because this dataset shows a high difference in word overlap between positive (en- tailment) and negative (no entailment) pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bentivogli et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>An analysis of the development set of the Ger- man RTE-3 data showed that 62% of the pairs con- tain at least one occurrence of any of the verbs from the classification in either T or H. However, T and H fragments display no statistically significant differences <ref type="bibr">21</ref> regarding the occurrences of any of the verb classes.</p><p>A detailed analysis revealed that pairs without entailment are often characterized by a mismatch between T and H regarding the presence of factu- ality markers. For example, the presence of verbs indicating uncertainty (all classes apart from wh- factual and wh/if-factual) in T and an absence of such verbs in H might indicate non-entailment as in the following not entailing pair from the English RTE3 development set where "long" signals non- factuality, but "researching" signals factuality:</p><p>T: The BBC's Americas editor Will Grant says many Mexicans are tired of conflict and long for a return to normality. H: Will Grant is researching a conflict with Mexicans.</p><p>Thus, an insufficient overlap of modality markers in T and H might actually indicate non-entailment, but lead to an incorrect classification as entailment when considering only word overlap.</p><p>Accordingly, we implemented a factuality- mismatch feature both for German and for En- glish, based on our new German and English classes. This feature is similar to the word overlap feature but with lemmatization and nor- malization of overlap score. Verb class counts are based on verb lemma counts of the mem- ber verbs; for English verbs that are members of more than one class, we included all verb classes in our factuality-mismatch feature. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Ta- ble 4 shows the results. While the differences for RTE-3 DE and RTE-3 EN are not statisti- cally significant, the factuality-mismatch feature yielded a small but significant improvement on the expanded RTE-3 EN dataset. This is due to the different nature of the expanded RTE dataset, which was created using a paraphrasing technique. As a result, the number of occurrences of verbs from our classes increased, and the factuality- mismatch became a discriminative feature for distinguishing between CONTRADICTION and UNKNOWN/ENTAILMENT.</p><p>Considering the fact that we employed only simple overlap features that do not rely on depen- dency parsing and did not perform any word sense disambiguation, these results suggest that the verb classes might be promising features for RTE, both for German and English. As factuality can be ex- pressed by a variety of further linguistic means, including modal verbs, negation, tense and certain adverbs, investigating the combination of our verb classes with other modality signals might be espe- cially promising as part of future work.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier (10- fold cross validation on the test sets) with word overlap (WO) and additional factuality-mismatch (WO+FM) features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results and Discussion</head><p>Our construction of semantic classes from the syn- tactic behavior of AO-selecting verbs results in an inventory of modal meanings that emerged from a large lexical resource. The main result of the link- ing based evaluation is a detailed semantic char- acterization of the inferred classes -a prerequisite for using them in NLP tasks in an informed way. The semantic classes seem to be particular suited for tasks related to opinion analysis, textual infer- ence, or argumentation mining. In this context, the relationship between our large resource of lexical verbs and the closed class of modal verbs might be an interesting question for future research. Most of all, the linking to GermaNet and FrameNet shows that it is indeed possible to nar- row down meaning components for Levin classes. Moreover, the results of the linking to Verb- Net also provide support for Levin's hypothesis that the correspondences between verb syntax and meaning described for English largely apply to the related language German as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Levin, 2015b)</ref>.</p><p>The English version of the semantic classes which we created by means of translation has the same semantic properties as the German classes. However, the syntactic properties of the English classes are not fully specified, because English has additional kinds of non-finite arguments, such as ing-forms or bare infinitives. Therefore, it might be interesting to address this question in the fu- ture and to build a similar semantic classification for English from scratch, in particular in the con- text of extracting modality classes from corpora. This would require an adaptation of the syntactic signatures, considering the various kinds of non- finite arguments particular to English. Based on large subcategorization lexicons available for En- glish (e.g. COMLEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grishman et al., 1994)</ref> or VerbNet), it should be feasible to derive such sig- natures and to construct a mapping of signatures to modality aspects in a similar way as for German.</p><p>The question whether the syntactic signatures can be recovered in large corpora is particularly in- teresting, because this would allow extending the existing classes and to also acquire AO-selecting adjectives and nouns. We plan to investigate this question as part of future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We inferred semantic classes from a large syn- tactic classification of German AO-selecting verbs based on findings from formal semantics about correspondences between verb syntax and mean- ing. Our thorough evaluation and analysis yields detailed insights into the semantic characteristics of the inferred classes, and we hope that this al- lows an informed use of the resulting resource in various semantic NLP tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>The 632 verbs in 8 semantic classes (5 verbs show idiosyncratic behavior).

It is important to point out that future-orientation can be combined with factuality: this corresponds to an independent matching of the 110 prefix and the factuality substring. While this combination may seem contradictory, it reflects the lexical data and shows that also weak forms of factuality (&quot;it will most likely be factual at some point in the future&quot;) are expressed in language. In a second step, the pre-aligned signatures are merged, if the remaining slots of the signature are either 1 or 0 (i.e. the respective argument types can or can not occur); in the resulting merged sigtypical instead of a to-infinitive in the past tense. 8 &quot;Control&quot; refers to the co-reference between the implicit subject of the infinitival argument and syntactic arguments in the main clause, either the subject (subject control) or direct object (object control). 9 We did not consider verbs can be used with all kinds of clausal and infinitival arguments, such as the majority of communication verbs (e.g., comment, whisper).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="12"> We consider only verb senses that are compatible with AOs, as indicated by subcat frames with clausal or non-finite arguments. 13 Linguee (http://www.linguee.de/) is a translation tool combining an editorial dictionary and a search engine processing bilingual texts. In particular, it provides a large variety of contextual translation examples. 14 We do not link the subcat frames, but we do compare them across the related languages German and English to determine their similarity in the context of linking.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="21"> All significance scores in this paper are based on Fisher&apos;s exact test at significance level p&lt;0.05. 22 In the German part, every verb is assigned to one class, while the translation to English resulted in 22% of the English verbs being members in more than one class. However, only 11% of the multiple class assignments involve a combination of factual and uncertainty classes.</note>
