				<p>Monitoring mobility-and industry-relevant events is important in areas such as personal travel planning and supply chain management, but extracting events pertaining to specific companies, transit routes and locations from heterogeneous, high-volume text streams remains a significant challenge. We present Spree, a scalable system for real-time, automatic event extraction from social media, news and domain-specific RSS feeds. Our system is tailored to a range of mobility-and industry-related events, and processes German texts within a distributed linguistic analysis pipeline implemented in Apache Flink. The pipeline detects and disambiguates highly ambiguous domain-relevant entities, such as street names, and extracts various events with their geo-locations. Event streams are visualized on a dynamic, interactive map for monitoring and analysis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Monitoring relevant news and events is of cen- tral importance in many economic and personal decision processes, such as supplier/supply chain management, market research, and personal travel planning. Social media, news sites, but also more specialized information systems such as on-line traffic and public transport information sources, provide valuable streams of text messages that can be used to improve decision making processes. For example, a sourcing department of a com- pany may wish to monitor world-wide news for disruptive or risk-related events pertaining to their suppliers (e.g. natural disasters, strikes, liquid- ity risks), while a traveler wants to be informed about traffic events related to her itinerary (e.g. delays, cancellations). We thus want to extract and recognize events from message streams that mention very specific entities, such as compa- nies, locations, or routes. For example, from the sentence "On Friday, Amazon employees once more went on strike in the company's shipping center in Leipzig.", we would like to extract a strike event with arguments time=Friday, organi- zation=Amazon, and location=Leipzig.</p><p>Detecting such events in textual message streams raises a number of challenges. Social me- dia streams, such as Twitter, are of very high vol- ume and often contain duplicated, imprecise and potentially non-trustworthy information. They are written in a very informal, not always grammat- ically well-formed style ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Osborne et al., 2014</ref>), which cannot easily be processed with standard linguistic tools. News sites provide well-formed texts, but their content is very heterogeneous and often hard to separate from non-relevant web page elements. Both types of sources relate informa- tion about an unbounded number of topics, which means that relevant messages need to be distin- guished from irrelevant data. Domain-specific in- formation sources, on the other hand, are topic- focused, but employ a wide variety of formats, from telegraph style texts to table entries. Process- ing such sources hence often requires customized analysis pipelines as well as domain adaptation of existing linguistic tools. We also typically re- quire that documents are processed in (near) real- time in order to enable timely responses to im- portant events. Finally, utilizing domain-specific, large entity datasets raises additional challenges for named entity recognition and linking, includ- ing significantly more cross-type ambiguities (e.g. synonymous street and transport stop names) and a higher rate of ambiguous, long-tail entities (e.g., there is a "main street" or "bus route #1" in many towns).</p><p>We introduce Spree, a scalable platform for real-time, fine-grained event extraction and geospatial visualization (Section 2). It is de- signed to process German texts from social media, news, web sites and traffic information sources in a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant manner (Section 3). These features are realized by im- plementing the system's main components within the Apache Flink framework ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexandrov et al., 2014</ref>), a big data analytics platform which pro- vides a high through-put, streaming computing en- vironment. Events are automatically detected and geo-located within a linguistic analysis pipeline (Section 4), and visualized for the end user in a web-based application (Section 5). The system in its current version is tailored to the mobility and supply chain domains, and allows users to moni- tor and analyze messages for a range of events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Overview and Architecture</head><p>The system was designed based on the following requirements:</p><p>• Combine mobility and industry data from structured knowledge resources with infor- mation from highly dynamic, unstructured or semi-structured document streams</p><p>• Identify and extract mobility and industry- related entities and events from dynamic data streams</p><p>• Enable large-scale, fault-tolerant processing of data streams in (near) real-time</p><p>• Visualize identified events on a dynamic, in- teractive map <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> gives an overview of the system ar- chitecture. The system separates data ingestion (crawling) from the actual processing, which fa- cilitates the integration of new data sources. Data ingestion and processing are loosely coupled via a message queue (MQ). The streaming process- ing of documents encompasses three major tasks: Preprocessing of documents (including HTML- to-text conversion, boilerplating, and linguistic preprocessing), entity discovery and linking, and event extraction. Components are coupled with a shared document schema which stores annota- tion results. Annotated documents are persisted to a distributed index. Additional structured knowl- edge is stored in relational databases, and served via REST interfaces. The user interface is imple- mented as a light-weight web application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Sources</head><p>This section describes the data streams and knowl- edge resources that are implemented in the Spree system. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows summary statistics of the data streams, and <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows summary statis- tics of the knowledge resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Size  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Data statistics for knowledge resources</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Streams</head><p>All source data streams are handled with in- dividual crawlers, which push documents to Kafka MQ 1 for further processing by the analysis pipeline (see Section 4).</p><p>Twitter We use the Twitter Search API 2 to obtain a topically focused streaming sample of tweets. For our current system, we define the search filter using a list of approximately 150 domain-relevant users/channels and 300 search terms. Channels include e.g. airline companies, traffic information sources, and railway compa- nies. Search terms comprise event-related key- words such as "traffic jam" or "roadworks", but also major highway names, railway route identi- fiers, and airport codes. This limits the number of tweets to approximately 50.000 per day, at a rate of about 35 tweets a minute.</p><p>News We retrieve news pages and general web  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: System architecture sites using the uberMetrics Search API 3 , which provides an interface to more than 400 million web sources that are crawled on a regular basis. The API allows us to define complex boolean search queries to filter the set of web pages that our sys- tem needs to process. We employ the same search terms as for Twitter, and limit the language to Ger- man. This provides approximately 13.200 docu- ments per day (9/min). RSS Feeds We implemented custom crawlers for a representative set of approximately 100 RSS feeds that provide traffic and transportation infor- mation. Feed sources include federal and state po- lice, radio stations, and air travel sources. The feeds are fetched at regular intervals, yielding ap- proximately 136.000 feed items per day (95/min).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Knowledge Bases</head><p>We integrate several types of knowledge resources for domain-specific named entity recognition, en- tity linking and event extraction. All resources are stored in a PostgreSQL relational database.</p><p>Companies We maintain a list of approx. 800K German companies, which includes many small and medium enterprises. From this list we selected a subset of 112,347 companies with ≥ 20 em- ployees. Company entries comprise information about the company's name, judicial form, number of employees, and industry sector, and are associ- ated with one or more postal addresses which were geocoded using Nominatim <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . If applicable, entries are linked to DBpedia 5 and Freebase <ref type="bibr">6</ref> .</p><p>OpenStreetMap OpenStreetMap provides data dumps 7 that we use as a knowledge resource for location names. In particular, we utilize city, town, village, highway and road data for Germany, in- cluding names and geo-shape information.</p><p>GTFS Our final resource consists of trans- portation data of the German railway company Deutsche Bahn AG. This dataset contains railway and public transport stops, timetables, and transit routes, and includes geographical information for each entity. The data is provided in the commonly used General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format 8 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Document Processing Pipeline</head><p>This section describes the implementation of the streaming pipeline to process documents in the Spree system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Schema</head><p>We store analysis results of individual pipeline components in a shared document schema that is inspired by the Common Analysis Structure (CAS) approach implemented in UIMA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ferrucci and Lally, 2004</ref>). The schema defines elements, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> nominatim.openstreetmap.org 5 dbpedia.org 6 freebase.com 7 planet.openstreetmap.org 8 developers.google.com/transit/gtfs such as documents, sentences, tokens, concepts and relations. Annotations are either realized as attributes of these classes, or in a generic fash- ion using a labeled span scheme. We use Avro 9 , a compact binary data format, to serialize docu- ments between pipeline processing steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Stream Processing</head><p>Document processing is implemented in an anal- ysis pipeline that is realized within the Apache Flink framework ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexandrov et al., 2014)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . Flink's core is a streaming data flow engine that provides data distribution, communication, and fault tolerance for distributed computations over data streams. All document processors in- gest messages (documents) from the MQ sys- tem. This architecture ensures data durability via Kafka's replication and disk persistence fea- tures, and consistent data movement and compu- tation with Apache Flink. Together, these frame- works guarantee exactly-once delivery of events, can handle back pressure in case of data stream peaks, and provide high throughput. Our sys- tem thus can easily scale to larger and faster data streams than those we currently handle, for exam- ple when extending the system to monitor more data streams, other languages, or a wider range of events.</p><p>Our document processing implementation reads messages from Kafka and converts them to the in- ternal document schema. For news and web sites, we extract text from the HTML and remove boil- erplate code <ref type="bibr">11</ref> . We perform language detection, and discard any non-German documents. All re- maining documents are then passed to the linguis- tic analysis components, described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Linguistic Analysis</head><p>The linguistic analysis components process doc- uments to detect and geo-locate mobility-and industry-related entities and events.</p><p>Documents are first segmented into sentences and tokens. We use the Mate Tools suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bohnet, 2010)</ref> to part-of-speech tag words, and for de- pendency parsing of sentences. For named en- tity recognition, we utilize SProUT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Drozdzynski et al., 2004</ref>), which implements a regular expression-like formalism and gazetteers for de- tecting concepts in text. SProUT uses rule sets to deal with frequent morphologic variations and ab- breviations, e.g. "strasse" and "straße" ("street"), or "Pl." for "Platz" ("place"). We construct gazetteers for companies, cities and towns, streets, transport stops, and transit routes, from the knowl- edge resources described in Section 3.2. All gazetteers store name variants, database identifier information, as well as geo-locations.</p><p>We perform an entity linking step next to dis- ambiguate the candidate entities of a recognized concept. Since our system is based on a very extensive set of company and geo-location en- tities, entity linking is particularly challenging. For example, many public transit route names are identical across German cities (e.g. "S1" for "train line #1"), and street names are also very of- ten re-used in different cities. We implement a straight-forward, geo-location-based disambigua- tion algorithm. For ambiguous entities, such as streets, transit stops, or small villages, the algo- rithm chooses the candidate whose coordinates are contained in the geo-shape of "larger" entities co- occurring in the text. In turn, unambiguous stop or street entities can also be used to resolve "larger" ambiguous entities, e.g. transit routes, using a similar strategy. Additionally, Twitter allows users to tag locations in a message. This can either be a precise location (longitude, latitude) or a general location label (e.g., a city name with geo-shape). For tweets with a location label, we retain only candidate entities located within the user-tagged geo-shape, and then apply our disambiguation al- gorithm.</p><p>Finally, our pipeline detects events and event ar- guments by matching dependency parse trees of sentences to a set of automatically learned depen- dency patterns, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Xu et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>We define an event in the spirit of the ACE / ERE guidelines (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2015) as a n-ary relation with a set of required and op- tional arguments, which include location and time. The dependency patterns we use for event detec- tion are extracted from a manually curated set of event-specific training sentences, which were an- notated with event type, argument types, and argu- ment roles. For Twitter texts, where we typically cannot expect high-quality dependency parses, we complement our approach with a key phrase-based event detection strategy. By carefully selecting the trigger key phrase set, we can identify event types with high precision. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> summarizes the events and arguments recognized by our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Web Application</head><p>Annotated documents are persisted to a distributed Solr index 12 . The index stores basic document in- formation, such as URL, title and text, and addi- tionally information about extracted entities and events. It serves as a back-end for the visualiza- tion component of the system, which is realized as a light-weight web application. The front-end is available at http://ta.dfki.de. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref> shows the main view of the front-end. The view displays the most recent events on an in- teractive map. Each icon represents a single event. Events co-located in a particular area are clustered to avoid cluttering. The clusters split into indi- vidual event icons when zooming in on the loca- tion. The map is updated frequently to refresh the event set, giving a dynamic view of ongoing de- velopments. The user interface provides various filtering options for event types, data sources, and transport modes, as well as a company search.</p><p>Events can be selected, which opens an overlay with detailed information about the event and its source document. Details include the event type, time, and location, as well as an explanatory text snippet from the source document. The detail view also shows a set of illustrative supply chains be- tween companies that may potentially be affected by the event, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>. Since data about sup- pliers is typically non-public information, we dy- namically generate example supply chains by ran- domly selecting a pair of companies in the vicinity of the event's location, and computing a route be- tween them using Mapbox <ref type="bibr">13</ref> . Selecting a "supply chain problem" involving a particular company opens another detail view. This detail view displays information about the af- fected company, and includes infobox-style facts from background knowledge bases, but also recent events and news referencing the company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Evaluation</head><p>We conducted a preliminary evaluation of our sys- tem's event extraction performance on the dataset described in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref> shows the distri- bution of recognized events. The largest propor- tion of events is extracted from Twitter messages. Company-related events are mostly found in news articles, while mobility-related events are mainly reported in Twitter and RSS feeds. To evaluate event extraction accuracy, we man- ually judge a random sample of 150 documents (50 per source) for each event. A document is con- sidered to correctly state an event if it explicitly reports a past, current or future event. All other documents are labeled as incorrect. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> lists the precision scores per source and micro-averaged across sources for selected event types. On average, 64% of the identified events are judged to be correct. Best results are observed for RSS feeds. This is an expected result, since traffic information RSS feeds are often well struc- tured and employ very formalized wording. Some events types are more reliably observed in spe- cific sources, e.g. Strike and Layoffs in news. The overall precision on Twitter is surprisingly high, with the exception of Traffic Jam events. This can be attributed to the fact that our key phrase-based approach used the German word "Stau" ("jam"), which often appears in non-traffic contexts to de- note slow or halting progress.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented Spree, a scalable, real-time event extraction system for mobility and industry events. Our system discovers and visualizes events from heterogeneous data streams, including Twit- ter, RSS feeds and news documents, on an interac- tive map. Data streams are automatically filtered for relevant events, and geo-located using infor- mation from the extracted entities. Our system recognizes an extensive set of fine-grained entities of different types, including companies, streets, routes and transport stops, and extracts ACE/ERE- style events, together with their argument fillers, using a dependency pattern-based approach. Im- plemented in Apache Flink, it is highly scalable and allows both batch and streaming processing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: Event distribution for RSS, Twitter and News.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="5,307.56,300.75,217.70,128.99" type="bitmap" /></figure>
