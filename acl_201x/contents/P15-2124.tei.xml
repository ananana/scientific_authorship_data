				<p>The relationship between context incon-gruity and sarcasm has been studied in linguistics. We present a computational system that harnesses context incongruity as a basis for sarcasm detection. Our statistical sarcasm classifiers incorporate two kinds of incongruity features: explicit and implicit. We show the benefit of our incon-gruity features for two text forms-tweets and discussion forum posts. Our system also outperforms two past works (with F-score improvement of 10-20%). We also show how our features can capture inter-sentential incongruity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sarcasm is defined as 'a cutting, often ironic re- mark intended to express contempt or ridicule' 1 . Sarcasm detection is the task of predicting a text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The past work in sar- casm detection involves rule-based and statistical approaches using: (a) unigrams and pragmatic fea- tures (such as emoticons, etc.) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gonzalez-Ibanez et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carvalho et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barbieri et al., 2014</ref>), (b) extraction of common patterns, such as hashtag-based sentiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Maynard and Greenwood, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liebrecht et al., 2013</ref>), a positive verb being followed by a negative situation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al., 2013)</ref>, or discriminative n-grams ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tsur et al., 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Davidov et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the past work detects sarcasm with spe- cific indicators. However, we believe that it is time that sarcasm detection is based on well-studied lin- guistic theories. In this paper, we use one such lin- guistic theory: context incongruity. Although the past work exploits incongruity, it does so piece- meal; we take a more well-rounded view of in- congruity and place it center-stage for our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Source: The Free Dictionary</head><p>The features of our sarcasm detection system are based on two kinds of incongruity: 'explicit' and 'implicit'. The contribution of this paper is:</p><p>• We present a sarcasm detection system that is grounded on a linguistic theory, the theory of context incongruity in our case. Sarcasm de- tection research can push the frontiers by tak- ing help of well-studied linguistic theories.</p><p>• Our sarcasm detection system outperforms two state-of-art sarcasm detection sys- tems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Maynard and Greenwood, 2014</ref>). Our system shows an improvement for short 'tweets' as well as long 'discussion forum posts'.</p><p>• We introduce inter-sentential incongruity for sarcasm detection, that expands context of a discussion forum post by including the previ- ous post (also known as the 'elicitor' post) in the discussion thread.</p><p>Rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first discuss related work in Section 2. We introduce context incongruity in Section 3. Feature design for explicit incongruity is presented in Section 3.1, and that for implicit incongruity is in Section 3.2.</p><p>We then describe the architecture of our sarcasm detection system in Section 4 and our experimen- tal setup in Section 5. Quantitative evaluation is in Section 6. Inter-sentential sarcasm detection is in Section 7. Section 8 presents the error analysis. Section 9 concludes the paper and points to future directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Sarcasm/irony as a linguistic phenomenon has been extensively studied. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wilson (2006)</ref>, sarcasm arises from situational disparity.</p><p>The relationship between context incongruity and sarcasm processing (by humans) has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ivanko and Pexman (2003)</ref>. Several properties of sarcasm have also been investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Campbell and Katz (2012)</ref> state that sarcasm occurs along different dimensions, namely, failed expectation, pragmatic insincerity, negative tension, presence of a victim and along stylistic components such as emotion words. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Eisterhold et al. (2006)</ref> observe that sarcasm can be identified based on the state- ment preceding and following the sarcastic state- ment. This is particularly true in cases where the incongruity is not expressed within the sarcastic text itself. Computational detection of sarcasm is a rela- tively recent area of research. Initial work on sarcasm detection investigates the role of lexi- cal and pragmatic features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Tepperman et al. (2006)</ref> present sarcasm recognition in speech us- ing prosodic, spectral (average pitch, pitch slope, etc.) and contextual cues (laughter or response to questions). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carvalho et al. (2009)</ref> use sim- ple linguistic features like interjection, changed names, etc. for irony detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Davidov et al. (2010)</ref> train a sarcasm classifier with syntactic and pattern-based features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gonzalez-Ibanez et al. (2011)</ref> study the role of unigrams and emoticons in sarcasm detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liebrecht et al. (2013)</ref> use a dataset of Dutch tweets that contain sarcasm- related hashtags and implement a classifier to pre- dict sarcasm. A recent work by ?) takes the output of sarcasm detection as an input to sentiment clas- sification. They present a rule-based system that uses the pattern: if the sentiment of a tokenized hashtag does not agree with sentiment in rest of the tweet, the tweet is sarcastic, in addition to other rules.</p><p>Our approach is architecturally similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Tsur et al. (2010b)</ref> who use a semi-supervised pattern acquisition followed by classification. Our feature engineering is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ramteke et al. (2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al. (2013)</ref> state that sarcasm is a contrast between positive senti- ment word and a negative situation. They imple- ment a rule-based system that uses phrases of pos- itive verb phrases and negative situations extracted from a corpus of sarcastic tweets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ramteke et al. (2013)</ref> present a novel approach to detect thwart- ing: the phenomenon where sentiment in major portions of text is reversed by sentiment in smaller, conclusive portions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Context Incongruity</head><p>Incongruity is defined as 'the state of being not in agreement, as with principles' 1 . Context incon- gruity is a necessary condition for sarcasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Campbell and Katz, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ivanko and Pexman (2003)</ref> state that the sarcasm processing time (time taken by humans to understand sarcasm) depends on the degree of context incongruity between the state- ment and the context.</p><p>Deriving from this idea, we consider two cases of incongruity in sarcasm that are analogous to two degrees of incongruity. We call them explicit in- congruity and implicit incongruity, where im- plicit incongruity demands a higher processing time. It must be noted that our system only han- dles incongruity between the text and common world knowledge (i.e., the knowledge that 'being stranded' is an undesirable situation, and hence, 'Being stranded in traffic is the best way to start my week' is a sarcastic statement). This leaves out an example like 'Wow! You are so punctual' which may be sarcastic depending on situational context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Explicit incongruity</head><p>Explicit incongruity is overtly expressed through sentiment words of both polarities (as in the case of 'I love being ignored' where there is a positive word 'love' and a negative word 'ignored'). The converse is not true as in the case of 'The movie starts slow but the climax is great'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Implicit Incongruity</head><p>An implicit incongruity is covertly expressed through phrases of implied sentiment, as op- posed to opposing polar words.</p><p>Consider the example "I love this paper so much that I made a doggy bag out of it". There is no explicit incongruity here: the only polar word is 'love'. However, the clause 'I made a doggy bag out of it' has an implied sentiment that is incongruous with the polar word 'love'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Estimating prevalence</head><p>We conduct a na¨ıvena¨ıve, automatic evaluation on a dataset of 18,141 sarcastic tweets. As a crude estimate, we consider an explicit incongruity as presence of positive and negative words. Around 11% sarcastic tweets have at least one explicit in- congruity. We also manually evaluate 50 sarcas- tic tweets and observe that 10 have explicit incon- gruity, while others have implicit incongruity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Architecture</head><p>Our system for sarcasm detection augments the feature vector of a tweet with features based on the two types of incongruity. Specifically, we use four kinds of features: (a) Lexical, (b) Pragmatic, (c) Implicit congruity, and (d) Explicit incongruity features. Lexical features are unigrams obtained using feature selection techniques such as χ 2 Test and Categorical Proportional Difference. Prag- matic features include emoticons, laughter expres- sions, punctuation marks and capital words as given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carvalho et al. (2009)</ref>. In addition to the two, our system incorporates two kinds of in- congruity features, as discussed next. The explicit incongruity features are numeric, qualitative fea- tures, while implicit incongruity features are re- lated to implicit phrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Feature Design: Explicit Incongruity</head><p>An explicit incongruity giving rise to sarcasm bears resemblance to thwarted expectations (an- other commonly known challenge to sentiment analysis). However, a tweet that is strongly positive on the surface is more likely to be sarcastic than a tweet that seems to be negative. This is because sarcasm, by definition, tends to be caustic/hurtful. This also helps against hum- ble bragging. (as in case of the tweet 'so i have to be up at 5am to autograph 7,000 pics of myself? Sounds like just about the worst Wednesday morning I could ever imagine').</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Feature Design: Implicit Incongruity</head><p>We use phrases with implicit sentiment as the implicit incongruity features. These phrases are sentiment-bearing verb and noun phrases, the lat- ter being situations with implied sentiment (e.g. 'getting late for work'). For this, we modify the algorithm given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al. (2013)</ref> in two ways: (a) they extract only positive verbs and neg- ative noun situation phrases. We generalize it to both polarities, (b) they remove subsumed phrases (i.e. 'being ignored' subsumes 'being ignored by a friend') while we retain both phrases. The ben- efit of (a) and (b) above was experimentally vali- dated, but is not included in this paper due to lim- ited space. While they use rule-based algorithms that em- ploy these extracted phrases to detect sarcasm, we include them as implicit incongruity features, in addition to other features. It is possible that the set of extracted situation phrases may contain some phrases without implicit sentiment. We hope that the limited size of the tweet guards against such false positives being too many in number. We add phrases in the two sets as count-based implicit in- congruity features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Setup</head><p>We use three datasets to evaluate our system:</p><p>1. Tweet-A (5208 tweets, 4170 sarcastic):</p><p>We download tweets with hashtags #sar- casm and #sarcastic as sarcastic tweets and #notsarcasm and #notsarcastic as non- sarcastic, using the Twitter API (https:// dev.twitter.com/). A similar hashtag- based approach to create a sarcasm-annotated dataset was employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gonzalez-Ibanez et al. (2011)</ref>. As an additional quality check, a rough glance through the tweets is done, and the ones found to be wrong are removed. The hashtags mentioned above are removed from the text so that they act as labels but not as features. To extract the implicit incongruity features, we run the iterative algorithm described in Section 4.2, on a dataset of 4000 tweets (50% sarcastic) (also created using hashtag-based supervision). The al- gorithm results in a total of 79 verb phrases and 202 noun phrases. We train our classifiers for dif- ferent feature combinations, using LibSVM with RBF kernel (Chang and Lin, 2011), and report av- erage 5-fold cross-validation values.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the performance of our classifiers in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-score   <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al. (2013)</ref>'s two rule-based algorithms: the ordered version predicts a tweet as sarcastic if it has a positive verb phrase followed by a negative situation/noun phrase, while the unordered does so if the two are present in any order. We see that all statistical classifiers surpass the rule-based algorithms. The best F-score obtained is 0.8876 when all four kinds of features are used. This is an improvement of about 5% over the baseline, and 40% over the al- gorithm by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al. (2013)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows that even in the case of the Discussion-A dataset, our features result in an improved performance. The F-score increases from 0.568 to 0.640, an im- provement of about 8% in case of discussion fo- rum posts, when all features are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Evaluation</head><p>To confirm that we indeed do better, we com- pare our system, with their reported values. This is necessary for several reasons. For example, we reimplement their algorithm but do not have</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Approach P R F Riloff et al. (2013) (best reported)</formula><p>0.62 0.44 0.51</p><p>Maynard and Green- wood (2014) 0.46 0.38 0.41</p><p>Our system (all fea- tures) 0.77 0.51 0.61 <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Comparison of our system with two past works, for Tweet-B access to their exact extracted phrases. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows that we achieve a 10% higher F-score than the best reported F-score of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al. (2013)</ref>. This value is also 20% higher than our re-implementation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Maynard and Greenwood (2014)</ref> that uses their hashtag retokenizer and rule- based algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Incorporating inter-sentential incongruity</head><p>Our system performs worse for Discussion-A than Tweet-A/B possibly because of incongruity outside the text. Because of the thread struc- ture of discussion forums, sarcasm in a 'target post' can be identified using the post preceding it (called 'elicitor post'), similar to human con- versation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Eisterhold et al., 2006</ref>). For example, 'Wow, you are smart!' may or may not be sarcas- tic. If a sarcasm classifier incorporates informa- tion from the elicitor post 'I could not finish my as- signment', a correct prediction is possible. Hence, we now explore how our incongruity-based fea- tures can help to capture 'inter-sentential incon- gruity'. We compute the five explicit incongruity features for a concatenated version of target post and elicitor post (elicitor posts are available for IAC corpus, the source of Discussion-A). The pre- cision rises to 0.705 but the recall falls to 0.274. A possible reason is that only 15% posts have elicitor posts, making the inter-sentential features sparse. That notwithstanding, our observation shows that using the inter-sentential context is an in- teresting direction for sarcasm detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Error Analysis</head><p>Some common errors made by our system are:</p><p>1. Subjective polarity: The tweet 'Yay for 3 hour Chem labs' is tagged by the author as sarcastic, which may not be common percep- tion.</p><p>2. No incongruity within text: As stated in Section 2, our system does not detect sar- casm where incongruity is expressed outside the text. About 10% misclassified examples that we analyzed, contained such an incon- gruity. 3. Incongruity due to numbers: Our system could not detect incongruity arising due to numbers as in 'Going in to work for 2 hours was totally worth the 35 minute drive.'. 4. Dataset granularity: Some discussion forum posts are marked as sarcastic, but contain non-sarcastic portions, lead- ing to irrelevant features. For example, 'How special, now all you have to do is prove that a glob of cells has rights. I happen to believe that a person's life and the right to life begins at conception'. 5. Politeness: In some cases, implicit incon- gruity was less evident because of politeness, as in, 'Post all your inside jokes on facebook, I really want to hear about them'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</head><p>Our paper uses the linguistic relationship between context incongruity and sarcasm as a basis for sar- casm detection. Our sarcasm classifier uses four kinds of features: lexical, pragmatic, explicit in- congruity, and implicit incongruity features. We evaluate our system on two text forms: tweets and discussion forum posts. We observe an improve- ment of 40% over a reported rule-based algo- rithm, and 5% over the statistical classifier base- line that uses unigrams, in case of tweets. The cor- responding improvement in case of discussion fo- rum posts is 8%. Our system also outperforms two past works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Riloff et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Maynard and Greenwood, 2014</ref>) with 10-20% improvement in F-score. Finally, to improve the performance for discussion forum posts, we introduce a novel ap- proach to use elicitor posts for sarcasm detection.</p><p>We observe an improvement of 21.6% in preci- sion, when our incongruity features are used to capture inter-sentential incongruity.</p><p>Our error analysis points to potential future work such as: (a) role of numbers for sarcasm, and (b) situations with subjective sentiment. We are currently exploring a more robust incorporation of inter-sentential incongruity for sarcasm detection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Consider this example: 'I love the color. The features are interesting. But a bad battery life ruins it'. The positive expectation in the first two sentences is thwarted by the last sentence. A similar incongruity is observed in the sarcastic 'My tooth hurts! Yay!'. The nega- tive word 'hurts' is incongruous with the positive 'Yay!'. Hence, our explicit incongruity features are a relevant subset of features from a past sys- tem to detect thwarting by Ramteke et al. (2013). These features are: • Number of sentiment incongruities: The number of times a positive word is followed by a negative word, and vice versa • Largest positive/negative subsequence: The length of the longest series of contiguous pos- itive/negative words • Number of positive and negative words • Lexical Polarity: The polarity based purely on the basis of lexical features, as determined by Lingpipe SA system (Alias-i, 2008). Note that the 'native polarity' need not be correct.</figDesc></figure>
