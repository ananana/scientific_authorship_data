				<p>In this work we explore some challenges related to analysing one form of the Ara-bic language called Arabizi. Arabizi, a portmanteau of Araby-Englizi, meaning Arabic-English, is a digital trend in texting Non-Standard Arabic using Latin script. Arabizi users express their natural dialectal Arabic in text without following a unified orthography. We address the challenge of identifying Arabizi from multilingual data in Twitter, a preliminary step for analysing sentiment from Arabizi data. We annotated a corpus of Twitter data streamed across two Arab countries, extracted linguistic features and trained a classifier achieving an average Arabizi identification accuracy of 94.5%. We also present the percentage of Arabizi usage on Twitter across both countries providing important insights for researchers in NLP and sociolinguistics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Arabizi comprises a portion of the Arabic social media, thus any large dataset crawled from an Ara- bic public source may contain Modern-Standard Arabic (MSA), Non-Standard Arabic (NSA), Ara- bizi and other languages such as English and French. MSA is the formal Arabic that is mostly used in news broadcasting channels and maga- zines to address the entire Arab region. NSA is informal, dialectal and esoteric to each region. It varies among North Africa, Egypt, Levant, and the Arabian Gulf. Arabizi is a descendant of NSA, where dialectal words are expressed in Latin script such as which means darling written as 7abibi. Apart from being dialectal, people express their natural voice in text without following a uni- fied orthographical and grammatical regulations.</p><p>A. Bies et al. mention that the use of Arabizi is prevalent enough to pose a challenge for Ara- bic NLP research <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref>. Basis Technology, a company that specializes in computational linguis- tics for digital forensics stated that Arabizi poses a problem for government analytics since it has no structure <ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref>. The way Arabs use Arabizi is a significant challenge for data scientists for the following reasons: it is written in Latin script, it varies among regions, it is not written in a unified orthographical, syntactical or grammatical struc- ture, it could be mixed with other languages in a single sentence, and it often exist within multi- lingual datasets.</p><p>Identification of Arabizi advances the Arabic NLP, specifically in sentiment analysis for Arabic. Being able to identify and analyse Arabizi will fill an important gap in processing Arabic from social media data. Several researchers working on sen- timent analysis for Arabic filter out Arabizi from their datasets, mainly due to the non-availablitiy of public resources such as word lexicons, stemmers, and POS taggers to process this type of text. In a recent survey about sentiment analysis for Ara- bic, S. Ahmed et al. mention that the use of di- alect and Arabizi have not been addressed yet in existing literature <ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref>. In this paper we ad- dress the following questions: How frequent is the usage of Arabizi in Egypt and Lebanon on Twit- ter, and which methods could be used to automati- cally identify Arabizi within multi-lingual Twitter streams.</p><p>Public social media data, particularly Twitter, is important for sentiment analysis as it contains and reflects the public's opinion. The type of data in Twitter is large-scale and diverse, not biased to certain groups of people or topics. We col- lect Twitter data from Egypt and Lebanon, pre-process it, and annotate sample datasets. First, we present the amount of Arabizi usage in each of Egypt and Lebanon by reporting the percentage of Arabic, English, and Arabizi tweets. Second, we extract some linguistic features using Langde- tect 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nakatani, 2010)</ref>, a language detection li- brary ported from Google's language-detection, and train an SVM classifier to identify Arabizi from multi-lingual Twitter data. We believe that being able to identify Arabizi from multi-lingual data on social media brings us closer to addressing sentiment analysis for Arabic, inclusive of NSA and Arabizi.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we investigate what other researchers have done for analysing Arabizi. In Section III, we collect, pre-process and annotate Twitter data and present our approach of extracting linguistic features and training the classifier. In Section IV, we present the results and a discussion. In Section V, we conclude and add a future work plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In this section we survey papers and present the efforts of other researchers on the percentage of Arabizi usage, the motive for analysing sentiment from Arabizi data, and related work in Arabic di- alect and Arabizi detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Percentage of Arabizi Usage</head><p>Several sociolinguistic studies focus on the Ara- bizi phenomena, where the researchers tend to ex- plore how this texting style developed and became a trend in the Arab region. S. Jaran and F. Al-Haq (Jaran and Al-Haq, 2015) presented how natives coin and trend Arabizi words by adopting an En- glish word and conjugating it in their NSA such as: I miss you → missak, ak is a suffix added when referring to the pronoun you in the mascu- line form in several NSA dialects. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Muhammed et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yaghan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aboelezz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alabdulqader et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gibson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jaran and Al-Haq, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Keong et al., 2015</ref>) the authors collected information about people who use Ara- bizi such as age, gender, and level of education and reported the frequency and context of Ara- bizi usage within certain groups of people. In Ta- ble 1 we present these studies that were conducted by monitoring mobile messaging, distributing sur- veys among university students, or analysing on-line forum comments. The percentage of Arabizi usage varies in each of these studies depending on the year the study was conducted, the region, the medium, and the users. However, most of these studies are based on private mobile messages, we on the other hand report the percentage of Arabizi usage on a public social medium. We investigated Arabizi from Twitter data across 2 Arab countries, Egypt and Lebanon; our method can be applied to any other Arab country.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Arabizi in Sentiment Analysis</head><p>We point to few studies where researchers col- lected Arabic data for sentiment analysis but fil- tered out Arabizi, saying that their tools are in- capable of handling Arabizi. M. Al-Kabi et al. carried out a research in sentiment analysis on a dataset of 1,080 NSA reviews collected from social and news websites filtering out <ref type="bibr">Arabizi (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">2014)</ref>. R. Duwairi and I. Qarqaz collected 500 Facebook comments in Arabic for sentiment analysis filtering out Arabizi as well (2014). R. Duwairi et al. also mention that Arabizi is com- mon in Arab blogs, highlighting the fact that there are no Arabizi benchmark datasets nor sentiment lexicons available (2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Arabic Dialect Detection</head><p>Recent studies are focused on detecting dialectal Arabic from a given text. Most of these stud- ies rely on annotated dialectal Arabic corpora and training a classifier with character and word n- gram features. O. Zaidan and C. Callison-Burch annotated over 100,000 sentences and trained an n-gram probabilistic classifier that detects the di- alect of input sentences (2014). S. Malmasi et al. used 2 classifiers to predict whether a given sen- tence is dialectal or MSA (2015). First, a Condi- tional Random Field (CRF) classifier trained with word-level features using MADAMIRA (2014) and other tools. Second, a trained sentence level classifier covering dialectal statistics, writing style, and word relatedness features. Other recent efforts on dialect detection <ref type="bibr">(Cotterell and CallisonBurch, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Elfardy and Diab, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sadat et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Al-Badrashiny et al., 2015</ref>) include creating dialectal corpora.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, K. Darwish pre- sented the only work on Arabizi detection in the literature <ref type="bibr">(2014</ref> 3 The Approach</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection and Annotation</head><p>We use geographic information 2 to stream tweets coming from within Lebanon and Egypt, where we specified the coordinates of each region sep- arately. We collect two datasets, one from each country, and split each into Arabic and Non- Arabic, shown in  Twitter data contains a lot of noisy tweets such as tweets that contain only URLs, hashtags, user mentions, laughter, and spam. We pre-process the data to maximize the number of textual tweets in each of the Non-Arabic dataset. We filter out URLs, hashtags, user mentions, laughter, exagger- ation, and emojis from tweets. Though some of these features can be used in an extended work for sentiment analysis, for this task we only aim for language identification. We filter out hashtags be- cause most of them are in English. We filter out laughter expressions and exaggerated words be- cause Langdetect misdetects sentences containing words with repetitive letters. From the resulting data, we deleted tweets that contain no text and 2 https://goo.gl/PFJj3H duplicated tweets. We observed from our datasets that many tweets aim to gather followers with ex- pressions such as: follow me, follow insta, and fol- low plz. We consider such tweets as spam and fil- ter out any tweet containing the word follow. Our pre-processed Non-Arabic datasets lessened from 32,024 to 21,878 for Lebanon and from 74,328 to 36,970 for Egypt.</p><p>We extracted and annotated 5,000 tweets which was done manually by one Arab native. Since Arabizi users might switch between Arabizi and English within a single sentence, we tag Arabizi tweets if the number of Arabizi words are sufficient to imply that the dominant language used is Arabizi. To tag an Arabizi tweet it should have more Arabizi words than English words and the Arabizi words should consist of nouns and verbs not just connectors and stop words. For example:</p><p>Tweet: honestly allah y3afeke (recovery wish) that you still cant get over a story thats a year not my fault ur ex boyfriend was a *** sara7a (honestly) Arabizi Words &lt; English Words Tag: Not Arabizi Tweet: kel marra b2oul monday bade ballesh diet bas emta ha yeje hayda lnhar/Everytime I plan to start a diet on monday but when will this day come Arabizi Words &gt; English Words Tag: Arabizi Tweet: eh (yes) God bless your mom w (and) your family Tag: Not Arabizi Out of each sample dataset, we tagged 465 Arabzi tweets from Lebanon and 955 Arabizi tweets from Egypt. However, each sample dataset is multi-lingual containing tweets in languages other than English and Arabizi. The annotated datasets can be found on project-rbz.com <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Arabizi Identification</head><p>We utilize Langdetect, a language detection library that detects one or more languages for each input sentence, and returns the language with the highest confidence score. Though it does not detect Arabizi sentences, it detects irrelevant languages when tested against Arabizi. It may detect 3 or more languages, or one irrelevant language with high confidence. We use those detections as input features to train a classifier to identify Arabizi from Twitter data. For example:</p><p>Tweet: never been so scared for an exam Languages Detected: {en:0.99} Tweet: kan yom eswed yom ma 3reftk /It was a bad day I didn't recognize you Languages Detected: {so: 0.42, cy: 0.42, sv: 0.14}</p><p>We use the irrelevant languages detected, the number of irrelevant languages, and their con- fidence scores as input features for the Arabizi identification classifier. We tested all the features on several classi- fiers and found that the best results are obtained from an SVM classifier using (languages detected by Langdetect, the language detected by Twit- ter API, and the count of word occurrences per tweet). The languages detected by Langdetect in- clude: languages predicted, number of predicted languages, and the confidence score of each. Al- though, Langdetect is more accurate than Twit- ter API when tested against our data, adding the language detected by Twitter API to the set of features improved the overall accuracy of Arabizi identification. The count of word occurrences per tweet helps the classifier identify words that are frequently used in Arabizi. We disregarded the other features (location of the tweet, country and language of the user, and the number of words per tweet) because they did not have any effect on the classification results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Classification</head><p>We run Langdetect against our annotated sam- ple datasets; in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> we present the distribu- tion of languages detected with high confidence scores apart from the manual Arabizi annota- tion. We note that the other languages detected  We carry out two experiments, one with our an- notated datasets that are filtered from other lan- guages and another with balanced datasets. Since the ratio of English to Arabizi tweets is very high, we under-sample the annotated-filtered datasets to have an almost equal number of English to Ara- bizi tweets. We applied a 10-fold cross validation technique in which we split the data into 80% and 20% for training and testing respectively, and av- erage the validation results for all folds.</p></div>

In Lebanon, Arabic and Non-Arabic tweets are almost equal, however English is dominant in Non-Arabic tweets. On the other hand, Arabic is dominant in tweets from Egypt. The total Arabizi usage is 4.9% for Lebanon and 5.7% for Egypt. We also observed that not only do the percentage of Arabizi usage differs between countries but also they way it is used in text. In Egypt, most of the Non-English tweets are written either in English or in Arabizi rather than mixing both in single tweets as compared to Lebanon. Also, in Egypt people tend to abbreviate Arabizi words in many cases by avoiding to write the vowels. For example:</p><p>Tweet from Egypt: na w nta hn3ml duet m3 b3d /me and you will perform a duet together Abbreviations: ana → na, enta → nta, hane3mal → hn3ml, ma3 → m3, ba3d → b3d</p><p>Tweet from Lebanon: bonsoir 7ewalit a3melik add 3ala fb bass i didnt find you can you give me your account /Morning I tried adding you on fb but... Languages: English, French, and Arabizi.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Arabizi Identification</head><p>We filtered our sample datasets from languages other than English and Arabizi that were detected by Langdetect with high confidence scores. We selected an SVM classifier with the following fea- tures: Languages detected by Langdetect, the lan- guage detected by Twitter API, and the count of word occurrences per tweet. We present the aver- aged 10-fold cross validation results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Discussion</head><p>Our results show that the percentage of Arabizi us- age in Twitter data across both Lebanon and Egypt is lower than the findings by other researchers in mobile messaging, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We hypothesize that people prefer to text in Arabizi on private mediums since Arabizi is generally perceived as an informal way of communication. However, 4.9% or 5.7% of a country's Twitter data is Arabizi, which is a large amount of data that might contain valuable information. Therefore it is important to generate NLP resources to identify, analyse, and process Arabizi data. We found that most of the unidentified Ara- bizi tweets are tweets from Lebanon written in both English and Arabizi. Langdetect identifies most of such mixed tweets as English. As for the false identification, it was due to misidenti-fication of Far-Eastern tweets. Neither Langde- tect nor Twitter API was able to correctly iden- tify all Far-Eastern tweets. The classifier could be enhanced to overcome those errors by extracting word-level features from tweets, such as TF-IDF, n-grams, word lengths, and vowel-consonant ra- tio, and by training it to classify mixed and Far- Eastern tweets.</p><p>The analysis of Arabizi usage on Twitter for dif- ferent Arab countries provides an insight for re- searchers who tempt to analyse sentiment from Arabic data and for sociolinguistic researchers who study a language in relation to social fac- tors such as region and dialect. We believe that creating tools to automatically identify Arabizi is a necessary step towards sentiment analysis over this type of text. Arabizi identification could be applied in automatic creation of an Arabizi corpus that could be used for classification tasks and in automatic language detection for machine transla- tion tools.</p><p>Another aspect of research in Arabizi includes transliteration to Arabic. There are some tools available such as Yamli 4 , Microsoft Maren 5 , and Google Input Tools 6 , however those tools are de- signed to help Arab speakers get MSA text by typ- ing Arabizi. Using transliterators to convert the natural Arabizi text, such as tweets, may result in broken Arabic words. Some researchers are work- ing on Arabizi transliteration as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bies et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">May et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chalabi and Gerges, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Darwish, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this work we have studied the usage of Ara- bizi on Twitter and the creation of tools to au- tomatically identify Arabizi from multi-lingual streams of data. We collected Twitter data from Lebanon and Egypt and presented the percent- age of each language, particularly Arabizi, pro- viding an important insight for researchers work- ing on the analysis of natural text for the Arab re- gion. We trained an Arabizi identification classi- fier by annotating sample datasets and extracting features using Langdetect, an existing language detection library. We achieved an average classifi- cation accuracy of 93% and 96% for Lebanon and Egypt datasets respectively. Our Arabizi identifi-cation classifier relies on sentence-level features; it could be improved by extracting word-level fea- tures from text. Our aim is to advance the Arabic NLP research by facilitating analysis on social me- dia data without the need to filter out complex or minority languages.</p><p>Several researchers have contributed to the anal- ysis of MSA in the literature, which is useful for analysing formal blogs and news pages. However analysing the public's sentiment requires effort for NSA and Arabizi as most people from the Arab region express their opinion on social media us- ing their mother tongue in text. Though NSA and Arabizi are written in different scripts, they can be addressed simultaneously since both share similar challenges. We plan to extend this work by ex- ploring the usage of NSA and Arabizi across sev- eral regions, and by identifying dialect on social media. We follow by trying to extract sentiment from NSA and Arabizi which might require the creation of dialect sentiment lexicons and parsers to process the heterogeneous Arabic social data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>).
