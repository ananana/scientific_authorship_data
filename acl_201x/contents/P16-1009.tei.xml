<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has obtained state-of-the art performance for several language pairs, while only using parallel data for training. Target-side monolingual data plays an important role in boosting fluency for phrase-based statisti- cal machine translation, and we investigate the use of monolingual data for NMT.</p><p>Language models trained on monolingual data have played a central role in statistical machine translation since the first IBM models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al., 1990</ref>). There are two major reasons for their importance. Firstly, word-based and phrase-based translation models make strong independence as- sumptions, with the probability of translation units estimated independently from context, and lan- guage models, by making different independence assumptions, can model how well these translation units fit together. Secondly, the amount of avail- able monolingual data in the target language typi- cally far exceeds the amount of parallel data, and models typically improve when trained on more data, or data more similar to the translation task.</p><p>In (attentional) encoder-decoder architectures for neural machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>, the decoder is es- sentially an RNN language model that is also con- ditioned on source context, so the first rationale, adding a language model to compensate for the in- dependence assumptions of the translation model, does not apply. However, the data argument is still valid in NMT, and we expect monolingual data to be especially helpful if parallel data is sparse, or a poor fit for the translation task, for instance be- cause of a domain mismatch.</p><p>In contrast to previous work, which integrates a separately trained RNN language model into the NMT model ( <ref type="bibr">Gülçehre et al., 2015)</ref>, we explore strategies to include monolingual training data in the training process without changing the neural network architecture. This makes our approach applicable to different NMT architectures.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as fol- lows:</p><p>• we show that we can improve the machine translation quality of NMT systems by mix- ing monolingual target sentences into the training set.</p><p>• we investigate two different methods to fill the source side of monolingual training in- stances: using a dummy source sentence, and using a source sentence obtained via back- translation, which we call synthetic. We find that the latter is more effective.</p><p>• we successfully adapt NMT models to a new domain by fine-tuning with either monolin- gual or parallel in-domain data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Neural Machine Translation</head><p>We follow the neural machine translation archi- tecture by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref>, which we will briefly summarize here. However, we note that our approach is not specific to this architecture. The neural machine translation system is imple- mented as an encoder-decoder network with recur- rent neural networks.</p><p>The encoder is a bidirectional neural network with gated recurrent units ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cho et al., 2014</ref>) that reads an input sequence x = (x 1 , ..., x m ) and calculates a forward sequence of hidden states (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">− → h 1 , ..., − → h m )</formula><p>, and a backward sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ← − h 1 , ..., ← − h m ).</formula><p>The hidden states − → h j and ← − h j are concatenated to obtain the annotation vector h j .</p><p>The decoder is a recurrent neural network that predicts a target sequence y = (y 1 , ..., y n ). Each word y i is predicted based on a recurrent hidden state s i , the previously predicted word y i−1 , and a context vector c i . c i is computed as a weighted sum of the annotations h j . The weight of each annotation h j is computed through an alignment model α ij , which models the probability that y i is aligned to x j . The alignment model is a single- layer feedforward neural network that is learned jointly with the rest of the network through back- propagation.</p><p>A detailed description can be found in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>. Training is performed on a parallel corpus with stochastic gradient descent. For translation, a beam search with small beam size is employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NMT Training with Monolingual Training Data</head><p>In machine translation, more monolingual data (or monolingual data more similar to the test set) serves to improve the estimate of the prior prob- ability p(T ) of the target sentence T , before tak- ing the source sentence S into account. In con- trast to ( <ref type="bibr">Gülçehre et al., 2015)</ref>, who train separate language models on monolingual training data and incorporate them into the neural network through shallow or deep fusion, we propose techniques to train the main NMT model with monolingual data, exploiting the fact that encoder-decoder neu- ral networks already condition the probability dis- tribution of the next target word on the previous target words. We describe two strategies to do this: providing monolingual training examples with an empty (or dummy) source sentence, or providing monolingual training data with a synthetic source sentence that is obtained from automatically trans- lating the target sentence into the source language, which we will refer to as back-translation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dummy Source Sentences</head><p>The first technique we employ is to treat monolin- gual training examples as parallel examples with empty source side, essentially adding training ex- amples whose context vector c i is uninformative, and for which the network has to fully rely on the previous target words for its prediction. This could be conceived as a form of dropout ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hinton et al., 2012</ref>), with the difference that the train- ing instances that have the context vector dropped out constitute novel training data. We can also conceive of this setup as multi-task learning, with the two tasks being translation when the source is known, and language modelling when it is un- known. During training, we use both parallel and mono- lingual training examples in the ratio 1-to-1, and randomly shuffle them. We define an epoch as one iteration through the parallel data set, and resam- ple from the monolingual data set for every epoch. We pair monolingual sentences with a single-word dummy source side &lt;null&gt; to allow processing of both parallel and monolingual training examples with the same network graph. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For monolingual minibatches 2 , we freeze the network parameters of the encoder and the attention model.</p><p>One problem with this integration of monolin-gual data is that we cannot arbitrarily increase the ratio of monolingual training instances, or fine- tune a model with only monolingual training data, because different output layer parameters are opti- mal for the two tasks, and the network 'unlearns' its conditioning on the source context if the ratio of monolingual training instances is too high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Synthetic Source Sentences</head><p>To ensure that the output layer remains sensitive to the source context, and that good parameters are not unlearned from monolingual data, we propose to pair monolingual training instances with a syn- thetic source sentence from which a context vec- tor can be approximated. We obtain these through back-translation, i.e. an automatic translation of the monolingual target text into the source lan- guage. During training, we mix synthetic parallel text into the original (human-translated) parallel text and do not distinguish between the two: no net- work parameters are frozen. Importantly, only the source side of these additional training examples is synthetic, and the target side comes from the monolingual corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate NMT training on parallel text, and with additional monolingual data, on English↔German and Turkish→English, using training and test data from WMT 15 for English↔German, IWSLT 15 for English→German, and IWSLT 14 for Turkish→English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data and Methods</head><p>We use Groundhog 3 as the implementation of the NMT system for all experiments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jean et al., 2015a</ref>). We generally follow the settings and training procedure described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sennrich et al.

In all experiments, the network vo- cabulary remains fixed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">English↔German</head><p>We use all parallel training data provided by WMT 2015 (Bojar et al., 2015) 4 . We use the News Crawl corpora as additional training data for the exper- iments with monolingual data. The amount of training data is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Baseline models are trained for a week. Ensem- bles are sampled from the last 4 saved models of training (saved at 12h-intervals). Each model is fine-tuned with fixed embeddings for 12 hours.</p><p>For the experiments with synthetic parallel data, we back-translate a random sample of 3 600 000 sentences from the German monolin- gual data set into English. The German→English system used for this is the baseline system (parallel). Translation took about a week on an NVIDIA Titan Black GPU. For experiments in German→English, we back-translate 4 200 000 monolingual English sentences into German, us- ing the English→German system +synthetic. Note that we always use single models for back- translation, not ensembles. We leave it to fu- ture work to explore how sensitive NMT training with synthetic data is to the quality of the back- translation.</p><p>We tokenize and truecase the training data, and represent rare words via BPE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sennrich et al., 2016)</ref>. Specifically, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sennrich et al. (2016)</ref> in performing BPE on the joint vocabulary with 89 500 merge operations.

We also perform experiments on the IWSLT 15 test sets to investigate a cross-domain setting. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The test sets consist of TED talk transcripts. As in- domain training data, IWSLT provides the WIT 3 parallel corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cettolo et al., 2012)</ref>, which also consists of TED talks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Turkish→English</head><p>We use data provided for the IWSLT 14 machine translation track ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cettolo et al., 2014</ref>), namely the WIT 3 parallel corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cettolo et al., 2012)</ref>, which consists of TED talks, and the SETimes corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Tyers and Alperen, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> After removal of sentence pairs which contain empty lines or lines with a length ratio above 9, we retain 320 000 sen- tence pairs of training data. For the experiments with monolingual training data, we use the En- glish LDC Gigaword corpus (Fifth Edition). The amount of training data is shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. With only 320 000 sentences of parallel data available for training, this is a much lower-resourced trans- lation setting than English↔German. <ref type="bibr">Gülçehre et al. (2015)</ref> segment the Turkish text with the morphology tool Zemberek, followed by a disambiguation of the morphological analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sak et al., 2007)</ref>, and removal of non-surface to- kens produced by the analysis. We use the same preprocessing <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . For both Turkish and English, we represent rare words (or morphemes in the case of Turkish) as character bigram sequences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sennrich et al., 2016</ref>). The 20 000 most frequent words (morphemes) are left unsegmented. The networks have a vocabulary size of 23 000 symbols.</p><p>To obtain a synthetic parallel training set, we back-translate a random sample of 3 200 000 sentences from Gigaword. We use an English→Turkish NMT system trained with the same settings as the Turkish→English baseline system.</p><p>We found overfitting to be a bigger problem than with the larger English↔German data set, and follow <ref type="bibr">Gülçehre et al. (2015)</ref> in using Gaus- sian noise (stddev 0.01) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Graves, 2011)</ref>, and dropout on the output layer (p=0.5) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hinton et al., 2012</ref>). We also use early stopping, based on BLEU measured every three hours on tst2010, which we treat as development set. For Turkish→English, we use gradient clipping with threshold 5, follow- ing <ref type="bibr">Gülçehre et al. (2015)</ref>, in contrast to the thresh- old 1 that we use for English↔German, following Jean et al. (2015a). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> shows English→German results with WMT training and test data. We find that mixing parallel training data with monolingual data with a dummy source side in a ratio of 1-1 improves qual- ity by 0.4-0.5 BLEU for the single system, 1 BLEU for the ensemble. We train the system for twice as long as the baseline to provide the training al- gorithm with a similar amount of parallel training instances. To ensure that the quality improvement is due to the monolingual training instances, and not just increased training time, we also continued training our baseline system for another week, but saw no improvements in BLEU.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">English→German WMT 15</head><p>Including synthetic data during training is very effective, and yields an improvement over our baseline by 2.8-3.4 BLEU. Our best ensemble system also outperforms a syntax-based baseline (Sennrich and Haddow, 2015) by 1.2-2.1 BLEU. We also substantially outperform NMT results re- ported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jean et al.

System 2, trained on parallel and synthetic WMT data, obtains a BLEU score of 25.5 on tst2015. We observe that even a small amount of fine-tuning 9 , i.e. continued train- ing of an existing model, on WIT data can adapt a system trained on WMT data to the TED do- main. By back-translating the monolingual WIT corpus (using a German→English system trained on WMT data, i.e. without in-domain knowledge), we obtain the synthetic data set WIT synth . A sin- gle epoch of fine-tuning on WIT synth (system 4) re- sults in a BLEU score of 26.7 on tst2015, or an im- provement of 1.2 BLEU. We observed no improve- ment from fine-tuning on WIT mono , the monolin- gual TED corpus with dummy input (system 3).</p></div>

Like for the re- verse translation direction, we see substantial im- provements (3.6-3.7 BLEU) from adding mono- lingual training data with synthetic source sen- tences, which is substantially bigger than the im- provement observed with deep fusion ( <ref type="bibr">Gülçehre et al., 2015)</ref>; our ensemble outperforms the previous state of the art on newstest2015 by 2.3 BLEU. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> shows results for Turkish→English. On average, we see an improvement of 0.6 BLEU on the test sets from adding monolingual data with a dummy source side in a 1-1 ratio <ref type="bibr">10</ref> , although we note a high variance between different test sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Turkish→English IWSLT 14</head><p>With synthetic training data (Gigaword synth ), we outperform the baseline by 2.7 BLEU on average, and also outperform results obtained via shallow or deep fusion by <ref type="bibr">Gülçehre et al. (2015)</ref> by 0.5 BLEU on average. To compare to what extent syn- thetic data has a regularization effect, even without novel training data, we also back-translate the tar- get side of the parallel training text to obtain the training corpus parallel synth . Mixing the original parallel corpus with parallel synth (ratio 1-1) gives some improvement over the baseline (1.7 BLEU on average), but the novel monolingual training data (Gigaword mono ) gives higher improvements, despite being out-of-domain in relation to the test sets. We speculate that novel in-domain monolin- gual data would lead to even higher improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">Back-translation Quality for Synthetic Data</head><p>One question that our previous experiments leave open is how the quality of the automatic back- translation affects training with synthetic data. To investigate this question, we back-translate the same German monolingual corpus with three dif- ferent German→English systems:</p><p>• with our baseline system and greedy decod- ing</p><p>• with our baseline system and beam search (beam size 12). This is the same system used for the experiments in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3. BLEU  DE→EN  EN→DE  back-translation  2015  2014 2015  none  - 20.4</ref>   • with the German→English system that was itself trained with synthetic data (beam size 12).</p><p>BLEU scores of the German→English sys- tems, and of the resulting English→German sys- tems that are trained on the different back- translations, are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 7</ref>. The quality of the German→English back-translation differs substantially, with a difference of 6 BLEU on new- stest2015. Regarding the English→German sys- tems trained on the different synthetic corpora, we find that the 6 BLEU difference in back-translation quality leads to a 0.6-0.7 BLEU difference in translation quality. This is balanced by the fact that we can increase the speed of back-translation by trading off some quality, for instance by reduc- ing beam size, and we leave it to future research to explore how much the amount of synthetic data affects translation quality.</p><p>We also show results for an ensemble of 3 mod- els (the best single model of each training run), and 12 models (all 4 models of each training run). Thanks to the increased diversity of the ensemble components, these ensembles outperform the en- sembles of 4 models that were all sampled from the same training run, and we obtain another im- provement of 0.8-1.0 BLEU.</p></div>

Both the WMT test sets and the News Crawl corpora which we used as monolin- gual data come from the same source, a web crawl of newspaper articles. 11 In contrast, News Crawl is out-of-domain for the IWSLT test sets.</p><p>In contrast to phrase-based SMT, which can <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The WMT test sets are held-out from News Crawl. make use of monolingual data via the language model, NMT has so far not been able to use mono- lingual data to great effect, and without requir- ing architectural changes. We find that the effect of synthetic parallel data is not limited to domain adaptation, and that even out-of-domain synthetic data improves NMT quality, as in our evaluation on IWSLT. The fact that the synthetic data is more effective on the WMT test sets (+2.9 BLEU) than on the IWSLT test sets (+1.2 BLEU) supports the hypothesis that domain adaptation contributes to the effectiveness of adding synthetic data to NMT training.</p><p>It is an important finding that back-translated data, which is mainly effective for domain adapta- tion in phrase-based SMT, is more generally use- ful in NMT, and has positive effects that go beyond domain adaptation. In the next section, we will in- vestigate further reasons for its effectiveness. cross-entropy WMTparallel (dev) WMTparallel (train) WMTsynth (dev) WMTsynth (train) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: English→German training and develop- ment set (newstest2013) cross-entropy as a func- tion of training time (number of training instances) for different systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Analysis</head><p>We previously indicated that overfitting is a con- cern with our baseline system, especially on small data sets of several hundred thousand training sentences, despite the regularization employed. This overfitting is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, which plots training and development set cross-entropy by training time for Turkish→English models. For comparability, we measure training set cross- entropy for all models on the same random sam- ple of the parallel training set. We can see that the model trained on only parallel train- ing data quickly overfits, while all three mono- lingual data sets (parallel synth , Gigaword mono , or Gigaword synth ) delay overfitting, and give bet- ter perplexity on the development set. The best development set cross-entropy is reached by Gigaword synth . <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref> shows cross-entropy for English→German, comparing the system trained on only parallel data and the system that includes synthetic training data. Since more training data is available for English→German, there is no indi- cation that overfitting happens during the first 40 million training instances (or 7 days of training); while both systems obtain comparable training set cross-entropies, the system with synthetic data reaches a lower cross-entropy on the development set. One explanation for this is the domain effect discussed in the previous section.</p><p>A central theoretical expectation is that mono- lingual target-side data improves the model's flu- system produced attested natural parallel 1078 53.4% 74.9% +mono 994 61.6% 84.6% +synthetic 1217 56.4% 82.5% <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>: Number of words in system out- put that do not occur in parallel training data (count ref = 1168), and proportion that is attested in data, or natural according to native speaker.

As a proxy to sentence-level flu- ency, we investigate word-level fluency, specif- ically words produced as sequences of subword units, and whether NMT systems trained with ad- ditional monolingual data produce more natural words. For instance, the English→German sys- tems translate the English phrase civil rights pro- tections as a single compound, composed of three subword units: Bürger|rechts|schutzes 12 , and we analyze how many of these multi-unit words that the translation systems produce are well-formed German words.</p><p>We compare the number of words in the system output for the newstest2015 test set which are pro- duced via subword units, and that do not occur in the parallel training corpus. We also count how many of them are attested in the full monolingual corpus or the reference translation, which we all consider 'natural'. Additionally, the main authors, a native speaker of German, annotated a random subset (n = 100) of unattested words of each sys- tem according to their naturalness 13 , distinguish- ing between natural German words (or names) such as Literatur|klassen 'literature classes', and nonsensical ones such as *As|best|atten (a miss- spelling of Astbestmatten 'asbestos mats').</p><p>In the results <ref type="table">(Table 9)</ref>, we see that the sys- tems trained with additional monolingual or syn- thetic data have a higher proportion of novel words attested in the non-parallel data, and a higher proportion that is deemed natural by our annota- tor. This supports our expectation that additional monolingual data improves the (word-level) flu- ency of the NMT system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>To our knowledge, the integration of monolingual data for pure neural machine translation architec- tures was first investigated by <ref type="bibr">(Gülçehre et al., 2015)</ref>, who train monolingual language models in- dependently, and then integrate them during de- coding through rescoring of the beam (shallow fu- sion), or by adding the recurrent hidden state of the language model to the decoder state of the encoder-decoder network, with an additional con- troller mechanism that controls the magnitude of the LM signal (deep fusion). In deep fusion, the controller parameters and output parameters are tuned on further parallel training data, but the lan- guage model parameters are fixed during the fine- tuning stage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jean et al. (2015b)</ref> also report on experiments with reranking of NMT output with a 5-gram language model, but improvements are small (between 0.1-0.5 BLEU).</p><p>The production of synthetic parallel texts bears resemblance to data augmentation techniques used in computer vision, where datasets are often aug- mented with rotated, scaled, or otherwise distorted variants of the (limited) training set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rowley et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Another similar avenue of research is self- training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">McClosky et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Schwenk, 2008)</ref>. The main difference is that self-training typically refers to scenario where the training set is en- hanced with training instances with artificially produced output labels, whereas we start with human-produced output (i.e. the translation), and artificially produce an input. We expect that this is more robust towards noise in the automatic translation. Improving NMT with monolingual source data, following similar work on phrase- based SMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Schwenk, 2008)</ref>, remains possible fu- ture work.</p><p>Domain adaptation of neural networks via con- tinued training has been shown to be effective for neural language models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ter-Sarkisov et al., 2015)</ref>, and in work parallel to ours, for neural translation models ( . We are the first to show that we can effectively adapt neural translation models with monolingual data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose two simple methods to use monolingual training data during training of NMT systems, with no changes to the network architecture. Providing training examples with dummy source context was successful to some ex- tent, but we achieve substantial gains in all tasks, and new SOTA results, via back-translation of monolingual target data into the source language, and treating this synthetic data as additional train- ing data. We also show that small amounts of in- domain monolingual data, back-translated into the source language, can be effectively used for do- main adaptation. In our analysis, we identified do- main adaptation effects, a reduction of overfitting, and improved fluency as reasons for the effective- ness of using monolingual data for training.</p><p>While our experiments did make use of mono- lingual training data, we only used a small ran- dom sample of the available data, especially for the experiments with synthetic parallel data. It is conceivable that larger synthetic data sets, or data sets obtained via data selection, will provide big- ger performance benefits.</p><p>Because we do not change the neural net- work architecture to integrate monolingual train- ing data, our approach can be easily applied to other NMT systems. We expect that the effective- ness of our approach not only varies with the qual- ity of the MT system used for back-translation, but also depends on the amount (and similarity to the test set) of available parallel and monolingual data, and the extent of overfitting of the baseline model. Future work will explore the effectiveness of our approach in more settings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The research presented in this publication was conducted in cooperation with Samsung Electronics Polska sp. z o.o. - Samsung R&amp;D Institute Poland.</figDesc></figure>
