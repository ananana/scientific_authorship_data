				<p>Software developers and testers have long struggled with how to elicit proactive responses from their coworkers when reviewing code for security vulnerabilities and errors. For a code review to be successful , it must not only identify potential problems but also elicit an active response from the colleague responsible for modifying the code. To understand the factors that contribute to this outcome, we analyze a novel dataset of more than one million code reviews for the Google Chromium project, from which we extract linguistic features of feedback that elicited responsive actions from coworkers. Using a manually-labeled subset of reviewer comments , we trained a highly accurate clas-sifier to identify &quot;acted-upon&quot; comments (AUC = 0.85). Our results demonstrate the utility of our dataset, the feasibility of using NLP for this new task, and the potential of NLP to improve our understanding of how communications between colleagues can be authored to elicit positive, proactive responses.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As in many other work environments, such as hos- pitals and law firms, employees in software devel- opment must communicate through written feed- back and comments to develop functional and se- cure code. Developers elicit feedback from their collaborators on the code that they write through the code review process, which is an integral part of the mature software development lifecy- cle. Most large software development organi- zations, including Microsoft <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lipner, 2004</ref>) and Google <ref type="bibr">(Chromium, 2017)</ref>, mandate the review of all changes to the code base. Code reviews iden- tify potential bugs or errors in software, but not all of the comments made by reviewers are acted upon by developers.</p><p>Some code reviews are taken seriously by de- velopers and prompt significant fixes, while many others are overlooked or dismissed. In some cases, such as when code reviewers misunderstand the purpose of a proposed change or identify an unim- portant issue, it may be appropriate to ignore their comments. At other times, however, the presenta- tion and language of the reviewer's feedback may cause the problems it identifies to be overlooked. Understanding which linguistic characteristics of code reviews influence whether reviews are taken seriously can aid developers in providing effective feedback that is acted upon by their peers. In turn, this can contribute to our general understanding of how to provide meaningful written feedback in a collaborative workplace setting.</p><p>With this in mind, we present a dataset of over one million code review comments from the Chromium project <ref type="bibr">(Chromium, 2017)</ref>, designed with the goal of discovering the linguistic fea- tures associated with actionable developer feed- back. We describe the dataset, along with an ar- ray of linguistic features capturing characteristics of complexity, content, and style, extracted from that dataset. Using a labeled subset of this large dataset, we develop a highly accurate classifier for identifying examples of actionable feedback that performs better than the keyword and sentiment features previously explored for similar tasks.</p><p>The contributions of this work are: (1) the intro- duction of a new NLP task: identifying actionable feedback in collaborative work conversations; (2) a large structured dataset of automatically linguis- tically annotated software developer conversations for feature exploration 1 ; (3) a smaller manually- labeled subset of that dataset for hypothesis test-ing 1 ; and (4) a demonstration of the feasibility of using NLP for this task in the form of a high- accuracy classifier of actionable feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>A typical code review is initiated by a developer (change-author) who wishes to have a collection (patchset) of local changes (patches) to the source code merged into the software product. The patch- set is reviewed by other developers (reviewers) who provide feedback to ensure that the change does not negatively impact the overall quality of the product. In response to this feedback, the change-author can submit one or more additional patchsets for further review. The process repeats until the owner of the source code approves the change. The Chromium project, which underlies Google's Chrome browser and Chrome OS, fol- lows this typical code review process, requiring all changes to the source code to be reviewed before being accepted into the repository. Rietveld <ref type="bibr">(The Chromium Project, 2017)</ref>, an open-source tool, fa- cilitates the code review process in Chromium.</p><p>The process of providing direct assessment of an individual's actions or performance, known as feedback intervention, has been widely studied in a number of domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Judd, 1905;</ref><ref type="bibr">DeNisi, 1996, 1998;</ref>, but previous work applying NLP to the specific task of evaluating code review feed- back is somewhat limited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rahman et al. (2017)</ref> examined a small set of text features (e.g., reading ease, stop word ratio) in a small set of code review comments but found associations between those features and comment usefulness to be mostly in- significant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pletea et al. (2014)</ref> examined senti- ment as an indicator of comment usefulness, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bosu et al. (2015)</ref> considered both sentiment and the presence of pre-defined keywords in feedback. While these studies offer insights into the lan- guage used by developers, they are limited to sen- timent and basic lexical attributes. In contrast, we explore more subtle linguistic features that more accurately characterize actionable feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Our dataset consists of written natural language conversations among developers working to find flaws in proposed changes to software. An ex- ample is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. We used Rietveld's RESTful API to retrieve, in JSON formatted doc- uments, publicly-accessible code reviews in the Chromium project spanning eight years . We processed the JSON documents and ex- tracted reviews with their associated patchsets, patches, and comments, saving them to a Post- greSQL database. Of the 2,855,018 comments, 1,591,431 were posted by reviewers. We refer to this set of comments, for which we provide val- ues for the 9 linguistic features (described in Sec- tion 4), as the full dataset.</p><p>With the goal of characterizing the linguistic at- tributes of actionable feedback, we created a la- beled dataset, which reflects the overall distri- bution of actionable comments in the full dataset by including 2,994 comments automatically iden- tified as acted-upon and 800 comments manually identified as not (known-to-be) acted-upon. We automatically identified acted-upon comments us- ing the Rietveld functionality that allows change- authors to respond to feedback by clicking a link labeled "Done", which automatically posts a spe- cial comment containing only the word 'Done.'. We consider comments by reviewers that elicit this 'Done.' response to be acted-upon. Of the 1.5 million comments posted by reviewers, 690,881 (43%) were identified as acted-upon using the 'Done.' metric. We independently verified a sub- set of 700 of these comments (Cohen's κ = 0.89) and found that in 97% of instances when a devel-oper posted a comment with 'Done.', there was an associated code change implemented.</p><p>To identify comments that were not acted upon, we manually inspected code review comments that did not terminate in a 'Done.' comment. We ran- domly sampled a set of 2,047 such comments and inspected the line of code associated with a com- ment across all patchsets and the source code com- mit associated with the code review. Comments for which the authors could not find evidence that the developer acted upon the feedback were la- beled as not (known-to-be) acted-upon. Within the sample, 800 (39.08%) were manually identified as not (known-to-be) acted-upon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Feature Extraction</head><p>We extract nine linguistic features from the re- viewer comments (examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>) that cap- ture structure, information content, style, and tone. Before extracting features, we automatically re- place all sequences of source code tokens with a single custom token. Since comments can span multiple sentences, we aggregate sentence-level features at the comment level as described below for each feature.</p><p>Syntactic complexity: Previous work (Rah- man et al., 2017) attempted to measure struc- tural complexity using readability metrics, such as Flesch reading ease <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Flesch, 1948)</ref>, which approx- imate complexity using word and sentence length. We instead evaluate the structure of comments by calculating YNGVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yngve, 1960)</ref> and FRA- ZIER <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Frazier, 1987)</ref> scores, two complimentary approaches derived from constituent parses (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Roark et al. (2011);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pakhomov et al. (2011)</ref>) that approximate the cognitive load of sentence pro- cessing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baddeley, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sweller and Chandler, 1991)</ref>. We take the maximum over all sentences in a comment for each of these scores.</p><p>Information content: We calculate both con- tent density (C-DENSITY), which measures the content of text using the ratio of open-class to closed-class words, and propositional density (P- DENSITY), which is the ratio of propositions to the number of words in a text <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Roark et al., 2011</ref>). We use an approach similar to that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al. (2008)</ref> to detect propositions, and we aggre- gate both scores over the sentences in a comment.</p><p>Style and tone: We explore several features characterizing style and tone to learn whether the way reviewers choose to communicate their feed- back has an influence on how their colleagues re- spond to that feedback.</p><p>SENTIMENT: We extract the sentiment of a code review comments using Stanford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Manning et al., 2014</ref>). In contrast to previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bosu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al., 2011</ref>), we use only three values, merging the two positive classes and the two negative classes, and introduce a fourth class, non-neutral, which ignores the sen- timent polarity. The sentiment at a comment level is the ratio of negative/neutral/positive/non-neutral tokens to all tokens.</p><p>FORMALITY: We use the dataset provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lahiri (2015)</ref> to train a logistic regression model for estimating the formality of a sentence, with precision and recall of 83%. We reduce the 7- point rating scale to a binary (formal vs. infor- mal) scale. The features used to train the model in- cluded parts-of-speech, character n-grams, chunk- ing tags, and other features used in predicting un- certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Vincze (2014)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013)</ref>. We re- implemented their logistic regression model with newer programming languages and frameworks, yielding 94% precision and 95% recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. For this feature and PO- LITENESS, we find the maximum and minimum values over all sentences in a comment. POLITENESS: To measure politeness, we use a corpus of Wikipedia editor and Stack Ex- change user conversations annotated for politeness</head><p>UNCERTAINTY: Uncertainty in natural lan- guage has been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Vincze (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Farkas et al. (2010)</ref>, who worked with <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Szarvas et al. (2012)</ref> to compile the Szeged Uncertainty Corpus. While Vincze (2014) trained a binary (certain vs. uncertain) model on the corpus, we trained a multi-label logistic regression model us- ing the same features to predict the type of uncer- tainty exhibited by each word in a comment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Using the labeled dataset described in Section 3, we evaluated the association between each feature and the class labels. For continuous valued fea- tures, we used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney- Wilcoxon to test for association and Cliff's δ to as- sess the strength of that association. For boolean- valued features, we used the χ 2 test to test for independence between the feature and class la- bel. Our results show that acted-upon code review comments were shorter, more polite, more formal, Example Sentence from Chromium dataset FRAZIER Low: This 'if' can be done more elegantly with Min(x,y) High: Please see this warning about adding things to NavigationEntry.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">YNGVE Low:</formula><p>The description is a little confusing.</p><p>High: The only time we call one but not the other is in the destructor, when we don't need to call needsNewGenID, but setting two fields needlessly might be a low price to pay to ensure we never accidentally call one without the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P-DENSITY</head><p>Low:</p><p>In addition to what I suggested earlier about testing for the non-existence of a third file, we could also verify that the contents of the sync database files are not nonsense. High: I tried patching this in locally and it doesn't compile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C-DENSITY</head><p>Low: Slight reordering: please put system modules first, then a blank line, then local ones (PRESUBMIT).</p><p>High: Please check that given user id is child user, not currently active user is child.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FORMALITY</head><p>Low: But yeah, I'm just being an API astronaut*; I think that what I wrote up there is neat, but after sleeping, don't worry about it; it's too much work to go and rewrite stuff.</p><p>High: Moving this elsewhere would also keep this module focused on handling the content settings / heuristics for banners, which is what it was originally intended for.   less uncertain, and had a lower density of proposi- tions than those that were not acted-upon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLITENESS</head><p>We then trained a classifier to identify code re- view comments that are likely to be acted upon. In training the classifier, we considered three sets of linguistic features: (1) all features, (2) sig- nificant features from association analysis, and (3) relevant features from recursive feature elim- ination. Through recursive feature elimination, we found MAX POLITENESS, P-DENSITY, MIN FORMALITY, and MAX FORMALITY to be the four most relevant features for discriminating be- tween acted-upon and not acted-upon comments.</p><p>We trained logistic regression classifiers with these three sets of linguistic features, evaluating performance using 10x10-fold cross validation. We compare these with two baseline classifiers us- ing only token count and sentence count. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the average precision, recall, F 1 -measure, and AUC. The classifiers trained on the linguistic features, while performing near the baselines on the first three measures, substantially outperform the baselines on AUC, with all three yielding val- ues over 0.8. Given these results and the imbal- anced nature of the dataset, it seems that the clas- sifiers trained on the linguistic features are able to identify both classes of comments with high ac- curacy, while the baseline classifiers perform only marginally better than a majority class baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion &amp; Future work</head><p>Overall, we find that the way in which cowork- ers communicate feedback to each other strongly influences whether their peers will act on their ad- vice. Remarkably, politeness and formality, two high-level discourse features, are among the most effective in distinguishing acted upon feedback. It seems that the manner in which feedback is deliv-ered has more impact on the actions of developers than might be expected given the practical and im- personal nature of written code reviews. These re- sults point to the critical importance of how feed- back is phrased and delivered in workplace set- tings, beyond just the content of the feedback it- self.</p><p>In our future work, we plan to explore whether these and other features can be incorporated into a code review tool like Rietveld to automatically flag feedback that is less likely to be acted upon and to encourage more effective communication strategies. We also plan to use our methods to an- alyze the linguistic patterns of individual review- ers to identify those with particularly effective or weak communication styles.</p><p>Our work demonstrates the potential of apply- ing NLP to the task of identifying actionable feed- back in collaborative work scenarios and the util- ity of our two datasets for this task. More broadly, these results speak to the importance of training code reviewers-and indeed all employees work- ing in highly collaborative environments-not just in how to do their jobs effectively but also how to communicate their findings and feedback to their coworkers in a way that will elicit proactive re- sponses.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example code review comment thread.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,307.28,62.81,218.26,216.24" type="bitmap" /></figure>
