				<p>We examine adjective-noun (AN) composition in the task of recognizing textual entail-ment (RTE). We analyze behavior of ANs in large corpora and show that, despite conventional wisdom, adjectives do not always restrict the denotation of the nouns they modify. We use natural logic to characterize the variety of entailment relations that can result from AN composition. Predicting these relations depends on context and on common-sense knowledge, making AN composition especially challenging for current RTE systems. We demonstrate the inability of current state-of-the-art systems to handle AN composition in a simplified RTE task which involves the insertion of only a single word.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Overview</head><p>The ability to perform inference over utterances is a necessary component of natural language understand- ing (NLU). Determining whether one sentence rea- sonably implies another is a complex task, often re- quiring a combination of logical deduction and simple common-sense. NLU tasks are made more complicated by the fact that language is compositional: understand- ing the meaning of a sentence requires understanding not only the meanings of the individual words, but also understanding how those meanings combine.</p><p>Adjectival modification is one of the most basic types of composition in natural language. Most exist- ing work in NLU makes a simplifying assumption that adjectives tend to be restrictive-i.e. adding an adjec- tive modifier limits the set of things to which the noun phrase can refer. For example, the set of little dogs is a subset of the set of dogs, and we cannot in general say that dog entails little dog. This assumption has been ex- ploited by high-performing RTE systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(MacCartney and Manning, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stern and Dagan, 2012)</ref>, as well as used as the basis for learning new entailment rules ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baroni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Young et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>However, this simplified view of adjectival modifica- tion often breaks down in practice. Consider the ques- tion of whether laugh entails bitter laugh in the follow- ing sentences:</p><p>1. Again his laugh echoed in the gorge.</p><p>2. Her laugh was rather derisive.</p><p>In (1), we have no reason to believe the man's laugh is bitter. In (2), however, it seems clear from context that we are dealing with an unpleasant person for whom laugh entails bitter laugh. Automatic NLU should be capable of similar reasoning, taking both context and common sense into account when making inferences.</p><p>This work aims to deepen our understanding of AN composition in relation to automated NLU. The contri- butions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• We conduct an empirical analysis of ANs and their entailment properties.</p><p>• We define a task for directly evaluating a system's ability to predict compositional entailment of ANs in context.</p><p>• We benchmark several state-of-the-art RTE sys- tems on this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Recognizing Textual Entailment</head><p>The task of recognizing textual entailment (RTE) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dagan et al., 2006</ref>) is commonly used to evalu- ate the state-of-the-art of automatic NLU. The RTE task is: given two utterances, a premise (p) and a hypothesis (h), would a human reading p typically infer that h is most likely true? Systems are ex- pected to produce either a binary (YES/NO) or trinary (ENTAILMENT/CONTRADICTION/UNKNOWN) output. The type of knowledge tested in the RTE task has shifted in recent years. While older datasets mostly captured logical reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cooper et al., 1996</ref>) and lexical knowledge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Giampiccolo et al., 2007</ref>) (see Ex- amples (1) and (2) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), the recent datasets have become increasingly reliant on common-sense knowl- edge of scenes and events <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Marelli et al., 2014</ref>). In Example (4) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, for which the gold label is ENTAILMENT, it is perfectly reasonable to assume the dogs are playing. However, this is not necessarily true that running entails playing-maybe the dogs are being (1) FraCas p No delegate finished the report on time.</p><p>Quantifiers h Some Scandinavian delegate finished the report on time.</p><p>(no → ¬some) (2) RTE2 p Trade between China and India is expected to touch $20 bn this year. . . Definitions h There is a profitable trade between China and India.</p><p>($20 bn → profitable) (3) NA p Some delegates finished the report on time. Implicature h Not all of the delegates finished the report on time.</p><p>(some → ¬all) (4) SICK p A couple of white dogs are running along a beach. Common Sense h Two dogs are playing on the beach.</p><p>(running → playing) chased by a bear and are running for their lives! Exam- ple (4) is just one of many RTE problems which rely on intuition rather than strict logical inference.</p><p>Transformation-based RTE. There have been an enormous range of approaches to automatic RTE-from those based on theorem proving ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bjerva et al., 2014</ref>) to those based on vector space models of semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowman et al., 2015a</ref>). Transformation-based RTE systems attempt to solve the RTE problem by identifying a se- quence of atomic edits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(MacCartney, 2009)</ref> which can be applied, one by one, in order to transform p into h. Each edit can be associated with some entailment rela- tion. Then, the entailment relation that holds between p and h overall is a function of the entailment relations associated with each atomic edit. This approach is ap- pealing in that it breaks potentially complex p/h pairs into a series of bite-sized pieces. Transformation-based RTE is widely used, not only in rule-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(MacCartney and Manning, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Young et al., 2014</ref>), but also in statistical RTE systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stern and Dagan, 2012;</ref>). MacCartney (2009) defines an atomic edit applied to a linguistic expression as the deletion DEL, insertion INS, or substitution SUB of a subexpression. If x is a linguistic expression and e is an atomic edit, than e(x) is the result of applying the edit e to the expression x. For example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x = a 1 girl 2 in 3 a 4 red 5 dress 6 e = DEL(red, 5) e(x) = a 1 girl 2 in 3 a 4 dress 5</formula><p>We say that the entailment relation that holds between x and e(x) is generated by the edit e. In the above example, we would say that e generates a forward en- tailment () since a girl in a red dress entails a girl in a dress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Natural Logic Entailment Relations</head><p>Natural logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(MacCartney, 2009</ref>) is a formalism that describes entailment relationships between natural lan- guage strings, rather than operating over mathemati- cal formulae. Natural logic enables both light-weight representation and robust inference, and is an increas- ingly popular choice for NLU tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bowman et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pavlick et al., 2015)</ref>. There are seven "basic entailment relations" described by natural logic, five of which we explore here. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> These five relations, as they might hold between an AN and the head N, are summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The forward entailment relation is the restrictive case, in which the AN (brown dog) is a subset of (and thus en- tails) the N (dog) but the N does not entail the AN (dog does not entail brown dog). The symmetric reverse en- tailment can also occur, in which the N is a subset of the set denoted by the AN. An example of this is the AN possible solution: i.e. all actual solutions are pos- sible solutions, but there are an abundance of possible solutions that are not and will never be actual solutions. In the equivalence relation, AN and N denote the same set (e.g. the entire universe is the same as the universe), whereas in the alternation relation, AN and N denote disjoint sets (e.g. a former senator is not a senator). In the independence relation, the AN has no determinable entailment relationship to the N (e.g. an alleged crimi- nal may or may not be a criminal).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Simplified RTE Task</head><p>The focus of this work is to determine the entailment relation that exists between an AN and its head N in a given context. To do this, we define a simplified en- tailment task identical to the normal RTE task, with the constraint that p and h differ only by one atomic edit e as defined in Section 2. We look only at insertion INS(A) and deletion DEL(A), where A must be a sin- gle adjective.</p><p>We use a 3-way entailment classification where the possible labels are ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, and UNKNOWN. This allows us to recover the basic entailment relation from Section 3: by determining the labels associated with the INS operation and the DEL  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Different entailment relations that can exist between an adjective-noun and the head noun. The best-known case is that of forward entailment, in which the AN denotes a subset of the N (e.g. brown dog). However, many other relationships may exist, as mod- eled by natural logic. operation, we can uniquely identify each of the five re- lations (  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>: Entailment generated by INS(A) or DEL(A) for possible relations holding between AN and N. Both INS and DEL are required to distinguish all five entail- ment relations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N does not entail AN N entails AN Alternation (AN | N) Forward Entailment (AN ⊏ N) Independent (AN # N) Equivalence (AN ≣ N) Reverse Entailment (AN ⊐ N) N</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Limitations</head><p>Modeling denotations of ANs and N. We note that this task design does not directly ask about the relation- ship between the sets denoted by the AN and by the N (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Rather than asking "Is this in- stance of AN an instance of N?" we ask "Is this state- ment that is true of AN also true of N?" While these are not the same question, they are often conflated in NLP, for example, in information extraction, when we use statements about ANs as justification for extracting facts about the head N ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angeli et al., 2015)</ref>. We fo- cus on the latter question and accept that this prevents us from drawing conclusions about the actual set the- oretic relation between the denotation of AN and the denotation of N. However, we are able to draw conclu- sions about the practical entailment relation between statements about the AN and statements about the N.</p><p>Monotonicity. In this simplified RTE task, we as- sume that the entailment relation that holds overall between p and h is attributable wholly to the atomic edit (i.e. the inserted or deleted adjective). This is an over-simplification. In practice, several factors can cause the entailment relation that holds between the sentences overall to differ from the relation that holds between the AN and the N. For example, quantifiers and other downward-monotone operators can block or reverse entailments (brown dog → dog, but no brown dog → no dog). While we make some effort to avoid selecting such sentences for our analysis (Section 5.3), fully identifying and handling such cases is beyond the scope of this paper. We acknowledge that monotone operators and other complicating factors (e.g. multi- word expressions) might be present in our data, but we believe, based on manual inspection, that they not fre- quent enough to substantially effect our analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Design</head><p>To build an intuition about the behavior of ANs in practice, we collect human judgments of the entail- ments generated by inserting and deleting adjectives from sentences drawn from large corpora. In this sec- tion, we motivate our design decisions, before carrying out our full analysis in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Human judgments of entailment</head><p>People often draw conclusions based on "assumptions that seem plausible, rather than assumptions that are known to be true" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kadmon, 2001)</ref>. We therefore col- lect annotations on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (definite contradiction) to 5 (definite entailment), with 2 and 4 capturing likely (but not certain) contradic- tion/entailment respectively. We recruit annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We tell each annotator to assume that the premise "is true, or describes a real sce- nario" and then, using their best judgement, to indicate how likely it is, on a scale of 1 to 5, that the hypothesis "is also true, or describes the same scenario." They are given short descriptions and several examples of sen- tence pairs that constitute each score along the 1 to 5 scale. They are also given the option to say that "the sentence does not make sense," to account for poorly constructed p/h pairs, or errors in our parsing. We use the mean score of the three annotators as the true score for each sentence pair.</p><p>Inter-annotator agreement. To ensure that our judgements are reproducible, we re-annotate a random 10% of our pairs, using the same annotation setup but a different set of annotators. We compute the intra-class correlation (ICC) between the scores received on the first round of annotation, and those received in the sec- ond pass. ICC is related to Pearson correlation, and is used to measure consistency among annotations when the group of annotators measuring each observation is not fixed, as opposed to metrics like Fleiss's κ which assume a fixed set of annotators. On our data, the ICC is 0.77 (95% CI 0.73 -0.81) indicating very high agree- ment. These twice-annotated pairs will become our test set in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Data</head><p>Selecting contexts. We first investigate whether, in naturally occurring data, there is a difference between contexts in which the author uses the AN and contexts in which the author uses only the (unmodified) N. In other words, in order to study the effect of an A (e.g. financial) on the denotation of an N (e.g. system), is it better to look at contexts like (a) below, in which the author originally used the AN financial system, or to use contexts like (b), in which the author used only the N system?</p><p>(a) The TED spread is an indication of investor confi- dence in the U.S. financial system.</p><p>(b) Wellers hopes the system will be fully operational by 2015.</p><p>We will refer to contexts like (a) as natural contexts, and those like (b) as artificial. We take sample of 500 ANs from the Annotated Gigaword corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Napoles et al., 2012)</ref>, and choose three natural and three artificial contexts for each. We generate p/h pairs by delet- ing/inserting the A for the natural/artificial contexts, re- spectively, and collect human judgements on the effect of the INS(A) operation for both cases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> displays the results of this pilot study. In sentences which contain the AN naturally, there is a clear bias toward judgements of "entailment." That is, in contexts when an AN appears, it is often the case that this A is superfluous: the information carried by the A is sufficiently entailed by the context that remov- ing it does not remove information. Sentences (a) and (b) above provide intuition: in the case of sentence (a), trigger phrases like investor confidence make it clear that the system we are discussing is the financial sys- tem, whether or not the adjective financial actually ap- pears. No such triggers exist in sentence (b). Selecting ANs. We next investigate whether the fre- quency with which an AN is used effects its tendency to entail/be entailed by the head N. Again, we run a small pilot study. We choose 500 ANs stratified across dif- ferent levels of frequency of occurrence in order to de- termine if sampling the most frequent ANs introduces bias into our annotation. We see no significant relation- ship between the frequency with which an AN appears and the entailment judgements we received.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Final design decisions</head><p>As a result of the above pilot experiments, we proceed with our study as follows. First, we use only artificial contexts, as we believe this will result in a greater va- riety of entailment relations and will avoid systemati- cally biasing our judgements toward entailments. Sec- ond, we use the most frequent AN pairs, as these will better represent the types of ANs that NLU systems are likely to encounter in practice.</p><p>We . From each corpus, we select the 100 nouns which occur with the largest number of unique adjectives. Then, for each noun, we take the 10 adjec- tives with which the noun occurs most often. For each AN, we choose 3 contexts 2 in which the N appears un- modified, and generate p/h pairs by inserting the A into each.</p><p>We collect 3 judgements for each p/h pair. Since this task is subjective, and we want to focus our analysis on clean instances on which human agreement is high, we remove pairs for which one or more of the annotators chose the "does not make sense" option and pairs for which we do not have at least 2 out of 3 agreement (i.e. at least two workers must have chosen the same score on the 5-point scale). In the end, we have a total of 5,560 annotated p/h pairs 3 coming roughly evenly from our 4 genres. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows how the entailment relations are dis- tributed in each genre. In Image Captions, the vast ma- jority of ANs are in a forward entailment (restrictive) relation with their head N. In the other genres, however, a substantial fraction (36% for Forums) are in equiva- lence relations: i.e. the AN denotes the same set as is denoted by the N alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Empirical Analysis</head><p>When does N entail AN? If it is possible to insert adjectives into a sentence without adding new infor- mation, when does this happen? When is adjectival 1) When the adjective is prototypical of the noun it modifies. In general, we see that adding adjec- tives which are seen as attributes of the "prototypi- cal" instance of the noun tend to generate entailments. E.g. people are generally comfortable concluding that beach→sandy beach. The same adjective may be pro- totypical and thus entailed in the context of one noun, but generate a contradiction in the context of another. E.g. if someone has a baby, it is probably fine to say they have a little baby, but if someone has control, it would be a lie to say they have little control ( <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref>). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical Analysis Empirical Analysis</head><p>Figure 4: Inserting adjectives that are seen as "proto- typical" of the noun tends to generate entailments. E.g., beach generally entails sandy beach.</p><p>2) When the adjective invokes a sense of salience or importance. Nouns are assumed to be salient and relevant. E.g. answers are assumed (perhaps naively) to be correct, and problems are assumed (perhaps melodramatically) to be current and huge.

Some entailment inferences depend entirely on contextual information (Example 2a) while others arise from common-sense inference (Example 2b). Many of the most interesting examples fall into the indepen- dence relation. Recall from Section 3 that indepen- dence, in theory, covers ANs such as alleged criminal, in which the AN may or may not entail the N. In prac- tice, the cases we observe falling into the independence relation tend to be those which are especially effected by world knowledge. In Example 3, local economy is considered to be independent of economy when used in the context of President Obama: i.e. the assump- tion that the president would be discussing the national economy is so strong that even when the president says the local economy is improving, people do not take this to mean that he has said the economy is improving.</p><p>Undefined entailment relations. Our annotation methodology-i.e. inferring entailment relations based on the entailments generated by INS and DEL edits- does not enforce that all of the ANs fit into one of the five entailment relations defined by natural logic. Specifically, we observe many instances (∼5% of p/h pairs) in which INS is determined to generate a con- tradiction, while DEL is said to generate an entail- ment. In terms of set theory, this is equivalent to the (non-sensical) setting in which "every AN is an in- stance of N, but no N is an instance of AN." On inspec- tion, these again represent cases in which common- sense assumptions dominate the inference. In Exam- ple 6, when given the premise Bush travels to Michi- gan to discuss the economy, annotators are confident enough that economy does not entail Japanese economy (why on earth would Bush travel to Michigan to discuss the Japanese economy?) that they label the insertion of Japanese as generating a contradiction. However, when presented with the p/h in the opposite direction, annotators agree that the Japanese economy does in- deed entail the economy. These examples highlight the flexibility with which humans perform natural lan- guage inference, and the need for automated systems to </p></div>

Our analysis in this section results in three key conclusions about AN composition. 1) De- spite common assumptions, adjectives do not always restrict the denotation of a noun. Rather, adjectival modification can result in a range of entailment re- lations, including equivalence and contradiction. 2) There are patterns to when the insertion of an adjective is or is not entailment-preserving, but recognizing these patterns requires common-sense and a notion of "pro- totypical" instances of nouns.</p><p>3) The entailment rela- tion that holds between an AN and the head N is highly context dependent. These observations describe sizable obstacles for automatic NLU systems. Common-sense reasoning is still a major challenge for computers, both in terms of how to learn world knowledge and in how to represent it. In addition, context-sensitivity means that entailment properties of ANs cannot be simply stored in a lexicon and looked-up at run time. Such properties make AN composition an important problem on which to focus NLU research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Benchmarking Current SOTA</head><p>We have highlighted why AN composition is an in- teresting and likely challenging phenomenon for auto- mated NLU systems. We now turn our investigation to the performance of state-of-the-art RTE systems, in or- der to quantify how well AN composition is currently handled.</p><p>The Add-One Entailment Task. We define the "Add-One Entailment" task to be identical to the nor- mal RTE task, except with the constraint that the premise p and the hypothesis h differ only by the atomic insertion of an adjective: h = e(p) where e=INS(A) and A is a single adjective. To provide a consistent interface with a range of RTE systems, we use a binary label set: NON-ENTAILMENT (which encompasses both CONTRADICTION and UNKNOWN) and ENTAILMENT. We want to test on only straight- forward examples, so as not to punish systems for failing to classify examples which humans themselves find difficult to judge. In our test set, therefore, we label pairs with mean human scores ≤ 3 as NON- ENTAILMENT, pairs with scores ≥ 4 as ENTAILMENT, and throw away the pairs which fall into the ambigu- ous range in between. 5 Our resulting train, dev, and test sets contain 4,481, 510, and 387 pairs, respectively. These splits cover disjoint sets of ANs-i.e. none of the ANs appearing in test were seen in train. Individ- ual adjectives and/or nouns can appear in both train and test. The dataset consists of roughly 85% NON- ENTAILMENT and 15% ENTAILMENT. Inter-annotator agreement achieves 93% accuracy.</p></div>

These ed- its are represented using feature vectors, and the sys- tem searches over edit sequences for the lowest cost "proof" of either entailment or non-entailment. The feature weights are set by logistic regression during training.</p><p>Deep learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowman et al. (2015a)</ref> recently re- ported very promising results using deep learning ar-chitectures and large training data for the RTE task. We test the performance of those same implementations on our Add-One task. Specifically, we test the following models: a basic Sum-of-words model (Sum), which represents both p and h as the sum of their word embed- dings, an RNN model, and an LSTM model. We also train a bag-of-vectors model (BOV), which is simply a logistic regression whose features are the concatenated averaged word embeddings of p and h. For the LSTM, in addition to the normal training setting-i.e. training only on the 5K Add-One training pairs-we test a transfer-learning setting (Transfer). In transfer learning, the model trains first on a large general dataset before fine-tuning its parameters on the smaller set of target-domain training data. For our Transfer model, we train first on the 500K pair SNLI dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowman et al., 2015a</ref>) until conver- gence, and then fine-tune on the 5K Add-One pairs. This setup enabled <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bowman et al. (2015a)</ref> to train a high-performance LSTM for the SICK dataset, which is of similar size to our Add-One dataset (∼5K training pairs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Results</head><p>Out of the box performances. To calibrate expec- tations, we first report the performance of each of the systems on the datasets for which they were originally designed. For the Excitement systems, this is the RTE3 dataset <ref type="table">(Table 6a</ref>). For the deep learning systems, this is the SNLI dataset <ref type="table">(Table 6b</ref>). For the deep learn- ing systems, in addition to reporting performance when trained on the SNLI corpus (500K p/h pairs), we re- port the performance in a reduced training setting in which systems only have access to 5K p/h pairs. This is equivalent to the amount of data we have available for the Add-One task, and is intended to give a sense of the performance improvements we should expect from these systems given the size of the training data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Performance on Add-One RTE.</head><p>Finally, we train each of the systems on the 5,000 Add- One p/h pairs in our dataset and test on our held- out set of 387 pairs. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> reports the results in terms of accuracy and precision/recall for the ENTAIL- MENT class. The baseline strategy of predicting the majority class for each adjective, based on the train- ing data, reaches close to human performance (92% accuracy). Given the simplicity of the task (p and h differ by a single word), this baseline strategy should be achievable. However, none of the systems tested come close to this level of performance, suggesting that they fail to learn even the most-likely entailment generated by adjectives (e.g. that INS(brown) prob- ably generates NON-ENTAILMENT and INS(possible) probably generates ENTAILMENT). The best perform- ing system is the RNN, which achieves 87% accuracy, only two points above the baseline of always guessing NON-ENTAILMENT. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Performances of all systems on AddOne RTE task. The strategy of predicting the majority class for each adjective-based on the training data-reaches near human performance. None of the systems tested come close to human levels, indicating that the systems fail even to memorize the most-likely class for each ad- jective in training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Related Work</head><p>Past work, both in linguistics and in NLP, has explored different classes of adjectives (e.g. privative, inten- sional) as they relate to entailment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kamp and Partee, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Partee, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boleda et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nayak et al., 2014</ref>). In general, prior studies have focused on mod- eling properties of the adjectives alone, ignoring the context-dependent nature of AN/N entailments-i.e. in prior work little is always restrictive, whether it is mod- ifying baby or control. Pustejovsky (2013) offer a pre- liminary analysis of the contextual complexities sur- rounding adjective inference, which reinforces many of the observations we have made here. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hartung and Frank (2011)</ref> analyze adjectives in terms of the proper- ties they modify but don't address them from an entail- ment perspective. Tien <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nguyen et al. (2014)</ref> look at the adjectives in the restricted domain of computer vision.</p><p>Other past work has employed first-order logic and other formal representations of adjectives in order to provide compositional entailment predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amoia and Gardent, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amoia and Gardent, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">McCrae et al., 2014)</ref>. Although theoretically appealing, such rigid logics are unlikely to provide the flexibility needed to handle the type of common-sense inferences we have discussed here. Distributional representations provide much greater flexibility in terms of represen- tation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guevara, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boleda et al., 2013)</ref>. However, work on distributional AN composition has so far remained out-of-context, and has mostly been evaluated in terms of overall "sim- ilarity" rather than directly addressing the entailment properties associated with composition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>We have investigated the problem of adjective-noun composition, specifically in relation to the task of RTE. AN composition is capable of producing a range of natural logic entailment relationship, at odds with commonly-used heuristics which treat all adjectives a restrictive. We have shown that predicting these entailment relations is dependent on context and on world knowledge, making it a difficult problem for cur- rent NLU technologies. When tested, state-of-the-art RTE systems fail to learn to differentiate entailment- preserving insertions of adjectives from non-entailing ones. This is an important distinction for carrying out human-like reasoning, and our results reveal important weaknesses in the representations and algorithms em- ployed by current NLU systems. The Add-One Entail- ment task we have introduced will allow ongoing RTE research to better diagnose systems' abilities to capture these subtleties of ANs, which that have practical ef- fects on natural language inference.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: p/h pairs derived from natural contexts result in a notable bias toward judgements of "entailment" for the INS(A) operation, compared to p/h pairs derived from artificial contexts.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> We omit two relationships: negation and cover. These relations require that the sets denoted by the strings being compared are &quot;exhaustive.&quot; In this work, this requirement would be met when everything in the universe is either an instance of the noun or it is an instance of the adjective-noun (or possibly both). This is a hard constraint to meet, and we believe that the interesting relations that result from AN composition are adequately captured by the remaining 5 relations.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> As a heuristic, we skip sentences containing obvious downward-monotone operators, e.g. not, every (Section 4). 3 Our data is available at http://www.seas.upenn. edu/ ˜ nlp/resources/AN-composition.tgz</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> For our training and dev sets, we include all pairs, considering scores &lt; 3.5 as NON-ENTAILMENT and scores ≥ 3.5 as ENTAILMENT. We tried removing &quot;ambiguous&quot; pairs from the training and dev sets as well, but it did not improve the systems&apos; performances on the test set.</note>
