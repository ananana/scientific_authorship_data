				<p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach to machine translation that has shown promising results that are comparable to traditional approaches. A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT&apos;14 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points, our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT&apos;14 contest task.</p>

NMT systems are ap- pealing because they use minimal domain knowl- edge which makes them well-suited to any prob- lem that can be formulated as mapping an input sequence to an output sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>). In addition, the natural ability of neural networks to generalize implies that NMT systems will also generalize to novel word phrases and sen- tences that do not occur in the training set. In addi- tion, NMT systems potentially remove the need to store explicit phrase tables and language models which are used in conventional systems. Finally, the decoder of an NMT system is easy to imple- ment, unlike the highly intricate decoders used by phrase-based systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Koehn et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Despite these advantages, conventional NMT systems are incapable of translating rare words be- cause they have a fixed modest-sized vocabulary <ref type="bibr">1</ref> which forces them to use the unk symbol to repre- sent the large number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Unsurpris- ingly, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref> have observed that sentences with many rare words tend to be translated much more poorly than sentences containing mainly frequent words. Standard phrase-based systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Koehn et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chiang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cer et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dyer et al., 2010</ref>), on the other hand, do not suffer from the rare word problem to the same extent because they can support a much larger vocabulary, and because their use of explicit alignments and phrase tables allows them to memorize the translations of even extremely rare words.</p><p>Motivated by the strengths of standard phrase- 1 Due to the computationally intensive nature of the soft- max, NMT systems often limit their vocabularies to be the top 30K-80K most frequent words in each language. How- ever, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jean et al. (2015)</ref> has very recently proposed an efficient approximation to the softmax that allows for training NTMs with very large vocabularies. As discussed in Section 2, this technique is complementary to ours. en: The ecotax portico in Pont-de-Buis , . . . <ref type="bibr">[truncated]</ref> . . . , was taken down on Thursday morning fr: Le portiqué ecotaxe de Pont-de-Buis , . . . <ref type="bibr">[truncated]</ref> . . . , a ´ eté démonté jeudi matin nn: Le unk de unkàunk`unkà unk , . . . <ref type="bibr">[truncated]</ref> . . . , a ´ eté pris le jeudi matin <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Example of the rare word problem -An English source sentence (en), a human translation to French (fr), and a translation produced by one of our neural network systems (nn) before handling OOV words.

Our experiments confirm that this approach is effective. On the English to French WMT'14 translation task, this approach provides an im- provement of up to 2.8 (if the vocabulary is rel- atively small) BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Neural Machine Translation</head><p>A neural machine translation system is any neural network that maps a source sentence, s 1 , . . . , s n , to a target sentence, t 1 , . . . , t m , where all sen- tences are assumed to terminate with a special "end-of-sentence" token &lt;eos&gt;. More con- cretely, an NMT system uses a neural network to parameterize the conditional distributions</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(t j |t &lt;j , s ≤n )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>for 1 ≤ j ≤ m. By doing so, it becomes pos- sible to compute and therefore maximize the log probability of the target sentence given the source sentence</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">log p(t|s) = m j=1 log p (t j |t &lt;j , s ≤n )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>There are many ways to parameterize these con- ditional distributions. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013)</ref> used a combination of a con- volutional neural network and a recurrent neural network, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al. (2014)</ref> used a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cho et al. (2014)</ref> used an architecture similar to the LSTM, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref> used a more elabo- rate neural network architecture that uses an atten- tional mechanism over the input sequence, similar to Graves (2013) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Graves et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we use the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al. (2014)</ref>, which uses a deep LSTM to encode the input sequence and a separate deep LSTM to out- put the translation. The encoder reads the source sentence, one word at a time, and produces a large vector that represents the entire source sentence. The decoder is initialized with this vector and gen- erates a translation, one word at a time, until it emits the end-of-sentence symbol &lt;eos&gt;.</p><p>None the early work in neural machine transla- tion systems has addressed the rare word problem, but the recent work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jean et al. (2015)</ref> has tack- led it with an efficient approximation to the soft- max to accommodate for a very large vocabulary (500K words). However, even with a large vocab- ulary, the problem with rare words, e.g., names, numbers, etc., still persists, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jean et al. (2015)</ref> found that using techniques similar to ours are beneficial and complementary to their approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Rare Word Models</head><p>Despite the relatively large amount of work done on pure neural machine translation systems, there has been no work addressing the OOV problem in NMT systems, with the notable exception of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jean et al. (2015)</ref>'s work mentioned earlier.</p><p>We propose to address the rare word problem by training the NMT system to track the origins of the unknown words in the target sentences. If we knew the source word responsible for each un-en: The unk 1 portico in unk 2 . . . fr: Le unk ∅ unk 1 de unk 2 . . . known target word, we could introduce a post- processing step that would replace each unk in the system's output with a translation of its source word, using either a dictionary or the identity translation. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, if the model knows that the second unknown token in the NMT (line nn) originates from the source word ecotax, it can perform a word dictionary lookup to replace that unknown token byécotaxebyécotaxe. Sim- ilarly, an identity translation of the source word Pont-de-Buis can be applied to the third un- known token.</p><p>We present three annotation strategies that can easily be applied to any NMT system <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cho et al., 2014</ref>). We treat the NMT system as a black box and train it on a corpus annotated by one of the models below. First, the alignments are produced with an unsupervised aligner. Next, we use the alignment links to construct a word dictio- nary that will be used for the word translations in the post-processing step. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> If a word does not ap- pear in our dictionary, then we apply the identity translation.</p><p>The first few words of the sentence pair in Fig- ure 1 (lines en and fr) illustrate our models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Copyable Model</head><p>In this approach, we introduce multiple tokens to represent the various unknown words in the source and in the target language, as opposed to using only one unk token. We annotate the OOV words in the source sentence with unk 1 , unk 2 , unk 3 , in that order, while assigning repeating un- known words identical tokens. The annotation of the unknown words in the target language is slightly more elaborate: (a) each unknown target word that is aligned to an unknown source word is assigned the same unknown token (hence, the en: The unk portico in unk . . . fr: Le p 0 unk p −1 unk p 1 de p ∅ unk p −1 . . . "copy" model) and (b) an unknown target word that has no alignment or that is aligned with a known word uses the special null token unk ∅ . See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> for an example. This annotation enables us to translate every non-null unknown token.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Positional All Model (PosAll)</head><p>The copyable model is limited by its inability to translate unknown target words that are aligned to known words in the source sentence, such as the pair of words, "portico" and "portique", in our running example. The former word is known on the source sentence; whereas latter is not, so it is labelled with unk ∅ . This happens often since the source vocabularies of our models tend to be much larger than the target vocabulary since a large source vocabulary is cheap. This limita- tion motivated us to develop an annotation model that includes the complete alignments between the source and the target sentences, which is straight- forward to obtain since the complete alignments are available at training time.</p><p>Specifically, we return to using only a single universal unk token. However, on the target side, we insert a positional token p d after ev- ery word. Here, d indicates a relative position (d = −7, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , 7) to denote that a tar- get word at position j is aligned to a source word at position i = j − d. Aligned words that are too far apart are considered unaligned, and unaligned words rae annotated with a null token p n . Our an- notation is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Positional Unknown Model (PosUnk)</head><p>The main weakness of the PosAll model is that it doubles the length of the target sentence. This makes learning more difficult and slows the speed of parameter updates by a factor of two. How- ever, given that our post-processing step is con- cerned only with the alignments of the unknown words, so it is more sensible to only annotate the unknown words. This motivates our positional un- known model which uses unkpos d tokens (for d in −7, . . . , 7 or ∅) to simultaneously denote (a) the fact that a word is unknown and (b) its rela- tive position d with respect to its aligned source word. Like the PosAll model, we use the symbol unkpos ∅ for unknown target words that do not have an alignment. We use the universal unk for all unknown tokens in the source language. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> for an annotated example.</p><p>en: The unk portico in unk . . . fr: Le unkpos 1 unkpos −1 de unkpos 1 . . . It is possible that despite its slower speed, the PosAll model will learn better alignments because it is trained on many more examples of words and their alignments. However, we show that this is not the case (see §5.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the effectiveness of our OOV mod- els on the WMT'14 English-to-French translation task. Translation quality is measured with the BLEU metric ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>) on the new- stest2014 test set (which has 3003 sentences).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training Data</head><p>To be comparable with the results reported by pre- vious work on neural machine translation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cho et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>, we train our models on the same training data of 12M parallel sentences (348M French and 304M English words), obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Schwenk, 2014</ref>). The 12M subset was selected from the full WMT'14 parallel corpora using the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Axelrod et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the computationally intensive nature of the naive softmax, we limit the French vocabulary (the target language) to the either the 40K or the 80K most frequent French words. On the source side, we can afford a much larger vocabulary, so we use the 200K most frequent English words. The model treats all other words as unknowns. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We annotate our training data using the three schemes described in the previous section. The alignment is computed with the Berkeley aligner ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liang et al., 2006</ref>) using its default settings. We discard sentence pairs in which the source or the target sentence exceed 100 tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Training Details</head><p>Our training procedure and hyperparameter choices are similar to those used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al. (2014)</ref>. In more details, we train multi-layer deep LSTMs, each of which has 1000 cells, with 1000 dimensional embeddings. Like Sutskever et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2014)</ref>, we reverse the words in the source sen- tences which has been shown to improve LSTM memory utilization and results in better transla- tions of long sentences. Our hyperparameters can be summarized as follows: (a) the parameters are initialized uniformly in [-0.08, 0.08] for 4-layer models and [-0.06, 0.06] for 6-layer models, (b) SGD has a fixed learning rate of 0.7, (c) we train for 8 epochs (after 5 epochs, we begin to halve the learning rate every 0.5 epoch), (d) the size of the mini-batch is 128, and (e) we rescale the normalized gradient to ensure that its norm does not exceed 5 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pascanu et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>We also follow the GPU parallelization scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>), allowing us to reach a training speed of 5.4K words per sec- ond to train a depth-6 model with 200K source and 80K target vocabularies ; whereas Sutskever et al. (2014) achieved 6.3K words per second for a depth-4 models with 80K source and target vo- cabularies. Training takes about 10-14 days on an 8-GPU machine.</p></div>

We highlight the performance of our best system in bolded text and state the improvements obtained by our technique of handling rare words (namely, the PosUnk model). Notice that, for a given vocabulary size, the more accurate systems achieve a greater improvement from the post-processing step. This is the case because the more accurate models are able to pin-point the origin of an unknown word with greater accuracy, making the post-processing more useful.</p><p>System BLEU Existing SOTA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Durrani et al., 2014)</ref> 35.8 Ensemble of 8 LSTMs + PosUnk 36.6 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Detokenized BLEU on newstest2014 - translation results of the existing state-of-the-art system and our best system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Main Results</head><p>We compare our systems to others, including the current state-of-the-art MT system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Durrani et al., 2014)</ref>, recent end-to-end neural systems, as well as phrase-based baselines with neural com- ponents. The results shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> demonstrate that our unknown word translation technique (in par- ticular, the PosUnk model) significantly improves the translation quality for both the individual (non- ensemble) LSTM models and the ensemble mod- els. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> For 40K-word vocabularies, the performance gains are in the range of 2.3-2.8 BLEU points. With larger vocabularies (80K), the performance gains are diminished, but our technique can still provide a nontrivial gains of 1.6-1.9 BLEU points.</p><p>It is interesting to observe that our approach is more useful for ensemble models as compared to the individual ones. This is because the useful- ness of the PosUnk model directly depends on the ability of the NMT to correctly locate, for a given OOV target word, its corresponding word in the source sentence. An ensemble of large models identifies these source words with greater accu- racy. This is why for the same vocabulary size, better models obtain a greater performance gain our post-processing step. e Except for the very re- cent work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jean et al. (2015)</ref> that employs a sim- ilar unknown treatment strategy 7 as ours, our best result of 37.5 BLEU outperforms all other NMT systems by a arge margin, and more importanly, our system has established a new record on the WMT'14 English to French translation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analysis</head><p>We analyze and quantify the improvement ob- tained by our rare word translation approach and provide a detailed comparison of the different rare word techniques proposed in Section 3. We also examine the effect of depth on the LSTM architectures and demonstrate a strong correla- tion between perplexities and BLEU scores. We also highlight a few translation examples where our models succeed in correctly translating OOV words, and present several failures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Rare Word Analysis</head><p>To analyze the effect of rare words on translation quality, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al. (Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>) and sort sentences in newstest2014 by the average inverse frequency of their words. We split the test sentences into groups where the sentences within each group have a comparable number of rare words and evaluate each group independently. We evaluate our systems before and after translat- ing the OOV words and compare with the stan- dard MT systems -we use the best system from the WMT'14 contest ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Durrani et al., 2014)</ref>, and neural MT systems -we use the ensemble systems described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>) and Section 4.</p><p>Rare word translation is challenging for neural machine translation systems as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Specifically, the translation quality of our model before applying the postprocessing step is shown by the green curve, and the current best NMT sys- tem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>) is the purple curve. While ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>) produces better translations for sentences with frequent words (the left part of the graph), they are worse than best <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Their unknown replacement method and ours both track the locations of target unknown words and use a word dictio- nary to post-process the translation. However, the mechanism used to achieve the "tracking" behavior is different. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jean et al. (2015)</ref>'s uses the attentional mechanism to track the origins of all target words, not just the unknown ones. In contrast, we only focus on tracking unknown words using unsuper- vised alignments. Our method can be easily applied to any sequence-to-sequence models since we treat any model as a blackbox and manipulate only at the input and output levels.

We compute the BLEU score of each group independently. system (red curve) on sentences with many rare words (the right side of the graph). When applying our unknown word translation technique (purple curve), we significantly improve the translation quality of our NMT: for the last group of 500 sen- tences which have the greatest proportion of OOV words in the test set, we increase the BLEU score of our system by 4.8 BLEU points. Overall, our rare word translation model interpolates between the SOTA system and the system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al. (2014)</ref>, which allows us to outperform the win- ning entry of WMT'14 on sentences that consist predominantly of frequent words and approach its performance on sentences with many OOV words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Rare Word Models</head><p>We examine the effect of the different rare word models presented in Section 3, namely: (a) Copy- able -which aligns the unknown words on both the input and the target side by learning to copy in- dices, (b) the Positional All (PosAll) -which pre- dicts the aligned source positions for every target word, and (c) the Positional Unknown (PosUnk) -which predicts the aligned source positions for only the unknown target words. <ref type="bibr">8</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Rare word models -translation perfor- mance of 6-layer LSTMs: a model that uses no alignment (NoAlign) and the other rare word mod- els (Copyable, PosAll, PosUnk). For each model, we show results before (left) and after (right) the rare word translation as well as the perplexity (in parentheses). For PosAll, we report the perplexi- ties of predicting the words and the positions.</p><p>ing to measure the improvement obtained when no alignment information is used during training. As such, we include a baseline model with no align- ment knowledge (NoAlign) in which we simply as- sume that the i th unknown word on the target sen- tence is aligned to the i th unknown word in the source sentence.</p><p>From the results in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, a simple mono- tone alignment assumption for the NoAlign model yields a modest gain of 0.8 BLEU points. If we train the model to predict the alignment, then the Copyable model offers a slightly better gain of 1.0 BLEU. Note, however, that English and French have similar word order structure, so it would be interesting to experiment with other language pairs, such as English and Chinese, in which the word order is not as monotonic. These harder lan- guage pairs potentially imply a smaller gain for the NoAlign model and a larger gain for the Copyable model. We leave it for future work.</p><p>The positional models (PosAll and PosUnk) im- prove translation performance by more than 2 BLEU points. This proves that the limitation of the copyable model, which forces it to align each un- known output word with an unknown input word, is considerable. In contrast, the positional mod- els can align the unknown target words with any source word, and as a result, post-processing has a much stronger effect. The PosUnk model achieves better translation results than the PosAll model which suggests that it is easier to train the LSTM  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Effect of depths -BLEU scores achieved by PosUnk models of various depths <ref type="bibr">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref>, and 6) before and after the rare word transla- tion. Notice that the PosUnk model is more useful on more accurate models.</p><p>on shorter sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Other Effects</head><p>Deep LSTM architecture -We compare PosUnk models trained with different number of layers (3, 4, and 6). We observe that the gain obtained by the PosUnk model increases in tandem with the overall accuracy of the model, which is consistent with the idea that larger models can point to the ap- propriate source word more accurately. Addition- ally, we observe that on average, each extra LSTM layer provides roughly 1.0 BLEU point improve- ment as demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Perplexity and BLEU -Lastly, we find it inter- esting to observe a strong correlation between the perplexity (our training objective) and the transla- tion quality as measured by BLEU. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref> shows the performance of a 4-layer LSTM, in which we compute both perplexity and BLEU scores at dif- ferent points during training. We find that on aver- age, a reduction of 0.5 perplexity gives us roughly 1.0 BLEU point improvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Sample Translations</head><p>We present three sample translations of our best system (with 37.5 BLEU) in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. In our first example, the model translates all the un- known words correctly: 2600, orthopédiques, and cataracte. It is interesting to observe that the model can accurately predict an alignment of dis- tances of 5 and 6 words. The second example highlights the fact that our model can translate long sentences reasonably well and that it was able to correctly translate the unknown word for JP- Morgan at the very far end of the source sentence. Lastly, our examples also reveal several penalties incurred by our model: (a) incorrect entries in the word dictionary, as with négociateur vs. trader in the second example, and (b) incorrect alignment prediction, such as when unkpos 3 is incorrectly aligned with the source word was and not with abandoning, which resulted in an incorrect trans- lation in the third sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have shown that a simple alignment-based technique can mitigate and even overcome one of the main weaknesses of current NMT systems, which is their inability to translate words that are not in their vocabulary. A key advantage of our technique is the fact that it is applicable to any NMT system and not only to the deep LSTM model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sutskever et al. (2014)</ref>. A technique like ours is likely necessary if an NMT system is to achieve state-of-the-art performance on machine translation.</p><p>We have demonstrated empirically that on the WMT'14 English-French translation task, our technique yields a consistent and substantial im- provement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over various NMT systems of different architectures. Most im- portantly, with 37.5 BLEU points, we have estab- lished the first NMT system that outperformed the best MT system on a WMT'14 contest dataset.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Copyable Model-an annotated example with two types of unknown tokens: "copyable" unk n and null unk ∅ .</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> When a source word has multiple translations, we use the translation with the highest probability. These translation probabilities are estimated from the unsupervised alignment links. When constructing the dictionary from these alignment links, we add a word pair to the dictionary only if its alignment count exceeds 100.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> When the French vocabulary has 40K words, there are on average 1.33 unknown words per sentence on the target side of the test set.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> http://matrix.statmt.org/matrix 5 The tokenizer.perl and multi-bleu.pl scripts are used to tokenize and score translations.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> For the 40K-vocabulary ensemble, we combine 5 models with 4 layers and 3 models with 6 layers. For the 80Kvocabulary ensemble, we combine 3 models with 4 layers and 5 models with 6 layers. Two of the depth-6 models are regularized with dropout, similar to Zaremba et al. (2015) with the dropout probability set to 0.2.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> In this section and in section 5.3, all models are trained on the unreversed sentences, and we use the following hyperparameters: we initialize the parameters uniformly in [-0.1, 0.1], the learning rate is 1, the maximal gradient norm is 1, with a source vocabulary of 90k words, and a target vocabulary of 40k (see Section 4.2 for more details). While these LSTMs do not achieve the best possible performance, it is still useful to analyze them.</note>
