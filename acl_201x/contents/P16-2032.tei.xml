			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper we study how to identify persuasive posts in the online forum discussions , using data from Change My View sub-Reddit. Our analysis confirms that the users&apos; voting score for a comment is highly correlated with its metadata information such as published time and author reputation. In this work, we propose and evaluate other features to rank comments for their persuasive scores, including tex-tual information in the comments and social interaction related features. Our experiments show that the surface textual features do not perform well compared to the argumentation based features, and the social interaction based features are effective especially when more users participate in the discussion.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the popularity of online forums such as ide- bate <ref type="bibr">1</ref> and convinceme <ref type="bibr">2</ref> , researchers have been paying increasing attentions to analyzing per- suasive content, including identification of argu- ing expressions in online debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Trabelsi and Zaıane, 2014</ref>), recognition of stance in ideolog- ical online debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hasan and Ng, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ranade et al., 2013b)</ref>, and debate summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ranade et al., 2013a</ref>). However, how to automatically determine if a text is persuasive is still an unsolved problem.</p><p>Text quality and popularity evaluation has been studied in different domains in the past few years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Louis and Nenkova, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Tan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Park et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Guerini et al., 2015)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> http://idebate.org/ 2 http://convinceme.net quality evaluation of argumentative text in the on- line forum has some unique characterisitcs. First, persuasive text contains argument that is not com- mon in other genres. Second, beside the text it- self, the interplay between a comment and what it responds to is crucial. Third, the community re- action to the comment also needs to be taken into consideration.</p><p>In this paper, we propose several sets of features to capture the above mentioned characteristics for persuasive comment identification in the online fo- rum. We constructed a dataset from a sub-forum of Reddit 3 , namely change my view <ref type="bibr">(CMV)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . We first analyze the corpus and show the correlation between the human voting score for an argumen- tative comment and its entry order and author rep- utation. Then for the comment ranking task, we propose three sets of features including surface text features, social interaction based features and argumentation based features. Our experimental results show that the argumentation based features work the best in the early stage of the discussion and the effectiveness of social interaction features increases when the number of comments in the discussion grows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Dataset and Task</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data</head><p>On CMV, people initiate a discussion thread with a post expressing their thoughts toward a specific topic and other users reply with arguments from the opposite side in order to change the initiator's mind. The writing quality on CVM is quite good since the discussions are monitored by modera- tors. Besides commenting, users can vote on dif- ferent replies to indicate which one is more per- suasive than others. The total amount of upvotes  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,785  Comment #  374,472  Comment # / Thread #  209.79  Author #  32,639  Unique Author # / Thread #  70.67  Delta Awarded Thread #  886 (49.6%</ref>) Delta Awarded Comment # 2,056 (0.5%) <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Statistics of the CMV dataset.</p><p>minus the down votes is called karma, indicating the persuasiveness of the reply. Users can also give delta to a comment if it changes their orig- inal mind about the topic. The comment is then named delta awarded comment (DAC), and the thread containing a DAC is noted as delta awarded thread.</p><p>We use a corpus collected from CMV. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The original corpus contains all the threads published between Jan. 2014 and Jan. 2015. We kept the threads with more than 100 comments to form our experimental dataset <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . The basic statistics of the dataset can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref> shows the distribution of the karma scores in the dataset. We can see that the karma score is highly skewed, similar to what is reported in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Jaech et al., 2015</ref>). 42% of comments obtain a karma score of exactly one (i.e., no votes be- yond the author), and around 15% of comments have a score less than one. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b and 1c</ref> show the correlation of the karma score with two meta- data features, author reputation 7 and entry order, respectively. We can see the karma score of a com- ment is highly related to its entry order. In gen- eral, the earlier a comment is posted, the higher karma score it obtains. The average score is less than one when it is posted after 30 comments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig- ure 1c</ref> shows that authors of comments with higher karma scores tend to have higher reputation on av- erage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Task</head><p>Tan et al. (2016) explored the task of mind change by focusing on delta awarded comments using their CMV data. However, the percentage of delta awarded comments is quite low, as shown in Ta- ble 1 (the percentage of comments obtained delta is as low as 0.5%). In addition, a persuasive com- ment is not necessarily delta awarded. It can be of high quality but does not change other people's mind. Our research thus uses the karma score of a comment, instead of delta, as the reference to represent the persuasiveness of the comment. Our analysis also shows that delta awarded com- ments generally have high karma scores (78.7% of DACs obtain a higher karma score than the median value in each delta awarded thread), indicating the karma score is correlated with the delta value.</p><p>Using karma scores as ground truth, Jaech et al. <ref type="formula">(2015)</ref> proposed a comment ranking task on several sub-forums of Reddit. In order to reduce the impact of timing, they rank each set of 10 connective comments. However, their setting is not suitable for our task. First, at the later stage of the discussion, comments posted connectively in terms of time can belong to different sub-trees of the discussion, and thus can be viewed or re- acted with great difference. Second, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>, comments entered in later stage obtain little attention from audience. This makes their karma scores less reliable as the ground-truth of persuasiveness.</p><p>To further control the factor of timing, we define the task as ranking the first-N comments in each thread. The final karma scores of these N com- ments are used to determine their reference rank for evaluation. We study two setups for this rank- ing task. First we use information until the time point when the thread contains only these N com- ments. Second we allow the system to access more comments than N . Our goal is to investigate if we can predict whether a comment is persuasive and how the community reacts to a comment in the fu- ture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Ranking Model</head><p>A pair-wise learning-to-rank model <ref type="bibr">(Ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002)</ref>) is used in our task. We first construct the training set including pairs of comments. In each pair, the first comment is more persuasive than the second one. Considering that two samples with similar karma scores might not be significantly different in terms of their persua- siveness, we propose to use a modified score to form training pairs in order to improve the learn- ing efficacy. We group comments into 7 buckets based on their karma scores, [-∞, 0], (0, 1], <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr">50]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(50, +∞]</ref>. We then use the bucket number (0 -6) of each comment 196  as its modified score. We use all the formed pairs to train our ranker. In order to be consistent, we use the first-N comments in the training threads to construct the training samples to predict the rank for the first-N comments in a test thread.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Features</head><p>We propose several key features that we hypoth- esize are predictive of persuasive comments. The full feature list is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>• Surface Text Features 8 : In order to capture the basic textual information, we use the comment length and content diversity represented as the number of words, POS tags, URLs, and punctu- ation marks. We also explored unigram features and named entity based features, but they did not improve system performance and are thus not included.</p><p>• Social Interaction Features: We hypothesize that if a comment attracts more social attention from the community, it is more likely to be per- suasive, therefore we propose several social in- teraction features to capture the community re- action to a comment. Besides the reply tree gen- erated by the comment, we also consider the re- ply tree generated by the root comment 9 for fea- ture computing. The tree size is the number of comments in the reply tree. The position of c is its level in the reply tree (the level of root node is zero).</p><p>• Argumentation Related Features: We believe a comment's argumentation quality is a good in- dicator of its persuasiveness. In order to cap- ture the argumentation related information, we propose two sub-groups of features based on the comment itself and the interplay between the comment and other comments in the discus- sion. a) Local features: we trained a binary classifier to classify sentences as argumentative and non-argumentative using features proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Stab and Gurevych, 2014</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Performance of first-10 comments rank- ing (T+S+A: the combination of the three sets of features we proposed; all: the combination of two meta-data features and our features; bold: the best performance in each column; †: the approach is significantly better than both metadata baselines (p &lt;0.01); ‡: the approach is significantly better than LTR approaches using a single category of features (p &lt;0.01).).</p><p>tences predicted by the classifier as features. Besides, we include some features used in the classifier directly (i.e. number of connective words <ref type="bibr">10</ref> and modal verbs). b) Interactive fea- tures: for these features, we consider the simi- larity of a comment and its parent comment, the original post, and all the previously published comments. We use cosine similarity computed based on the term frequency vector representa- tion. Intuitively a comment needs to be relevant to the discussed topic and possibly have some original convincing opinions or arguments to re- ceive a high karma score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Results</head><p>We use 5-fold cross-validation in our experiments. Normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) score <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Järvelin and Kekäläinen, 2000</ref>) is used as the evaluation metric for our First-N comments ranking task. In this study, N is10. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the results for first-10 comments ranking using information from only these 10 comments. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, metadata fea- tures, entry order and author's reputation are cor- related with the karma score of a comment. We thus use these two values as baselines. We also include the performance of the random baseline for comparison <ref type="bibr">11</ref> . For our ranking based models (LTR * ), we compare using the three sets of fea- tures described in Section. 3.2 (noted as text, so- cial and arg respectively), individually or in com- bination. We report NDCG scores for position 1, 5 and 10 respectively. The followings are some findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiment I: Using N Comments for Ranking</head><p>• Both metadata based baselines generate signif- icantly <ref type="bibr">12</ref> better results compared to the random baseline. Baseline entry-order performs much better than author, suggesting that the entry or- der is more indicative for the karma score of a comment.</p><p>• The surface text features are least effective among the three sets of features, and the per- formance using them is even worse than the two metadata baselines. This might be because the general writing quality of the comments in CMV is high because of the policy of the forum. Therefore, the surface text features we used are not very discriminative for comment ranking. A further analysis of features in this category shows that length is the most effective feature.</p><p>• Argumentation based features have the best per- formance among the three categories. Its per- formance is significantly better than surface text features, consistent with our expectation that ar- gumentation related features are useful for per- suasiveness evaluation. Our additional experi- ments show that interactive features are more effective than local features. This might be be- cause the argumentation features and models we use are not perfect. Future research is still needed to better represent argumentation infor- mation in the text.</p><p>• When combining two categories of features, the performance of the ranker increases con- sistently. The performance can be further im- proved by combining all the three categories of features we proposed (the improvement com- pared to using a single feature category is signif- icant). The best results are achieved by LTR all , i.e., combining two metadata features and fea- tures we proposed. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The performance of random baseline is high because of the tie of reference karma scores. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Significance is computed by two tailed t-test.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Results using various number of com- ments in the thread for ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experiment II: Using Varying Numbers of Comments for Ranking</head><p>With the evolving discussion, there will be more comments joining the thread providing more in- formation for social interaction based features. In order to show the impact of different features at different discussion stage, we conduct another ex- periment by ranking first-10 comments with vary- ing numbers of comments in the test thread for fea- ture computing. The result of the experiment is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The performance of LTR text and LTR arg remain the same since their feature values are not affected by the new coming com- ments. The performance of LTR social increases consistently when the number of comments grows, and it outperforms LTR arg when the number of comments is more than 20. LTR T +S+A has always the best performance, benefiting from the combi- nation of different types of features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Our work is most related to two lines of work, including text quality evaluation and research on Reddit.com. Text quality: Text quality and popularity eval- uation has been studied in different domains in the past few years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Louis and Nenkova (2013)</ref> imple- mented features to capture aspects of great writing in science journalism domain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Tan et al. (2014)</ref> looked into the effect of wording while predict- ing the popularity of social media content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Park et al. (2016)</ref> developed an interactive system to as- sist human moderators to select high quality news. <ref type="bibr">Guerini et al. (2015)</ref> modeled a notion of euphony and explored the impact of sounds on different forms of persuasiveness. Their research focused on the phonetic aspect instead of language usage.</p><p>Reddit based research: Reddit has been used recently for research on social news analysis and recommendation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buntain and Golbeck, 2014)</ref>). Researchers also analyzed the language use on Reddit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Jaech et al. (2015)</ref> studied how language use affects community reaction to com- ments in Reddit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tan et al. (2016)</ref> analyzed the interaction dynamics and persuasion strategies in CMV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we studied the impact of different sets of features on the identification of persuasive comments in the online forum. Our experiment re- sults show that argumentation based features work the best in the early stage of the discussion, while the effectiveness of social interaction based fea- tures increases when the number of comments in the thread grows.</p><p>There are three major future directions for this research. First, the approach for argument mod- eling in this paper is lexical based, which limits the effectiveness of argumentation related features for our task. It is thus crucial to study more ef- fective ways for argument modeling. Second, we will explore persuasion behavior of the argumen- tative comments and study the correlation between the strength of the argument and different persua- sion behaviors. Third, we plan to automatically construct an argumentation corpus including pairs of arguments from two opposite sides of the topic from CMV, and use this for automatic disputing argument generation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Karma value distributions in the CMV dataset.
