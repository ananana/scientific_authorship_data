				<p>Frames defined in FrameNet (FN) share highly similar structures with events in ACE event extraction program. An event in ACE is composed of an event trigger and a set of arguments. Analogously, a frame in FN is composed of a lexical unit and a set of frame elements, which play similar roles as triggers and arguments of ACE events respectively. Besides having similar structures, many frames in FN actually express certain types of events. The above observations motivate us to explore whether there exists a good mapping from frames to event-types and if it is possible to improve event detection by using FN. In this paper, we propose a global inference approach to detect events in FN. Further , based on the detected results, we analyze possible mappings from frames to event-types. Finally, we improve the performance of event detection and achieve a new state-of-the-art result by using the events automatically detected from FN.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the ACE (Automatic Context Extraction) even- t extraction program, an event is represented as a structure consisting of an event trigger and a set of arguments. This paper tackles with the event de- tection (ED) task, which is a crucial component in the overall task of event extraction. The goal of ED is to identify event triggers and their correspond- ing event types from the given documents.</p><p>FrameNet (FN) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fillmore et al., 2003</ref>) is a linguistic resource storing con- siderable information about lexical and predicate- argument semantics. In FN, a frame is defined as a composition of a Lexical Unit (LU) and a set of Frame Elements (FE). Most frames contain a set of exemplars with annotated LUs and FEs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> and Section 2.2 for details).</p><p>From the above definitions of events and frames, it is not hard to find that the frames defined in FN share highly similar structures as the events defined in ACE. Firstly, the LU of a Frame plays a similar role as the trigger of an event. ACE de- fines the trigger of an event as the word or phrase which most clearly expresses an event occurrence. For example, the following sentence "He died in the hospital." expresses a Die event, whose trig- ger is the word died. Analogously, the LU of a frame is also the word or phrase which is capa- ble of indicating the occurrence of the expressed semantic frame. For example, the sentence "Aero- planes bombed London." expresses an Attack 1 frame, whose LU is the word bombed. Secondly, the FEs of a frame also play similar roles as argu- ments of an event. Both of them indicate the par- ticipants involved in the corresponding frame or event. For example, in the first sentence, He and hospital are the arguments, and in the second sen- tence, Aeroplanes and London are the FEs.</p><p>Besides having similar structure as events, many frames in FN actually express certain type- s of events defined in ACE. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fining Fine</head><p>The court fined her $40.</p><p>Execution Execute He was executed yesterday. The aforementioned observations motivate us to explore: (1) whether there exists a good mapping from frames to event-types, and (2) whether it is possible to improve ED by using FN.</p><p>Figure 1: Our framework for detecting events in FN (including training and detecting processes).</p><p>For the first issue, we investigate whether a frame could be mapped to an event-type based on events expressed by exemplars annotated for that frame. Therefore the key is to detect events from the given exemplar sentences in FN. To achieve this goal, we propose a global inference approach (see <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>). We firstly learn a basic ED model based on the ACE labeled corpus and employ it to yield initial judgements for each sentence in FN. Then, we apply a set of soft constraints for global inference based on the following hypotheses: 1). Sentences belonging to the same LU tend to ex- press events of the same type; 2). Sentences be- longing to related frames tend to express events of the same type; 3). Sentences belonging to the same frame tend to express events of the same type. All of the above constraints and initial judgments are formalized as first-order logic formulas and mod- eled by Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kimmig et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bach et al., 2013</ref>). Finally, we obtain the final results via PSL-based global inference. We conduct both manual and automatic evalua- tions for the detected results.</p><p>For the second issue, ED generally suffer- s from data sparseness due to lack of labeled samples. Some types, such as Nominate and Extradite, contain even less than 10 labeled samples. Apparently, from such a small scale of training data is difficult to yield a satisfying perfor- mance. We notice that ACE corpus only contains about 6,000 labeled instances, while FN contains more than 150,000 exemplars. Thus, a straightfor- ward solution to alleviate the data sparseness prob- lem is to expand the ACE training data by using events detected from FN. The experimental result- s show that events from FN significantly improve the performance of the event detection task. To sum up, our main contributions are: (1) To our knowledge, this is the first work perform- ing event detection over ACE and FN to explore the relationships between frames and events. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2)</ref> We propose a global inference approach to detect events in FN, which is demonstrated very effective by our experiments. Moreover, based on the de- tected results, we analyze possible mappings from frames to event-types (all the detecting and map- ping results are released for further use by the NLP community 2 ). (3) We improve the performance of event detection significantly and achieve a new state-of-the-art result by using events automatical- ly detected from FN as extra training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">ACE Event Extraction</head><p>In ACE evaluations, an event is defined as a specif- ic occurrence involving several participants. ACE event evaluation includes 8 types of events, with 33 subtypes. Following previous work, we treat them simply as 33 separate event types and ignore the hierarchical structure among them. In this pa- per, we use the ACE 2005 corpus 3 in our experi- ments. It contains 599 documents, which include about 6,000 labeled events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">FrameNet</head><p>The FrameNet is a taxonomy of manually identi- fied semantic frames for English <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows the hierarchy of FN corpus. Listed in the FN with each frame are a set of lemmas with part of speech (i.e "invade.v") that can evoke the frame, which are called lexical units (LUs). Accompany- ing most LUs in the FN is a set of exemplars anno- tated for them. Moreover, there are a set of labeled relations between frames, such as Inheritance.</p><p>FN contains more than 1,000 various frames and 10,000 LUs with 150,000 annotated exem- plars. Eight relations are defined between frames in FN, but in this paper we only use the following three of them because the others do not satisfy our hypotheses (see section 4.2): Inheritance: A inherited from B indicates that A must correspond to an equally or more specific fact about B. It is a directional relation. See also: A and B connected by this relation indi- cates that they are similar frames. Perspective on: A and B connected by this relation means that they are different points-of-view about the same fact (i.e. Receiving vs. Transfer).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Related Work</head><p>Event extraction is an increasingly hot and chal- lenging research topic in NLP. Many approaches have been proposed for this task. Nearly all the ex- isting methods on ACE event task use supervised paradigm. We further divide them into feature- based methods and representation-based methods.</p><p>In feature-based methods, a diverse set of s- trategies has been exploited to convert classifica- tion clues into feature vectors. Ahn (2006) us- es the lexical features(e.g., full word), syntactic features (e.g., dependency features) and external- knowledge features <ref type="bibr">(WordNet (Miller, 1995)</ref>) to extract the event. Inspired by the hypothesis of One Sense Per Discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Yarowsky, 1995)</ref>, Ji and Grishman (2008) combined global evidence from related documents with local decisions for the event extraction. To capture more clues from the texts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gupta and Ji (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Liao and Grishman (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hong et al. (2011)</ref> proposed the cross- event and cross-entity inference for the ACE even- t task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al. (2013)</ref> proposed a joint model to capture the combinational features of triggers and arguments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liu et al. (2016)</ref> proposed a global in- ference approach to employ both latent local and global information for event detection.</p><p>In representation-based methods, candidate event mentions are represented by embedding, which typically are fed into neural networks. T- wo similarly related work has been proposed on event detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nguyen and Grishman, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nguyen and Grishman (2015)</ref> em- ployed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically extract sentence-level features for event detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2015)</ref> proposed dy- namic multi-pooling operation on CNNs to cap- ture better sentence-level features.</p><p>FrameNet is a typical resource for frame- semantic parsing, which consists of the resolution of predicate sense into a frame, and the analy- sis of the frame's participants ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Thompson et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hermann et al., 2014;</ref>). Other tasks which have been studied based on FN include question an- swering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shen and Lapata, 2007)</ref>, textual entailment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burchardt et al., 2009</ref>) and paraphrase recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Padó and Lapata, 2005</ref>). This is the first work to explore the application of FN to event detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Basic Event Detection Model</head><p>Alike to existing work, we model event detection (ED) as a word classification task. In the ED task, each word in the given sentence is treated as a can- didate trigger and the goal is to classify each of these candidates into one of 34 classes (33 event types plus a NA class). However, in this work, as we assumed that the LU of a frame is analogical to the trigger of an event, we only treat the LU anno- tated in the given sentence as a trigger candidate. Each sentence in FN only contains one candidate trigger, thus "the candidate" denotes both the can- didate trigger of a sentence and the sentence itself for FN in the remainder of this paper. Another no- table difference is that we train the detection mod- el on one corpus (ACE) but apply it on another (FN). That means our task is also a cross-domain problem. To tackle with it, our basic ED approach follows representation-based paradigm, which has been demonstrated effective in the cross-domain situation (Nguyen and Grishman, 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model</head><p>We employ a simple three-layer (a input layer, a hidden layer and a soft-max output layer) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hagan et al., 1996</ref>) to model the ED task. In our model, adjacent layers are fully connected.</p><p>Word embeddings learned from large amount of unlabeled data have been shown to be able to cap- ture the meaningful semantic regularities of words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bengio et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Erhan et al., 2010)</ref>. This pa- per uses unsupervised learned word embeddings as the source of base features. We use the Skip- gram model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) to learn word embeddings on the NYT corpus <ref type="bibr">5</ref> .</p><p>Given a sentence, we concatenate the embed- ding vector of the candidate trigger and the aver- age embedding vector of the words in the sentence as the input to our model. We train the model using a simple optimization technique called stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over shuffled mini-batches with the Adadelta update rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Zeiler, 2012)</ref>. Reg- ularization is implemented by a dropout <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hinton et al., 2012)</ref>. The experiments show that this simple model is surprisingly effective for event detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Event Detection in FrameNet</head><p>To detect events in FN, we first learned the basic ED model based on ACE labeled corpus and then employ it to generate initial judgements (possible event types with confidence values) for each sen- tence in FN. Then, we apply a set of constraints for global inference based on the PSL model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Probabilistic Soft Logic</head><p>PSL is a framework for collective, probabilistic reasoning in relational domains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kimmig et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bach et al., 2013</ref>). Similar to Markov Log- ic Networks (MLNs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Richardson and Domingos, 2006</ref>), it uses weighted first-order logic formulas to compactly encode complex undirected proba- bilistic graphical models. However, PSL brings t- wo remarkable advantages compared with MLNs. First, PSL relaxes the boolean truth values of MLNs to continuous, soft truth values. This allows for easy integration of continuous values, such as similarity scores. Second, PSL restricts the syntax of first order formulas to that of rules with con- junctive bodies. Together with the soft truth values constraint, the inference in PSL is a convex op- timization problem in continuous space and thus can be solved using efficient inference approach- es. For further details, see the references ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kimmig et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bach et al., 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Global Constraints</head><p>Our global inference approach is based on the following three hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Same Frame Same Event</head><p>This hypothesis indicates that sentences under the same frame tend to express events of the same type. For example, all exemplars annotated for the frame Rape express events of type Attack, and all sentences under the frame Clothing express NA (none) events. With this hypothesis, sentences annotated for the same frame help each other to infer their event types during global inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: Related Frame Same Event</head><p>This hypothesis is an extension of H1, which relaxes "the same frame" constraint to "related frames". In this paper, frames are considered to be related if and only if they are connected by one of the following three relations: Inheritance, See also and Perspective on (see section 2.2). For example, the frame Invading is inherited from Attack, and they actually express the same type of event, Attack. With this hypothesis, sentences under related frames help each other to infer their event types during global inference.</p><p>The previous two hypotheses are basically true for most frames but not perfect. For example, for the frame Dead or alive, only a few of the sentences under it express Die events while the remainder do not. To amend the this flaw, we in- troduce the third hypothesis. On the other hand, the first two hypotheses al- so help H3 in some cases. For example, most of the sentences belonging to the LU suit.n under the frame Clothing are misidentified as Sue events due to the ambiguity of the word "suit". However, in this situation, H1 can help to rectify it because the majority of LUs under Clothing are not am- biguous words. Thus, under the first hypothesis, the misidentified results are expected to be correct- ed by the the results of other exemplars belonging to Clothing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Inference</head><p>To model the above hypotheses as logic formulas in PSL, we introduce a set of predicates (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Ta- ble 2)</ref>, which are grouped into two categories: ob- served predicates and target predicates. Observed predicates are used to encode evidences, which are always assumed to be known during the inference, while target predicates are unknown and thus need to be predicted.</p><p>CandEvt <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">sf (c 1 , c 2 )</ref>, which is defined as follows:</p><note type="other">(c, t) is introduced to represen- t conf (c, t), which is the confidence value gener- ated by the basic ED model for classifying the can- didate c as an event of the type t. SameF r(c 1 , c 2 ) indicates whether the candidates c 1 and c 2 belong to the same frame. It is initialized by the indicator function I</note><formula xml:id="formula_0">I sf (c 1 , c 2 ) = 1 c 1 , c 2 from the same frame 0 otherwise (1)</formula><p>SameLU (c 1 , c 2 ) is similar, but applies for candi- dates under the same LU. The last three observed predicates in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> are used to encode the afore- mentioned semantic relations between frames. For example, Inherit(c 1 , c 2 ) indicates whether the frame of c 1 is inherited from that of c 2 , and it is initialized by the indicator function I ih (c 1 , c 2 ), which is set to 1 if and only if the frame of c 1 is inherited from that of c 2 , otherwise 0. Evt(c, t) is the only target predicate, which indicates that the candidate c triggers an event of type t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type</head><p>Predicate Assignment  Putting all the predicates together, we design a set of formulas to apply the aforementioned hy- potheses in PSL (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Formula f 1 con- nects the target predicate with the initial judge- ments from the basic ED model. Formulas f 2 and f 3 respectively encode H1 and H3. Finally, the re- maining formulas are designed for various rela- tions between frames in H2. We tune the formu- las's weights via grid search (see Section 5.4). The inference results provide us with the most likely </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I sf (c 1 , c 2 ) SameLU (c 1 , c 2 ) I sl (c 1 , c 2 ) Inherit(c 1 , c 2 ) I ih (c 1 , c 2 ) SeeAlso(c 1 , c 2 ) I sa (c 1 , c 2 ) P erspect(c 1 , c 2 ) I pe (c 1 , c 2 ) Target Evt(c, t) -</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">f 1 CandEvt(c, t) → Evt(c, t) f 2 SameF r(c 1 , c 2 ) ∧ Evt(c 1 , t) → Evt(c 2 , t) f 3 SameLU (c 1 , c 2 ) ∧ Evt(c 1 , t) → Evt(c 2 , t) f 4 Inherit(c 1 , c 2 ) ∧ Evt(c 1 , t) → Evt(c 2 , t) f 5</formula><p>SeeAlso(c 1 , c 2 ) ∧ Evt(c 1 , t) → Evt(c 2 , t) f 6 P erspect(c 1 , c 2 ) ∧ Evt(c 1 , t) → Evt(c 2 , t) <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Formulas in the PSL model interpretation, that is, the soft-truth values of the predicate Evt. The final detected event type t of candidate c is decided by the the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t = argmax t Evt(c, t )<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluations</head><p>In this section, we present the experiments and the results achieved. We first manually evaluate our novel PSL-based ED model on the FN corpus. Then, we also conduct automatic evaluations for the events detected from FN based on ACE cor- pus. Finally, we analyze possible mappings from frames/LUs to event types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data</head><p>We learned the basic ED model on ACE2005 dataset. In order to evaluate the learned model, we followed the evaluation of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al., 2013)</ref>: ran- domly selected 30 articles from different genres as the development set, and we subsequently con- ducted a test on a separate set of 40 ACE 2005 newswire documents. We used the remaining 529 articles as the training data set. We apply our proposed PSL-based approach to detect events in FrameNet. Via collecting al- l exemplars annotated in FN, we totally obtain 154,484 sentences for detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Setup and Performance of Basic Model</head><p>We have presented the basic ED model in Section 3. Hyperparameters were tuned by grid search on the development data set. In our experiments, we set the size of the hidden layer to 300, the size of word embedding to 200, the batch size to 100 and the dropout rate to 0.5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the experimental results, from which we can see that the three-layer ANN model is surprisingly effective for event detection, which even yields competitive results compared with N- guyen's CNN and Chen's DMCNN. We believe the reason is that, compared with CNN and DMCNN,</p></div>

The result shows that randomly initialized word embeddings decrease the F 1 score by 7.3 (61.5 vs. 68.8). The main reasons are: 1). ACE corpus only contains 599 articles, which are far insufficient to train good embeddings. 2). Words only existing in the test dataset always retain random embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Baselines</head><p>For comparison, we designed four baseline sys- tems that utilize different hypotheses to detec- t events in FN.</p><p>(1) ANN is the first baseline, which directly uses a basic ED model learned on ACE training corpus to detect events in FN.

For each frame, we introduce a score function φ(f, t) to estimate the probability that the frame f could be mapped to the event type t as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">φ(f, t) = 1 ||S f || c∈S f I(c, t)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where S f is the set of sentences under the frame f ; I(c, t) is an indicator function which is true if and only if ANN predicts the candidate c as an event of type t. Then for each frame f satisfying φ(f, t) &gt; α, we mapped it to event type t, where α is a hyperparameter. Finally, all sentences under mapped frames are labeled as events. Note that, unlike the PSL-based approach which applies con- straints as soft rules, this system utilizes H1 as a hard constraint. (3) RelatedFrame (RF) is the third baseline sys- tem, which applies H2 over the results from AN- N. For each frame f , we merge it and its related frames into a super frame, f . Similar with SF, a score function ζ(f , t), which shares the same expression to equation 3, is introduced. For the merged frame satisfying ζ(f , t) &gt; β, we mapped it to the event type t. Finally, all sentences under f are labeled as events.</p><p>(4) SameLU (SL) is the last baseline, which ap- plies the hypothesis H3 over the results from ANN. Also, a score function ψ(l, t) is introduced:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ψ(l, t) = 1 ||S l || c∈S l I(c, t)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where S l is the set of sentences under the LU l. For each LU satisfying ψ(l, t) &gt; γ, we mapped it to the event type t. Finally, all sentences under l are labeled as events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Manual Evaluations</head><p>In this section, we manually evaluate the precision of the baseline systems and our proposed PSL- based approach. For fair comparison, we set α, β and γ to 0.32, 0.29 and 0.42 respectively to en- sure they yield approximately the same amount of events as the first baseline system ANN. We tune the weights of formulas in PSL via grid search by using ACE development dataset. In details, we firstly detect events in FN under different config- urations of formulas' weights and add them to ACE training dataset, respectively. Consequent- ly, we obtain several different expanded training datasets. Then, we separately train a set of basic ED models based on each of these training dataset- s and evaluate them over the development corpus. Finally, the best weights are selected according to their performances on the development dataset. The weights of f 1 ¬f 5 used in this work are 100, 10, 100, 5, 5 and 1, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manual Annotations</head><p>Firstly, we randomly select 200 samples from the results of each system. Each selected sample is a sentence with a highlighted trigger and a predicted event type. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> illustrates three samples. The first line of each sample is a sentence labeled with the trigger. The next line is the predicted event type of that sentence. Annotators are asked to as- sign one of two labels to each sample (annotating in the third line): Y: the word highlighted in the given sentence indeed triggers an event of the predicted type.</p><p>N: the word highlighted in the given sentence does not trigger any event of the predicted type. We can see that, it is very easy to annotate a sam- ple for annotators, thus the annotated results are expected to be of high quality. To make the annotation more credible, each sample is independently annotated by three anno- tators 7 (including one of the authors and two of our colleagues who are familiar with ACE event task) and the final decision is made by voting. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> shows the results of manual evaluations. Through the comparison of ANN and SF, we can see that the application of H1 caused a loss of 5.5 point. It happens mainly because the performance of SF is very sensitive to the wrongly mapped frames. That is, if a frame is mismapped, then all sentences under it would be mislabeled as events. Thus, even a single mismapped frame could sig- nificantly hurt the performance. This result also proves that H1 is inappropriate to be used as a hard constraint. As H2 is only an extension of H1, RF performs similarly with SF. Moreover, SL obtains a gain of 2.0% improvement compared with ANN, which demonstrates that the "same LU" hypoth- esis is very useful. Finally, with all the hypothe- ses, the PSL-based approach achieves the best per- formance, which demonstrates that our hypotheses are useful and it is an effective way to jointly uti- lize them as soft constraints through PSL for event detection in FN.</p></div>

Compared with ACE- ANN-FN, events from SF and RF hurt the perfor- mance. As analyzed in previous section, SF and R- F yield quite a few false events, which dramatical- ly hurt the accuracy. Moreover, ACE-SL-FN ob- tains a score of 70.3% in F 1 measure, which out- performs ACE-ANN-FN. This result illustrates the effectiveness of our "same LU" hypothesis. Final- ly and most importantly, consistent with the results of manual evaluations, ACE-PSL-FN performs the best, which further proves the effectiveness of our proposed approach for event detection in FN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Improving Event Detection Using FN</head><p>Event detection generally suffers from data sparse- ness due to lack of labeled samples. In this section, we investigate the effects of alleviating the afore- mentioned problem by using the events detected from FN as extra training data. Our investigation is conducted by the comparison of two basic ED models, ANN and ANN-FN: the former is trained on ACE training corpus and the latter is trained on the new training corpus ACE-PSL-FN (introduced in the previous section), which contains 3,816 ex- tra events detected from FN.</p></div>

Com- pared with ANN, ANN-FN achieves a significant improvement of 1.9% in F 1 measure. It happens mainly because that the high accurate extra train- ing data makes the model obtain a higher recall (from 60.7% to 65.2%) with less decrease of pre- cision (from 79.5% to 77.6%). The result demon- strates the effectiveness of alleviating the data s- parseness problem of ED by using events detect- ed from FN. Moreover, compared with state-of- the-art methods, ANN-FN outperforms all of them with remarkable improvements (more than 1.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Analysis of Frame-Event Mapping</head><p>In this section, we illustrate the details of map- pings from frames to event types. The mapping pairs are obtained by computing the function φ (see Section 5.3) for each (frame, event-type) pair (f , t) based on the events detected by the PSL- based approach. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 8</ref> presents the top 10 map- pings. We manually evaluate their quality by in- vestigating: (1) whether the definition of each frame is compatible with its mapped event type; (2) whether exemplars annotated for each frame actually express events of its mapped event type.</p><p>For the first issue, we manually compare the definitions of each mapped pair. Excep- t Relational nat features 8 , definitions of all the mapped pairs are compatible. For the sec- ond issue, we randomly sample 20 exemplars (if possible) from each frame and manually annotate them. Except the above frame and Invading, exemplars of the remaining frames all express the right events. The only exemplar of Invading failing to express its mapped event is as follows: "The invasion of China by western culture has had a number of far-reaching effects on Confucianis- m." ACE requires an Attack event to be a phys- ical act, while the invasion of culture is unphysi- cal. Thus, the above sentence does not express an <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The full name is Relational natural relations in FN.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Analysis of LU-Event Mapping</head><p>This section illustrates the details of mappings from LUs to event types. The mapping pairs are obtained by computing the function ψ (see Section 5.3).  ally annotate the exemplars under these LUs. The result shows that all exemplars are rightly mapped. These mappings are quite good. We believe the reason is that an LU is hardly ambiguous due to its high specificity, which is not only specified by a lemma but also by a frame and a part of speech tag. <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 9</ref> only presents the top 10 mappings. In fact, we obtain 54 mappings in total with ψ = 1.0. We released all the detected events and mapping results for further use by the NLP community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Motivated by the high similarity between frames and events, we conduct this work to study their relations. The key of this research is to detec- t events in FN. To solve this problem, we proposed a PSL-based global inference approach based on three hypotheses between frames and events. For evaluation, we first conduct manual evaluations on events detected from FN. The results reveal that our hypotheses are very useful and it is an effective way to jointly utilize them as soft rules through P- SL. In addition, we also perform automatic evalu- ations. The results further demonstrate the effec- tiveness of our proposed approach for detecting events in FN. Furthermore, based on the detected results, we analyze the mappings from frames/LUs to event types. Finally, we alleviate the data s- parseness problem of ED by using events detected from FN as extra training data. Consequently, we obtain a remarkable improvement and achieve a new state-of-the-art result for the ED task.</p><p>Event detection is only a component of the over- all task of event extraction, which also includes event role detection. In the future, we will ex- tend this work to the complete event extraction task. Furthermore, event schemas in ACE are quite coarse. For example, all kinds of violent acts, such as street fights and wars, are treated as a single event type Attack. We plan to refine the event schemas by the finer-grained frames defined in FN (i.e. Attack may be divided into Terrorism, Invading, etc.).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The hierarchy of FN corpus, where each S k under a LU is a exemplar annotated for that LU.

based on the intuition that events with higher ac-
