			<abstract>
				<p>Most cross-lingual sentiment classification (CLSC) research so far has been performed at sentence or document level. Aspect-level CLSC, which is more appropriate for many applications, presents the additional difficulty that we consider sub-sentential opinionated units which have to be mapped across languages. In this paper , we extend the possible cross-lingual sentiment analysis settings to aspect-level specific use cases. We propose a method, based on constrained SMT, to transfer opinionated units across languages by preserving their boundaries. We show that cross-language sentiment classifiers built with this method achieve comparable results to monolingual ones, and we compare different cross-lingual settings.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sentiment analysis (SA) is the task of analysing opinions, sentiments or emotions expressed to- wards entities such as products, services, organi- sations, issues, and the various attributes of these entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Liu, 2012)</ref>. The analysis may be per- formed at the level of a document (blog post, re- view) or sentence. However, this is not appropriate for many applications because the same document or sentence can contain positive opinions towards specific aspects and negative ones towards other aspects. Thus a finer analysis can be conducted at the level of the aspects of the entities towards which opinions are expressed, identifying for each opinionated unit elements such as its target, polar- ity and the polar words used to qualify the target.</p><p>The two main SA approaches presented in the literature are (i) a machine learning approach, mostly supervised learning with features such as opinion words, dependency information, opinion shifters and quantifiers and (ii) a lexicon-based ap- proach, based on rules involving opinion words and phrases, opinion shifters, contrary clauses (but), etc. Thus in most SA systems we may dis- tinguish three types of resources and text:</p><p>TRAIN Resources (collection of training exam- ples, lexicons) used to train the classifier.</p><p>TEST Opinions to be analysed.</p><p>OUT Outcome of the analysis. It depends on the level of granularity. At the document or sentence level, it is the polarity of each document or sen- tence. At the aspect level, it may the set of opinion targets with their polarity.</p><p>The internet multilingualism and the globalisa- tion of products and services create situations in which these three types of resources are not all in the same language. In these situations, a lan- guage transfer is needed at some point to perform the SA analysis or to understand its results, thus called cross-lingual sentiment analysis (CLSA).</p><p>Sentences or documents are handy granularity levels for CLSA because the labels are not related to specific tokens and thus are not affected by a language transfer. At the aspect level, labels are attached to a specific opinionated unit formed by a sequence of tokens. When transferring these an- notations into another language, the opinionated units in the two languages have thus to be mapped.</p><p>This paper is one of the first ones to address CLSA at aspect level (see Section 3). It makes the following specific contributions:</p><p>(i) an extended definition of CLSA including use cases and settings specific to aspect-level analyses (Section 2);</p><p>(ii) a method to perform the language transfer preserving the opinionated unit boundaries. This avoids the need of mapping source and target opinionated units after the language transfer via methods such as word alignment (Section 4);</p><p>The paper also reports (in Section 5) experiments comparing different settings described in Sec- tion 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Use Cases and Settings</head><p>We can think of the following use cases for CLSA: Use case I. There are opinions we want to ana- lyse, but we do not avail of a SA system to perform this analysis. We thus want to predict the polarity of opinions expressed in a language L T EST us- ing a classifier in another language L T RAIN . We can assume that the language L OU T of the analysis outcome 1 is the same as the one of the opinions. In this case, equation 1 applies, yielding CLSA set- tings a and b as follows (see also <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L T RAIN = L T EST ; L OU T = L T EST (1)</formula><p>(a) available training resources are transferred into the test language to build a classifier in the test language.</p><p>(b) we translate the test into the language of the classifier, classify the opinions in the test, and then transfer back the analysis outcome into the source language by projecting the labels or/and opinion- ated units onto the test set.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(a) TRAIN TRAIN L T EST TEST OUT L T EST T SA L T EST Learn (b) TEST OUT L T EST TEST L T RAIN OUT L T RAIN T SA L T RAIN</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>The main CLSC approaches described in the liter- ature are via lexicon transfer, via corpus transfer, via test translation and via joint classification. In the lexicon transfer approach, a source senti- ment lexicon is transferred into the target language and a lexicon-based classifier is build in the tar- get language. Approaches to transfer lexica in- clude machine translation (MT) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mihalcea et al., 2007</ref>), Wordnet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Banea et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hassan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Perez-Rosas et al., 2012)</ref>, relations between dictionaries represented in graphs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Scheible et al., 2010)</ref>, or triangulation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Steinberger et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>The corpus transfer approach consists of trans- ferring a source training corpus into the target lan- guage and building a corpus-based classifier in the target language. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Banea et al. (2008)</ref> follow this approach, translating an annotated corpus via MT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balamurali et al.

This may not be true at aspect level, in which the annota- tion cost is much higher. In any case, when the skills to build such annotated resources are lack- ing, CLSA may be the only option. In language pairs in which no high-quality MT systems are available, MT may not be an appropriate trans- fer method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Popat et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balamurali et al., 2012</ref>). However, Balahur and Turchi (2014) con- clude that MT systems can be used to build senti- ment analysis systems that can obtain comparable performances to the one obtained for English.</p><p>All this work was performed at sentence or doc- ument level.  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lin et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Language Transfer</head><p>In aspect-level SA, there may be several opinion- ated segments in each sentence. When perform- ing a language transfer, each segment in the target language has to be mapped to its corresponding segment in the source language. This may not be an obvious task at all. For example, if a standard MT system is used for language translation, the source opinionated segment may be reordered and split in several parts in the target language. Then the different parts have to be mapped to the orig- inal segment with a method such as word align- ment, which may introduce errors and may leave some parts without a corresponding segment in the source language. To avoid these problems, we could translate only the opinionated segments, in- dependently of each other. However, the context of these segments, which may be useful for some applications, would then be lost. Furthermore, the translation quality would be worse than when the segments are translated within the whole sentence context.</p><p>To solve these problems, we translate the whole sentences but with reordering constraints ensur- ing that the opinionated segments are preserved during translation. That is, the text between the relevant segment boundaries is not reordered nor mixed with the text outside these boundaries. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Thus the text in the target language segment comes only from the corresponding source language seg- ment. We use the Moses statistical MT (SMT) toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Koehn et al., 2007)</ref> to perform the trans- lation. In Moses, these reordering constraints are implemented with the zone and wall tags, as in- dicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. Moses also allows mark-up to be directly passed to the translation, via the x tag. We use this functionality to keep track, via the tags &lt;ou <ref type="bibr">[id]</ref>[-label]&gt; and &lt;/ou[id]&gt;, of the segment boundaries (ou stands for Opinion- ated Unit), of the opinionated segment identifier ( <ref type="bibr">[id]</ref>) and, for training and evaluation purposes, of the polarity label ( <ref type="bibr">[-label]</ref>). In the example of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, the id is 1 and the label is P.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CLSA experiments</head><p>In order to compare CLSA settings a and b (of use case I), we needed data with opinion annotations at the aspect level, in two different languages and in the same domain. We used the OpeNER 4 opinion corpus, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and more specifically the opinion expres- sion and polarity label annotations of the hotel re- view component, in Spanish and English. We split the data in training (train) and evaluation (test) sets as indicated in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The SMT system was trained on freely avail-Source: On the other hand &lt;zone&gt; &lt;x translation="ou1-P"&gt;x&lt;/x&gt; &lt;wall/&gt; a big ad- vantage &lt;wall/&gt; &lt;x translation="/ou1"&gt;x&lt;/x&gt; &lt;/zone&gt; of the hostel is its placement Translation: por otra parte &lt;ou1-P&gt;una gran ventaja&lt;/ou1&gt; del hostal es su colocación  From these in-domain data we extracted 100k and 50k word corpora, respectively for data selec- tion and language model (LM) interpolation tun- ing. We selected the data closest to the domain in the English-Spanish parallel corpora via a cross- entropy-based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Moore and Lewis, 2010)</ref>, using the open source XenC tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rousseau, 2013)</ref>. The size of available and selected corpora are indicated in the first 4 rows of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The LM was an interpolation of LMs trained with the target part of the parallel corpora and with the rest of the Booking and Trip Advisor data (last 2 rows of Ta- ble 2). We used Moses Experiment Management System (Koehn, 2010) with all default options to build the SMT system. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Because the common crawl corpus contained English sentences in the Spanish side, we applied an LM-based filter to select only sentence pairs in which the Spanish side was better scored by the Spanish LM than with the English LM, and con- versely for the English side.</p><p>We conducted supervised sentiment classifica- tion experiments for settings a and b of use case I (see Section 2).

We performed the experiments with the weka toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hall et al., 2009)</ref>, using a filter to con- vert strings into word vectors, and two learning al- gorithms: SVMs and bagging with Fast Decision Tree Learner as base algorithm. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> represents the experiments conducted with the EN test set. A monolingual classifier in English is trained with the EN training set, and evaluated with the EN test set <ref type="formula">(1 mono</ref>  sults are reported in the first row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. To evaluate cross-lingual setting a, the ES training set is translated into English (see Section 4), and an English classifier is trained on the translated data and evaluated on the EN test set (1 CL a). To eval- uate setting b, the EN test set is translated into Spanish, and this translated test is used to evalu- ate a classifier trained on the ES training set (1 CL b). With this very simple classifier, we achieve up to 83.4% accuracy in the monolingual case. With cross-lingual settings, we loose from about 4% to 8% accuracy, and with the higher quality SMT system (LM filter), CL-b setting is slightly better than CL-a. The same three experiments were conducted for the ES test set (last three rows of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>). We achieved an accuracy of 81.1% in the monolin- gual case. Here the CL-b setting achieved a clearly better accuracy than the CL-a setting (at least 5% more), and only from 2.3% to 3.5% below the monolingual one. Thus with the higher quality SMT system, it is always better to translate the test data (CL-b setting) than the training corpus.</p><p>Comparing the SVM classification accuracy in the "LM Filter" and "No Fil" columns, we can see the effect of introducing noise in the MT system. We observe that the results were more affected by the translation of the test (-2.2% and -0.8% accu- racy) than the training set (+0.5% accuracy in both cases). This agrees with the intuition than errors in the test directly affect the results and thus may be more harmful than in the training set, where they may hardly affect the results if they represent in- frequent examples.</p><p>Regarding use case II, setting c implies a trans- lation of the analysis outcome. We can use our method to translate the relevant opinionated units with their predicted label in their test sentence context, and extract the relevant information in the outcome language. In setting d, the test is trans- lated in the same way as in setting b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Perspectives</head><p>We extended the possible CLSA settings to aspect- level specific use cases. We proposed a method, based on constrained SMT, to transfer opinionated units across languages by preserving their bound- aries. With this method, we built cross-language sentiment classifiers achieving comparable results to monolingual ones (from about 4 to 8% and 2.3 to 3.5% loss in accuracy depending on the lan- guage and machine learning algorithm). We ob- served that improving the MT quality had more impact in settings using a translated test than a translated training corpus. With the higher MT quality system, we achieved better accuracy by translating the test than the training corpus.</p><p>As future work, we plan to investigate the ex- act effect of the reordering constraints in terms of possible translation model phrase pairs and target language model n-grams which may not be used depending on the constraint parameters, in order to find the best configuration.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Use case II settings.</figDesc></figure>
