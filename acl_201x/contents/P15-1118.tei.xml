				<p>Treebanks are key resources for developing accurate statistical parsers. However, building treebanks is expensive and time-consuming for humans. For domains requiring deep subject matter expertise such as law and medicine, treebanking is even more difficult. To reduce annotation costs for these domains, we develop methods to improve cross-domain parsing inference using paraphrases. Paraphrases are easier to obtain than full syntactic analyses as they do not require deep linguistic knowledge , only linguistic fluency. A sentence and its paraphrase may have similar syntactic structures, allowing their parses to mutually inform each other. We present several methods to incorporate paraphrase information by jointly parsing a sentence with its paraphrase. These methods are applied to state-of-the-art constituency and dependency parsers and provide significant improvements across multiple domains .</p>

Many natural lan- guage processing tasks use parse trees as a basis for deeper analysis.</p><p>The most effective sources of supervision for training statistical parsers are treebanks. Unfortu- nately, treebanks are expensive, time-consuming to create, and not available for most domains. Compounding the problem, the accuracy of statis- tical parsers degrades as the domain shifts away from the supervised training corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gildea, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bacchiani et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McClosky et al., 2006b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Surdeanu et al., 2008)</ref>. Furthermore, for * Work performed during an IBM internship. domains requiring subject matter experts, e.g., law and medicine, it may not be feasible to produce large scale treebanks since subject matter experts generally don't have the necessary linguistic back- ground. It is natural to look for resources that are more easily obtained. In this work, we ex- plore using paraphrases. Unlike parse trees, para- phrases can be produced quickly by humans and don't require extensive linguistic training. While paraphrases are not parse trees, a sentence and its paraphrase may have similar syntactic structures for portions where they can be aligned.</p><p>We can improve parsers by jointly parsing a sentence with its paraphrase and encouraging cer- tain types of overlaps in their syntactic structures. As a simple example, consider replacing an un- known word in a sentence with a synonym found in the training data. This may help disambiguate the sentence without changing its parse tree. More disruptive forms of paraphrasing (e.g., topicaliza- tion) can also be handled by not requiring strict agreement between the parses.</p><p>In this paper, we use paraphrases to improve parsing inference within and across domains. We develop methods using dual-decomposition (where the parses of both sentences from a depen- dency parser are encouraged to agree, Section 3.2) and pair-finding (which can be applied to any n- best parser, Section 3.3). Some paraphrases signif- icantly disrupt syntactic structure. To counter this, we examine relaxing agreement constraints and building classifiers to predict when joint parsing won't be beneficial (Section 3.4). We show that paraphrases can be exploited to improve cross- domain parser inference for two state-of-the-art parsers, especially on domains where they perform poorly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Bilingual Parsing</head><p>The closest task to ours is bilingual parsing where sentences and their translations are parsed simul- taneously ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burkett et al., 2010)</ref>. While our meth- ods differ from those used in bilingual parsing, the general ideas are the same. 1 Translating and para- phrasing are related transformations since both ap- proximately preserve meaning. While syntax is only partially preserved across these transforma- tions, the overlapping portions can be leveraged with joint inference to mutually disambiguate. Ex- isting bilingual parsing methods typically require parallel treebanks for training and parallel text at runtime while our methods only require parallel text at runtime. Since we do not have a paral- lel paraphrase treebank for training, we cannot di- rectly compare to these methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Jointly Parsing Paraphrases</head><p>With a small number of exceptions, parsers typi- cally assume that the parse of each sentence is in- dependent. There are good reasons for this inde- pendence assumption: it simplifies parsing infer- ence and oftentimes it is not obvious how to relate multiple sentences (though see  for one approach). In this section, we present two methods to jointly parse paraphrases without com- plicating inference steps. Before going into de- tails, we give a high level picture of how jointly parsing paraphrases can help in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. With the baseline parser, the parse tree of the target sen- tence is incorrect but its paraphrase (parsed by the same parser) is parsed correctly. We use rough alignments to map words across sentence pairs. Note the similar syntactic relations when they are projected across the aligned words.</p><p>Our goal is to encourage an appropriate level of agreement between the two parses across align- ments. We start by designing "hard" methods which require complete agreement between the parses. However, since parsers are imperfect and alignments approximate, we also develop "soft" methods which allow for disagreements. Addi- tionally, we make procedures to decide whether to use the original (non-joint) parse or the new joint parse for each sentence since joint parses may be worse in cases where the sentences are too differ- ent and alignment fails.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Objective</head><p>In a typical parsing setting, given a sentence (x) and its paraphrase (y), parsers find a * (x) and b * (y) that satisfy the following equation: 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a * , b * = argmax a∈T (x),b∈T (y) f (a) + f (b) = argmax a∈T (x) f (a) + argmax b∈T (y) f (b) (1)</formula><p>where f is a parse-scoring function and T returns all possible trees for a sentence. f can take many forms, e.g., summing the scores of arcs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eisner, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McDonald et al., 2005</ref>) or multiplying prob- abilities together <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Charniak and Johnson, 2005</ref>). The argmax over a and b of equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> is sepa- rable; parsers make two sentence-level decisions.</p><p>For joint parsing, we modify the objective so that parsers make one global decision:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a * , b * = argmax a∈T (x),b∈T (y) : c(a,b)=0 f (a) + f (b) (2)</formula><p>where c (defined below) measures the syntactic similarity between the two trees. The smaller c(a, b) is, the more similar a and b are. Intuitively, joint parsers must retrieve the most similar pair of trees with the highest sum of scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Constraints</head><p>The constraint function, c, ties two trees together using alignments as a proxy for semantic informa- tion. An alignment is a pair of words from sen- tences x and y that approximately mean the same thing. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, (help x , help y ) is one alignment and (pestilence x , disease y ) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Set u 0 (i, j) = 0 for all i, j ∈ E for k = 1 to K do a k = argmax a∈T (x) f (a) + i,j∈E u k (i, j)a(i, j) b k = argmax b∈T (y) f (b) − i,j∈E u k (i, j)b(i, j) v, u k+1 = UPDATE(u k , δ k , a k , b k ) if v = 0 then return a k , b k return a K , b K function UPDATE(u, δ, a, b) v = 0, u (i, j) = 0 for all i, j ∈ E for i, j ∈ E do u (i, j) = u(i, j) − δ(a(i, j) − b(i, j)) if a(i, j) = b(i, j) then v = v + 1 return v, u</formula><p>Algorithm 1: Dual decomposition for jointly parsing paraphrases pseudocode. E is the set of all possible edges between any pair of aligned words. Given aligned word pairs, E = {1, . . . , } × {1, . . . , }. a(i, j) is one if the ith aligned word is the head of jth aligned word, zero otherwise. u(i, j) is the dual value of an edge from the ith aligned word to the jth aligned word. δ k is the step size at kth itera- tion.</p><p>another. To simplify joint parsing, we assume the aligned words play the same syntactic roles (which is obviously not always true and should be revisited in future work). c measures the syn- tactic similarity by computing how many pairs of alignments have different syntactic head relations. For the two trees in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we see two differ- ent relations: (help As we'll show in Section 5, the constraints defined above are too restrictive because of this strong as- sumption. To alleviate the problem, we present ways of appropriately changing constraints later. We now turn to the first method of incorporating constraints into joint parsing.</p></div>

Essen- tially, dual decomposition penalizes relations that are different in two trees by adding/subtracting dual values to/from arc scores. When dual de- composition is applied in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the arc score of (help x − → dying) decreases and the score for (natives x − → dying) increases in the second itera- tion, which eventually leads the algorithm to favor the latter.</p><p>We relax the constraints by employing soft dual decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anzaroot et al., 2014</ref>) and replac- ing UPDATE in Algorithm 1 with S-UPDATE from Algorithm 2. The problem with the original con- straints is they force every pair of alignments to have the same relation even when some aligned words certainly play different syntactic roles. The introduced slack variable lets some alignments have different relations when parsers prefer them. Penalties bounded by the slack tend to help fix in- correct ones and not change correct parses. In this work, we use a single slack variable but it's possi- ble to have a different slack variable for each type of dependency relation. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Constraints via Pair-finding</head><p>One shortcoming of the dual decomposition ap- proach is that it only applies to parse-scoring func- tions with an arc-factored component. We intro- duce another method for estimating equation <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> that applies to all n-best parsers.</p><p>Given the n-best parses of x and the m-best parses of y, Algorithm 3 scans through n×m pairs of trees and chooses the pair that satisfies equa- tion (2). If it finds one pair with c(a, b) = 0, then it has found the answer to the equation. Otherwise, it chooses the pair with the smallest c(a, b), breaking ties using the scores of the parses (f (a) + f (b)). This algorithm is well suited for finding solutions to the equation but the solutions are not necessar- ily good trees due to overly hard constraints.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">function S-UPDATE(u, δ, a, b, s) v = 0, u (i, j) = 0 for all i, j ∈ E for i, j ∈ E do t = max(u(i, j) − δ(a(i, j) − b(i, j)), 0) u (i, j) = min(t, s) if u (i, j) = 0, u (i, j) = s then v = v + 1 return v, u</formula><p>The algorithm often finds bad trees far down the n-best list because it is mainly interested in re- trieving pairs of trees that satisfy all constraints. Parsers find such pairs with low scores if they are allowed to search through unrestricted space. To mitigate the problem, we shrink the search space by limiting n. Reducing the search space relies on the fact that higher ranking trees are more likely to be correct than the lower ranking ones. Note that we decrease n because we are interested in recov- ering the tree of the target sentence, x. m should also be decreased to improve the parse of its para- phrase, y.</p></div>

We chose a value that generalizes well across four corpora as opposed to a value that does 11 http://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser 12 RBG parser requires predicted POS tags. We used the Stanford tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Toutanova et al., 2003)</ref> to tag WSJ and paraphrase datasets.

As shown in Ta- ble 4, joint parsing with hard dual decomposition performs worse than independent parsing (RBG). This is expected because hard dual decomposition forces every pair of alignments to form the same relation even when they should not. With relaxed constraints (S-Dual), joint parsing performs sig- nificantly better than independent parsing. Soft dual decomposition improves across all domains except for Brown (where it ties).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Pair-finding</head><p>These experiments use the 50-best trees from BLLIP parser. When converting to dependencies, some constituency trees map to the same depen- dency tree. In this case, trees with lower rankings are dropped. Like joint parsing with hard dual de- composition, joint parsing with unrestricted pair- finding (n = 50) allows significantly worse parses to be selected <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>). With small n values, pair-finding improves over the baseline BLLIP parser. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Experiments with self-trained BLLIP exhibit similar results so we use n = 2 for all <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Decreasing m did not lead to further improvement and thus we don't report the results of changing m.  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: UAS of joint parsing using the pair- finding scheme with various n values on the de- velopment portion. n = 1 is the baseline BLLIP parser and n &gt; 1 is BLLIP with pair-finding.</p><p>other experiments. Interestingly, each corpus has a different optimal value for n which suggests we might improve accuracy further if we know the do- main of each sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Logistic Regression</head><p>The classifier is trained on sentences where parse scores (UAS) of the proposed methods are higher or lower than those of the baselines 16 from the development set using leave-one-out cross- validation. We use random greedy search to select specific features from the 15 feature templates de- fined in Section 3.4.1. Features seen fewer than three times in the development are thrown out. Separate regression models are built for three dif- ferent parsers. The logistic regression classifier uses an L 1 penalty with regularization parameter C = 1.</p><p>Logistic regression experiments are reported in  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Effect of using logistic regression on top of each method (UAS). Leave-one-out cross- validation is performed on the development data. +X means augmenting the above system with X. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. All parsers benefit from employing logis- tic regression models on top of paraphrase meth- ods. BLLIP experiments show a larger improve- ment than RBG. This may be because BLLIP can- not use soft constraints so its errors are more pro- nounced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Final Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the three parsers on the test set using the tuned parameters and logistic regression mod- els from above. Joint parsing with paraphrases sig- nificantly improves accuracy for all systems (Ta- ble 7). Self-trained BLLIP with logistic regres- sion is the most accurate, though RBG with S- Dual provides the most consistent improvements. Joint parsing without logistic regression (RBG + S-Dual) is more accurate than independent pars- ing (RBG) overall. With the help of logistic re- gression, the methods do at least as well as their baseline counterparts on all domains with the ex- ception of self-trained BLLIP on BNC. We believe that the drop on BNC is largely due to noise as our BNC test set is the smallest of the four. As on de- velopment, logistic regression does not change the accuracy much over the RBG parser with soft dual decomposition.</p><p>Joint parsing provides the largest gains on QuestionBank, the domain with the lowest base- line accuracies. This fits with our goal of using paraphrases for domain adaptation -parsing with paraphrases helps the most on domains furthest from our training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Error analysis</head><p>We analyzed the errors from RBG and BLLIP along several dimensions: by dependency label, sentence length, dependency length, alignment status (whether a token was aligned), percentage of tokens aligned in the sentence, and edit distance between the sentence pairs. Most errors are fairly uniformly distributed across these dimensions and indicate general structural improvements when us- ing paraphrases. BLLIP saw a 2.2% improvement for the ROOT relation, though RBG's improvement here was more moderate. For sentence lengths, BLLIP obtains larger boosts for shorter sentences while RBG's are more uniform. RBG gets a 1.4% UAS improvement on longer dependencies (6 or more tokens) while shorter dependencies are more modestly improved by about 0.3-0.5% UAS. Sur- prisingly, alignment information provides no sig- nal as to whether accuracy improves.</p><p>Additionally, we had our annotator label a por- tion of our dataset with the set of paraphrasing operations employed. 17 While most paraphrasing operations generally improved performance un- der joint inference, the largest reliable gains came from lexical replacements (e.g., synonyms).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Our methods of incorporating paraphrases im- prove parsing across multiple domains for state- of-the-art constituency and dependency parsers. We leverage the fact that paraphrases often express the same semantics with similar syntactic realiza- tions. These provide benefits even on top of self- training, another domain adaptation technique.</p><p>Since paraphrases are not available at most times, our methods may seem limited. However, there are several possible use cases. The best case scenario is when users can be directly asked to rephrase a question and provide a paraphrase. For instance, question answering systems can ask users to rephrase questions when an answer is marked as wrong by users. Another option is to use crowdsourcing to quickly create a paraphrase corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Negri et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burrows et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tschirsich and Hintz, 2013)</ref>. As part of future work, we plan to integrate existing larger para- phrase resources, such as WikiAnswers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fader et al., 2013</ref>) and PPDB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013)</ref>. WikiAnswers provides rough equivalence classes of questions. PPDB includes phrasal and syntactic alignments which could supplement our existing alignments or be used as proxies for paraphrases.</p></div>

Lastly, in- tegrating our methods with paraphrase detection or generation systems could help provide para- phrases on demand.</p><p>There are many other ways to extend this work. Poor alignments are one of the larger sources of errors and improving alignments could help dra- matically. One simple extension is to use multiple paraphrases and their alignments instead of just one. More difficult would be to learn the align- ments jointly while parsing and adaptively learn how alignments affect syntax. Our constraints can only capture certain types of paraphrase transfor- mations currently and should be extended to un- derstand common tree transformations for para- phrases, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Heilman and Smith, 2010)</ref>. Fi- nally, and perhaps most importantly, our methods apply only at inference time. We plan to investi- gate methods which use paraphrases to augment parsing models created at train time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The rest have the same relation so c(a, b) = 2.</figDesc></figure>
