				<p>Linguistics studies have shown that action verbs often denote some Change of State (CoS) as the result of an action. However, the causality of action verbs and its potential connection with the physical world has not been systematically explored. To address this limitation, this paper presents a study on physical causality of action verbs and their implied changes in the physical world. We first conducted a crowd-sourcing experiment and identified eighteen categories of physical causality for action verbs. For a subset of these categories , we then defined a set of detectors that detect the corresponding change from visual perception of the physical environment. We further incorporated physical causality modeling and state detection in grounded language understanding. Our empirical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of causality modeling in grounding language to perception.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Linguistics studies have shown that action verbs often denote some change of state (CoS) as the result of an action, where the change of state of- ten involves an attribute of the direct object of the verb . For example, the result of "slice a pizza" is that the state of the ob- ject (pizza) changes from one big piece to several smaller pieces. This change of state can be per- ceived from the physical world. In Artificial Intel- ligence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Russell and Norvig, 2010)</ref>, decades of re- search on planning, for example, back to the early days of the STRIPS planner (Fikes and Nilsson, * This work was conducted at Michigan State University where the author received his MS degree. 1971), have defined action schemas to capture the change of state caused by a given action. Based on action schemas, planning algorithms can be ap- plied to find a sequence of actions to achieve a goal state ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ghallab et al., 2004</ref>). The state of the phys- ical world is a very important notion and chang- ing the state becomes a driving force for agents' actions. Thus, motivated by linguistic literature on action verbs and AI literature on action repre- sentations, in our view, modeling change of phys- ical state for action verbs, in other words, physical causality, can better connect language to the phys- ical world.</p><p>Although this kind of physical causality has been described in linguistic studies , a detailed account of potential causality that could be denoted by an action verb is lacking. For example, in VerbNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schuler, 2005</ref>) the semantic representation for various verbs may indicate that a change of state is involved, but it does not provide the specifics associated with the verb's meaning (e.g., to what attribute of its pa- tient the changes might occur).</p><p>To address this limitation, we have conducted an empirical investigation on verb semantics from a new angle of how they may change the state of the physical world. As the first step in this inves- tigation, we selected a set of action verbs from a cooking domain and conducted a crowd-sourcing study to examine the potential types of causality associated with these verbs. Motivated by lin- guistics studies on typology for gradable adjec- tives, which also have a notion of change along a scale ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dixon and Aikhenvald, 2006</ref>), we devel- oped a set of eighteen main categories to charac- terize physical causality. We then defined a set of change-of-state detectors focusing on visual per- ception. We further applied two approaches, a knowledge-driven approach and a learning-based approach, to incorporate causality modeling in grounded language understanding. Our empirical results have demonstrated that both of these ap- proaches achieve significantly better performance in grounding language to perception compared to previous approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Yang et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The notion of causality or causation has been ex- plored in psychology, linguistics, and computa- tional linguistics from a wide range of perspec- tives. For example, different types of causal re- lations such as causing, enabling, and prevent- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Goldvarg and Johnson-Laird, 2001;</ref>) have been studied extensively as well as their linguistic expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wolff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Neeleman et al., 2012)</ref> and automated extraction of causal relations from text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blanco et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mulkar-Mehta et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Radinsky et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Riaz and Girju, 2014)</ref>. Different from these previous works, this paper focuses on the physical causality of action verbs, in other words, change of state in the phys- ical world caused by action verbs as described in . This is motivated by recent advances in computer vision, robotics, and grounding language to perception and action.</p><p>A recent trend in computer vision has started looking into intermediate representations beyond lower-level visual features for action recogni- tion, for example, by incorporating object affor- dances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Koppula et al., 2013</ref>) and causality be- tween actions and objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fathi and Rehg, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fathi and Rehg (2013)</ref> have borken down detec- tion of actions to detection of state changes from video frames. <ref type="bibr">Yang and colleagues (2013;</ref> have developed an object segmentation and track- ing method to detect state changes (or, in their terms, consequences of actions) for action recog- nition. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fire and Zhu (2015)</ref> have developed a framework to learn perceptual causal structures between actions and object statuses in videos.</p><p>In the robotics community, as robots' low-level control systems are often pre-programmed to han- dle (and thus execute) only primitive actions, a high-level language command will need to be translated to a sequence of primitive actions in order for the corresponding action to take place. To make such translation possible, previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(She et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">She et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Misra et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">She and Chai, 2016</ref>) explicitly model verbs with predicates describing the resulting states of actions. Their empirical evaluations have demon- strated how incorporating resulting states into verb representations can link language with underlying planning modules for robotic systems. These re- sults have motivated a systematic investigation on modeling physical causality for action verbs.</p><p>Although recent years have seen an increas- ing amount of work on grounding language to perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Yu and Siskind, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Walter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Naim et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu and Chai, 2015)</ref>, no previous work has investi- gated the link between physical causality denoted by action verbs and the change of state visually perceived. Our work here intends to address this limitation and examine whether the causality de- noted by action verbs can provide top-down in- formation to guide visual processing and improve grounded language understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Modeling Physical Causality for Action Verbs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linguistics Background on Action Verbs</head><p>Verb semantics have been studied extensively in linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pustejovsky, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002</ref>). Partic- ularly, for action verbs (such as run, throw, cook), Hovav and Levin (Hovav and Levin, 2010) pro- pose that they can be divided into two types: man- ner verbs that "specify as part of their meaning a manner of carrying out an action" (e.g., nibble, rub, scribble, sweep, flutter, laugh, run, swim), and result verbs that "specify the coming about of a result state" (e.g., clean, cover, empty, fill, chop, cut, melt, open, enter). Result verbs can be further classified into three categories: Change of State verbs, which denote a change of state for a prop- erty of the verb's object (e.g. "to warm"); Inher- ently Directed Motion verbs, which denote move- ment along a path in relation to a landmark object (e.g. "to arrive"); and Incremental Theme verbs, which denote the incremental change of volume or area of the object (e.g. "to eat") ( . In this work, we mainly focus on re- sult verbs. Unlike Hovav and Levin's definition of Change of State verbs, we use the term change of state in a more general way such that the location, volume, and area of an object are part of its state. Previous linguistic studies have also shown that result verbs often specify movement along a scale , i.e., they are verbs of scalar change. A scale is "a set of points on a particular dimension (e.g. height, tempera- ture, cost)". In the case of verbs, the dimension is an attribute of the object of the verb. For ex- ample, "John cooled the coffee" means that the temperature attribute of the object coffee has de- creased. Kennedy and McNally give a very de- tailed description of scale structure and its vari- ations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kennedy and McNally, 2005</ref>). Interest- ingly, gradable adjectives also have their seman- tics defined in terms of a scale structure. Dixon and Aikhenvald have defined a typology for adjec- tives which include categories such as Dimension, Color, Physical Property, Quantification, and Posi- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dixon and Aikhenvald, 2006</ref>). The connec- tion between gradable adjectives and result verbs through scale structure motivates us to use the Dixon typology as a basis to define our categoriza- tion of causality for verbs.</p><p>In summary, previous linguistic literature has provided abundant evidence and discussion on change of state for action verbs. It has also pro- vided extensive knowledge on potential dimen- sions that can be used to categorize change of state as described in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">A Crowd-sourcing Study</head><p>Motivated by the above linguistic insight, we have conducted a pilot study to examine the feasibility of causality modeling using a small set of verbs which appear in the TACoS corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Regneri et al., 2013)</ref>. This corpus is a collection of natu- ral language descriptions of actions that occur in a set of cooking videos. This is an ideal dataset to start with since it contains mainly descriptions of physical actions. Possibly because most actions in the cooking domain are goal-directed, a major- ity of the verbs in TACoS denote results of actions (changes of state) which can be observed in the world.</p><p>More specifically, we chose ten verbs (clean, rinse, wipe, cut, chop, mix, stir, add, open, shake)) based on the criteria that they occur relatively fre- quently in the corpus and take a variety of different objects as their patient. We paired each verb with three different objects in the role of patient. Nouns (e.g., cutting board, dish, counter, knife, hand, cu- cumber, beans, leek, eggs, water, break, bowl, etc.) were chosen based on the criteria that they repre- sent objects dissimilar to each other, since we hy- pothesize that the change of state indicated by the verb will differ depending on the object's features.</p><p>Each verb-noun pair was presented to turkers via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and they were asked to describe (by text) the changes of state that occur to the object as a result of the verb. The descriptions were collected under two conditions: (1) without showing the correspond- ing video clips (so turkers would have to use their imagination of the physical situation) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> showing the corresponding video clips. For each condition and each verb-noun pair, we col- lected 30 turkers' responses, which resulted in a total of 1800 natural language responses describ- ing change of state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Categorization of Change of State</head><p>Based on Dixon and Aikhenvald's typology for ad- jectives ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dixon and Aikhenvald, 2006</ref>) and turk- ers' responses, we identified a categorization to characterize causality, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. This categorization is also driven by the expectation that these attributes can be potentially recognized from the physical world by artificial agents. The first column specifies the type of state change and the second column specifies specific attributes re- lated to the type. The third column specifies the particular value associated with the attribute, e.g., it could be a binary categorization on whether a change happens or not (i.e., changes), or a direc- tion along a scale (i.e., increase/decrease), or a specific value (i.e., specific such as "five pieces"). In total, we have identified eighteen causality cat- egories corresponding to eighteen attributes as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>An important motivation of modeling physical causality is to provide guidance for visual pro- cessing. Our hypothesis is that once a language description is given together with its correspond- ing visual scene, potential causality of verbs or verb-noun pairs can trigger some visual detectors associated with the scene. This can potentially improve grounded language understanding (e.g., grounding nouns to objects in the scene). Next we give a detailed account on these visual detectors and their role in grounded language understand- ing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Visual Detectors based on Physical Causality</head><p>The changes of state associated with the eighteen attributes can be detected from the physical world  using various sensors. In this paper, we only focus on attributes that can be detected by visual per- ception. More specifically, we chose the subset: Attachment, NumberOfPieces, Presence, Visibil- ity, Location, Size. They are chosen because: 1) according to the pilot study, they are highly corre- lated with our selected verbs; and 2) they are rela- tively easy to be detected from vision. Corresponding to these causality attributes, we defined a set of rule-based detectors as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. These in fact are very simple detectors, which consist of four major detectors and a refined set that distinguishes directions of state change. These visual detectors are specifically applied to the potential objects that may serve as patient for a verb to identify whether certain changes of state occur to these objects in the visual scene.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Verb Causality in Grounded Language Understanding</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate how verb causal- ity modeling and visual detectors can be used to- gether for grounded language understanding. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, given a video clip V of hu- man action and a parallel sentence S describing the action, our goal is to ground different seman- tic roles of the verb (e.g., get) to objects in the video. This is similar to the grounded semantic role labeling task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>. Here, we fo- cus on a set of four semantic roles {agent, patient, source, destination}. We also assume that we have object and hand tracking results from video data. Each object in the video is represented by a track, which is a series of bounding boxes across video frames. Thus, given a video clip and a parallel sentence, the task is to ground semantic roles of the verb λ 1 , λ 2 , . . . , λ k to object (or hand) tracks γ 1 , γ 2 , . . . , γ n , in the video. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We applied two ap- proaches to this problem. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Knowledge-driven Approach</head><p>We intend to establish that the knowledge of phys- ical causality for action verbs can be acquired di- rectly from the crowd and such knowledge can be coupled with visual detectors for grounded lan- guage understanding.</p><p>Acquiring Knowledge. To acquire knowledge of verb causality, we collected a larger dataset of causality annotations based on sentences from the TACoS Multilevel corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rohrbach et al., 2014</ref>), through crowd-sourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Annotators were shown a sentence contain- ing a verb-patient pair (e.g., "The person chops the cucumber into slices on the cutting board"). And they were asked to annotate the change of state that occurred to the patient as a result of the verb by choosing up to three options from the 18 causality attributes. Each sentence was annotated by three different annotators. This dataset contains 4391 sentences, with 178 verbs, 260 nouns, and 1624 verb-noun pairs. Af- ter summarizing the annotations from three differ- ent annotators, each sentence is represented by a 18-dimension causality vector. In the vector, an element is 1 if at least two annotators labeled the corresponding causality attribute as true, 0 other- wise. For 83% of all the annotated sentences, at least one causality attribute was agreed on by at least two people.</p><p>From the causality annotation data, we can ex- tract a verb causality vector c(v) for each verb by averaging all causality vectors of the sentences that contain this verb v.</p><p>Applying Knowledge. Since the collected causal- ity knowledge was only for the patient, we first look at the grounding of patient. Given a sen- tence containing a verb v and its patient, we want to ground the patient to one of the object tracks in the video clip. Suppose we have the causal- ity knowledge, i.e., c(v), for the verb. For each candidate track in the video, we can generate a causality detection vector d(γ i ), using the pre- defined causality detectors. A straightforward way is to ground the patient to the object track whose causality detection results has the best coherence with the causality knowledge of the verb. The co- herence is measured by the cosine similarity be- tween c(v) and d(γ i ). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Since objects in other semantic roles often have relations with the patient during the action, once we have grounded the patient, we can use it as an anchor point to ground the other three semantic roles. To do this, we define two new detectors for grounding each role as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. These detectors are designed using some common sense knowledge, e.g., source is likely to be the initial location of the patient; destination is likely to be the final location of the patient; agent is likely to be the hand that touches the patient. With these new detectors, we simply ground a role to the ob- ject (or hand) track that has the largest number of positive detections from the corresponding detec- tors.</p><p>It is worth noting that although currently we only acquired knowledge for verbs that appear in the cooking domain, the same approach can be ex- tended to verbs in other domains. The detectors associated with attributes are expected to remain the same. The significance of this knowledge- driven method is that, once you have the causality knowledge of a verb, it can be directly applied to any domain without additional training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Learning-based Approach</head><p>Our second approach is based on learning from training data. A key requirement for this approach is the availability of annotated data where the ar- guments of a verb are already correctly grounded to the objects in the visual scene. Then we can learn the association between detected causality Semantic Role Rule-based Detector Source Patient track appears within its bounding box. Its track is overlapping with the patient track at the initial frame.</p></div>

Its track is overlapping with the patient track when the patient track starts moving or stops moving.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(Φ|λ 1 , . . . , λ k , γ 1 , . . . , γ k , v) = 1 Z i Ψ i (φ i , λ i , γ 1 , . . . , γ k , v)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Φ is the binary random vector [φ 1 , . . . , φ k ], and v is the verb. Z is the normalization constant. Ψ i is the potential function that takes the following log-linear form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ψ i (φ i , λ i , Γ, v) = exp l w l f l (φ i , λ i , Γ, v)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where f l is a feature function, w l is feature weight to be learned, and Γ = [γ 1 , . . . , γ k ] are the ground- ings. In our model, we use the following features:</p><p>1. Joint features between a track label of γ i and a word occurrence in λ i .</p><p>2. Joint features between each of the causality detection results and a verb v. Causality de- tection includes all the detectors in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. Note that the causality detectors <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: The CRF factor graph of the sentence: the man gets a knife from the drawer.</p><p>shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> capture relations between groundings of different semantic roles.</p><p>During learning, gradient ascent with L2 regular- ization is used for parameter learning. Compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tellex et al., 2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Yang et al., 2016</ref>), a key difference in our model is the in- corporation of causality detectors. These previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tellex et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2016</ref>) ap- ply geometric features, for example, to capture re- lations, distance, and relative directions between grounding objects. These geometric features can be noisy. In our model, features based on causal- ity detectors are motivated and informed by the underlying causality models for corresponding ac- tion verbs.</p><p>In the inference step, we want to find the most probable groundings. Given a video clip and its parallel sentence, we fix the Φ to be true, and search for groundings γ 1 , . . . , γ k that maximize the probability as in Equation 1. To reduce the search space we apply beam search to ground in the following order: patient, source, destination, agent.</p></div>

For approaches which do not need training such as Label Match- ing and VC-Knowledge, we used the same test set to report their results.</p><p>The results of the patient role grounding for each verb are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. The results of grounding all four semantic roles are shown in Ta- ble 5. The scores in bold are statistically signifi- cant (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the Label Matching method. The scores with an asterisk ( * ) are statis- tically significant (p &lt; 0.05) compared to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>As it can be difficult to obtain labels for the track, especially when the vision system encoun- ters novel objects, we further conducted several experiments assuming we do not know the labels for the object tracks. In this case, only geometric information of tracked objects is available. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> also include these results.</p><p>From the grounding results, we can see that the causality modeling has shown to be very effec- tive in grounding semantic roles. First of all, both the knowledge-driven approach and the learning- based approach outperform the two baselines. In   <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Grounding accuracy on patient role using predicted causality knowledge. particular, our knowledge-driven approach (VC- Knowledge) even outperforms the trained model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>. Our learning-based approach (VC-Learning) achieves the best overall perfor- mance. In the learning-based approach, causal- ity detection results can be seen as a set of in- termediate visual features. The reason that our learning-based approach significantly outperforms the similar model in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2016)</ref> is that the causality categorization provides a good guideline for designing intermediate visual features. These causality detectors focus on the changes of state of objects, which are more robust than the geometric features used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2016</ref>).</p><p>In the setting of no object recognition labels, VC-Knowledge and VC-Learning also generate significantly better grounding accuracy than the two baselines. This once again demonstrates the advantage of using causality detection results as intermediate visual features. All these results il- lustrate the potential of causality modeling for grounded language understanding.</p><p>The results in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> also indicate that ground- ing source or destination is more difficult than grounding patient or agent. One reason could be that source and destination do not exhibit obvi- ous change of state as a result of action, so their groundings usually depend on the correct ground- ing of other roles such as patient.</p><p>Since automated tracking for this TACoS dataset is notably difficult due to the complexity of the scene and the lack of depth information, our current results are based on annotated tracks. But object tracking algorithms have made significant progress in recent years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Milan et al., 2014</ref>). We intend to apply our algorithms with automated tracking on real scenes in the fu- ture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Causality Prediction for New Verbs</head><p>While various methods can be used to acquire causality knowledge for verbs, it may be the case that during language grounding, we do not know the causality knowledge for every verb. Further- more, manual annotation/acquisition of causality knowledge for all verbs can be time-consuming.</p><p>In this section, we demonstrate that the existing causality knowledge for some seed verbs can be used to predict causality for new verbs of which we have no knowledge.</p><p>We formulate the problem as follows. Suppose we have causality knowledge for a set of seed verbs as training data. Given a new verb, whose causality knowledge is not known, our goal is to predict the causality attributes associated with this new verb. Although the causality knowledge is unknown, it is easy to compute Distributional Se- mantic Models (DSM) for this verb. Then our goal is to find the causality vector c that maximizes</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">arg max c p(c |v),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where v is the DSM vector for the verb v. The usage of DSM vectors is based on our hypothe- sis that the textual context of a verb can reveal its possible causality information. For example, the contextual words "pieces" and "halves" may indi- cate the CoS attribute "NumberOfPieces" for the verb "cut". We simplify the problem by assuming that the causality vector c takes binary values, and also assuming the independence between different causality attributes. Thus, we can formulate this task as a group of binary classification problems: predicting whether a particular causality attribute is positive or negative given the DSM vector of a verb. We apply logistic regression to train a sep- arate classifier for each attribute. Specifically, for the features of a verb, we use the Distributional Memory (typeDM) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni and Lenci, 2010)</ref> vec- tor. The class label indicates whether the corre- sponding attribute is associated with the verb.</p><p>In our experiment we chose six attributes to study: Attachment, NumberOfPieces, Presence, Visibility, Location, and Size. For each one of the eleven verbs in the grounding task, we predict its causality knowledge using classifiers trained on all other verbs (i.e., 177 verbs in training set). To evaluate the predicted causality vectors, we ap- plied them in the knowledge-driven approach (P- VC-Knowledge). Grounding results were com- pared with the same method using the causal- ity knowledge collected via crowd-sourcing. Ta-ble 6 shows the grounding accuracy on the pa- tient role for each verb. For most verbs, us- ing the predicted knowledge achieves very simi- lar performance compared to using the collected knowledge. The overall grounding accuracy of us- ing the predicted knowledge on all four semantic roles is only 0.3% lower than using the collected knowledge. This result demonstrates that physical causality of action verbs, as part of verb semantics, can be learned through Distributional Semantics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt that explicitly models the physical causality of action verbs. We have applied causal- ity modeling to the task of grounding semantic roles to the environment using two approaches: a knowledge-based approach and a learning-based approach.</p><p>Our empirical evaluations have shown en- couraging results for both approaches. When annotated data is available (in which seman- tic roles of verbs are grounded to physical ob- jects), the learning-based approach, which learns the associations between verbs and causality de- tectors, achieves the best overall performance. On the other hand, the knowledge-based ap- proach also achieves competitive performance (even better than previous learned models), with- out any training. The most exciting aspect about the knowledge-based approach is that causality knowledge for verbs can be acquired from humans (e.g., through crowd-sourcing) and generalized to novel verbs about which we have not yet acquired causality knowledge.</p><p>In the future, we plan to build a resource for modeling physical causality for action verbs. As object recognition and tracking are undergoing significant advancements in the computer vision field, such a resource together with causality de- tectors can be immediately applied for any ap- plications that require grounded language under- standing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Language descrip.on: The man gets a knife from the drawer.
