				<p>Understanding how ideas relate to each other is a fundamental question in many domains, ranging from intellectual history to public communication. Because ideas are naturally embedded in texts, we propose the first framework to systematically characterize the relations between ideas based on their occurrence in a corpus of documents, independent of how these ideas are represented. Combining two statistics-cooccurrence within documents and prevalence correlation over time-our approach reveals a number of different ways in which ideas can cooperate and compete. For instance, two ideas can closely track each other&apos;s prevalence over time, and yet rarely cooccur, almost like a &quot;cold war&quot; scenario. We observe that pairwise cooccurrence and prevalence correlation exhibit different distributions. We further demonstrate that our approach is able to uncover intriguing relations between ideas through in-depth case studies on news articles and research papers.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Ideas exist in the mind, but are made manifest in language, where they compete with each other for the scarce resource of human attention. <ref type="bibr">Milton (1644)</ref> used the "marketplace of ideas" metaphor to argue that the truth will win out when ideas freely compete; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dawkins (1976)</ref> similarly likened the evolution of ideas to natural selection of genes. We propose a framework to quantitatively charac- terize competition and cooperation between ideas in texts, independent of how they might be repre- sented.</p><p>By "ideas", we mean any discrete conceptual units that can be identified as being present or ab- sent in a document. In this work, we consider representing ideas using keywords and topics ob- tained in an unsupervised fashion, but our way of characterizing the relations between ideas could be applied to many other types of textual repre- sentations, such as frames ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Card et al., 2015)</ref> and hashtags.</p><p>What does it mean for two ideas to compete in texts, quantitatively? Consider, for example, the issue of immigration. There are two strongly com- peting narratives about the roughly 11 million peo- ple 1 who are residing in the United States without permission. One is "illegal aliens", who "steal" jobs and deny opportunities to legal immigrants; the other is "undocumented immigrants", who are already part of the fabric of society and deserve a path to citizenship <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Merolla et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Although prior knowledge suggests that these two narratives compete, it is not immediately ob- vious what measures might reveal this competition in a corpus of writing about immigration. One question is whether or not these two ideas cooc- cur in the same documents. In the example above, these narratives are used by distinct groups of peo- ple with different ideologies. The fact that they don't cooccur is one clue that they may be in com- petition with each other.</p><p>However, cooccurrence is insufficient to express the selection process of ideas, i.e., some ideas fade out over time, while others rise in popularity, anal- ogous to the populations of species in nature. Of the two narratives on immigration, we may expect one to win out at the expense of another as pub- lic opinion shifts. Alternatively, we might expect to see these narratives reinforcing each other, as both sides intensify their messaging in response to growing opposition, much like the U.S.S.R. and anti-correlated correlated likely to cooccur tryst friendship <ref type="bibr">1980 1990 2000 2010</ref> immigration, deportation detainee, detention <ref type="bibr">1980 1990 2000 2010</ref> immigrant, undocumented obama, president unlikely to cooccur head-to-head arms-race <ref type="bibr">1980 1990 2000 2010</ref> immigrant, undocumented illegal, alien <ref type="bibr">1980 1990 2000 2010</ref> immigration, deportation republican, party <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Relations between ideas in the space of cooccurrence and prevalence correlation (prevalence correlation is shown explicitly and cooccurrence is encoded in row captions). We use topics from LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003</ref>) to represent ideas. Each topic is named with a pair of words that are most strongly associated with the topic in LDA. Subplots show examples of relations between topics found in U.S. newspaper articles on immigration from 1980 to 2016, color coded to match the description in text. The y-axis represents the proportion of news articles in a year (in our corpus) that contain the corresponding topic. All examples are among the top 3 strongest relations in each type except ("immigrant, undocumented", "illegal, alien"), which corresponds to the two competing narratives. We explain the formal definition of strength in §2.</p><p>the U.S. during the cold war. To capture these pos- sibilities, we use prevalence correlation over time.</p><p>Building on these insights, we propose a frame- work that combines cooccurrence within docu- ments and prevalence correlation over time. This framework gives rise to four possible types of rela- tion that correspond to the four quadrants in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. We explain each type using examples from news articles in U.S. newspapers on immigration from 1980 to 2016. Here, we have used LDA to iden- tify ideas in the form of topics, and we denote each idea with a pair of words most strongly associated with the corresponding topic.</p><p>Friendship (correlated over time, likely to cooc- cur). The "immigrant, undocumented" topic tends to cooccur with "obama, president" and both topics have been rising during the period of our dataset, likely because the "undocumented immigrants" narrative was an important part of Obama's fram- ing of the immigration issue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Haynes et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Head-to-head (anti-correlated over time, unlikely to cooccur). "immigrant, undocumented" and "ille- gal, alien" are in a head-to-head competition: these two topics rarely cooccur, and "immigrant, undocu- mented" has been growing in prevalence, while the usage of "illegal, alien" in newspapers has been de- clining. This observation agrees with a report from Pew Research Center <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guskin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Tryst (anti-correlated over time, likely to cooc- cur). The two off-diagonal examples use topics related to law enforcement. Overall, "immigration, deportation" and "detention, jail" often cooccur but "detention, jail" has been declining, while "immigra- tion, deportation" has been rising. This possibly re- lates to the promises to overhaul the immigration detention system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kalhan, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Arms-race (correlated over time, unlikely to cooccur). One of the above law enforcement top- ics ("immigration, deportation") and a topic on the Republican party ("republican, party") hold an arms- race relation: they are both growing in prevalence over time, but rarely cooccur, perhaps suggesting an underlying common cause.</p><p>Note that our terminology describes the rela- tions between ideas in texts, not necessarily be- tween the entities to which the ideas refer. For example, we find that the relation between "Is- rael" and "Palestine" is "friendship" in news ar- ticles on terrorism, based on their prevalence cor- relation and cooccurrence in that corpus.</p><p>We introduce the formal definition of our frame- work in §2 and apply it to news articles on five issues and research papers from ACL Anthology and NIPS as testbeds. We operationalize ideas us- ing topics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003</ref>) and keywords <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Monroe et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To explore whether the four relation types exist and how strong these relations are, we first exam- ine the marginal and joint distributions of cooccur- rence and prevalence correlation ( §3). We find that cooccurrence shows a unimodal normal-shaped distribution but prevalence correlation demon- strates more diverse distributions across corpora. As we would expect, there are, in general, more and stronger friendship and head-to-head relations than arms-race and tryst relations.</p><p>Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through in-depth case studies ( §4). We not only validate existing knowledge about some news issues and research areas, but also identify hypotheses that require further investigation. For example, using keywords to represent ideas, a top pair with the tryst relation in news articles on ter- rorism is "arab" and "islam"; they are likely to cooccur, but "islam" is rising in relative prevalence while "arab" is declining. This suggests a conjec- ture that the news media have increasingly linked terrorism to a religious group rather than an ethnic group. We also show relations between topics in ACL that center around machine translation.</p><p>Our work is a first step towards understanding relations between ideas from text corpora, a com- plex and important research question. We provide some concluding thoughts in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Computational Framework</head><p>The aim of our computational framework is to explore relations between ideas. We thus as- sume that the set of relevant ideas has been iden- tified, and those expressed in each document have been tabulated. Our open-source implementation is at https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/ idea_relations/. In the following, we in- troduce our formal definitions and datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>∀x, y ∈ I,</head><p>PMI(x, y) = logˆP logˆ logˆP (x, y)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ P (x) ˆ P (y) = C + log 1+ t k 1{x∈dt k }·1{y∈dt k } (1+ t k 1{x∈dt k })·(1+ t k 1{y∈dt k }) (1) ˆ r(x, y) = t ˆ P (x|t)− ˆ P (x|t) ˆ P (y|t)− ˆ P (y|t) t ˆ P (x|t)− ˆ P (x|t) 2 t ˆ P (y|t)− ˆ P (y|t) 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Figure 2: Eq. 1 is the empirical pointwise mutual information for two ideas, our measure of cooccur- rence of ideas; note that we use add-one smooth- ing in estimating PMI. Eq. 2 is the Pearson corre- lation between two ideas' prevalence over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Cooccurrence and Prevalence Correlation</head><p>As discussed in the introduction, we focus on two dimensions to quantify relations between ideas:</p><p>1. cooccurrence reveals to what extent two ideas tend to occur in the same contexts;</p><p>2. similarity between the relative prevalence of ideas over time reveals how two ideas relate in terms of popularity or coverage.</p><p>Our input is a collection of documents, each rep- resented by a set of ideas and indexed by time. We denote a static set of ideas as I and a text corpus that consists of these ideas as C = {D 1 , . . . , D T }, where D t = {d t 1 , . . . , d t N t } gives the collection of documents at timestep t, and each document, d t k , is represented as a subset of ideas in I. Here T is the total number of timesteps, and N t is the number of documents at timestep t. It follows that the total number of documents N = T t=1 N t . In order to formally capture the two dimensions above, we employ two commonly-used statistics. First, we use empirical pointwise mutual informa- tion (PMI) to capture the cooccurrence of ideas within the same document <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Church and Hanks, 1990)</ref>; see Eq. 1 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Positive PMI indi- cates that ideas occur together more frequently than would be expected if they were independent, while negative PMI indicates the opposite. Second, we compute the correlation between normalized document frequency of ideas to cap- ture the relation between the relative prevalence of ideas across documents over time; see Eq. 2 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Positivê r indicates that two ideas have similar prevalence over time, while negativê r sug-gests two anti-correlated ideas (i.e., when one goes up, the other goes down). The four types of relations in the introduction can now be obtained using PMI andˆrandˆ andˆr, which cap- ture cooccurrence and prevalence correlation re- spectively. We further define the strength of the relation between two ideas as the absolute value of the product of their PMI andˆrandˆ andˆr scores:</p><p>∀x, y ∈ I, strength(x, y) = | PMI(x, y)×ˆr×ˆr(x, y)|.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Datasets and Representation of Ideas</head><p>We use two types of datasets to validate our frame- work: news articles and research papers. We choose these two domains because competition between ideas has received significant interest in history of science <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kuhn, 1996)</ref> and research on framing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chong and Druckman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Entman, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gitlin, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lakoff, 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, interesting differences may exist in these two do- mains as news evolves with external events and scientific research progresses through innovations.</p><p>• News articles. We follow the strategy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Card et al. (2015)</ref> to obtain news articles from Lex- isNexis on five issues: abortion, immigration, same-sex marriage, smoking, and terrorism. We search for relevant articles using LexisNexis subject terms in U.S. newspapers from 1980 to 2016. Each of these corpora contains more than 25,000 articles. Please refer to the supplemen- tary material for details.</p><p>• Research papers. We consider full texts of pa- pers from two communities: our own ACL com- munity captured by papers from ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and TACL from 1980 to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Radev et al., 2009</ref>; and the NIPS community from 1987 to 2016. 3 There are 4.8K papers from the ACL community and 6.6K papers from the NIPS community. The processed datasets are available at https://chenhaot.com/ pages/idea-relations.html.</p><p>In order to operationalize ideas in a text corpus, we consider two ways to represent ideas.</p><p>• Topics. We extract topics from each document by running LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003</ref>) on each cor- pus C. In all datasets, we set the number of top- ics to 50. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Formally, I is the 50 topics learned from the corpus, and each document is repre- sented as the set of topics that are present with greater than 0.01 probability in the topic distri- bution for that document.</p><p>• Keywords. We identify a list of distinguish- ing keywords for each corpus by comparing its word frequencies to the background frequencies found in other corpora using the informative Dirichlet prior model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Monroe et al. (2008)</ref>. We set the number of keywords to 100 for all corpora. For news articles, the background cor- pus for each issue is comprised of all articles from the other four issues. For research papers, we use NIPS as the background corpus for ACL and vice versa to identify what are the core con- cepts for each of these research areas. Formally, I is the 100 top distinguishing keywords in the corpus and each document is represented as the set of keywords within I that are present in the document. Refer to the supplementary material for a list of example keywords in each corpus.</p><p>In both procedures, we lemmatize all words and add common bigram phrases to the vocabulary fol- lowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mikolov et al. (2013)</ref>. Note that in our analysis, ideas are only present or absent in a doc- ument, and a document can in principle be mapped to any subset of ideas in I. In our experiments 90% of documents are marked as containing be- tween 7 and 14 ideas using topics, 8 and 33 ideas using keywords.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Characterizing the Space of Relations</head><p>To provide an overview of the four relation types in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, we first examine the empirical distribu- tions of the two statistics of interest across pairs of ideas. In most exploratory studies, however, we are most interested in pairs that exemplify each type of relation, i.e., the most extreme points in each quadrant. We thus look at these pairs in each corpus to observe how the four types differ in salience across datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Empirical Distribution Properties</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, the distributions of pairwise cooccurrence and prevalence correlation have not been examined in previous literature. We thus first investigate the marginal distributions of cooccurrence and prevalence correlation and then our framework is to analyze relations between ideas, so this choice is not essential in this work. In these plots, we use topics to represent ideas. their joint distribution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref> shows three exam- ples: two from news articles and one from re- search papers. We will also focus our case studies on these three corpora in §4. The corresponding plots for keywords have been relegated to supple- mentary material due to space limitations. Cooccurrence tends to be unimodal but not normal. In all of our datasets, pairwise cooccur- rence ( PMI) presents a unimodal distribution that somewhat resembles a normal distribution, but it is rarely precisely normal. We cannot reject the hypothesis that it is unimodal for any dataset (us- ing topics or keywords) using the dip test <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hartigan and Hartigan, 1985)</ref>, though D'Agostino's K 2 test (D' <ref type="bibr">Agostino et al., 1990</ref>) rejects normality in almost all cases. Prevalence correlation exhibits diverse distri- butions. Pairwise prevalence correlation fol- lows different distributions in news articles com- pared to research papers: they are unimodal in news articles, but not in ACL or NIPS. The dip test only rejects the unimodality hypothesis in NIPS. None follow normal distributions based on D'Agostino's K 2 test. Cooccurrence is positively correlated with prevalence correlation. In all of our datasets, cooccurrence is positively correlated with preva- lence correlation whether we use topics or key- words to represent ideas, although the Pearson correlation coefficients vary. This suggests that there are more friendship and head-to-head rela- tions than tryst and arms-race relations. Based on the results of kernel density estimation, we also observe that this correlation is often loose, e.g., in ACL topics, cooccurrence spreads widely at each mode of prevalence correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>776</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Relative Strength of Extreme Pairs</head><p>We are interested in how our framework can iden- tify intriguing relations between ideas. These po- tentially interesting pairs likely correspond to the extreme points in each quadrant instead of the ones around the origin, where PMI and prevalence cor- relation are both close to zero. Here we com- pare the relative strength of extreme pairs in each dataset. We will discuss how these extreme pairs confirm existing knowledge and suggest new hy- potheses via case studies in §4.</p><p>For each relation type, we average the strengths of the 25 pairs with the strongest relations in that type, with strength defined in Eq. 3. This heuristic (henceforth collective strength) allows us to col- lectively compare the strengths of the most promi- nent friendship, tryst, arms-race, and head-to-head relations. The results are not sensitive to the choice of 25. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> shows the collective strength of the four types in all of our datasets. The most common ordering is:</p><p>friendship &gt; head-to-head &gt; arms-race &gt; tryst.</p><p>The fact that friendship and head-to-head relations are strong is consistent with the positive correla- tion between cooccurrence and prevalence corre- lation. In news, friendship is the strongest relation type, but head-to-head is the strongest in ACL top- ics and NIPS topics. This suggests, unsurprisingly, that there are stronger head-to-head competitions 1.4</p><p>1.6</p><p>1.8 collective strength friends tryst head-to-head arms-race (b) Keywords <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Collective strength of the four relation types in each dataset (news is the average of the news corpora and research is for ACL and NIPS). <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref> uses topics to represent ideas, while <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b</ref> uses keywords to represent ideas. Each bar presents the average strength of the top 25 pairs in a relation type in the corresponding dataset. Error bars represent standard errors calculated in the usual way, but note that since the top 25 pairs are not random samples, they cannot be interpreted in the usual way.</p><p>(i.e., one idea takes over another) between ideas in scientific research than in news. We also see that topics show greater strength in our scientific arti- cle collections, while keywords dominate in news, especially in friendship. We conjecture that terms in scientific literature are often overloaded (e.g., a tree could be a parse tree or a decision tree), neces- sitating some abstraction when representing ideas. In contrast, news stories are more self-contained and seek to employ consistent usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Exploratory Studies</head><p>We present case studies based on strongly re- lated pairs of ideas in the four types of relation. Throughout this section, "rank" refers to the rank of the relation strength between a pair of ideas in its corresponding relation type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">International Relations in Terrorism</head><p>Following a decade of declining violence in the 90s, the events of September 11, 2001 precipi- tated a dramatic increase in concern about ter- rorism, and a major shift in how it was framed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kern et al., 2003)</ref>. As a showcase, we consider a topic which encompasses much of the U.S. gov- ernment's response to terrorism: "federal, state". <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We observe two topics engaging in an "arms race" with this one: "afghanistan, taliban" and "pakistan, in- dia". These correspond to two geopolitical regions closely linked to the U.S. government's concern with terrorism, and both were sites of U.S. mili- tary action during the period of our dataset. Events abroad and the U.S. government's responses fol- low the arms-race pattern, each holding increasing <ref type="bibr">5</ref> As in §1, we summarize each topic using a pair of strongly associated words, instead of assigning a name.  attention with the other, likely because they share the same underlying cause.</p><p>We also observe two head-to-head rivals to the "federal, state" topic: "iran, libya" and "israel, pales- tinian". While these topics correspond to regions that are hotly debated in the U.S., their coverage in news tends not to correlate temporally with the U.S. government's responses to terrorism, at least during the time period of our corpus. Discussion of these regions was more prevalent in the 80s and 90s, with declining media coverage since then ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kern et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The relations between these topics are consis- tent with structural balance theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cartwright and Harary, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Heider, 1946)</ref>, which suggests that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. The "afghanistan, taliban" topic has the strongest friend- ship relation with the "pakistan, india" topic, i.e., they are likely to cooccur and are positively corre- lated in prevalence. Similarly, the "iran, libya" topic is a close "friend" with the "israel, palestinian" topic (ranked 8th in friendship). (c) ("federal, state", "iran, libya")</p><p>Figure 5: <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a</ref> shows the relations between the "federal, state" topic and four international topics. Edge colors indicate relation types and the number in an edge label presents the ranking of its strength in the corresponding relation type. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 5c</ref> represent concrete examples in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a</ref>: "federal, state" and "afghanistan, taliban" follow similar trends, although "afghanistan, taliban" fluctuates over time due to significant events such as the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the death of Bin Laden in 2011; while "iran, lybia" is negatively correlated with "federal, state". In fact, more than 70% of terrorism news in the 80s contained the "iran, lybia" topic.</p><p>When using keywords to represent ideas, we observe similar relations between the term home- land security and terms related to the above foreign countries. In addition, we highlight an interest- ing but unexpected tryst relation between arab and islam <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6)</ref>. It is not surprising that these two words tend to cooccur in the same news articles, but the usage of islam in the news is increasing while arab is declining. The increasing prevalence of islam and decreasing prevalence of arab over this time period can also be seen, for example, using Google's n-gram viewer, but it of course provides no information about cooccurrence.</p><p>This trend has not been previously noted to the best of our knowledge, although an article in the Huffington Post called for news editors to distin- guish Muslim from Arab. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Our observation sug- gests a conjecture that the news media have in- creasingly linked terrorism to a religious group rather than an ethnic group, perhaps in part due to the tie between the events of 9/11 and Afghanistan, which is not an Arab or Arabic-speaking country. We leave it to further investigation to confirm or reject this hypothesis.</p><p>To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare a pair's rank using only cooccurrence or prevalence correlation with its rank in our framework. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the results for three pairs above. If we had looked at only cooccurrence or prevalence correlation, we would probably have missed these interesting pairs.</p></div>

Al- though these words are likely to cooccur, their prevalence trajectories differ, with the discussion of Asian immigrants in the 1990s giving way to a focus on the word latino from 2000 onward. Pos- sible theories to explain this observation include that undocumented immigrants are generally per- ceived as a Latino issue, or that Latino voters are increasingly influential in U.S. elections. Furthermore, latino holds head-to-head relations with two subgroups of Latin American immi- grants: haitian and cuban. In particular, the strength of the relation with haitian is ranked #18 in head- to-head relations. Meanwhile, haitian and cuban have a friendship relation, which is again consis- tent with structural balance theory. The decreas- ing prevalence of haitian and cuban perhaps speaks to the shifting geographical focus of recent immi- gration to the U.S., and issues of the Latino pan- ethnicity. In fact, a majority of Latinos prefer to identify with their national origin relative to the </p></div>

However, we should also note that much of this coverage re- lates to a set of specific refugee crises, temporarily elevating the political importance of these nations in the U.S. Nevertheless, the underlying social and political reasons behind these head-to-head rela- tions are worth further investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Relations between Topics in ACL</head><p>Finally, we analyze relations between topics in the ACL Anthology. It turns out that "machine transla- tion" is at a central position among top ranked re- lations in all the four types <ref type="figure">(Fig. 8)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> It is part of the strongest relation in all four types except tryst (ranked #5). The full relation graph presents further patterns. Friendship demonstrates transitivity: both "ma- chine translation" and "word alignment" have similar relations with other topics. But such transitiv- ity does not hold for tryst: although the preva- lence of "rule, forest methods" is anti-correlated with both "machine translation" and "sentiment analysis", "sentiment analysis" seldom cooccurs with "rule, for-est methods" because "sentiment analysis" is seldom built on parsing algorithms. Similarly, "rule, forest methods" and "discourse (coherence)" hold an arms- race relation: they do not tend to cooccur and both decline in relative prevalence as "machine transla- tion" rises.</p><p>The prevalence of each of these ideas in com- parison to machine translation is shown in in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, which reveals additional detail.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: Overall distributions of cooccurrence and prevalence correlation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>We present two strands of related studies in addi- tion to what we have discussed. Trends in ideas. Most studies have so far exam- ined the trends of ideas individually <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Michel et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hall et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rule et al., 2015</ref>). For in- stance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hall et al. (2008)</ref> present various trends in our own computational linguistics community, in- cluding the rise of statistical machine translation. More recently, rhetorical framing has been used to predict these sorts of patterns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Prabhakaran et al., 2016</ref>). An exception is that <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shi et al. (2010)</ref> use prevalence correlation to analyze lag relations be- tween topics in publications and research grants. Anecdotally, Grudin (2009) observes a "head-to- head" relation between artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction in research funding. However, to our knowledge, our work is the first study to systematically characterize relations be- tween ideas. Representation of ideas. In addition to topics and keywords, studies have also sought to operational- ize the "memes" metaphor using quotes and text reuse in the media ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Leskovec et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Niculae et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Smith et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wei et al., 2013</ref> machine translation sentiment analysis <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: Relations between topics in ACL Anthology in the space of cooccurrence and prevalence correlation (prevalence correlation is shown explicitly and cooccurrence is encoded in row captions), color coded to match the text. The y-axis represents the relative proportion of papers in a year that contain the corresponding topic. The top 10 words for the rule, forest methods topic are rule, grammar, derivation, span, algorithm, forest, parsing, figure, set, string.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Concluding Discussion</head><p>We proposed a method to characterize relations between ideas in texts through the lens of cooc- currence within documents and prevalence corre- lation over time. For the first time, we observe that the distribution of pairwise cooccurrence is uni- modal, while the distribution of pairwise preva- lence correlation is not always unimodal, and show that they are positively correlated. This com- bination suggests four types of relations between ideas, and these four types are all found to varying extents in our experiments. We illustrate our computational method by ex- ploratory studies on news corpora and scientific research papers. We not only confirm existing knowledge but also suggest hypotheses around the usage of arab and islam in terrorism and latino and asian in immigration.</p><p>It is important to note that the relations found using our approach depend on the nature of the representation of ideas and the source of texts. For instance, we cannot expect relations found in news articles to reflect shifts in public opinion if news articles do not effectively track public opinion.</p><p>Our method is entirely observational. It remains as a further stage of analysis to understand the un- derlying reasons that lead to these relations be- tween ideas. In scientific research, for example, it could simply be the progress of science, i.e., newer ideas overtake older ones deemed less valuable at a given time; on the other hand, history suggests that it is not always the correct ideas that are most expressed, and many other factors may be impor- tant. Similarly, in news coverage, underlying so- ciological and political situations have significant impact on which ideas are presented, and how.</p><p>There are many potential directions to improve our method to account for complex relations be- tween ideas. For instance, we assume that both ideas and relations are statically grounded in key- words or topics. In reality, ideas and relations both evolve over time: a tryst relation might appear as friendship if we focus on a narrower time period. Similarly, new ideas show up and even the same idea may change over time and be represented by different words.</p></div>			</div>
