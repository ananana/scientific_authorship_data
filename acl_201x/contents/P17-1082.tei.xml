				<p>The sociolinguistic construct of stancetak-ing describes the activities through which discourse participants create and signal relationships to their interlocutors, to the topic of discussion, and to the talk itself. Stancetaking underlies a wide range of interactional phenomena, relating to formality, politeness, affect, and subjec-tivity. We present a computational approach to stancetaking, in which we build a theoretically-motivated lexicon of stance markers, and then use multidimensional analysis to identify a set of underlying stance dimensions. We validate these dimensions intrinsically and extrinsically, showing that they are internally coherent, match pre-registered hypotheses, and correlate with social phenomena.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>What does it mean to be welcoming or standoffish, light-hearted or cynical? Such interactional styles are performed primarily with language, yet little is known about how linguistic resources are arrayed to create these social impressions. The sociolin- guistic concept of interpersonal stancetaking at- tempts to answer this question, by providing a con- ceptual framework that accounts for a range of in- terpersonal phenomena, subsuming formality, po- liteness, and subjectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Du Bois, 2007)</ref>. 1 This <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Stancetaking is distinct from the notion of stance which corresponds to a position in a debate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Walker et al., 2012</ref>). Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Freeman et al. (2014)</ref> correlate phonetic features with the strength of such argumentative stances.</p><p>framework has been applied almost exclusively through qualitative methods, using close readings of individual texts or dialogs to uncover how lan- guage is used to position individuals with respect to their interlocutors and readers.</p><p>We attempt the first large-scale operationaliza- tion of stancetaking through computational meth- ods. Du Bois (2007) formalizes stancetaking as a multi-dimensional construct, reflecting the re- lationship of discourse participants to (a) the au- dience or interlocutor; (b) the topic of discourse; (c) the talk or text itself. However, the multi- dimensional nature of stancetaking poses prob- lems for traditional computational approaches, in which labeled data is obtained by relying on anno- tator intuitions about scalar concepts such polite- ness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013</ref>) and formality <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pavlick and Tetreault, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Instead, our approach is based on a theoretically-guided application of unsupervised learning, in the form of factor analysis, applied to lexical features. Stancetaking is characterized in large part by an array of linguistic features ranging from discourse markers such as actually to backchannels such as yep <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kiesling, 2009)</ref>. We therefore first compile a lexicon of stance markers, combining prior lexicons from Biber and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Finegan (1989)</ref> and the Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jurafsky et al., 1998</ref>). We then extend this lexicon to the social media domain using word embeddings. Finally, we apply multi-dimensional analysis of co-occurrence patterns to identify a small set of stance dimensions.</p><p>To measure the internal coherence (construct validity) of the stance dimensions, we use a word intrusion task <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chang et al., 2009</ref>) and a set of pre- registered hypotheses. To measure the utility of the stance dimensions, we perform a series of ex- trinsic evaluations. A predictive evaluation shows that the membership of online communities is de- termined in part by the interactional stances that predominate in those communities. Furthermore, the induced stance dimensions are shown to align with annotations of politeness and formality.</p><p>Contributions We operationalize the sociolin- guistic concept of stancetaking as a multi- dimensional framework, making it possible to measure at scale. Specifically,</p><p>• we contribute a lexicon of stance markers based on prior work and adapted to the genre of online interpersonal discourse;</p><p>• we group stance markers into latent dimensions;</p><p>• we show that these stance dimensions are inter- nally coherent;</p><p>• we demonstrate that the stance dimensions pre- dict and correlate with social phenomena. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>From a theoretical perspective, we build on prior work on interactional meaning in language. Methodologically, our paper relates to prior work on lexicon-based analysis and contrastive studies of social media communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Linguistic Variation and Social Meaning</head><p>In computational sociolinguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>, language variation has been studied pri- marily in connection with macro-scale social vari- ables, such as age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Argamon et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nguyen et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">), gender (Burger et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bamman et al., 2014</ref>), race <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eisenstein et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Blodgett et al., 2016)</ref>, and geography ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eisenstein et al., 2010)</ref>. This parallels what Eckert (2012) has called the "first wave" of language variation studies in sociolinguistics, which also focused on macro-scale variables.</p><p>More recently, sociolinguists have dedicated in- creased attention to situational and stylistic varia- tion, and the interactional meaning that such vari- ation can convey <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Eckert and Rickford, 2001</ref>). This linguistic research can be aligned with com- putational efforts to quantify phenomena such as subjectivity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Riloff and Wiebe, 2003)</ref>, senti- ment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wiebe et al., 2005</ref>), politeness (Danescu- Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mizil et al., 2013)</ref>, formality <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pavlick and Tetreault, 2016)</ref>, and power dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Prabhakaran et al., 2012)</ref>. While linguistic research on interactional meaning has focused largely on qualitative methodologies such as discourse anal- ysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bucholtz and Hall, 2005</ref>), these com- putational efforts have made use of crowdsourced annotations to build large datasets of, for example, polite and impolite text. These annotation efforts draw on the annotators' intuitions about the mean- ing of these sociolinguistic constructs.</p><p>Interpersonal stancetaking represents an at- tempt to unify concepts such as sentiment, polite- ness, formality, and subjectivity under a single the- oretical framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jaffe, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kiesling, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The key idea, as articulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Du Bois (2007)</ref>, is that stancetaking captures the speaker's relation- ship to (a) the topic of discussion, (b) the inter- locutor or audience, and (c) the talk (or writing) itself. Various configurations of these three legs of the "stance triangle" can account for a range of phenomena. For example, epistemic stance re- lates to the speaker's certainty about what is be- ing expressed, while affective stance indicates the speaker's emotional position with respect to the content <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ochs, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The framework of stancetaking has been widely adopted in linguistics, particularly in the discourse analytic tradition, which involves close reading of individual texts or conversations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kärkkäinen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Keisanen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Precht, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">White, 2003)</ref>. But despite its strong theoretical foundation, we are aware of no prior efforts to operationalize stancetaking at scale. Since annotators may not have strong intuitions about stance -in the way that they do about formality and politeness -we cannot rely on the annotation methodologies em- ployed in prior work. We take a different ap- proach, performing a multidimensional analysis of the distribution of likely stance markers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Lexicon-based Analysis</head><p>Our operationalization of stancetaking is based on the induction of lexicons of stance markers. The lexicon-based methodology is related to earlier work from social psychology, such as the Gen- eral Inquirer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stone, 1966)</ref> and LIWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010)</ref>. In LIWC, the basic cate- gories were identified first, based on psychological constructs (e.g., positive emotion, cognitive pro- cesses, drive to power) and syntactic groupings of words and phrases (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, quantifiers). The lexicon designers then manually contructed lexicons for each category, augmenting their intuitions by using distributional statistics to suggest words that may have been missed <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pennebaker et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, we follow the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Biber (1991)</ref>, using multidimensional analysis to identify latent groupings of markers based on co-occurrence statistics. We then use crowdsourcing and extrinsic comparisons to val- idate the coherence of these dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Multicommunity Studies</head><p>Social media platforms such as Reddit, Stack Ex- change, and Wikia can be considered multicom- munity environments, in that they host multiple subcommunities with distinct social and linguis- tic properties. Such subcommunities can be con- trasted in terms of topics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adamic et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hessel et al., 2014</ref>) and social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Backstrom et al., 2006</ref>). Our work focuses on Red- dit, emphasizing community-wide differences in norms for interpersonal interaction. In the same vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tan and Lee (2015)</ref> attempt to characterize stylistic differences across subreddits by focusing on very common words and parts-of-speech; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tran and Ostendorf (2016)</ref> use language models and topic models to measure similarity across threads within a subreddit. One distinction of our ap- proach is that the use of multidimensional analy- sis gives us interpretable dimensions of variation. This makes it possible to identify the specific in- terpersonal features that vary across communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Reddit, one of the internet's largest social me- dia platforms, is a collection of subreddits or- ganized around various topics of interest. As of January 2017, there were more than one mil- lion subreddits and nearly 250 million users, dis- cussing topics ranging from politics (r/politics) to horror stories (r/nosleep). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Although Reddit was originally designed for sharing hyperlinks, it also provides the ability to post original textual content, submit comments, and vote on content quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gilbert, 2013</ref>). Reddit's conversation-like threads are therefore well suited for the study of interpersonal social and linguistic phenomena.  For example, the following are two comments from the subreddit r/malefashionadvice, posted in response to a picture posted by a user asking for fashion advise. U 1 : "I think the beard looks pretty good. Defi- nitely not the goatee. Clean shaven is always the safe option."</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U 2 :</formula><p>"Definitely the beard. But keep it trimmed."</p><p>The phrases in bold face are markers of stance, indicating a evaluative stance. The following example is a part of a thread in the subreddit r/photoshopbattles where users discuss an edited image posted by the original poster OP. The phrases in bold face are markers of stance, indicating an involved and interactional stance. We used an archive of 530 million comments posted on Reddit in 2014, retrieved from the pub- lic archive of Reddit comments. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> This dataset consists of each post's textual content, along with metadata that identifies the subreddit, thread, au- thor, and post creation time. More statistics about the full dataset are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Stance Lexicon</head><p>Interpersonal stancetaking can be characterized in part by an array of linguistic features such as hedges (e.g., might, kind of ), discourse markers (e.g., actually, I mean), and backchannels (e.g., yep, um). Our analysis focuses on these markers, which we collect into a lexicon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Seed lexicon</head><p>We began with a seed lexicon of stance markers from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Biber and Finegan (1989)</ref>, who compiled an extensive list by surveying dictionaries, previous studies on stance, and texts in several genres of English. This list includes certainty adverbs (e.g., actually, of course, in fact), affect markers (e.g., amazing, thankful, sadly), and hedges (e.g., kind of, maybe, something like) among other adverbial, adjectival, verbal, and modal markers of stance. In total, this list consists of 448 stance markers.</p><p>The <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Biber and Finegan (1989)</ref> lexicon is pri- marily based on written genres from the pre-social media era. Our dataset -like much of the re- cent work in this domain -consists of online dis- cussions, which differ significantly from printed texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eisenstein, 2013)</ref>. One difference is that online discussions contain a number of dialog act markers that are characteristic of spoken language, such as oh yeah, nah, wow. We accounted for this by adding 74 dialog act markers from the Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jurafsky et al., 1998</ref>). The final seed lexicon consists of 517 unique markers, from these two sources. Note that the seed lexicon also includes markers that contain multiple tokens (e.g. kind of, I know).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Lexicon expansion</head><p>Online discussions differ not only from writ- ten texts, but also from spoken discussions, due to their use of non-standard vocabulary and spellings. To measure stance accurately, these genre differences must be accounted for. We therefore expanded the seed lexicon using auto- mated techniques based on distributional statistics. This is similar to prior work on the expansion of sentiment lexicons <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hamilton et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our lexicon expansion approach used word em- beddings to find words that are distributionally similar to those in the seed set. We trained word embeddings on a corpus of 25 million Reddit com- ments and a vocabulary of 100K most frequent words on Reddit using the structured skip-gram models of both WORD2VEC <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) and WANG2VEC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ling et al., 2015</ref>) with default parameters. The WANG2VEC method augments WORD2VEC by accounting for word order infor- mation. We found the similarity judgments ob- tained from WANG2VEC to be qualitatively more meaningful, so we used these embeddings to con- struct the expanded lexicon. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seed term</head><p>Expanded terms (Example seeds from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Biber and Finegan (1989)</ref>) significantly considerably, substantially, dramatically certainly surely, frankly, definitely incredibly extremely, unbelievably, exceptionally  To perform lexicon expansion, we constructed a dictionary of candidate terms, consisting of all unigrams that occur with a frequency rate of at least 10 −7 in the Reddit comment corpus. Then, for each single-token marker in the seed lexi- con, we identified all terms from the candidate set whose embedding has cosine similarity of at least 0.75 with respect to the seed marker. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Ta- ble 2 shows examples of seed markers and re- lated terms we extracted from word embeddings. Through this procedure, we identified 228 addi- tional markers based on similarity to items in the seed list from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Biber and Finegan (1989)</ref>, and 112 additional markers based on the seed list of dia- log acts. In total, our stance lexicon contains 812 unique markers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Linguistic Dimensions of Stancetaking</head><p>To summarize the main axes of variation across the lexicon of stance markers, we apply a multi- dimensional analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Biber, 1992)</ref> to the distribu- tional statistics of stance markers across subred- dit communities. Each dimension of variation can then be viewed as a spectrum, characterized by the stance markers and subreddits that are associated with the positive and negative extremes. Multi- dimensional analysis is based on singular value decomposition, which has been applied success- fully to a wide range of problems in natural lan- guage processing and information retrieval (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Landauer et al., 1998</ref>). While Bayesian topic mod- els are an appealing alternative, singular value de- composition is fast and deterministic, with a min- imal number of tuning parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Extracting Stance Dimensions</head><p>Our analysis is based on the co-occurrence of stance markers and subreddits. This is motivated by our interest in comparisons of the interactional styles of online communities within Reddit, and by the premise that these distributional differences reflect socially meaningful communicative norms. A pilot study applied the same technique to the co- occurrence of stance markers and individual au- thors, and the resulting dimensions appeared to be less stylistically coherent.</p><p>Singular value decomposition is often used in combination with a transformation of the co- occurrence counts by pointwise mutual informa- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bullinaria and Levy, 2007)</ref>. This transforma- tion ensures that each cell in the matrix indicates how much more likely a stance marker is to co- occur with a given subreddit than would happen by chance under an independence assumption. Be- cause negative PMI values tend to be unreliable, we use positive PMI (PPMI), which involves re- placing all negative PMI values with zeros <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Niwa and Nitta, 1994)</ref>. Therefore, we obtain stance di- mensions by applying singular value decomposi- tion to the matrix constructed as follows: Truncated singular value decomposition per- forms the approximate factorization X ≈ U ΣV , where each row of the matrix U is a k-dimensional description of each stance marker, and each row of V is a k-dimensional description of each subred- dit. We included the 7,589 subreddits that received at least 1,000 comments in 2014.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results: Stance Dimensions</head><p>From the SVD analysis, we extracted the six prin- cipal latent dimensions that explain the most vari- ation in our dataset. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The decision to include only the first six dimensions was based on the strength of the singular values corresponding to the dimen- sions. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the top five stance markers for each extreme of the six dimensions. The stance dimensions convey a range of concepts, such as involved versus informational language, narrative <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Similar to factor analysis, the top few dimensions of SVD explain the most variation, and tend to be most inter- pretable. A scree plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cattell, 1966)</ref> showed that the amount of variation explained dropped after the top six dimensions, and qualitative interpretation showed that the remaining di- mension were less interpretable.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Mapping of subreddits in dimension two and dimension three, highlighting especially popular subreddits. Picture-oriented subreddits r/gonewild and r/aww map high on dimension two and low on dimension three, indicating involved and informal style of discourse. Subreddits ded- icated for knowledge sharing discussions such as r/askscience and r/space map low on dimension two and high on dimension three indicating infor- mational and formal style.</p><p>versus dialogue-oriented writing, standard versus non-standard variation, and positive versus nega- tive affect. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the distribution of sub- reddits along two of these dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Construct Validity</head><p>Evaluating model output against gold-standard an- notations is appropriate when there is some no- tion of a correct answer. As stancetaking is a multidimensional concept, we have taken an unsu- pervised approach. Therefore, we use evaluation techniques based on the notion of validity, which is the extent to which the operationalization of a construct truly captures the intended quantity or concept. Validation techniques for unsupervised content analysis are widely found in the social sci- ence literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Weber, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Quinn et al., 2010)</ref> and have also been recently used in the NLP and machine learning communities (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chang</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: For each of the six dimensions extracted by our method, we show the five markers and three subreddits (among the 100 most popular subreddits) with the highest loadings.</p><p>ingful, thereby testing the construct or content va- lidity of the proposed stance dimensions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Quinn et al., 2010)</ref>. Extrinsic evaluations are presented in section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Word Intrusion Task</head><p>A word intrusion task is used to measure the co- herence and interpretability of a group of words. Human raters are presented with a list of terms, all but one of which are selected from a target con- cept; their task is to identify the intruder. If the target concept is internally coherent, human raters should be able to perform this task accurately; if not, their selections should be random. Word in- trusion tasks have previously been used to validate the interpretability of topic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chang et al., 2009)</ref> and vector space models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Murphy et al., 2012</ref>). We deployed a word intrusion task on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), in which we presented the top four stance markers from one end of a di- mension, along with an intruder marker selected from the top four markers of the opposite end of that dimension. In this way, we created four word intrusion tasks for each end of each dimension. The main reason for including only the top four words in each dimension is the expense of con- ducting crowd-sourced evaluations. In the most relevant prior work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chang et al. (2009)</ref> used the top five words from each topic in their evaluation of topic models.</p><p>Worker selection We required that the AMT workers ("turkers") have completed a minimum of 1,000 HITs and have at least 95% approval rate Furthermore, because our task is based on analysis of English language texts, we required the turkers to be native speakers of English living in one of the majority English speaking countries. As a fur- ther requirement, we required the turkers to obtain a qualification which involves an English compre- hension test similar to the questions in standard- ized English language tests. These requirements are based on best practices identified by <ref type="bibr">CallisonBurch and Dredze (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Task specification Each AMT human intelli- gence task (HIT) consists of twelve word intrusion tasks, one for each end of the six dimensions. We provided minimal instructions regarding the task, and did not provide any examples, to avoid intro- ducing bias. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> As a further quality control, each HIT included three questions which ask the turkers to pick the best synonym for a given word from a list of five answers, where one answer was clearly correct; Turkers who gave incorrect answers were to be excluded, but this situation did not arise in practice. Altogether each HIT consists of 15 ques- tions, and was paid US$1.50. Five different turk- ers performed each HIT.</p><p>Results We measured the interrater reliability using <ref type="bibr">Krippendorf's α (Krippendorff, 2007)</ref> and the model precision metric of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chang et al. (2009)</ref>. Results on both metrics were encouraging. We obtained a value of α = 0.73, on a scale where α = 0 indicates chance agreement and α = 1 indi- cates perfect agreement. The model precision was 0.82; chance precision is 0.20. To offer a sense of typical values for this metric, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chang et al. (2009)</ref> report model precisions in the range 0.7-0.83 in their analysis of topic models. Overall, these re- sults indicate that the multi-dimensional analysis has succeeded at identifying dimensions that re- flect natural groupings of stance markers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Pre-registered Hypotheses</head><p>Content validity was also assessed using a set of pre-registered hypotheses. The practice of pre- registering hypotheses before an analysis and test- ing the correctness is widely used in the social sciences; it was adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sim et al. (2013)</ref> to evaluate the induction of political ideological models from text. Before performing the muti- dimensional analysis, we identified two groups of hypotheses that are expected to hold with respect to the latent stancetaking dimensions using our prior linguistic knowledge:</p><p>• Hypothesis I: Stance markers that are syn- onyms should not appear on the opposite ends of a stance dimension.</p><p>• Hypothesis II: If at least one stance marker from a predefined stance feature group (de- fined below) appears on one end of a stance dimension, then other markers from the same feature group will tend not to appear at the opposite end of the same dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Synonym Pairs</head><p>For each marker in our stance lexicon, we ex- tracted synonyms from Wordnet, focusing on markers that appear in only one Wordnet synset, and not including pairs in which one term was an inflection of the other. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Our final list contains 73 synonym pairs (e.g., eventually/finally, grate- ful/thankful, yea/yeah). Of these pairs, there were 59 cases in which both terms appeared in either the top or bottom 200 positions of a stance dimension. In 51 of these cases (86%), the two terms appeared on the same side of the dimension. The chance rate would be 50%, so this supports Hypothesis I and 9 It is possible that inflections are semantically similar, be- cause by definition they are changes in the form of a word to mark distinctions such as tense, person, or number. However, different inflections of a single word form might be used to mark different stances (e.g., some stances might be associ- ated with the past while others might be associated with the present or future). <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Stance Dimension On same end On opposite ends   DIMENSION 1  6  3  DIMENSION 2  12  2  DIMENSION 3  2  1  DIMENSION 4  11  0  DIMENSION 5  10  2  DIMENSION 6</ref> 10 0</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of synonym pairs</head><p>Total 51/59 8/59 <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Results for pre-registered hypothesis that stance dimensions will not split synonym pairs.</p><p>further validates the stance dimensions. More de- tails of the results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Note that synonym pairs may differ in aspects such as for- mality (e.g., said/informed, want/desire), which is one of the main dimensions of stancetaking. Therefore, perfect support for Hypothesis I is not expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Stance Feature Groups</head><p>Biber and Finegan (1989) group stance markers into twelve "feature groups", such as certainty adverbs, doubt adverbs, affect expressions, and hedges. Ideally, the stance dimensions should pre- serve these groupings. To test this, for each of the seven feature groups with at least ten stance markers in the lexicon, we counted the number of terms appearing among the top 200 positions in both ends (high/low) of each dimension. Un- der the null hypothesis, the stance dimensions are random with respect to the feature groups, so we would expect roughly an equal number of mark- ers on both ends. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, for five of the seven feature groups, it is possible to reject the null hypothesis at p &lt; .007, which is the signifi- cance threshold at α = 0.05, after correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correc- tion. This indicates that the stance dimensions are aligned with predefined stance feature groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Extrinsic Evaluations</head><p>The evaluations in the previous section test inter- nal validity; we now describe evaluations testing whether the stance dimensions are relevant to ex- ternal social and interactional phenomena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Predicting Cross-posting</head><p>Online communities can be considered as commu- nities of practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 1992)</ref>, where members come together to engage in shared linguistic practices. These practices   <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Results for preregistered hypothesis that stance dimensions will align with stance feature groups of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Biber and Finegan (1989)</ref>.</p><p>evolve simultaneously with membership, coalesc- ing into shared norms. The memberships of mul- tiple subreddits on the same topic (e.g., r/science and r/askscience) often do not overlap consider- ably. Therefore we hypothesize that users of Red- dit have preferred interactional styles, and that par- ticipation in subreddit communities is governed not only by topic interest, but also by these inter- actional preferences. The proposed stancetaking dimensions provide a simple measure of interac- tional style, allowing us to test whether it is pre- dictive of community membership decisions.</p><p>Classification task We design a classification task, in which the goal is to determine whether a pair of subreddits is high-crossover or low- crossover. In high-crossover subreddit pairs, indi- viduals are especially likely to participate in both.</p><p>For the purpose of this evaluation, individuals are considered to participate in a subreddit if they con- tribute posts or comments. We compute the point- wise mutual information (PMI) with respect to cross-participation among the 100 most popular subreddits. For each subreddit s, we identify the five highest and lowest PMI pairs s, t, and add these to the high-crossover and low-crossover sets, respectively. Example pairs are shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>After eliminating redundant pairs, we identify 437 unique high-crossover pairs, and 465 unique low- crossover pairs. All evaluations are based on mul- tiple random training/test splits over this dataset.</p><p>Classification approaches A simple classifica- tion approach is to predict that subreddits with similar text will have high crossover. We mea- sure similarity using TF-IDF weighted cosine sim- ilarity, using two possible lexicons: the 8,000 most frequent words on reddit (BOW), and the stance lexicon (STANCE MARKERS).

We also tested the relevance of multi-dimensional analysis, by applying SVD to both lexicons.

Regularization was tuned by internal cross- validation.</p><p>Results <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows average accuracies for these models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Politeness and Formality</head><p>The utility of the induced stance dimensions de- pends on their correlation with social phenomena of interest. Prior work has used crowdsourcing to annotate texts for politeness and formality. We now evaluate the stancetaking properties of these annotated texts.</p><p>Data We used the politeness corpus of Wikipedia edit requests from Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mizil et al. (2013)</ref>, which includes the textual content of the edit requests, along with scalar annotations of politeness. Following the original authors, we compare the text for the messages ranked in the first and fourth quartiles of polite- ness scores. For formality, we used the corpus from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pavlick and Tetreault (2016)</ref>, focusing on the blogs domain, which is most similar to our domain of Reddit. Each sentence in this corpus was annotated for formality levels from −3 to +3. We considered only the sentences with mean formality score greater than +1 (more formal) and less than −1 (less formal).</p><p>Stance dimensions For each document in the above datasets, we compute the stance properties, as follows: for each dimension, we compute the total frequency of the hundred most positive terms and the hundred most negative terms, and then take the difference. Instances containing no terms from either list are excluded. We focus on stance dimensions two and five (summarized in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), because they appeared to be most relevant to po- liteness and formality. Dimension two contrasts informational and argumentative language against emotional and non-standard language. Dimension five contrasts positive and formal language against non-standard and somewhat negative language.</p><p>Results A kernel density plot of the resulting differences is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>. The effect sizes of the resulting differences are quantified using Cohen's d statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>. Effect sizes for all differences are between 0.3 and 0.4, indicating small-to-medium effects -except for the evalu- ation of formality on dimension five, where the effect size is close to zero. The relatively mod- est effect sizes are unsurprising, given the short length of the texts. However, these differences lend insight to the relationship between formal- ity and politeness, which may seem to be closely related concepts. On dimension two, it is possi- ble to be polite while using non-standard language such as hehe and awww, so long as the sentiment expressed is positive; however, these markers are not consistent with formality. On dimension five, we see that positive sentiment terms such as lovely and stunning are consistent with politeness, but not with formality. Indeed, the distribution of di- mension five indicates that both ends of dimension five are consistent only with informal texts.</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that interactional phenomena such as politeness and formality are reflected in our stance dimensions, which are in- duced in an unsupervised manner. Future work may consider the utility of these stance dimen- sions to predict these social phenomena, particu- larly in cross-domain settings where lexical clas- sifiers may overfit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>Stancetaking provides a general perspective on the various linguistic phenomena that structure social interactions. We have identified a set of several hundred stance markers, building on previously- identified lexicons by using word embeddings to perform lexicon expansion. We then used multi- dimensional analysis to group these markers into stance dimensions, which we show to be internally coherent and extrinsically useful. Our hope is that these stance dimensions will be valuable as a con- venient building block for future research on inter- actional meaning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Subreddits</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
