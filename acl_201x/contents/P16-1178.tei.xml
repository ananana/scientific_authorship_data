				<p>Online news editors ask themselves the same question many times: what is missing in this news article to go online? This is not an easy question to be answered by computational linguistic methods. In this work, we address this important question and characterise the constituents of news article editorial quality. More specifically, we identify 14 aspects related to the content of news articles. Through a correlation analysis, we quantify their independence and relation to assessing an article&apos;s editorial quality. We also demonstrate that the identified aspects, when combined together , can be used effectively in quality control methods for online news.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A recent study 1 found that online news is nowa- days the main source of news for the population in the 18-29 age group (71%), and as popular as TV in the 30-39 age group (63%). The readers appetite for high-quality online news result in an offer of thousands of articles published every day in the whole of the Web. For instance, it is not un- common to find the same facts reported by many different online news articles. However, only a few of them actually grab the attention of the read- ers. Journalists and editors follow standardised discourse rules and techniques aiming at engaging the reader in the article's narrative of article ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Louis and Nenkova, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Analysing the discourse of such articles is cen- tral to properly assessing the quality of online * This work was done while the authors were at Ya- hoo!Research Barcelona.</p><p>1 http://www.people-press.org/2013/08/08/amid- criticism-support-for-medias-watchdog-role-stands-out news <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983)</ref>. Defining the variables that computational linguistics should quantify is a challenging task. Several questions arise from this exercise. For example, what does the quality refer to? What makes a new article per- ceived as high quality by the editors/users? What aspects of an article correlate better with its per- ceived quality? Can we predict the quality of an article using linguistic features extracted from its content? These are the kind of questions we ad- dress in this paper.</p><p>To this end, we propose a linguistic resource and assessment methodology to quantify the ed- itorial quality of online news discourse. We ar- gue that quality is too complex to be represented by a single number and should be instead decom- posed into a set of simpler variables that capture the different linguistic and narrative aspects of on- line news. Thus, we depart from current literature and propose a multidimensional representation of quality. The first contribution of this paper is a taxonomy of 14 different content aspects that are associated with the editor-perceived quality of on- line news articles. The proposed 14 aspects are the result of an editorial study involving professional editors, journalists, and computational linguists.</p><p>The second contribution of this paper is an expert-annotated corpus of online news articles obtained from a major news portal. This corpus is curated by the editors and journalists who an- notated the articles with respect to the 14 aspects and to the general editorial quality. To confirm the independence and relevance of the proposed aspects, we perform a correlation analysis on this ground-truth to determine the strength of the asso- ciations between different aspects and article edi- torial quality. Our analysis shows that the editor- perceived quality of an article exhibits a strong positive correlation with certain aspects, such as fluency and completeness, while it is weakly cor- related with other aspects like subjectivity and po- larity.</p><p>As a baseline benchmark, we investigate the feasibility of predicting the quality aspects of an article using features extracted from the article only. Our findings indicate that article editorial quality prediction is a challenging task and that ar- ticle quality can be predicted to a varying degree, depending on the feature space. The proposed as- pects can be used to control the editorial quality with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.398 on a 5-point Likert-scale.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Next, we discuss existing literature in discourse analysis and text quality metrics. In Section 3, we present the aspects that we identified as po- tential indicators of article quality. Section 4 pro- vides the details of our online news corpus target- ing the aspects of editorial quality control. The results of the correlation analysis conducted be- tween the identified aspects and article quality are presented in Section 4. In Section 5, we present a baseline benchmark to automatically infer individ- ual aspects and editorial quality from online news.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>A very recent work related to ours is ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gao et al., 2014)</ref>, where the authors try to predict the inter- estingness of a news article for a user who is cur- rently reading another news article. In our work, however, we try to predict the perceived quality of an article without using any context information other than the content of the article itself. More- over, while the authors of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gao et al., 2014</ref>) take a quite pragmatic approach to handle the prob- lem, we follow a more principled approach and model the quality of a news article according to five orthogonal dimensions: readability, informa- tiveness, style, topic, and sentiment. Work has been done in each one of these dimensions, but none has tackled the problem of modelling overall article quality in a comprehensive and articulated manner as we do. Below, we provide a survey of the previous work on these dimensions.</p><p>The readability of a piece of text can be de- fined as the ease that the text can be processed and understood by a human reader ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Richards and Schmidt, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zamanian and Heydari, 2012</ref>). The readability is usually associated with fluency and writing quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nenkova et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pitler and Nenkova, 2008)</ref>. Even though there is a sig- nificant amount of research that targets readabil- ity, most work <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Redish, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yan et al., 2006</ref>) were originally designed to measure the readabil- ity of school books and do not suit well to more complex reading materials, such as news articles, which form the focus of our work.</p><p>The informativeness of a news article has been tackled from several different angles. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tang et al., 2003)</ref>, news information quality was charac- terised by a set of nine aspects that were shown to have a good correlation with textual features. Catchy titles were shown to often lead to frustra- tion, as the reader does not get the content that she expects (Louis and Nenkova, 2011). The task of assessing a news title's descriptiveness is re- lated to semantic text similarity and has been re- searched by the SemEval initiative ( <ref type="bibr">Agirre et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, the completeness of a news ar- ticle is an aspect that has been considered in the past by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Louis and Nenkova, 2014)</ref>, which showed that reporting the news with adequate detail is key to provide the reader with enough information to grasp the entire story. The freshness of news in- formation also sets the tone of the discourse: in- formation can be novel to the average reader or it can be already known and be presented as a ref- erence to the reader. The novelty of an article is essentially accomplished by either analysing pre- vious articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gamon, 2006</ref>) or by relying on real- time data from social-media services <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Phelan et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>The characterisation of the style of text compo- sitions has been an active topic of research in com- munication sciences and humanities. An excellent example of the research done in this area is the in- fluential work in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McNamara et al., 2009)</ref>, where the authors found the best predictors of writing quality to be the syntactic complexity (number of words before the main verb), the diversity of words used by the author, and some other shallow features. In NLP, the writing style has been inves- tigated in several contexts. A problem relevant to the one we addressed is the characterisation of an author's writing style to predict the success of nov- els ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ashok et al., 2013)</ref>. The authors investigated a wide range of complex linguistic features, ranging from simple unigrams to distribution of word cate- gories, grammar rules, distribution of constituents, sentiment, and connotation. The comparison of novels and news articles revealed a great similar-ity in the writing style of novels and informative articles.</p><p>The broadness of a news topic has an impact on the reader's perceived quality of the article. A technical article is usually targeting niche groups of users and a popular article targets the masses. One of the few corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Louis and Nenkova, 2013)</ref> addressing quality was limited to the domain of scientific journalism, thus more technical articles. This corpus only considered news from the New York Times, thus contained already very good quality news. Two recent work investigated the feasibility of predicting news articles' feature pop- ularity in social media at cold start ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bandari et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arapakis et al., 2014a</ref>). In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bandari et al., 2012)</ref>, features extracted from the article's content as well as additional meta-data was used to pre- dict the number of times an article will be shared in Twitter after it went online. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arapakis et al., 2014a</ref>), a similar study was repeated to predict the popularity of a news article in social media using additional features obtained from external sources.</p><p>Sentiment analysis concerns the subjectivity and the strength and sign of the opinions expressed in a given piece of text. In ( <ref type="bibr">Arapakis et al., 2014b</ref>), it was demonstrated that news articles exhibit con- siderable variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Phelan et al., 2009</ref>) has provided evidence that sentiment- related aspects are important to profile and assess the quality of news articles. Sentiment analysis has been applied to news articles in other contexts as well ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Godbole et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balahur et al., 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Modeling News Article Quality</head><p>The editorial control of news articles is an un- solved task that involves addressing a number of issues, such as identifying the characteristics of an effective text, determining what methods produce reliable and valid judgments for text quality, as well as selecting appropriate aspects of text evalu- ation that can be automated using machine learn- ing methods. Underlying these tasks is a main theme: can we identify benchmarks for character- ising news article quality? Therefore, there is a need for empirical work to identify the global and local textual features which will help us make an optimal evaluation of news articles.</p><p>By doing so, we achieve two goals. On one hand, we can offer valuable insights with respect to what constitutes an engaging, good quality news article. On the other hand, we can identify bench- marks for characterising news article quality in an automatic and scalable way and, thus, predict poor writing before a news article is even published. This can help reduce greatly the burden of manual evaluation which is currently performed by profes- sional editors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Methodology</head><p>The methodology described here provides a framework for characterising and modelling news article editorial quality. In our work, we follow a bottom-up approach and identify 14 different content aspects that are good predictors (as we demonstrate in Section 6.1) of news article qual- ity. The aspects we identified are informed by input from news editors, journalists and compu- tational linguists, and previous research in NLP and, particularly, the efforts in text summarisa- tion (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2012), document un- derstanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Seki et al., 2006</ref>) and question answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Surdeanu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shtok et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>After discussing the editorial quality control with professionals, we gathered a set of heuristics and examined the literature for ways of design- ing quantitative measures to achieve our goal. We group the aspects under five headings: readability, informativeness, style, topic, and sentiment (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Below, we provide a brief description of each aspect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Readability</head><p>High quality articles are written in a way that makes them easier to read. In our model, we in- clude two different aspects related to readability <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pitler and Nenkova, 2008)</ref>: fluency and concise- ness. Fluency: Fluent articles are built from sentence to sentence, forming a coherent body of informa- tion. Consecutive sentences are meaningfully con- nected. Similarly, paragraphs are written in a log- ical sequence. Conciseness: Concise articles have a focus. Sen- tences contain information that is related to the main theme of the article. The same or similar information is tried to be not repeated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Informativeness</head><p>As a main reason for reading online news is to remain well-informed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tang et al., 2003)</ref>, infor- mativeness of articles have an effect on their per- ceived quality. In our model, we consider four dif- ferent aspects related to informativeness: descrip- tiveness, novelty, completeness, and referencing. Descriptiveness: Descriptiveness indicates how well the title of an article reflects its main body content. Titles with low descriptiveness are often click baits (e.g., "You won't believe what you will see"). Such titles may lead to dissatisfaction, as the provided news content usually does not meet the raised user expectation. Novelty: Novel articles provide new and valuable information to the readers. The provided informa- tion is unlikely to be known to an average reader. Completeness: Complete articles cover the topic in an adequate level of detail ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Louis and Nenkova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bouayad-Agha et al., 2012)</ref>. A reader can satisfy her information need after reading such an article. Referencing: Referencing is about the degree to which the article references external sources (in- cluding other people's opinions and related arti- cles). Providing references allows the reader to access related information sources easily, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gamon, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Style</head><p>The language and aesthetics is also related to the article quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McNamara et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ashok et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pavlick and Tetreault, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peterson et al., 2011</ref>). We consider three style-related aspects: formality, richness, and attractiveness. Formality: Formal articles are written by follow- ing certain writing guidelines. They are more likely to contain formal words and obey punctu- ation/grammar rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Peterson et al., 2011)</ref>. Richness: The vocabulary of rich articles is per- ceived as diverse and interesting by the readers. Rich articles are not written in a plain and straight- forward manner.</p><p>Attractiveness: Attractiveness measures the de- gree to which the title of an article raises curios- ity in its readers. Attractive titles entice people to continue reading the main content of the article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Topic</head><p>Editors consider the nature of the article with re- spect to its target audience, i.e., according to the target audience (technical or popular) the other as- pects may play a different role. We investigate two topic-related aspects: technicality and popularity. Technicality: Technical articles (Louis and Nenkova, 2013) usually require some effort to un- derstand as well as previous knowledge on the topic. Examples of usually technical news topics include science and finance. Popularity: The popularity refers to the size of the audience who would be interested in the topic of the article ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bandari et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Arapakis et al., 2014b</ref>). For example, while many readers are in- terested in reading about celebrities, few readers are interested in articles about anthropology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Sentiment</head><p>Finally, we consider the sentiments expressed in an article. Besides opinion articles (which are sub- jective by nature), many news may also convey a particular emotion. We evaluate three sentiment- related aspects: subjectivity, sentimentality, and polarity. Subjectivity: Subjective articles tend to contain opinions, preferences, or possibilities. There are relatively few factual statements. Sentimentality: Sentimentality is a measure of the total magnitude of positive or negative state- ments made in the article regarding an object or an event. Highly sentimental articles include rela- tively few neutral statements. Polarity: Polarity indicates the overall sign of the sentiments expressed in the article ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arapakis et al., 2014a)</ref>. Articles with positive (negative) polarity include relatively more statements with positive (negative) sentiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Corpus: Editorial Quality Control</head><p>Our goal is to identify proxies of news article qual- ity that can be learned and predicted in an auto- matic and scalable manner. To identify these prox- ies, we rely on the domain knowledge and human intuition of expert judges, whom we employ in a rigorous, crowdsourcing-based evaluation for gen-erating a ground-truth dataset. Through an edito- rial study we create an in-domain, annotated news corpus that allows us to learn predictive models which can estimate accurately the perceived qual- ity of news articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Online News Articles</head><p>Our analysis was conducted on a dataset consist- ing of 13, 319 news articles taken from a major news portal 2 . We opted for a single news por- tal to be able to extract features that are consis- tent across all news articles. The dataset was con- structed by crawling news articles over a period of two weeks. During the crawling period, we con- nected to the RSS news feed of the portal every 15 minutes and fetched newly published articles written in English. The content of the discovered articles was then downloaded from the portal.</p><p>Each article is identified by its unique URI and stored in a database, along with some meta-data, such as article's genre, its publication date, and its HTML content. We applied further filtering on the initial set of 13,319 news articles. The word count distribution of the articles followed a bimodal pat- tern, with the bulk of the articles located around a mean value of 447.5. Using this value as a refer- ence point, we removed articles that contain less than 150 or more than 800 words. We then sam- pled a smaller set of articles such that each of the most frequent 15 genres have at least 65 articles in the sample. This left us with 1,043 new arti- cles, out of which a randomly selected set of 561 articles were used in the editorial study.</p><p>The selected news articles were preprocessed before the editorial study. The preprocessing was performed in two steps. First, we removed the boilerplate of HTML pages and extracted the main body text of news articles, using Boiler- pipe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kohlschütter et al., 2010</ref>). Second, we seg- mented the body text into sentences and para- graphs. For sentence segmentation, we used the Stanford CoreNLP library, which includes a prob- abilistic parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Klein and Manning, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007)</ref>. For each news article we generated a body-and sentence-level annotation form (see example in the supplementary notes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Annotations of Editorial Quality Aspects</head><p>For our editorial study, we employed ten expert judges (male = 4, female = 6) who had a back- 2 Yahoo! News at http://www.yahoo.com/news.   ground in computational linguistics, journalism, or were media monitoring experts. The expert judges were either native English speakers or were proficient with the English language. The expert judges assessed a total of 561 news articles on 15 measures (14 aspects and the main quality mea- sure), using a 5-point Likert scale, where low and high scores suggest weak or strong presence of the assessed measure, respectively. The annotation took place remotely, and each expert judge could annotate up to ten news arti- cles per day (this threshold was set to ensure a high quality of annotation), and each article was annotated by one expert judge and by one of the authors of this paper. Prior to that, there was a pi- lot session were each expert judge was asked to become familiar with the quality criteria and an- notate three trial news articles. Next, a meeting (physical or online) was arranged and the authors discussed with the expert judge the rationale be- hind assigning the scores, and appropriate correc- tions and recommendations were made. This step ensured that we had disambiguated any questions prior to the editorial study and also assured that ex- pert judges followed the same scoring procedure. The compensation for annotating was 10eper ar- ticle. The annotated corpus is publicly available. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">. 2</ref> illustrates the details of the overall an- notations agreement. We can see that annotations agree on 62.1% of the articles, on 65.5% they vary only 1-point and in 96.6% they vary 2 points in the 5-point Likert-scale. These results are quite satisfying and show a good level of agreement and consistency across all aspects. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the mean (M) and standard devi- ation (SD) values for five different distributions (number of characters, words, unique words, en- tities, and sentences) and four different subsets of the corpus. The subsets contain all articles, high- quality articles (labels 4 and 5), medium-quality articles (label 3), or low-quality articles (labels 1 and 2). The last three subsets contain 84, 298, and 179 news articles, respectively. According to these numbers, the article quality follows an un- balanced distribution: about half of the articles are labeled as medium quality, and there are about two times more low-quality articles than high-quality articles. According to <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, there is a clear difference between distributions for the high-and low-quality articles. In general, we observe that higher-quality articles are relatively longer (e.g., more words or sentences), on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Corpus Statistics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Aspects Correlation Analysis</head><p>To identify which aspects of a news article are better discriminants of its quality, we perform a correlation analysis. Given that we are looking at ordinal data that violates parametric assump- tions, we compute the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (r s ) between the aspects' scores and the news article quality that we acquired from our ground truth. The motivation behind this analysis is to get a first intuition into the aspects' effective- ness to act as quality predictors, by understanding how they are associated to news article quality.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we report several statistically sig- nificant correlations between the different aspects. Given that our correlation analysis involves multi- ple pairwise comparisons, we need to correct the level of significance for each test such that the overall Type I error rate (α) across all comparisons remains at .05. Given that the Bonferroni correc- tion is too conservative in the Type I error rate, we opt for the more liberal criterion proposed by Ben- jamini and Hochberg ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Benjamini and Hochberg, 2000</ref>) and com- pute the critical p-value for every pairwise com- parisons as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">pcrit = j k α,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where j is the index of all pairwise comparison p- values, listed in an ascending order, and k is the number of comparisons. If we consider Cohen's conventions for the interpretation of effect size, we observe that most of the correlation coefficients shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> represent sizeable effects, which range from small (±.1) to large (±.5). For exam- ple, completeness is highly correlated with quality (r s = .70) while polarity is the least correlated with quality (r s = .05). In addition, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> does not provide any evidence of multicollinearity since none of the aspects (with the exception of quality) are significantly highly correlated (r s &gt; .80).</p><p>6 Predicting Editorial Quality</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Predicting EQ with the Aspects</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the predictive char- acteristics of the proposed aspects (Section 3) with respect to news article quality. We formulate the prediction problem as a regression problem, and conduct a 10-fold cross validation to estimate the regression model. For our regression task we use a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) via penalized maximum likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Friedman et al., 2010</ref>). The regularisation path is computed for the lasso or elasticnet penalty at a grid of values for the reg- ularisation parameter lambda. The GLM solves the following problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">min β 0 ,β 1 N N i=1 wil(yi, β0 +β T xi)+λ[(1−α) β 2 2 2 +αβ1, ],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>over a grid of values of λ covering the entire range. Here l(y, η) is the negative log-likelihood contri- bution for observation i. The elastic-net penalty is controlled by α, and bridges the gap between lasso (α = 1, the default) and ridge (α = 0). The tun- ing parameter λ controls the overall strength of the penalty. It is known that the ridge penalty shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other while the lasso tends to pick one of them and discard the others, which makes it more robust against predictor collinearity and overfit- ting. We used the values that minimise RMSE, i.e., α = 0.95 and λ = 0.01.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, we see the coefficients of the fi- nal GLM model which are to be interpreted in the same manner as a Cox model. A positive regres- sion coefficient for an explanatory variable means that the variable is associated with a higher risk of an event. In our case, all coefficients are positive, being completeness, fluency and richness the ones  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polarity</head><p>.05</p><p>Significance levels (two-tailed) are as follows: * :&lt; .01; * * :&lt; .001. showing a higher relation to the overall editorial quality.</p><p>Next, we replicate our regression experiments for the GLM regression model, but this time we apply a leave-one-aspect-out method, to examine the relative importance of each aspect in explain- ing our predicted variable, i.e., the news article quality. To this end, we evaluate the 14 regres- sion models, each one with out one of the aspects. The goal is to verify how prediction is affected by each individual quality aspect. To compare the performance of our GLM re- gression model against the baseline method (with all quality aspects), we compute the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">RM SE = N i=1 (ˆ y − y i ) 2 N (3)</formula><p>wherê y is the sample mean and y i is the i-th es- timate. However, while regression results give an idea of the prediction quality of the models they do not quantify the size of the difference of their per- formance. We, therefore, also compute the Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) metric as it pro- vides a good indication of any relative improve- ment over the baseline methods, given by <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the RMSE and RRSE, with respect to the GLM regression model trained on all the fea- tures. These results show that completeness, flu- ency and richness are the aspects that most affect RMSE when they are missing from the full model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">RRSE = 1 − RM SE GLM RM SE Baseline .<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Automatic Prediction of EQ</head><p>We examined a baseline model (BaselineM) that always predicts the mean value and a base- line GLM model (BaselineShallow) trained on shallow features, to automatically predict the editorial quality. Shallow or lexical fea- tures are commonly used in traditional read- ability metrics, which are based on the analy- sis of superficial text properties. Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Flesch, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">François and Fairon, 2012)</ref>, SMOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McLaughlin, 1969)</ref>, and Gun- ning Fog <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gunning, 1952)</ref> are some examples of readability metrics. The simplicity of these fea- tures makes them an attractive solution compared to computationally more expensive features, such as syntactic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Feng et al., 2010)</ref>. However, as Shriver ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Schriver, 1989)</ref> points out, the readabil- ity metrics can be useful when used as gross index of readability. For our baseline, we consider the Flesh Kincaid, Coleman Liau, ARI, RIX, Gunning Fog, SMOG, LIX features. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, we report the average performance of the GLM regression model, BaselineM, and BaselineShallow across all folds. We note that our GLM regression model improves the RMSE by at least 40%, compared to both base- lines.</p><p>Finally, as a reference for future research with the proposed corpus, we trained GLM regression models to predict each aspect individually. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> presents the RMSE for each aspect, for two differ- ent sets of feature: a standard BoW and the shal- low features described previously, as well as the BaselineM. Despite the simplicity of the fea- tures, we can see that the aspects can be inferred from the articles. In particular, the model trained on the BoW features achieves an RMSE that is very close to that of the BaselineM, whereas the  model trained on the shallow features outperforms all other models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we proposed an annotated corpus for controlling the editorial quality of online news through 14 aspects related to editors perceived quality of news articles. To this end, we performed an editorial study with expert judges either in com- putational linguistics, journalism, or media mon- itoring experts. The judges assessed a total of 561 news articles with respect to 14 aspects. The study produced valuable insights. One important finding was that high quality articles share a sig- nificant amount of variability with several of the proposed aspects, which supports the claim that the proposed aspects may characterise news arti- cle quality in an automatic and scalable way. An- other finding was that fluency, completeness and richness are the aspects that best correlate with quality, while technicality, subjectivity and polar- ity aspects show a poor correlation with quality. This shows that the text comprehension and writ- ing style are aspects that are more relevant than sentiment. Later, we showed that using the entire set of 14 aspects we could predict the text quality with an RMSE of only 0.400 in a 5-point Likert- scale. This renders a very effective decomposi- tion of news article quality into the 14 aspects. As future work, we plan to investigate other linguis- tic representations that can improve the automated extraction of the proposed aspects to better predict the article's perceived quality.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A taxonomy of the identified aspects.</figDesc></figure>
