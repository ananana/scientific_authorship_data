				<p>Word-level language detection is necessary for analyzing code-switched text, where multiple languages could be mixed within a sentence. Existing models are restricted to code-switching between two specific languages and fail in real-world scenarios as text input rarely has a priori information on the languages used. We present a novel unsupervised word-level language detection technique for code-switched text for an arbitrarily large number of languages, which does not require any manually annotated training data. Our experiments with tweets in seven languages show a 74% relative error reduction in word-level labeling with respect to competitive baselines. We then use this system to conduct a large-scale quantitative analysis of code-switching patterns on Twitter, both global as well as region-specific, with 58M tweets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In stable multilingual societies, communication often features fluid alteration between two or more languages -a phenomenon known as code-switching 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gumperz, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Myers-Scotton, 1993)</ref>. It has been studied extensively in linguis- tics, primarily as a speech phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Poplack, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gumperz, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Myers-Scotton, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Milroy and Muysken, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Auer, 2013)</ref>. How- ever, the growing popularity of computer mediated * * This work was done when the authors were affiliated with Microsoft Research.communication, particularly social media, has re- sulted in language data in the text form which exhibits code-switching, among other speech- like characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crystal, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Herring, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Danet and Herring, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cardenas-Claros and Isharyanti, 2009)</ref>. With the large amount of online content generated by multilingual users around the globe, it becomes necessary to design techniques to analyze mixed language, which can help not only in developing end-user applications, but also in conducting fundamental sociolinguistic studies.</p><p>Language detection (LD) is a prerequisite to several NLP techniques. Most state-of-the-art LD systems detect a single language for an entire doc- ument or sentence. Such methods often fail to detect code-switching, which can occur within a sentence. In recent times, there has been some effort to build word-level LD for code-switching between a specific pair of languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nguyen and Dogruöz, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Elfardy et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Solorio et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barman et al., 2014)</ref>. However, usually user-generated text (e.g., on social media) has no prior information of the languages being used. Further, as several previous social-media based studies on multilingualism have pointed out <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kim et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Manley, 2012)</ref>, lack of general word- level LD has been a bottleneck in studying code- switching patterns in multilingual societies.</p><p>This paper proposes a novel technique for word- level LD that generalizes to an arbitrarily large set of languages. The method does not require a pri- ori information on the specific languages (poten- tially more than two) being mixed in an input text as long as the languages are from a fixed (arbitrar- ily large) set. Training is done without any man- ually annotated data, while achieving accuracies comparable to language-restricted systems trained with large amounts of labeled data. With a word- level LD accuracy of 96.3% on seven languages, this technique enabled us to analyze patterns of code-switching on Twitter, which is the second key contribution of this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of its kind, particularly at such a large-scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In this section, we will briefly survey the language detection techniques (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hughes et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Garg et al. (2014)</ref> for comprehensive surveys), and sociolinguistic studies on multilingualism (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nguyen et al. (2016)</ref> for a detailed survey) that were enabled by these techniques.</p><p>Early work on LD <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dunning, 1994</ref>) focused on detecting a single language for an entire document. These ob- tained high accuracies on well-formed text (e.g., news articles), which led to LD being consid- ered solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(McNamee, 2005</ref>). However, there has been renewed interest with the amount of user-generated content on the web. Such text poses unique challenges such as short length, misspelling, idiomatic expressions and acronyms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldszmidt et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Xia et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tromp and Pechenizkiy (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Lui and Baldwin (2012)</ref> created LD systems for monolingual sentences, web pages and tweets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zhang et al. (2016)</ref> built an unsupervised model to detect the majority language in a document. There has also been document-level LD that assigns mul- tiple language to each document <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Prager, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lui et al., 2014</ref>). However, documents were syn- thetically generated, restricted to inter-sentential language mixing. Also, these models do not frag- ment the document based on language, making language-specific analysis impossible.</p><p>Document-level or sentence-level LD does not identify code-switching accurately, which can oc- cur within a sentence. Word-level LD systems attempt to remedy this problem. Most work has been restricted to cases where two languages, known a priori, is to be detected in the input i.e, binary LD at the word-level. There has been work on <ref type="bibr">Dutch-Turkish (Nguyen and Dogruöz, 2013)</ref>, English-Bengali ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Das and Gambäck, 2014)</ref> and Standard and dialectal Arabic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Elfardy et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">King and Abney (2013)</ref> address word- level LD for bilingual documents in 30 language pairs, where the language pair is known a pri- ori. The features for word-level LD proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Al-Badrashiny and Diab (2016)</ref> are language- independent, however, at any given time, the model is only trained to tag a specific language pair. There have also been two shared task se- ries on word-level LD: FIRE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Roy et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sequiera et al., 2015</ref>) fo- cused on Indian languages and the EMNLP Code- Switching Workshop ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Solorio et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Molina et al., 2016)</ref>. These pairwise LD methods vary from dictionary-based to completely supervised and semi-supervised. None tackle the imminent lack of annotated data required for scaling to more than one language pair.</p><p>There has been little research on word-level LD that is not restricted to two languages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hammarström (2007)</ref> proposed a model for multi- lingual LD for short texts like queries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gella et al. (2014)</ref> designed an algorithm for word- level LD across 28 languages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jurgens et al. (2017)</ref> use an encoder-decoder architecture for word-level LD that supports dialectal variation and code-switching. However, these studies ex- periment with synthetically created multilingual data, constrained either by the number of lan- guage switches permitted or to phrase-level code- switching, and are not equipped to handle the chal- lenges posed by real-world code-switching.</p><p>Using tweet-level LD systems like the Com- pactLanguageDetector <ref type="bibr">2</ref> , there have been studies on multilingualism in specific cities like Lon- don <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Manley, 2012)</ref> and Manchester ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bailey et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>These studies, as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bergsma et al. (2012)</ref>, observe that existing LD systems fail on code-switched text. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim et al. (2014</ref>) studied the linguistic behavior of bilingual Twitter users from Qatar, Switzerland and Québec, and also ac- knowledge that code-switching could not be stud- ied due to the absence of appropriate LD tools.</p><p>Using word-level LD for English-Hindi (Gella et al., 2013),  observed that as much as 17% of Indian Facebook posts had code- switching, and  showed that the native language is strongly preferred for express- ing negative sentiment by English-Hindi bilin- guals on Twitter. However, without accurate mul- tilingual word-level LD, there have been no large- scale studies on the extent and distribution of code-switching across various communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Generalized Word-level LD</head><p>We present Generalized Word-Level Language Detection, or GWLD, where:</p><p>• The number of supported languages can be arbitrarily large • Any number of the supported languages can be mixed within a single input • The languages in the input do not need to be known a priori • Any number of language switches are al- lowed in the input.</p><p>• No manual annotation is required for training Formalizing our model, let w = w i=1...n be a natural language text consisting of a sequence of words, w 1 to w n . For our current work, we define words to be whitespace-separated tokens (details in Sec 5). Let L = {l 1 , l 2 , . . . , l k } be a set of k natural languages. We assume that each w i can be assigned to a unique language l j ∈ L.</p><p>We also define universal tokens like numbers, emoticons, URLs, emails and punctuation, which do not belong to any specific natural language. Certain strings of alphabetic characters represent- ing generic interjections or sounds, such as oh, awww, zzz also fall in this category. For label- ing these tokens, we use an auxiliary set of labels, X L = {xl 1 , xl 2 , . . . , xl k }. Labeling each univer- sal token with a specific language l i (using xl i ) in- stead of generically labeling all such tokens xl al- lows preserving linguistic context when a memo- ryless model like Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are used for tagging. Further, various NLP tasks on might require the input text, including these universal tokens, to be split by language.</p><p>For input w, let the output from the LD system be y = y i=1...n , a sequence of labels, where y i ∈ L ∪ X L . y i = l j if and only if, in the context of w, w i is a word from l j . If w i is a universal token,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y i = xl j , when y i−1 = l j or y i−1 = xl j . If w 1 is a universal token, y 1 = xl j ,</formula><p>where l j is the label of the first token ∈ L in the input. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Method</head><p>Word-level LD is essentially a sequence labeling task. We use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), though any other sequence labeling technique, e.g., CRFs, can be used as well.</p><p>The intuition behind the model architecture is simple -a person who is familiar with k lan- guages can easily recognize (and also understand) the words when any of those languages are code- switched, even if s/he has never seen any mixed language text before. Analogously, is it possi- ble that monolingual language models, when com- bined, can identify code-switched text accurately?</p><p>Imagine we have k HMMs, where the ith HMM has two states l i and xl i . Each state can label a word. The HMMs are independent, but they are tied to a common start state s and end state e, forming a word-level LD model for monolingual text in one of the k languages. Now, we make transitions from l i → l j possible, where i = j. This HMM, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, is capable of gen- erating and consequently, labeling code-switched text between any of the k languages. The solid and dotted lines show monolingual transitions and the added code-switching transitions respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> depicts three languages, however, the num- ber of languages can be arbitrarily large.</p><p>Obtaining word-level annotated monolingual and code-switched data is expensive and nearly in- feasible for a large number of languages. Instead, we automatically create weakly-labeled monolin- gual text (set W) and use it to initialize the HMM parameters. We then use Baum-Welch reestima- tion on unlabeled data (set U) that has monolin- gual and code-switched text in their natural distri- bution. Sec. 5 discusses creation of W and U.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Structure, Initialization and Learning</head><p>The structure of the HMM shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> can be formally described using:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• Set of states, S = s ∪ L ∪ X L ∪ e • Set of observations, O • Emission matrix (|S| × |O|) • Transition matrix (|S| × |S|)</formula><p>O consists of all seen events in the data, and a special symbol unk for all unseen events. We define an event as a token n-gram and we experi- mented with n = 1 to 3. It is important to men- tion that the n-grams do not spread over language states. We also use special start and end symbols, which are observed at states s and e respectively. Elements of O are effectively what the states of the HMM 'emit' or generate during decoding.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Ex(1): no\l 2 me\l 2 lebante\l 2 ahorita\l 2 cuz\l 1 I\l 1 felt\l 1 como\l 2 si\l 2 me\l 2 kemara\l 2 por\l 2 dentro\l 2 !\xl 2 :o\xl 2 Then\l 1 I\l 1 started\l 1 getting\l 1 all\l 1 red\l 1 ,\xl 1 I\l 1 think\l 1 im\l 1 allergic\l 1 a\l 2 algo\l 2</formula><p>Ex <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>   For any input, the HMM always starts in the state s. The parameters to be learned are the tran- sition and emission matrices.</p><p>We initialize these matrices using W. The tri- gram, bigram and unigram word counts from the data for each language in W are used to create language models (LM) with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen and Goodman, 1999</ref>). The emis- sion values for state l i are initialized with the re- spective LM probabilities for all seen n-grams. We also assign a small probability to unk. The emissions for the xl i state are initialized using the counts of universal tokens for the language l i in W. These are identified using the preprocessing techniques discussed in Sec. 5.1.</p><p>Possible transitions for each monolingual HMM are l i → l i , l i → xl i and xl i → l i . We do not have the xl i → xl i transition, because preprocess- ing (Sec. 5.1) concatenates successive universal tokens into a single token. This does not change the output as the tokens can easily be separated af- ter LD, but is a useful simplification for the model. The transition values for l i are initialized by the probability of transitions between words and uni- versal tokens in the text from W.</p><p>As stated earlier, the model supports code- switching by the addition of transitions l i → l j , and xl i → l j , for all i = j. For each state l i , there are 2k − 2 new transitions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>. We initial- ize these news edges with a small probability π, before normalizing transitions for each state. π, which we call the code-switch probability, is a hy- perparameter tuned on a validation set.</p><p>Starting with the initialized matrices, we rees- timate the transition and emission matrices using the EM-like Baum-Welch algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Welch, 2003)</ref> over the large set of unlabeled text U.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Decoding</head><p>The input to the trained model is first preprocessed as described in Sec. 5.1 (tokenization and identifi- cation of universal tokens). The Viterbi algorithm is then used with the HMM parameters to perform word-level LD. When an unknown n-gram, is en- countered, its emission probability is estimated by recursively backing off to (n − 1)-gram, until we find a known n-gram. If the unigram, i.e., the to- ken, is also unknown, then the observation of the symbol unk is used instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Dataset Creation</head><p>The data for both training and testing comes pri- marily from Twitter because of its public API, and studies have shown the presence of code- switching in social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crystal, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Herring, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Danet and Herring, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cardenas-Claros and Isharyanti, 2009;</ref>.</p><p>Our experiments use monolingual and code- switched tweets in seven languages -Dutch (nl), English (en), French (fr), German (de), Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es) and Turkish (tr). These form the set L. The choice of languages is motivated by several factors. First, LD is non-trivial as all these languages use the Latin script. Second, a large volume of tweets are generated in these languages.</p><p>Third, there is annotated code-switched data avail- able in nl-tr and en-es, which can be used for val- idation and testing. Lastly, we know that certain pairs of these languages are code-switched often.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Collection and Preprocessing</head><p>Using the Twitter API <ref type="bibr">(Twitter, 2013)</ref>, we col- lected tweets over May-July 2015. We selected tweets identified by Twitter LD API <ref type="bibr">(Twitter, 2015)</ref> as one of the languages in L. We also re- moved non-Latin script tweets.</p><p>As preprocessing, each tweet is first tokenized using ark-twitter (Gimpel et al., 2011) and URLs, hashtags and user mentions are identified using regular expressions. We also identify emoticons, punctuation, digits, special characters, and some universal interjections and abbreviations (such as RT, aww) as universal tokens. We use an existing dictionary ( ) for the latter. Let the set of tweets after preprocessing be T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Sets W and U</head><p>We use the COVERSET algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gella et al., 2014</ref>) on each tweet in T . It obtains a confidence score for a word w i belonging to a language l j us- ing a Naive Bayes classifier trained on Wikipedia. These scores are used to find the minimal set of languages are required to label all the input words. If COVERSET detects the tweet as monolingual (i.e., one language can label all words) and the identified language is the same as the Twitter LD label, the tweet is added to the weakly-labeled set W. These tweets are almost certainly monolin- gual, as COVERSET has very high recall (and low precision) for detecting code-switching. As these are not manually labeled, we call them weakly- labeled. W contains 100K tweets in each lan- guage (700K in total).</p><p>From T , we randomly select 100K tweets in each of the seven languages based on the Twitter LD API labels. These tweets do not have word- level language labels and may be code-switched or have an incorrect Twitter language label. We use these as unlabeled data, the set U.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Validation and Test Sets</head><p>We curate two word-level gold-standard datasets for validation and testing. These sets contain monolingual tweets in each of the seven languages as well as code-switched tweets from certain lan- guage pairs, based on the availability of real-world data. However, it must be noted that GWLD can  detect code-switching between more than two lan- guages. The language-wise distribution is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Including universal tokens, the valida- tion and test set contain 33981 and 58221 tokens respectively. The annotated tweets will be made available for public use.</p><p>For es-en, we use the word-level annotated test set from the code-switching shared task on lan- guage detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Solorio et al., 2014</ref>). We ignore the tokens labeled NE, Ambiguous and Mixed dur- ing our system evaluation (Sec. 6), as they do not fall in the scope of this work. The words labeled 'Other' were marked as xl i where l i is en or es, based on the context. We also use existing nl- tr validation and test sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nguyen and Dogruöz, 2013)</ref>, which contain posts from a web forum.</p><p>For the other language pairs, we created our own validation and test sets, as none already ex- ist. We randomly selected tweets for which CO- VERSET identified code-switching with high con- fidence. We gave 215 of these to six annotators for word-level annotation. It is difficult to find annotators who know all seven languages; elabo- rate guidelines were provided on using online ma- chine translation, dictionaries and search engines for the task. Four out of the six annotators had high inter-annotator agreement -the agreement on L1 (language that the majority of the words in the tweet belong to) was 0.93, L2 (the other language, whenever present) was 0.8 and whether the tweet is code-switched was 0.84. We did not find any in- stances of code-switching between more than two  languages, which is rare in general. We distributed 3000 tweets between the four annotators (mono- lingual and code-switched tweets from COVER- SET). Disagreements were settled between the an- notators and a linguist. A subset of the annotated tweets form the validation and test sets <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, and were removed from W and U.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments and Results</head><p>We compare GWLD with three existing systems: LINGUINI (Prager, 1999), LANGID (Lui and Bald- win, 2012), and POLYGLOT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lui et al., 2014</ref>). None of these perform word-level LD, however, LANGID and POLYGLOT return a list of languages with confidence scores for the input. Since code- switching with more than two languages is absent in our dataset, we consider up to two language la- bels. We define the tweet to be monolingual if the difference between the confidence values for the top two languages is greater than a parameter δ. Otherwise, it is assumed to be code-switched with the top two languages. δ is tuned independently for the two LD systems on the validation set by maximizing the metric L 1 L 2 Accuracy (Sec. 6.2). Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gella et al. (2013)</ref>, we also compare with dictionary-based word-level LD baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Dictionary-based Baselines</head><p>For each language, we build a lexicon of all the words and their frequencies found in W for that language. Let the lexicon for language l i ∈ L be lex i . Let f (lex i , w j ) be the frequency of w j in lex i . We define the following baselines: MAXFREQ: For each w j in w, MAXFREQ re- turns lex i that has the maximum frequency for that token. Therefore, the language label for w j is y j = l [arg max i f (lex i ,w j )] . If the token is not found in any lexicon, y j is assigned the value of y j−1 .</p><p>MINCOVER: We find the smallest subset mincov(w) ⊂ L, such that for all w j in input w, we have at least one language l i ∈ mincov(w) with f (lex i , w j ) &gt; 0. If there is no such lan- guage, then w j is not considered while comput- ing mincov(w). Once mincov(w) is obtained, labels y i are computed using the MAXFREQ strat- egy, where the set of languages is restricted to mincov(w) instead of L. Note that mincov(w) need not be unique for w; in such cases, we choose the mincov(w) which maximizes the sum of lex- ical frequencies based on MAXFREQ labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Metrics</head><p>We define the Accuracy (Acc) of an LD system as the fraction of words in the test set that are labeled correctly. Since the existing LD systems do not label languages at word-level, we also define:</p><p>IsMix is the fraction of tweets that are correctly identified as either monolingual or code-mixed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L 1 L 2 Accuracy (L 1 L 2 Acc)</formula><p>is the mean accu- racy of detecting language(s) at tweet-level. For monolingual tweets, this accuracy is 1 if the gold standard label is detected by the LD system, else 0. For code-switched tweets, the accuracy is 1 if both languages are detected, 0.5 if one language is detected, and 0 otherwise. L 1 L 2 Acc is the average over all test set tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Results</head><p>We use these metrics to assess performance on the test set for the baselines, existing LD systems and GWLD <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref>. Initial refers to the HMM model estimated from W and Reestimated refers to the final model after Baum-Welch reestimation. The parameter π is tuned on the validation set using grid search. Reestimated GWLD has the best ac- curacy of 0.963 and performs significantly better than all the other systems for all metrics. Reesi- matation improves the word-level Acc for L1 from 0.89 to 0.97 and for L2 from 0.43 to 0.82. LIN- GUINI and POLYGLOT likely have low L 1 L 2 Acc because they are trained on synthetically-created documents with no word-level code-switching.</p><p>Since our test set contains pre-existing anno- tations for en-es ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Solorio et al., 2014</ref>) and nl-tr <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nguyen and Dogruöz, 2013)</ref>, we compare with state-of-the-art results on those datasets. On en-es tokens, Al-Badrashiny and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Diab (2016)</ref> reports an F 1-score of 0.964; GWLD obtains 0.978. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nguyen and Dogruöz (2013)</ref> report 0.976 Acc on the nl-tr We obtain a less competitive 0.936. How- ever, when errors between nl-en are ignored as most of these are en words with nl gold-standard labels (convention followed by the dataset cre- ators), the revised Acc is 0.963. Notably, unlike GWLD, both these models use large amounts of annotated data for training and are restricted to de- tecting only two languages.</p><p>Error Analysis: GWLD sometimes detects lan- guages that are not present in the tweet, which ac- count for a sizable fraction (39%) of all word-level errors. Not detecting a language switch causes 8% of the errors. Most other errors are caused by named entities, single-letter tokens, unseen words and the nl-en annotation convention in the test set from <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nguyen and Dogruöz (2013)</ref>.</p></div>

A slow rise in accuracy is observed as the number of tweets in W is increased. We also experiment with varying the size of U. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref>, we see that with 0.25% of U (around 1,400 randomly sampled tweets), the accuracy on the test set is lower than 0.91. This quickly in- creases with 10% of U. Thus, GWLD achieves Acc comparable to existing systems with very lit- tle weakly-labeled data (just 250 tweets per lan- guage, which are easily procurable for most lan- guages) and around 50,000 unlabeled tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.2">Noise in W</head><p>Since a small, but pure, W gives high accuracy (Sec. 6.4.1), we evaluate how artificially intro- duced noise affects Acc. The noise introduced into the W of each language comes uniformly from the other six languages. <ref type="figure">Figure 3b</ref> shows how in- creasing fractions of noise slowly degrades accu- racy, with a steep drop to 0.11 accuracy at 90% noise, where the tweets from each incorrect lan- guage outnumber the correct language tweets. We test this with a pairwise model as well, as noise from a single language might have greater effect. The accuracy falls to 0.36 at 50% noise ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b)</ref>. At this point, W has an equal number of tweets from each language and is essentially useless.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Code-Switching on Twitter</head><p>The high accuracy and fast processing speed (the current multithreaded implementation labels 2.5M tweets per hour) of GWLD enables us to conduct large-scale and reliable studies of CS patterns on Twitter for the 7 languages. In this paper, we con- duct two such studies. The first study analyzes 50M tweets from across the world to understand the extent and broad patterns of switching among these languages. In the second study, we ana- lyze 8M tweets from 24 cities to gain insights into geography-specific CS patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Worldwide Code-Switching Trends</head><p>We collected 50 million unique tweets that were identified by the Twitter LD API as one of the 7 languages. We place this constraint to avoid tweets from unsupported languages during anal- ysis. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the overall language distribu- tion, including the CS language-pair distribution. Approximately 96.5% of the tweets are monolin- gual, a majority of which are en (74%). Around 3.5% of all tweets are code-switched. Globally, en-es, en-fr and en-pt are the three most commonly mixed pairs accounting for 21.5%, 20.8% and 18.4% of all CS tweets in our data re- spectively. Interestingly, 85.4% of the CS tweets have en as one of the languages; fr is the next most popularly mixed language, with fr-es (3.2%), fr-pt (1.2%) and fr-nl (0.6%) as the top three ob- served pairs. Although around 1% of CS tweets were detected as containing more than two lan- guages, these likely have low precision because of language overdetection as discussed in Sec. 6.3. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the fraction of code-switch points, i.e., how many times the language changes in a CS tweet, for all the languages, as well as for three language pairs with to highlight differ- ent trends. Most CS tweets have one CS-point, which implies that the tweet begins with one lan- guage, and then ends with another. Such tweets are very frequent for en-de where we observe that usually the tweets state the same fact in both en and de. This so-called translation function  of CS is probably adopted for reaching out to a wider and global audience. In contrast, es-fr tweets have fewer tweets with sin- gle and far more with two CS-point than average. Tweets with two CS-points typically imply the in- clusion of a short phrase or chunk from another language. en-tr tweets have the highest number of CS-points, implying rampant and fluid switching between the two languages at all structural levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">City-Specific Code-Switching Trends</head><p>Cosmopolitan cities are melting pots of cultures, which make them excellent locations for studying multilingualism and language interaction, includ- ing CS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bailey et al., 2013)</ref>. We collected tweets from 24 populous and highly cosmopolitan cities from Europe, North America and South America, where the primarily spoken language is one of the 7 languages detectable by GWLD. Around 8M tweets were collected from these cities. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows the top and bottom 6 cities, ranked by the fraction of CS tweets from that city. The total number of tweets analyzed and the top two CS pairs, along with their fractions (of CS tweets from that city) are also reported. More de- tails can be found in the supplementary material. It is interesting to note that the 6 cities with lowest CS tweet fractions have en as the major language, whereas the 6 cities with highest CS fractions are from non-English (Turkish, Spanish and French) speaking geographies. In fact, the Pearson's cor-Cities with highest fraction of CS tweet Cities with lowest fraction of CS tweets City Tweets CS-fraction (CS pairs) City Tweets CS-fraction (CS pairs) Istanbul 351K</p><p>.12 (en-tr .53, nl-tr .13) Houston 588K .01 (en-es .22, en-fr .21) Québec City 108K</p><p>.08 (en-fr .45, es-fr .23) San Francisco 532K .02 <ref type="bibr">(en-es .26, en-fr .19</ref>    <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> one can also ob- serve that for non-English speaking geographies, the majority language is most commonly mixed with English, followed by French (Spanish, if French is the majority language). Istanbul is an exception, where Dutch is the second most com- monly mixed language with Turkish, presumably because of the large Turkish immigrant popula- tion in Netherlands resulting in a sizeable Turkish- Dutch bilingual diaspora <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Do˘ gruöz and Backus, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nguyen and Dogruöz, 2013)</ref>. Is there a difference in the way speakers mix a pair of languages, say en and es, in en-speaking goegraphies like San Diego, Miami, Houston and New York City, and es-speaking geographies like Madrid, Barcelona, Buenos Aires and Mexico City? Indeed, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7</ref>, the distribu- tion of the lengths of en and es runs (contigu- ous sequence of words in a single language be- ginning and ending with either a CS-point or be- ginning/end of a tweet) in en-es CS tweets is sig- nificantly different in en-speaking and es-speaking geographies. en runs are longer in en-speaking cities and vice versa, showing that the second lan- guage is likely used in short phrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We present GWLD, a system for word-level lan- guage detection for an arbitrarily large set of lan- guages that is completely unsupervised. Our re- sults on monolingual and code-switched tweets in seven Latin script languages show a high 0.963 ac- curacy, significantly out-performing existing sys- tems. Using GWLD, we conducted a large-scale study of CS trends among these languages, both globally and in specific cities.</p><p>One of the primary observations of this study is that while code-switching on Twitter is com- mon worldwide (3.5%), it is much more common in non-English speaking cities like Istanbul (12%) where 90% of the population speak Turkish. On the other hand, while a third of the population of Houston speaks Spanish and almost everybody English, only 1% of the tweets from the city are code-switched. All the trends indicate a global dominance of English, which might be because Twitter is primarily a medium for broadcast, and English tweets have a wider audience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bergsma et al. (2012)</ref> show that " <ref type="bibr">[On Twitter]</ref> bilinguals bridge between monolinguals with English as a hub, while monolinguals tend not to directly fol- low each other." <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Androutsopoulos (2006)</ref> argues that due to linguistic non-homogenity of online public spaces, languages like en, fr and de are typ- ically preferred for communication, even though in private spaces, "bilingual talk" differs consider- ably in terms of distribution and CS patterns.</p><p>As future directions, we plan to extend GWLD to several other languages and conduct similar so- ciolinguistic studies on CS patterns including not only more languages and geographies, but also other aspects like topic and sentiment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>shows a few examples of labeled code- switched tweets.
