			<abstract>
				<p>This paper presents an email importance corpus annotated through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Annotators annotate the email content type and email importance for three levels of hierarchy (se-nior manager, middle manager and employee). Each email is annotated by 5 turkers. Agreement study shows that the agreed AMT annotations are close to the expert annotations. The annotated dataset demonstrates difference in proportions of content type between different levels. An email importance prediction system is trained on the dataset and identifies the unimportant emails at minimum 0.55 precision with only text-based features.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>It is common that people receive tens or hundreds of emails everyday. Reading and managing all these emails consume significant time and atten- tion. Many efforts have been made to address the email overload problem. There are studies mod- eling the email importance and the recipients' ac- tions in order to help with the user's interaction with emails ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dabbish and Kraut, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dabbish et al., 2005</ref>). Meanwhile, there are NLP studies on spam message filtering, email intention classi- fication, and priority email selection to reduce the number of emails to read <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Schneider, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cohen et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jeong et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dredze et al., 2009</ref>). In our project, we intend to build an email briefing system which extracts and summa- rizes important email information for the users.</p><p>However, we believe there are critical com- ponents missing from the current research work. First, to the extent of our knowledge, there is lit- tle public email corpus with email importance la- beled. Most of the prior works were either based on surveys or private commercial data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dabbish and Kraut, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aberdeen et al., 2010)</ref>. Second, little attention has been paid to study the difference of emails received by people at different levels of hierarchy. Third, most of the prior works chose the user's action to the email (e.g. replies, opens) as the indicator of email importance. However, we argue that the user action does not necessarily in- dicate the importance of the email. For example, a work-related reminder email can be more impor- tant than a regular social greeting email. However, a user is more likely to reply to the later and keep the information of the former in mind. Specifically for the goal of our email briefing system, impor- tance decided upon the user's action is insufficient.</p><p>This paper proposes to annotate email impor- tance on the Enron email corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klimt and Yang, 2004</ref>). Emails are grouped according to the re- cipient's levels of hierarchy. The importance of an email is annotated not only according to the user's action but also according to the importance of the information contained in the email. The content type of the emails are also annotated for the email importance study. Section 3 describe the annotation and analysis of the dataset. Section 4 describes our email importance prediction system trained on the annotated corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The most relevant work is the email corpus an- notated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dredze et al. (Dredze et al., 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dredze et al., 2008b</ref>). 2391 emails from inboxes of 4 volunteers were included. Each volunteer manually annotated whether their own emails need to be replied or not. The annotations are reliable as they come from the emails' owners. However, it lacks diversity in the user distribution with only 4 volunteers. Also, whether an email gets response or not does not always indicate its importance. While commercial products such as Gmail Priority Inbox ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aberdeen et al., 2010</ref>) has a better cover-age of users and decides the importance of emails upon more factors 1 , it is unlikely to have their data accessible to public due to user privacy concerns.</p><p>The Enron corpus is a public email corpus widely researched ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klimt and Yang, 2004</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lampert et al. (2010)</ref> annotated whether an email con- tains action request or not based on the agreed an- notations of three annotators. We followed sim- ilar ideas and labeled the email importance and content type with the agreed Amazon Mechanical Turk annotations. Emails are selected from En- ron employees at different levels of hierarchy and their importance are labeled according to the im- portance of their content. While our corpus can be less reliable without the annotations from the emails' real recipients, it is more diverse and has better descriptions of email importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data annotation 3.1 Annotation scheme</head><p>Annotators are required to select the importance of the email from three levels: Not important, Nor- mal and Important. Not important emails con- tain little useful information and require no action from the recipient. It can be junk emails missed by the spam filter or social greeting emails that do not require response from the recipient. Important emails either contain very important information to the recipient or contain urgent issues that re- quire immediate action (e.g. change of meeting time/place). Normal emails contain less impor- tant information or contain less urgent issues than Important emails. For example, emails discussing about plans of social events after work would typ- ically be categorized as Normal.</p><p>We also annotate the email content type as it reveals the semantic information contained in the emails. There are a variety of email content type definitions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jabbari et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goldstein et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dabbish et al., 2005</ref>). We choose Dabbish et al.'s definition for our work. Eight categories are included: Action Request, Info Request, Info At- tachment, Status Update, Scheduling, Reminder, Social, and Other. While an email can contain more than one type of content, annotators are re- quired to select one primary type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Annotation with AMT</head><p>Amazon Mechanical Turk is widely used in data annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lawson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Marge et al., 2010)</ref>. It is typically reliable for simple tasks. Ob- serving the fact that it takes little time for a user to decide an email's importance, we choose AMT to do the annotations and manage to reduce the an- notation noise through redundant annotation.</p><p>Creamer et al. categorized the employees of the Enron dataset to 4 groups: senior managers, mid- dle managers, traders and employees <ref type="bibr">2 (Creamer et al., 2009</ref>). We hypothesized that the types of emails received by different groups were different and annotated different groups separately. Based on Creamer et al's work, we identified 23 senior managers with a total of 21728 emails, 20 middle managers with 13779 emails and 17 regular em- ployees with 12137 emails. The trader group was not annotated as it was more specific to Enron. For each group, one batch of 750 assignments (email) was released. The emails were randomly selected from all the group members' received emails (to or cc'ed). Turkers were presented with all de- tails available in the Enron dataset, including sub- ject, sender, recipients, cclist, date and the con- tent (with history of forwards and replies). Turkers were required to make their choices as they were in the position. 3 Each assignment was annotated by 5 turkers at the rate of $0.06 per Turker assign- ment. The email type and the email importance are decided according to the majority votes. If an email has 3 agreed votes or higher, we call this email agreed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> demonstrates the average time per assignment (Time), the effectively hourly rate (Ehr), the number of emails with message type agreed (#TypeAgreed), importance agreed (#Im- poAgreed) and both agreed (#AllAgreed). We find that #AllAgreed is close to #TypeAgreed, which indicates a major overlap between the agreed type annotation and the agreed importance annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data discussion</head><p>In this paper we focus on the AllAgreed emails to mitigate the effects of annotation noise. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> demonstrates the contingency table of the corpus. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(23)  40  5.400  750 589  656  574  Middle (20)  33  6.545  750 556  622  550  Employee (17) 31</ref> 6.968 750 593 643 586  A potential issue of the corpus is that the impor- tance of the email is not decided by the real email recipient. To address this concern, we compared the AllAgreed results with the annotations from an expert annotator. 50 emails were randomly se- lected from AllAgreed emails for each level. The annotator was required to check the background of each recipient (e.g. the recipient's position in the company at the time, his/her department infor- mation and the projects he/she was involved in if these information were available online) and judge the relationship between the email's contacts be- fore annotation (e.g. if the contact is a family member or a close friend of the recipient). Agree- ment study shows a Kappa score of 0.7970 for the senior manager level, 0.6420 for the middle man- ager level and 0.7845 for the employee level. It demonstrates that the agreed Turker annotations are as reliable as well-prepared expert annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Level</head><note type="other">Time (s) Ehr ($) #All #TypeAgreed #ImpoAgreed #AllAgreed Senior</note><p>We first tested whether the content type pro- portions were significantly different between dif- ferent levels of hierarchy. Recipients with more than 20 emails sampled were selected. A vector of content type proportions was built for each recipi- ent on his/her sampled emails. Then we applied multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test the difference in the means of the vectors between levels 4 . We found that there were sig- nificant differences in proportions of status up- date (p=0.042) and social emails (p=0.035). This agrees with the impression that the senior man- agers spend more time on project management and social relationship development. Following the same approach, we tested whether there were sig- nificant differences in importance proportions be- tween levels. However, no significant difference was found while we can observe a higher portion of Important emails in the Senior group in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2.</ref> In the next section, we further investigate the rela- tionship between content type and message impor- tance using the content type as a baseline feature in email importance prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Email importance prediction</head><p>In this section we present a preliminary study of automatic email importance prediction. Two base- lines are compared, including a Majority baseline where the most frequent class is chosen and a Type baseline where the only feature used for classifica- tion is the email content type.    <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Cross-group results of Experiment 2</p><note type="other">Kappa P(U) R(I) Sr.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Feature extraction</head><p>While prior works have pointed out that the so- cial features such as contacting frequency are re- lated to the user's action on emails ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lampert et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dredze et al., 2008a)</ref>, in this paper we only focus on features that can be extracted from text. N-gram features Binary unigram features are extracted from the email subject and the email content separately. Stop words are not filtered as they might also hint the email importance.</p><p>Part-of-speech tags According to our observa- tion, the work-related emails have more content words than greeting emails. Thus, POS tag fea- tures are extracted from the email content, includ- ing the total numbers of POS tags in the text and the average numbers of tags in each sentence. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Length features We observe that work-related emails tend to be more succinct than unimpor- tant emails such as advertisements. Thus, length features are extracted including the length of the email subject and email content, and the average length of sentences in the email content.</p><p>Content features Inspired by prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lampert et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dredze et al., 2008a</ref>), fea- tures that provide hints of the email content are ex- tracted, including the number of question marks, date information and capitalized words, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experiments</head><p>We treat our task as a multi-class classification problem. We test classifications within-level and cross-level with only text-based features.</p><p>Experiment 1 Each level is tested with 10-fold cross-validation. SVM of the Weka toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hall et al., 2009</ref>) is chosen as the classifier. To address the data imbalance problem, the minority classes of the training data are oversampled with the Weka SMOTE package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chawla et al., 2002</ref>). The pa- rameters of SMOTE are decided according to the class distribution of the training data.</p><p>Experiment 2 The classifiers are trained on two levels and tested on the other level. Again, SVM is chosen as the model and SMOTE is used to over- sample the training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation</head><p>Kappa 6 and accuracy are chosen to evaluate the overall performance in prediction. For our email briefing task specifically, precision in unimpor- tant email prediction P(U) (avoid the false recog- nition of unimportant emails) and recall in impor- tant email prediction R(I) (cover as many impor- tant emails as possible) are evaluated. Paired t- tests are utilized to compare whether there are sig- nificant differences in performance (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>As demonstrated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, the text-based fea- tures are useful for the prediction of unimportant email classification but not as useful for the recog- nition of important emails. It also shows that the content type is an important indicator of the email's importance. While the content type is not always accessible in real life settings, the results demonstrate the necessity of extracting semantic information for email importance prediction. In <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, precision of unimportant email prediction is higher on the manager levels but lower on the employee level. This indicates a potential differ- ence of email features between the manager levels and the employee level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and future work</head><p>In this paper we present an email importance cor- pus collected through AMT. The dataset focuses on the importance of the information contained in the email instead of the email recipient's action. The content type of the email is also annotated and we find differences in content type proportions be- tween different levels of hierarchy. Experiments demonstrate that the content type is an important indicator of email importance. The system based on only text-based features identifies unimportant emails at minimum 0.5467 precision.</p><p>Agreement study shows that the agreed Turker annotations are as good as annotations of well- prepared expert annotators. We plan to increase the size of our dataset through AMT. We expect the dataset to be helpful for studies on email over- load problems. Meanwhile, we are aware that the current corpus lacks social and personal informa- tion. We believe features regarding such informa- tion (e.g. the recipient's email history with the contact, the recipient's personal preference in cat- egorizing emails, etc.) should also be incorporated for importance prediction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="true"><head>Table 1 : AMT annotation results, notice that #AllAgreed is close to #TypeAgreed</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Act.Req Info.Req Info Status Schedule Reminder Social Other All
