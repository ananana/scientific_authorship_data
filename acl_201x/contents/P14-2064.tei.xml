			<abstract>
				<p>This article contributes to the ongoing discussion in the computational linguistics community regarding instances that are difficult to annotate reliably. Is it worthwhile to identify those? What information can be inferred from them regarding the nature of the task? What should be done with them when building supervised machine learning systems? We address these questions in the context of a subjective semantic task. In this setting, we show that the presence of such instances in training data misleads a machine learner into misclassifying clear-cut cases. We also show that considering machine learning outcomes with and without the difficult cases, it is possible to identify specific weaknesses of the problem representation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The problem of cases that are difficult for anno- tation received recent attention from both the the- oretical and the applied perspectives. Such items might receive contradictory labels, without a clear way of settling the disagreement.  showed theoretically that hard cases -items with unreliable annota- tions -can lead to unfair benchmarking results when found in test data, and, in worst case, to a degradation in a machi74ne learner's performance on easy, uncontroversial instances if found in the training data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schwartz et al. (2011)</ref> provided an empirical demonstration that the presence of such difficult cases in dependency parsing evaluations leads to unstable benchmarking results, as diffe- rent gold standards might provide conflicting an- notations for such items. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Reidsma and Carletta (2008)</ref> demonstrated by simulation that systema- tic disagreements between annotators negatively impact generalization ability of classifiers built using data from different annotators. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Oosten et al. (2011)</ref> showed that judgments of readability of the same texts by different groups of experts are sufficiently systematically different to hamper cross-expert generalization of readability classi- fiers trained on annotations from different groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rehbein and Ruppenhofer (2011)</ref> discuss the ne- gative impact of systematic simulated annotation inconsistencies on active learning performance on a word-sense disambiguation task.</p><p>In this paper, we address the task of classify- ing words in a text as semantically new or old. Using multiple annotators, we empirically identify instances that show substantial disagreement be- tween annotators. We then discuss those both from the linguistic perspective, identifying some char- acteristics of such cases, and from the perspec- tive of machine learning, showing that the pres- ence of difficult cases in the training data misleads the machine learner on easy, clear-cut cases -a phenomenon termed hard case bias in Beigman and Beigman . The main con- tribution of this paper is in providing additional empricial evidence in support of the argument put forward in the literature regarding the need to pay attention to problematic, disagreeable instances in annotated data -not only from the linguistic per- spective, but also from a machine learning one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>The task considered here is that of classifying first occurrences of words in a text as semantically old or new. One of goals of the project is to inves- tigate the relationship between various kinds of non-novelty in text, and, in particular, the rela-tionship between semantic non-novelty (conceptu- alized as semantic association with some preced- ing word in the text), the information structure in terms of given and new information, and the cog- nitive status of discourse entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Postolache et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Birner and Ward, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gundel et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Prince, 1981)</ref>. If an annotator identified an asso- ciative tie from the target word back to some other word in the text, the target word is thereby classi- fied as semantically old (class 1, or positive); if no ties were identified, it is classified as new (class 0, or negative).</p><p>For the project, annotations were collected for 10 texts of various genres, where annotators were asked, for every first appearance of a word in a text, to point out previous words in the text that are semantically or associatively related to it. All data was annotated by 22 undergraduate and grad- uate students in various disciplines who were re- cruited for the task. During outlier analysis, data from two annotators was excluded from considera- tion, while 20 annotations were retained. This task is fairly subjective, with inter-annotator agreement κ=0.45 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beigman Klebanov and Shamir, 2006</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the number and proportion of in- stances that received the "semantically old" (1) la- bel from i annotators, for 0 ≤ i ≤ 20. The first col- umn shows the number of annotators who gave the label "semantically old" (1). Column 2 shows the number and proportion of instances that received the label 1 from the number of annotators shown in column 1. Column 3 shows the split into item dif- ficulty groups. We note that while about 20% of the instances received a unanimous 0 annotation and about 12% of the instances received just one 1 label out of 20 annotators, the remaining instances are spread out across various values of i. Reasons for this spread include intrinsic difficulty of some of the items, as well as attention slips. Since anno- tators need to consider the whole of the preceding text when annotating a given word, maintaining focus is a challenge, especially for words that first appear late in the text.</p><p>Our interest being in difficult, disagreeable cases, we group the instances into 5 bands accor- ding to the observed level of disagreement and the tendency in the majority of the annotations. Thus, items with at most two label 1 annotations are clearly semantically new, while those with at least 17 (out of 20) are clearly semantically old. The groups Hard 0 and Hard 1 contain instances with at least a 60% majority classification, while the middle class -Very Hard -contains instances for which it does not appear possible to even iden- tify the overall tendency.</p><p>In what follows, we investigate the learnabi- lity of the classification of semantic novelty from various combinations of easy, hard, and very hard data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Setup</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Training Partitions</head><p>The objective of the study is to determine the use- fulness of instances of various types in the training data for semantic novelty classification. In parti- cular, in light of , we want to check whether the presence of less reliable data (hard cases) in the training set adversely impacts performance on the highly reli- able data (easy cases). We therefore test separately on easy and hard cases.</p><p>We ran 25 rounds of the following experiment. All easy cases are randomly split 80% (train) and 20% (test), all hard cases are split into train and test sets in the same proportions. Then various parts of the training data are used to train the 5 sys- tems described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. We build models using easy data; hard data; easy and hard data; easy, hard, and very hard data; easy data and a weighted sample of the hard data. The labels for very hard data were assigned by flipping a fair coin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Machine Learning</head><p>We use linear Support Vector Machines classifier as implemented in SVMLight (Joachims, 1999). Apart from being a popular and powerful ma- chine learning method, linear SVM is one of the family of classifiers analyzed in Beigman and Beigman , where they are theo- retically shown to be vulnerable to hard case bias in the worst case.</p><p>To represent the instances, we use two features that capture semantic relatedness between words. One feature uses Latent Semantic Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Deerwester et al., 1990</ref>) trained on the Wall Street Jour- nal articles to quantify the distributional similarity of two words, the other uses an algorithm based on WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Miller, 1990)</ref> to calculate seman- tic relatedness, combining information from both the hierarchy and the glosses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beigman Klebanov, 2006</ref>). For each word, we calculate LSA (Word- Net) relatedness score for this word with each pre- ceding word in the text, and report the highest pair- wise score as the LSA (WordNet) feature value for the given word. The values of the features can be thought of as quantifying the strength of the evidence for semantic non-newness that could be obtained via a distributional or a dictionary-based method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>We calculate the accuracy of every system sepa- rately on the easy and hard test data. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Train</head><p>Test We observe first the performance of the system trained solely on hard cases (H in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). This system shows the worst performance, both on the easy test and on the hard test. In fact, this system failed to learn anything about the positive class in 24 out of the 25 runs, classifying all cases as nega- tive. It is thus safe to conclude that in the feature space used here the supervision signal in the hard cases is too weak to guide learning.</p><note type="other">-E Test-H Acc Rank Acc Rank E 0.781 1 0.643 2 E+H 0.764 2 0.654 1 E+H+VH 0.761 2 0.650 1,2 H 0.620 3 0.626 3 E+H 100 w 0.779 1 0.645 2</note><p>The system trained solely on easy cases (E in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>) significantly outperforms H both on the easy and on the hard test. That is, easy cases are more informative about the classification of hard cases than the hard cases themselves. This shows that at least some hard cases pattern similarly to the easy ones in the feature space; SVM failed to single them out when trained on hard cases alone, but they are learnable from the easy data.</p><p>The system that trained on all cases -both easy and hard -attains the best performance on hard cases but yields to E on the easy test <ref type="bibr">(Test-E)</ref>. This demonstrates what Beigman and Beigman Kle- banov (2009) called hard case bias -degradation in test performance on easy cases due to hard cases in the training data. The negative effect of using hard cases in training data can be mitigated if we only use a small sample of them (system E+H 100 w ); yet neither this nor other schemes we tried of selectively incorporating hard cases into training data produced an improvement over E when tested on easy cases (Test-E).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Beyond worst case</head><p>Beigman and Beigman  per- formed a theoretical analysis showing that hard cases could lead to hard case bias where hard cases have completely un-informative labels, with pro- bability of p=0.5 for either label. These corre- spond to very hard cases in our setting. According to <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, it is indeed the case that adding the very hard cases hurts performance, but not signif- icantly so -compare results for E+H vs E+H+VH systems.</p><p>Our results suggest that un-informative labels are not necessary for the hard case bias to sur- face. The instances grouped under Hard 1 have the probability of p=0.66 for class 1 and the in- stances grouped under Hard 0 have the probabi- lity of p=0.71 for class 0. Thus, while the labels are somewhat informative, it is apparently the case that the hard instances are distributed sufficiently differently in the feature space from the easy cases with the same label to produce a hard case bias.</p><p>Inspecting the distribution of hard cases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig- ure 1)</ref>, we note that hard cases do not follow the worst case pattern analyzed in Beigman and Beigman , where they were con- centrated in an area of the feature space that was removed far from the separation plane, a malig- nant but arguably unlikely scenario ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dligach et al., 2010)</ref>. Here, hard cases are spread both close and far from the plane, yet their distribution is suffi- ciently different from that of the easy cases to pro- duce hard case bias during learning.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> plots the hard instances in the two- dimensional feature space: Latent Semantic Anal- ysis score is shown on x-axis, and WordNet-based score is shown on the y-axis. The red lines show the linear separator induced when the system is trained on easy cases only (system E in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>), whereas the green line shows the separator in- duced when the system is trained on both easy and hard cases (system E+H). It is apparent from the figure that the difference in the distributions of the easy and the hard cases lead to a lower threshold for LSA score when WordNet score is zero and a higher threshold of WordNet score when LSA score is zero in hard vs easy cases. That is, the system exposed to hard cases learned to trust LSA more and to trust Word- Net less when determining that an instance is se- mantically old than a system that saw only easy cases at train time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">The nature of hard cases</head><p>The tendency to trust WordNet less yields an improvement in precision (92.1% for system E+H on Test-E class 1 data vs 84% for system E on Test-E class 1 data), which comes at a cost of a drop in recall (42.2% vs 53.3%) on easy positive cases. This suggests that high WordNet scores that are not supported by distributional evidence are a source of Hard 0 cases that made the system more cautious when relying on WordNet scores.</p><p>The pattern of low LSA score and high Word- Net score often obtains for rare senses of words: Distributional evidence typically points away from these senses, but they can be recovered through dictionary definitions (glosses) in WordNet.</p><p>An example of hard 0 case involves a homony- mous rare sense. Deck is used in the observation deck sense in one of the texts. However, it was found to be highly related to buy by WordNet- based measure through the notion of illegal -buy in the sense of bribe and deck in the sense of a packet of illegal drugs. This is clearly a spuri- ous connection that makes deck appear semanti- cally associated with preceding material, whereas annotators largely perceived it as new.</p><p>Exposure to such cases at training time leads the system to forgo handling rare senses that lack dis- tributional evidence, thus leading to misclassifica- tion of easy positive cases that exhibit a similar pattern. Thus, stall and market are both used in the sales outlet sense in one of the text. They come out highly related by WordNet measure; yet in the 68 instances of stall in the training data for LSA the homonymous verbal usage predominates. Simi- larly, partner is overwhelmingly used in the busi- ness partner sense in the WSJ data, hence wife and partner come out distributionally unrelated, while the WordNet based measure successfully recovers these connections.</p><p>Our features, while rich enough to diagnose a rare sense (low LSA score and high WordNet score), do not provide information regarding the appropriateness of the rare sense in context. Short of full scale word sense disambiguation, we expe- rimented with the idea of taking the second highest pairwise score as the value of the WordNet fea- ture, under the assumption that an appropriate rare sense is likely to be related to multiple words in the preceding text, while a spurious rare sense is less likely to be accidentally related to more than one preceding word. We failed to improve per- formance, however; it is thus left for future work to enrich the representation of the problem so that cases with inappropriate rare senses can be differ- entiated from the appropriate ones. In the context of the current article, the identification of a parti- cular weakness in the representation is an added value of the analysis of the machine learning per- formance with and without the difficult cases.</p></div>
