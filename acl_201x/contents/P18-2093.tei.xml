			<abstract>
				<p>Humor is one of the most attractive parts in human communication. However, automatically recognizing humor in text is challenging due to the complex characteristics of humor. This paper proposes to model sentiment association between discourse units to indicate how the punch-line breaks the expectation of the setup. We found that discourse relation, sentiment conflict and sentiment transition are effective indicators for humor recognition. On the perspective of using sentiment related features, sentiment association in discourse is more useful than counting the number of emotional words.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Humor can be recognized as a cognitive process, which provokes laughter and provides amusement. It not only promotes the success of human inter- action, but also has a positive impact on human mental and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Martineau, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson and Arnoult, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lefcourt and Martin, 2012)</ref>. To some extent, humor reflects a kind of intelligence.</p><p>However, from both theoretical and computa- tional perspectives, it is hard for computers to build a mechanism for understanding humor like human beings. First, humor is generally loosely defined. Thus it is impossible to construct rules to identify humor. Second, humor is context and background dependent that it expects to break the reader's common sense within a specific situation. Finally, the study of humor involves multiple dis- ciplines like psychology, linguistics and computer science. Recently, humor recognition has drawn more attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005</ref>; * corresponding author Figure 1: An example of RST style discourse pars- ing, sentiment polarity analysis and the features we consider in this paper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Friedland and Allan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhang and Liu, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yang et al., 2015)</ref>. The main trend is to design interpretable and computable features that can be well explained by humor theories and easy to be implemented in practice.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a novel idea to exploit sentiment analysis for humor recognition. Con- sidering superiority theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gruner, 1997)</ref> and re- lief theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rutter, 1997)</ref>, sentiment information should be common in humorous texts to express comparisons between good and bad or the emo- tion changes.</p><p>Existing work mainly considers statistical senti- ment information such as the number of emotional words. We argue that modeling sentiment asso- ciation at discourse unit level should be a better option for exploiting sentiment information. Such sentiment association in some extent can be used as sentiment patterns to describe the expectedness or unexpectedness, which is the main idea of in- congruity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Suls, 1972)</ref>.</p><p>To incorporate discourse information, we ex- ploit RST(Rhetorical Structure Theory) style dis- course parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref> to get discourse units and relations. Combining with sentiment analysis, we derive discourse relation, sentiment conflict and sentiment transition fea-tures for humor recognition as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref>. The experimental results show that our method can improve the performance of humor recog- nition on the dataset provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005</ref>) and exploiting sentiment infor- mation at discourse unit level is a better option compared with simply using the number of emo- tional words as features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Humor Recognition</head><p>Humor recognition is typically viewed as a clas- sification problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005</ref>). The main goal is to identify whether a given text contains humorous expressions. Humor is a cognitive process. Thus the interpretability of models is important. Most existing work focuses on designing features motivated by humor theories from different perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Humor Theories</head><p>The highly recognized theories include superiority theory, relief theory and incongruity theory.</p><p>Superiority theory expresses that we laugh be- cause some types of situations make us feel supe- rior to other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gruner, 1997)</ref>. For example, in some jokes, people appear stupid because they have misunderstood an obvious situation or made a stupid mistake.</p><p>Relief theory says that humor is the release of nervous energy. The nervous energy relieved through laughter is the energy of emotions that have been found to be inappropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Spencer et al., 1860;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Rutter, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Incongruity theory says that humor is the per- ception of something incongruous, something that violates our common sense and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Suls, 1972)</ref> . It is now the dominant theory of humor in philosophy and psychology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Baseline Features</head><p>Motivated by the humor theories, many re- searchers design features to describe the charac- teristics of humor. We mainly follow the recent work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yang et al. (2015)</ref> to build baseline fea- tures. The features are summarized as follows.</p><p>Incongruity Structure. Inconsistency is con- sidered as an important factor in causing laugh- ter. Following the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yang et al. (2015)</ref>, we describe inconsistency through the following two features:</p><p>• The largest semantic distance between word pairs in a sentence</p><p>• The smallest semantic distance between word pairs in a sentence</p><p>The semantic distance is measured by comput- ing cosine similarity between word embeddings.</p><p>Ambiguity. Ambiguity of semantic is a crucial part of humor <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Miller and Gurevych, 2015)</ref>, be- cause ambiguity often causes incongruity, which comes from different understandings of the inten- tion expressed by the author <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bekinschtein et al., 2011</ref>). The computation of ambiguity features is based on WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Fellbaum, 2012)</ref>. We use WordNet to obtain all senses of each word w in an instance s and measure the possibility of ambigu- ity by computing log w∈s num of sense(w), which is used as the value of an ambiguity feature. We also compute the sense farmost and sense clos- est features as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Yang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Interpersonal Effect. In addition to the com- monly used linguistic cues, interpersonal effect may serve an important role in humor ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhang and Liu, 2014)</ref>. It is believed that texts containing emotional words and subjective words are more likely to express humor. Therefore, we use the fol- lowing features based on the resources in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wilson et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>• The number of words with positive polarity</p><p>• The number of words with negative polarity</p><p>• The number of subjective words Phonetic Style. Phonetics can also create comic effects. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005</ref>), we build a feature set which includes alliteration chain and rhyme chain by using CMU speech dictionary 1 . An alliteration chain is a set of words that have the same first phoneme. Simi- larly, a rhyme chain includes words with the same last syllable. The features are:</p><p>• The number of alliteration chains</p><p>• The number of rhyme chains</p><p>• The length of the longest alliteration chain</p><p>• The length of the longest rhyme chain KNN. The KNN feature set contains the labels of the top 5 instances in the training data, which are closest to the target instance.</p><p>The above five feature sets are denoted as Hu- mor Centric Features(HCF).</p><p>Word2Vec Features. Averaged word embed- dings are used as sentence representations for clas- sification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Modeling Sentiment Association in Discourse</head><p>As described in humor theories and baseline fea- tures, emotional words are viewed as important in- dicators of humorous expressions, which trigger the subjective opinions and sentiment. Previous work only considers the number of words with dif- ferent sentiment polarity, but ignores the sentiment association in discourse.</p><p>Consider the example in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> again. The first clause expresses a positive sentiment, while the second clause reveals a negative sentiment. The different sentiment polarity forms a kind of contrast or comparison.</p><p>Such sentiment association can be explained with main humor theories. For example, superi- ority theory says humor is the result of suddenly feeling superior when compared with others who are infirm or unfortunate. There are usually two objects, one of the objects is a laugher who feel better than the other, a weak person. The senti- ment association between the perfect weight and the late height highlights such a comparison.</p><p>There are also other cases that may have senti- ment association between negatively nervous and positively relief or from expected sentiment to un- expected sentiment, which can be explained with relief theory (Rutter, 1997) and incongruity the- ory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Suls, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ritchie, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, sentiment association should be a useful representation to reveal the nature of hu- mor. In this paper, we utilize a discourse parser to get comparable text units and measure sentiment association among them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Discourse Parsing</head><p>A well-written text is organized by text units which are connected to express the author's inten- tions through certain discourse relations.</p><p>We use the discourse parser implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Feng and Hirst (2012)</ref> to automatically recog- nize RST style discourse relations. RST struc- ture builds a hierarchical structure over the whole text <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref>. A coher- ent text is represented as a discourse tree, whose leaf nodes are individual text units called elemen- tary discourse unites (EDUs).These independent EDUs can be connected through their relations. The parser can automatically separate a sentence into EDUs and gives discourse relations between EDUs. One of its advantage over others is that it can identify implicit relations, when no discourse marker is given. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> There are about 77% of sen- tences in our dataset that don't have explicit con- nective.</p><p>Our goals of using discourse parsing include two aspects: First, we want to investigate whether humorous texts prefer any discourse relations to realize or enhance the effect. Second, EDUs can be used as comparable text units and enable us to measure sentiment association among them. As a result, we derive three types of features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Discourse Relation Features</head><p>For each instance, we recognize EDUs and the re- lations connecting them. Then, we design boolean features to indicate the occurrence of discourse re- lations. The main idea is that some discourse rela- tions such as contrast usually indicate a topic tran- sition, which may be used to achieve the effect of unexpectedness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Sentiment Conflict Feature</head><p>The sentiment conflict we proposed is a specific and descriptive feature to model a kind of incon- gruity. After dividing an instance into EDUs, we check the sentiment polarity of each EDU using the TextBlob toolkit 3 . The sentiment polarity is either positive, negative or neutral. The sentiment conflict feature is a boolean feature. If there are at least two EDUs and their polarity are opposite (positive vs. negative), the feature is set as True.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Sentiment Transition Features</head><p>Besides the heuristically designed sentiment con- flict feature, we integrate sentiment polarity and discourse relations. We thought that the expected sentiment might be dependent on the discourse re- lation. For example, if two clauses have a se- quence relation, their sentiment polarity may be expected to be the same, while if their relation is contrast, their polarity might be different.</p><p>For two EDUs with a discourse relation R, we get their sentiment polarity respec- tively, namely E 1 and E 2 , where E * ∈ {positive, negative, neutral}. We design a fea- ture E 1 •R•E 2 , where • indicates a concatenation operation and E 1 and E 2 are ordered according to the order in which they appear in the instance. For sentence with more than two EDUs, we do this re- cursively and set a True value for every extracted features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Research Questions</head><p>We are interested in the following research ques- tions:</p><p>• Whether the proposed features are useful for humor recognition?</p><p>• Whether the way we manipulate sentiment is more effective compared with previous ap- proaches?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Settings</head><p>We conducted experiments on the dataset used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005</ref>). The dataset contains 10,200 humorous short texts and 10000 non-humorous short texts coming from Reuters titles and Proverbs and British National Cor- pus(RPBN). We used the pre-trained word embeddings that are learned using the Word2Vec toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) on Google News dataset. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We used the implementation of Random Forest in Scikit- learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>) as the classifier. We ran 10-fold cross-validation on the dataset and the average performance would be reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Baselines</head><p>• HCF. The method includes the incongruity structure, ambiguity, interpersonal effect, phonetic style features and KNN features.</p><p>•  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Humor recognition results. Base1 to Base4 correspond to four baseline settings and SA represents sentiment association features.</p><p>• Word2Vec. As described in Section 2.2, this method exploits semantic representations of sentences. It is also content dependent but has better generalization capability.</p><p>• HCF+Word2Vec. This method combines HCF and Word2Vec and is the strongest set- ting as reported in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yang et al., 2015</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the results, reported with accu- racy(Acc.), precision (P), recall (R) and F 1 score. We add sentiment association features (SA) to four baseline settings. In all cases, the performance is improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">System Comparisons</head><p>Base2 only uses features that are motivated by humor theories without content features. After adding SA features, Base2 achieves a significant improvement of 4% in accuracy and 3.5% in F 1 score. Since SA features have good interpretabil- ity, they complement previous features very well both in theory and practice.</p><p>Base1, Base3 and Base4 all consider content features and their performance is significantly bet- ter than Base2. However, since the negative in- stances in the dataset include news titles, it is very likely that the model matches specific topics of the data, rather than capturing the nature of humor. We can see that the KNN method that is based on content similarity only can achieve high scores, which is unreasonable. Even so, SA features still benefit the three baseline settings, although the im- provements become small. The results indicate that sentiment association features are useful for humor recognition, especially when domain spe- cific information is not considered.   <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Comparing the ways of utilizing senti- ment information. Base2 doesn't consider content; Base4 utilizes full information; SA: sentiment as- sociation, EWC: emotional word count.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Comparing with Emotional Word Count</head><p>Previous work also considers sentiment informa- tion but in a different way. Among interpersonal effect features, the numbers of emotional words are used as features, noted as emotional word count, EWC for short. We want to compare the sentiment association features with EWC.</p><p>We compare them in two conditions. First, we replace EWC features with SA features in Base2, which doesn't use content information. Second, we replace EWC features with SA features in Base4, which considers all available information. As shown inTable 2, in both conditions, SA fea- tures are more effective, indicating the usefulness of analyzing sentiment polarity at EDU level. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows the results of adding individual sen- timent association features on the basis of Base2 and Base4. All three features are shown to be use- ful for humor recognition. Sentiment transition is most useful. Again, when removing content fea- tures (Base2), the improvements are large. In con- trast, if considering content features (Base4), the improvements become small. This is because the content features are already very strong for distin- guishing two classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Discussion of Sentiment Association</head><p>Discourse Relation. By analyzing the data, we found that 79% of the humorous instances contain more than one EDU, while 38% of non-humorous messages contain more than one EDU. This means that humorous texts may have more complex sen- tence structures. The most frequent discourse re- lations in humorous data include condition, back- ground and Contrast. In contrast, non-humorous texts contain same-unit and attribution more. The most discriminative relation is condition, which accounts for 4.5% in humorous instances and 2% in non-humorous instances. This may be ex- plained with the incongruity theory, where the  setup of the text prepares an expectation for the readers, while the punchline breaks the expecta- tion. Condition relation is often used to connect the setup and the punchline. Sentiment polarity in Humor. According to the automatic sentiment analysis tool we use, 57% of humorous instances have non-neutral polarity, while 47% of non-humorous instances have non- neutral polarity. This means that humor truly has a positive correlation with sentiment polarities and sentiment analysis should be a useful complement to semantic analysis for measuring incongruity. In addition, as we have shown, measuring sentiment at discourse level should be more important. Com- bining discourse relations and sentiment polarity performs best.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have studied humor recogni- tion from a novel perspective: modeling senti- ment association in discourse. We integrate dis- course parsing and sentiment analysis to get senti- ment association patterns and measure incongruity in a new angle. The proposed idea can be ex- plained with major humor theories. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of pro- posed features. This indicates that sentiment asso- ciation could be a better representation compared with simply analyzing the distribution of senti- ment polarity for humor recognition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[</head><label></label><figDesc>My weight is perfect for my height,]EDU1 [but your height is late for weight.]EDU2 Discourse relation: contrast Sentiment polarity: positive Sentiment polarity: negative Sentiment conflict: True Sentiment transition: positive-contrast-negative</figDesc></figure>
