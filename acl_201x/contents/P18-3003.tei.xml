				<p>The evaluation of image caption quality is a challenging task, which requires the assessment of two main aspects in a caption: adequacy and fluency. These quality aspects can be judged using a combination of several linguistic features. However, most of the current image captioning metrics focus only on specific linguistic facets, such as the lexical or semantic, and fail to meet a satisfactory level of correlation with human judgements at the sentence-level. We propose a learning-based framework to incorporate the scores of a set of lexical and semantic metrics as features, to capture the adequacy and fluency of captions at different linguistic levels. Our experimental results demonstrate that composite metrics draw upon the strengths of stand-alone measures to yield improved correlation and accuracy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Automatic image captioning requires the under- standing of the visual aspects of images to gen- erate human-like descriptions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bernardi et al., 2016)</ref>. The evaluation of the generated captions is crucial for the development and fine-grained analysis of image captioning systems ( . Automatic evaluation metrics aim at providing efficient, cost-effective and objective assessments of the caption quality. Since these automatic measures serve as an alternative to the manual evaluation, the major concern is that such measures should correlate well with human as- sessments. In other words, automatic metrics are expected to mimic the human judgement process by taking into account various aspects that humans consider when they assess the captions.</p><p>The evaluation of image captions can be charac- terized as having two major aspects: adequacy and fluency. Adequacy is how well the caption reflects the source image, and fluency is how well the cap- tion conforms to the norms and conventions of hu- man language <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Toury, 2012)</ref>. In the case of man- ual evaluation, both adequacy and fluency tend to shape the human perception of the overall caption quality. Most of the automatic evaluation metrics tend to capture these aspects of quality based on the idea that "the closer the candidate description to the professional human caption, the better it is in quality" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>). The output in such case is a score (the higher the better) reflect- ing the similarity.</p><p>The majority of the commonly used metrics for image captioning such as BLEU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>) and METEOR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Banerjee and Lavie, 2005</ref>) are based on the lexical similarity. Lexical mea- sures (n-gram based) work by rewarding the n- gram overlaps between the candidate and the ref- erence captions. Thus, measuring the adequacy by counting the n-gram matches and assessing the fluency by implicitly using the reference n-grams as a language model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mutton et al., 2007)</ref>. How- ever, a high number of n-gram matches cannot al- ways be indicative of a high caption quality, nor a low number of n-gram matches can always be reflective of a low caption quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Giménez and M` arquez, 2010)</ref>. A recently proposed semantic metric SPICE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2016)</ref>, overcomes this deficiency of lexical measures by measuring the semantic similarity of candidate and reference captions using Scene Graphs. However, the major drawback of SPICE is that it ignores the fluency of the output caption.</p><p>Integrating assessment scores of different mea- sures is an intuitive and reasonable way to improve the current image captioning evaluation methods. Through this methodology, each metric plays the role of a judge, assessing the quality of captions in terms of lexical, grammatical or semantic accu- racy. For this research, we use the scores conferred by a set of measures that are commonly used for captioning and combine them through a learning- based framework. In this work: 1. We evaluate various combinations of a chosen set of metrics and show that the proposed com- posite metrics correlate better with human judge- ments. 2. We analyse the accuracy of composite metrics in terms of differentiating between pairs of cap- tions in reference to the ground truth captions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Literature Review</head><p>The success of any captioning system depends on how well it transforms the visual informa- tion to natural language. Therefore, the signifi- cance of reliable automatic evaluation metrics is undeniable for the fine-grained analysis and ad  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lu et al., 2017)</ref>, it has also benefited from automatic metrics which were initially pro- posed to evaluate machine translations/text sum- maries, such as BLEU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>), ME- TEOR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Denkowski and Lavie, 2014</ref>) and ROUGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lin, 2004</ref>).</p><p>In the past few years, two metrics CIDEr ( ) and SPICE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2016)</ref> were developed specifically for im- age captioning. Compared to the previously used metrics, these two show a better correlation with human judgements. The authors in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu et al., 2016)</ref> proposed a linear combination of SPICE and CIDEr called SPIDEr and showed that op- timizing image captioning models for SPIDEr's score can lead to better quality captions. How- ever, SPIDEr was not evaluated for its correlation with human judgements. Recently, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kusner et al., 2015)</ref> proposed the use of a document similar- ity metric Word Mover's Distance (WMD), which uses the word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) embed- ding space to determine the distance between two texts.</p><p>The metrics used for caption evaluation can be broadly categorized as lexical and semantic mea- sures. Lexical metrics reward the n-gram matches between candidate captions and human generated reference texts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Giménez and M` arquez, 2010)</ref>, and can be further categorized as unigram and n-gram based measures. Unigram based methods such as BLEU-1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Papineni et al., 2002</ref>), assess only the lexical correctness of the candidate. However, in the case of METEOR or WMD, where some sort of synonym-matching/stemming is also involved, unigram-overlaps help to evaluate both the lexi- cal and to some degree the semantic aptness of the output caption. N-gram based metrics such as ROUGE and CIDEr primarily assess the lex- ical correctness of the caption, but also measure some amount of syntactic accuracy by capturing the word order.</p><p>The lexical measures have received criticism based on the argument that the n-gram overlap is neither an adequate nor a necessary indicative measure of the caption quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2016)</ref>. To overcome this limitation, semantic met- rics such as SPICE, capture the sentence meaning to evaluate the candidate captions. Their perfor- mance however is highly dependent on a success- ful semantic parsing. Purely syntactic measures, which capture the grammatical correctness, exist, and have been used in MT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mutton et al., 2007)</ref>, but not in the captioning domain.</p><p>While fluency (well-formedness) of a candidate caption can be attributed to the syntactic and lexi- cal correctness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fomicheva et al., 2016)</ref>, adequacy (informativeness) depends on the lexical and se- mantic correctness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rios et al., 2011</ref>). We hypoth- esize that by combining scores from different met- rics, which have different strengths in measuring adequacy and fluency, a composite metric that is of overall higher quality is created (Sec. 5).</p><p>Machine learning offers a systematic approach to integrate the scores of stand-alone metrics. In the MT evaluation, various successful learn- ing paradigms have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bojar et al., 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bojar et al., 2017</ref>) and the existing learning-based metrics can be categorized as binary functions-"which classify the candidate translation as good or bad" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kulesza and Shieber, 2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guzmán et al., 2015)</ref> or continuous func- tions-"which score the quality of translation on an absolute scale" (Song and Cohn, 2011), <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albrecht and Hwa, 2008)</ref>. Our research is conceptually similar to the work in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kulesza and Shieber, 2004</ref>), which induces a "human-likeness" criteria. How- ever, our approach differs in terms of the learning algorithm as well as the features used. Moreover, the focus of this work is to assess various combina- tions of metrics (that capture the caption quality at </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed Approach</head><p>In our approach, we use scores conferred by a set of existing metrics as an input to a multi-layer feed-forward neural network. We adopt a training criteria based on a simple question: is the caption machine or human generated? Our trained classi- fier sets a boundary between good and bad quality captions, thus classifying them as human or ma- chine produced. Furthermore, we obtain a contin- uous output score by using the class-probability, which can be considered as some "measure of be- lievability" that the candidate caption is human generated. Framing our learning problem as a classification task allows us to create binary train- ing data using the human generated captions and machine generated captions as positive and nega- tive training examples respectively.</p><p>Our proposed framework shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> first extracts a set of numeric features using the can- didate "C" and the reference sentences "S". The extracted feature vector is then fed as an input to our multi-layer neural network. Each entity of the feature vector corresponds to the score generated by one of the four measures: METEOR, CIDEr, WMD 1 and SPICE respectively. We chose these measures because they show a relatively better correlation with human judgements compared to the other commonly used ones for captioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kilickaya et al., 2016)</ref>. Our composite metrics are named Eval M S , Eval CS , Eval M CS , Eval W CS , Eval M W S and Eval M W CS . The subscript let- ters in each name corresponds to the first letter of each individual metric. For example, Eval M S corresponds to the combination of METEOR and SPICE. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the linguistic aspects cap- tured by the stand-alone 2 and the composite met- rics. SPICE is based on sentence meanings, thus it evaluates the semantics. CIDEr covers the syntac- tic and lexical aspects, whereas Meteor and WMD assess the lexical and semantic components. The learning-based metrics mostly fall in the region formed by the overlap of all three major linguis- tics facets, leading to better a evaluation.</p><p>We train our metrics to maximise the classifica- tion accuracy on the training dataset. Since we are primarily interested in maximizing the correlation with human judgements, we perform early stop- ping based on Kendalls τ (rank correlation) with the validation set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Setup</head><p>To train our composite metrics, we source data from   <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Turk, 2012)</ref>. For each image in Flicker30k, we randomly select three of the human generated cap- tions as positive training examples, and three ma- chine generated (one from each image captioning model) captions as negative training examples. We combined the Microsoft COCO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2015)</ref> training and validation set (containing 123,287 im- ages in total, each paired with 5 or more captions), to train the image captioning models using their official codes. These image captioning models achieved state-of-the-art performance when they were published.</p><p>In order to obtain reference captions for each training example, we again use the human writ- ten descriptions of Flicker30k. For each neg- ative training example (machine-generated cap- tion), we randomly choose 4 out of 5 human writ- ten captions originally associated with each im- age. Whereas, for each positive training example (human-generated caption), we use the 5 human written captions associated with each image, se- lecting one of these as a human candidate caption (positive example) and the remaining 4 as refer- ences. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, a possible pairing scenario is shown for further clarification.</p><p>For our validation set, we source data from Flicker8k ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Young et al., 2014</ref>). This dataset contains 5,822 captions assessed by three expert judges on a scale of 1 (the caption is unrelated to the image) to 4 (the caption describes the im- age without any errors). From our training set, we remove the captions of images which overlap with the captions in the validation and test sets (discussed in Sec. 5), leaving us with a total of 132,984 non-overlapping captions for the training of the composite metrics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Correlation</head><p>The most desirable characteristic of an automatic evaluation metric is its strong correlation with hu- man scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Zhang and Vogel, 2010)</ref>. A stronger correlation with human judgements indicates that a metric captures the information that humans use to assess a candidate caption. To evaluate the sentence-level correlation of our composite met- rics with human judgements, we source data from a dataset collected by the authors in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aditya et al., 2017)</ref>. We use 6993 manually evaluated human and machine generated captions from this set, which were scored by AMT workers for correct- ness on the scale of 1 (low relevance to image) to 5 (high relevance to image). Each caption in the dataset is accompanied by a single judgement. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, we report the Kendalls τ correlation co- efficient for the proposed composite metrics and other commonly used caption evaluation metrics. It can be observed from <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> that composite metrics outperform stand-alone metrics in terms of sentence-level correlation. The combination of Meteor and SPICE (Eval M S ) and METEOR, CIDEr and SPICE (Eval M CS ) showed the most promising results. The success of these com- posite metrics can be attributed to the individ- ual strengths of Meteor, CIDEr and SPICE. ME- TEOR is a strong lexical measure based on un- igram matching, which uses additional linguistic knowledge for word matching, such as the mor- phological variation in words via stemming and dictionary based look-up for synonyms and para- phrases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Banerjee and Lavie, 2005</ref>). CIDEr uses higher order n-grams to account for fluency and down-weighs the commonly occurring (less infor- mative) n-grams by performing Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting for each n-gram in the dataset ( . SPICE on the other hand is a strong in- dicator of the semantic correctness of a caption. Together these metrics assess the lexical, seman- tic and syntactic information. The composite met- rics which included WMD in the combination achieved a lower performance, compared to the ones in which WMD was not included. One possi- ble reason is that WMD heavily penalizes shorter candidate captions when the number of words be- tween the output and the reference captions are not equal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kusner et al., 2015)</ref>. This penalty might not be consistently useful as it is possible for a shorter candidate caption to be both fluent and adequate. Therefore, WMD is a better suited metric for mea- suring document distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Accuracy</head><p>We follow the framework introduced in ) to analyse the ability of a met- ric to discriminate between pairs of captions with reference to the ground truth caption. A met- ric is considered accurate if it assigns a higher score to the caption preferred by humans. For this experiment, we use PASCAL-50s , which contains human judge- ments for 4000 triplets of descriptions (one refer- ence caption with two candidate captions). Based on the pairing, the triplets are grouped into four categories (comprising of 1000 triplets each) i.e., Human-Human Correct (HC), Human-Human In- correct (HI), Human-Machine (HM), Machine- Machine (MM). We follow the original approach of ) and use 5 reference captions per candidate to assess the accuracy of the metrics and report them in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows that on average composite measures pro- duce better accuracy compared to the individual metrics. Amongst the four categories, HC is the hardest, in which all metrics show the worst per- formance. Differentiating between two good qual- ity (human generated) correct captions is challeng- ing as it involves a fine-grained analysis of the two candidates. Eval M S achieves the highest accu- racy in HC category which shows that as caption- ing systems continue to improve, this combination of lexical and semantic metrics will continue to perform well. Moreover, human generated cap- tions are usually fluent. Therefore, a combination of strong indicators of adequacy such as SPICE and METEOR is the most suitable for this task. Eval M CS shows the highest accuracy in differ-entiating between machine captions, which is an- other important category as one of the main goals of automatic evaluation is to distinguish between two machine algorithms. Amongst the composite metrics, Eval M S is again the best in distinguish- ing human captions (good quality) from machine captions (bad quality) which was our basic train- ing criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Works</head><p>In this paper we propose a learning-based ap- proach to combine various metrics to improve cap- tion evaluation. Our experimental results show that metrics operating along different linguistic di- mensions can be successfully combined through a learning-based framework, and they outperform the existing metrics for caption evaluation in term of correlation and accuracy, with Eval M S and Eval M CS giving the best overall performance.</p><p>Our study reveals that the proposed approach is promising and has a lot of potential to be used for evaluation in the captioning domain. In the fu- ture, we plan to integrate features (components) of metrics instead of their scores for a better per- formance. We also intend to use syntactic mea- sures, which to the best of our knowledge have not yet been used for caption evaluation (except in an indirect way by the n-gram measures which capture the word order) and study how they can improve the correlation at the sentence level. Ma- jority of the metrics for captioning focus more on adequacy as compared to fluency. This aspect also needs further attention and a combination of met- rics/features that can specifically assess the flu- ency of captions needs to be devised.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overall framework of the proposed Composite Metrics</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,72.00,62.81,453.54,218.81" type="bitmap" /></figure>
