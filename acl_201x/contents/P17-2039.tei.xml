				<p>Argumentation quality is viewed differently in argumentation theory and in practical assessment approaches. This paper studies to what extent the views match empirically. We find that most observations on quality phrased spontaneously are in fact adequately represented by theory. Even more, relative comparisons of arguments in practice correlate with absolute quality ratings based on theory. Our results clarify how the two views can learn from each other.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The assessment of argumentation quality is critical for any application built upon argument mining, such as debating technologies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rinott et al., 2015</ref>). However, research still disagrees on whether qual- ity should be assessed from a theoretical or from a practical viewpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allwood, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Theory states, among other things, that a cogent argument has acceptable premises that are relevant to its conclusion and sufficient to draw the conclu- sion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Johnson and Blair, 2006</ref>). Practitioners ob- ject that such quality dimensions are hard to assess for real-life arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Habernal and Gurevych, 2016b)</ref>. Moreover, the normative nature of theory suggests absolute quality ratings, but in practice it seems much easier to state which argument is more convincing-a relative assessment. Consider two debate-portal arguments for "advancing the com- mon good is better than personal pursuit", taken from the corpora analyzed later in this paper: Argument A "While striving to make advance- ments for the common good you can change the world forever. Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it."</p><p>Argument B "I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand."</p><p>In the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Habernal and Gurevych (2016b)</ref>, annotators assessed Argument A as more convinc- ing than B. When giving reasons for their assess- ment, though, they saw A as more credible and well thought through; that does not seem to be too far from the theoretical notion of cogency. This paper gives empirical answers to the ques- tion of how different the theoretical and practical views of argumentation quality actually are. Sec- tion 2 briefly reviews existing theories and practical approaches. Section 3 then empirically analyzes correlations in two recent argument corpora, one annotated for 15 well-defined quality dimensions taken from theory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wachsmuth et al., 2017a</ref>) and one with 17 reasons for quality differences phrased spontaneously in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Habernal and Gurevych, 2016a</ref>). In a crowdsourcing study, we test whether lay annotators achieve agreement on the theoretical quality dimensions (Section 4).</p><p>We find that assessments of overall argumenta- tion quality largely match in theory and practice. Nearly all phrased reasons are adequately repre- sented in theory. However, some theoretical quality dimensions seem hard to separate in practice. Most importantly, we provide evidence that the observed relative quality differences are reflected in abso- lute quality ratings. Still, our study underpins the fact that the theory-based argumentation quality assessment remains complex. Our results do not generally answer the question of what view of ar- gumentation quality is preferable, but they clarify where theory can learn from practice and vice versa. In particular, practical approaches indicate what to focus on to simplify theory, whereas theory seems beneficial to guide quality assessment in practice. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Theory versus Practice</head><p>This section outlines major theories and practical approaches to argumentation quality assessment, including those we compare in the present paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Theoretical Views of Quality Assessment</head><p>Argumentation theory discusses logical, rhetorical, and dialectical quality. As few real-life arguments are logically sound, requiring true premises that de- ductively entail a conclusion, cogency (as defined in Section 1) is largely seen as the main logical qual- ity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Johnson and Blair, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Damer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Govier, 2010)</ref>. Toulmin (1958) models the general struc- ture of logical arguments, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Walton et al. (2008)</ref> analyze schemes of fallacies and strong arguments. A fallacy is a kind of error that undermines reason- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Tindale, 2007)</ref>. Strength may mean cogency but also rhetorical effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969)</ref>. Rhetoric has been studied since Aristotle (2007) who developed the notion of the means of persuasion (logos, ethos, pathos) and their linguistic delivery in terms of arrangement and style. Dialectical quality dimensions resemble those of cogency, but arguments are judged specifi- cally by their reasonableness for achieving agree- ment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wachsmuth et al. (2017a)</ref> point out that dialecti- cal builds on rhetorical, and rhetorical builds on log- ical quality. They derive a unifying taxonomy from the major theories, decomposing quality hierarchi- cally into cogency, effectiveness, reasonableness, and subdimensions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> </p></div>

In Section 3, we use their absolute quality ratings from 1 (low) to 3 (high) annotated by three experts for each dimension of 304 arguments taken from the UKPConvArg1 corpus detailed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Practical Views of Quality Assessment</head><p>There is an application area where absolute quality ratings of argumentative text are common practice: essay scoring (Beigman <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Klebanov et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Persing and Ng (2015)</ref> annotated the argumentative strength of essays composing multiple arguments with notable agreement. For single arguments, how- ever, all existing approaches that we are aware of assess quality in relative terms, e.g., Cabrio and Vil- lata <ref type="formula">(2012)</ref>   <ref type="formula">(2015)</ref> ar- gue that normative concepts such as fallacies rarely apply to real-life arguments and that they are too sophisticated for operationalization. Based on the idea that relative assessment is eas- ier, Habernal and Gurevych (2016b) crowdsourced the UKPConvArg1 corpus. Argument pairs (A, B) from a debate portal were classified as to which argument is more convincing. Without giving any guidelines, the authors also asked for reasons as to why A is more convincing than B. In a follow-up study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Habernal and Gurevych, 2016a</ref>), these rea- sons were used to derive a hierarchical annotation scheme. 9111 argument pairs were then labeled with one or more of the 17 reason labels in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> Negative Properties of Argument B Positive Properties of Argument A   by crowd workers (UKPConvArg2). These pairs represent the practical view in our experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Matching Theory and Practice</head><p>We now report on experiments that we performed to examine to what extent the theory and practice of argumentation quality assessment match. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Corpus-based Comparison of the Views</head><p>Several dimensions and reasons in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 and 2</ref> seem to refer to the same or opposite property, e.g., clarity and 5-3 (unclear). This raises the question of how absolute ratings of arguments based on the- ory relate to relative comparisons of argument pairs in practice. We informally state three hypotheses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Hypothesis 1</formula><p>The reasons for quality differences in practice are adequately represented in theory. Hypothesis 2 The perception of overall argumen- tation quality is the same in theory and practice. Hypothesis 3 Relative quality differences are re- flected by differences in absolute quality ratings.</p><p>As both corpora described in Section 2 are based on the UKPConvArg1 corpus and thus share many arguments, we can test the hypotheses empirically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Correlations of Dimensions and Reasons</head><p>For Hypotheses 1 and 2, we consider all 736 pairs of arguments from Habernal and Gurevych (2016a) where both have been annotated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wachsmuth et al. (2017a)</ref>. For each pair (A, B) with A being 1 Source code and annotated data: http://www.arguana.com more convincing than B, we check whether the rat- ings of A and B for each dimension (averaged over all annotators) show a concordant difference (i.e., a higher rating for A), a disconcordant difference (lower), or a tie. This way, we can correlate each di- mension with all reason labels in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> including Conv. In particular, we compute Kendall's τ based on all argument pairs given for each label. 2 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> presents all τ -values. The phrasing of a reason can be assumed to indicate a clear quality difference-this is underlined by the generally high correlations. Analyzing the single values, we find much evidence for Hypothesis 1: Most notably, la- bel 5-1 perfectly correlates with global acceptabil- ity, fitting the intuition that abuse is not acceptable. The high τ 's of 8-5 (more credible) for local accept- ability (.73) and of 9-4 (well thought through) for cogency (.75) confirm the match assumed in Sec- tion 1. Also, the values of 5-3 (unclear) for clarity (.91) and of 7-2 (non-sense) for reasonableness (.94) as well as the weaker correlation of 8-4 (ob- jective) for emotional appeal (.35) makes sense.</p><p>Only the comparably low τ of 6-1 (no credible evidence) for local acceptability (.49) and credibil- ity (.52) seem really unexpected. Besides, the de- scriptions of 6-2 and 6-3 sound like local but cor-  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: The mean rating for each quality dimension of those arguments from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wachsmuth et al.

Similarly, 7-3 (off-topic) correlates strongly with local and global relevance (both .95). So, these dimensions seem hard to separate. In line with Hypothesis 2, the highest correlation of Conv is indeed given for overall quality (.64). Thus, argumentation quality assessment seems to match in theory and practice to a broad extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Absolute Ratings for Relative Differences</head><p>The correlations found imply that the relative qual- ity differences captured are reflected in absolute dif- ferences. For explicitness, we computed the mean rating for each quality dimension of all arguments from Wachsmuth et al. (2017a) with a particular reason label from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Habernal and Gurevych (2016a)</ref>. As each reason refers to one argument of a pair, this reveals whether the labels, although meant to signal relative differences, indicate absolute ratings. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> compares the mean ratings of "negative labels" (5-1 to 7-4) and "positive" ones (8-1 to 9-4). For all dimensions, the maximum and minimum value are higher for the positive than for the nega- tive labels-a clear support of Hypothesis 3. 3 Also, <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> reveals which reasons predict absolute dif- ferences most: The mean ratings of 7-3 (off-topic) are very low, indicating a strong negative impact, while 6-3 (irrelevant reasons) still shows rather <ref type="bibr">3</ref> While the differences seem not very large, this is expec- ted, as in many argument pairs from Habernal and Gurevych (2016a) both arguments are strong or weak respectively. high values. Vice versa, especially 8-5 (more credi- ble) and 9-4 (well thought through) are reflected in high ratings, whereas 9-2 (sticks to topic) does not have much positive impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Annotating Theory in Practice</head><p>The results of Section 3 suggest that theory may guide the assessment of argumentation quality in practice. In this section, we evaluate the reliability of a crowd-based annotation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Absolute Quality Ratings by the Crowd</head><p>We emulated the expert annotation process carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wachsmuth et al. (2017a)</ref> on CrowdFlower in order to evaluate whether lay annotators suffice for a theory-based quality assessment. In particular, we asked the crowd to rate the same 304 arguments as the experts for all 15 given quality dimensions with scores from 1 to 3 (or choose "cannot judge"). Each argument was rated 10 times at an offered price of $0.10 for each rating (102 annotators in total). Given the crowd ratings, we then performed two comparisons as detailed in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Agreement of the Crowd with Experts</head><p>First, we checked to what extent lay annotators and experts agree in terms of Krippendorff's α. On one hand, we compared the mean of all 10 crowd rat- ings to the mean of the three ratings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wachsmuth et al. (2017a)</ref>. On the other hand, we estimated a reliable rating from the crowd ratings using MACE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hovy et al., 2013</ref>) and compared it to the experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a) Crowd / Expert (b) Crowd 1 / 2 / Expert (c) Crowd 1 / Expert (d) Crowd 2 / Expert</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality Dimension</head><p>Mean  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Mean and MACE Krippendorff's α agreement between (a) the crowd and the experts, (b) two independent crowd groups and the experts, (c) group 1 and the experts, and (d) group 2 and the experts. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>(a) presents the results. For the mean ratings, most α-values are above .40. This is similar to the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wachsmuth et al. (2017b)</ref>, where a range of .27 to .51 is reported, meaning that lay annotators achieve similar agreement to experts. Considering the minimum of mean and MACE, we observe the highest agreement for overall quality (.43)-analog to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wachsmuth et al. (2017b)</ref>. Also, global sufficiency has the lowest agreement in both cases. In contrast, the experts hardly said "cannot judge" at all, whereas the crowd chose it for about 4% of all ratings (most often for global sufficiency), possibly due to a lack of training. Still, we conclude that the crowd generally handles the theory-based quality assessment almost as well as the experts.</p><p>However, the complexity of the assessment is underlined by the generally limited agreement, sug- gesting that either simplification or stricter guide- lines are needed. Regarding simplification, the most common practical reasons of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Habernal and Gurevych (2016a)</ref> imply what to focus on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Reliability of the Crowd Annotations</head><p>In the second comparison, we checked how many crowd annotators are needed to compete with the experts. For this purpose, we split the crowd ratings into two independent groups of 5 and treated the mean and MACE of each group as a single rating. We then computed the agreement of both groups and each group individually against the experts.</p><p>The α-values for both groups are listed in Ta- ble 5(b). On average, they are a bit lower than those of all 10 crowd annotators in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>(c) are close to those in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>(a), so 10 ratings might suffice. Moreover, we see that the most stable α-values in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> are given for overall quality, indicating that the theory indeed helps assessing quality reliably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper demonstrates that the theory and prac- tice of assessing argumentation quality can learn from each other. Most reasons for quality differ- ences phrased in practice seem well-represented in the normative view of theory and correlate with absolute quality ratings. In our study, lay annota- tors had similar agreement on the ratings as experts. Considering that some common reasons are quite vague, the diverse and comprehensive theoretical view of argumentation quality may guide a more insightful assessment. On the other hand, some quality dimensions remain hard to assess and/or to separate in practice, resulting in limited agreement. Simplifying theory along the most important rea- sons will thus improve its practical applicability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>find accepted arguments based on attack relations, Wei et al.

			<note place="foot" n="2"> Lacking better options, we ignore pairs where a label is not given: It is indistinguishable whether the associated reason does not hold, has not been given, or is just not included in the corpus. Thus, τ is more &quot;boosted&quot; the fewer pairs exist for a label and, thus, its values are not fully comparable across labels. Notice, though, that Conv exists for all pairs. So, the values of Conv suggest the magnitude of τ without boosting.</note>
