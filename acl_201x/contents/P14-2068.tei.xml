				<p>How do journalists mark quoted content as certain or uncertain, and how do readers interpret these signals? Predicates such as thinks, claims, and admits offer a range of options for framing quoted content according to the author&apos;s own perceptions of its credibility. We gather a new dataset of direct and indirect quotes from Twit-ter, and obtain annotations of the perceived certainty of the quoted statements. We then compare the ability of linguistic and extra-linguistic features to predict readers&apos; assessment of the certainty of quoted content. We see that readers are indeed influenced by such framing devices-and we find no evidence that they consider other factors, such as the source, journalist, or the content itself. In addition, we examine the impact of specific framing devices on perceptions of credibility.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Contemporary journalism is increasingly con- ducted through social media services like Twit- ter <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lotan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hermida et al., 2012</ref>). As events unfold, journalists and political commen- tators use quotes -often indirect -to convey potentially uncertain information and claims from their sources and informants, e.g., A key pragmatic goal of such messages is to convey the provenance and uncertainty of the quoted content. In some cases, the author may also introduce their own perspective ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lin et al., 2006</ref>) through the use of framing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Greene and Resnik, 2009)</ref>. For instance, consider the use of the word claims in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, which conveys the author's doubt about the indirectly quoted content.</p><p>Detecting and reasoning about the certainty of propositional content has been identified as a key task for information extraction, and is now sup- ported by the FactBank corpus of annotations for newstext <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009)</ref>. However, less is known about this phenomenon in social media -a domain whose endemic uncertainty makes proper treatment of factuality even more crucial <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Morris et al., 2012)</ref>. Successful automa- tion of factuality judgments could help to detect online rumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Qazvinian et al., 2011)</ref>, and might enable new applications, such as the computation of reliability ratings for ongoing stories.</p><p>This paper investigates how linguistic resources and extra-linguistic factors affect perceptions of the certainty of quoted information in Twitter. We present a new dataset of Twitter messages that use FactBank predicates (e.g., claim, say, insist) to scope the claims of named entity sources. This dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk work- ers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message. This en- ables us to build a predictive model of the fac- tuality annotations, with the goal of determining the full set of relevant factors, including the pred- icate, the source, the journalist, and the content of the claim itself. However, we find that these extra-linguistic factors do not predict readers' fac- tuality judgments, suggesting that the journalist's own framing plays a decisive role in the cred- ibility of the information being conveyed. We explore the specific linguistic feature that affect factuality judgments, and compare our findings with previously-proposed groupings of factuality- related predicates.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Text data</head><p>We gathered a dataset of Twitter messages from 103 professional journalists and bloggers who work in the field of American Politics. 1 Tweets were gathered using Twitter's streaming API, ex- tracting the complete permissible timeline up to <ref type="bibr">February 23, 2014</ref>. A total of 959,754 tweets were gathered, and most were written in early 2014. Our interest in this text is specifically in quoted content -including "indirect" quotes, which may include paraphrased quotations, as in the examples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. While labeled datasets for such quotes have been created (O' <ref type="bibr">Keefe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pareti, 2012</ref>), these are not freely available at present. In any case, the relevance of these datasets to Twitter text is currently unproven. Therefore, rather than train a supervised model to detect quotations, we apply a simple dependency-based heuristic.</p><p>• We focus on tweets that contain any member of a list of source-introducing predicates (we bor- row the terminology of Pareti (2012) and call this the CUE). Our complete list -shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> -was selected mainly from the exam- ples presented by Saurí and Pustejovsky (2012), Report say, report, tell, told, observe, state, accord, insist, assert, claim, main- tain, explain, deny Knowledge learn, admit, discover, forget, forgot Belief think, thought, predict, suggest, guess, believe Doubt doubt, wonder, ask, hope Perception sense, hear, feel <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Lemmas of source-introducing predicates (cues) and groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Saurí, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>but with reference also to Saurí's (2008) dis- sertation for cues that are common in Twitter. The Porter Stemmer is applied to match inflec- tions, e.g. denies/denied; for irregular cases not handled by the Porter Stemmer (e.g., for- get/forgot), we include both forms. We use the CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Owoputi et al., 2013</ref>) to select only instances in the verb sense. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the distribution of the cues and <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the distribution of the cue groups. For cues that appear in multiple groups, we chose the most common group.</p><p>• We run the Stanford Dependency parser to obtain labeled dependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(De Marneffe et al., 2006</ref>), requiring that the cue has outgoing edges of the type NSUBJ (noun subject) and CCOMP (clausal complement). The subtree headed by the modifier of the CCOMP relation is considered the claim; the subtree headed by the modifier of the NSUBJ relation is consid- ered the source. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> for an example.</p><p>• We use a combination of regular expressions and dependency rules to capture expressions of the type "CLAIM, according to SOURCE." Specifically, the PCOMP path from according is searched for the pattern according to * . The text that matches the * is the source and the remaining text other than the source is taken as the claim.</p><p>• Finally, we restrict consideration to tweets in which the source contains a named entity or twitter username. This eliminates expressions of personal belief such as I doubt Obama will win, as well as anonymous sources such as Team sources report that Lebron has demanded a trade to New York. Investigating the factual- ity judgments formed in response to such tweets is clearly an important problem for future re- search, but is outside the scope of this paper.</p><p>This heuristic pipeline may miss many relevant tweets, but since the overall volume is high, we Source Cue Claim I guess, since FBI claims it couldn't match Tsarnaev, we can assume ...     <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Annotation</head><p>We used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to col- lect ratings of claims. AMT has been widely used by the NLP community to collect data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Snow et al., 2008)</ref>, with "best practices" defined to help requesters best design Turk jobs (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010). We followed these guidelines to perform pilot experiments to test the instruction set and the quality of responses. Based on the pi- lot study we designed Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) to annotate 1265 claims. Each HIT contained a batch of ten tweets and rewarded $0.10 per hit. To ensure quality con- trol we required the Turkers to have at least 85% hit approval rating and to reside in the United States, because the Twitter messages in our dataset were related to American politics. For each tweet, we obtained five independent ratings from Turk- ers satisfying the above qualifications. The rat- ings were based on a 5-point Likert scale rang- ing from "[-2] Certainly False" to " <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> Certainly True" and allowing for " <ref type="bibr">[0]</ref> Uncertain". We also allowed for "Not Applicable" option to capture ratings where the Turkers did not have sufficient knowledge about the statement or if the statement was not really a claim. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> shows the set of instructions provided to the Turkers, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the annotation interface. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We excluded tweets for which three or more Turkers gave a rating of "Not Applicable," leaving us with a dataset of 1170 tweets. Within this set, the average variance per tweet (excluding "Not Applicable" ratings) was 0.585.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Modeling factuality judgments</head><p>Having obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we now model the factors that drive these ratings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Predictive accuracy</head><p>First, we attempt to determine the impact of vari- ous predictive features on rater judgments of fac- tuality. We consider the following features:</p><p>• Cue word: after stemming • Cue word group: as given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> • Source: represented by the named entity or username in the source field (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>) • Journalist: represented by their Twitter ID • Claim: represented by a bag-of-words vector from the claim field <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4</ref>) These features are used as predictors in a series of linear ridge regressions, where the dependent variable is the mean certainty rating. We throw out tweets that were rated as "not applicable" by a majority of raters, but otherwise ignore "not appli- cable" ratings of the remaining tweets. The goal of these regressions is to determine which fea- tures are predictive of raters' factuality judgments. The ridge regression regularization parameter was tuned via cross-validation in the training set. We used the bootstrap to obtain multiple training/test    splits (70% training), which were used for signifi- cance testing. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> reports mean average error for each fea- ture group, as well as a baseline that simply re- ports the mean rating across the training set. Each accuracy was compared with the baseline using a paired z-test. Only the cue word features pass this test at p &lt; .05. The other features do not help, even in combination with the cue word.</p><p>While these findings must be interpreted with caution, they suggest that readers -at least, Me- chanical Turk workers -use relatively little inde- pendent judgment to assess the validity of quoted text that they encounter on Twitter. Of course, richer linguistic models, more advanced machine learning, or experiments with more carefully- selected readers might offer a different view. But the results at hand are most compatible with the conclusion that readers base their assessments of factuality only on the framing provided by the journalist who reports the quote.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Cue words and cue groups</head><p>Given the importance of cue words as a sig- nal for factuality, we want to assess the factual- ity judgments induced by each cue. A second question is whether proposed groupings of cue words into groups cohere with such perceptions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Saurí (2008)</ref> describes several classes of source- introducing predicates, which indicate how the source relates to the quoted claim. These classes are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, along with frequently- occuring cues from our corpus. We rely on Fact- Bank to assign the cue words to classes; the only word not covered by FactBank was sense, which we placed in predicates of perception.</p><p>We performed another set of linear regressions, again using the mean certainty rating as the de- pendent variable. In this case, there was no train- ing/test split, so confidence intervals on the result- ing parameters are computed using the analytic closed form. We performed two such regressions: first using only the individual cues as predictors, and then using only the cue groups. Results are shown in Figures 7 and 8; <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> includes only cues which appear at least ten times, although all cues were included in the regression.</p><p>The cues that give the highest factuality coef- ficients are learn and admit, which are labeled as predicates of knowledge. These cues carry a sub- stantial amount of framing, as they purport to de- scribe the private mental state of the source. The word admit often applies to statements that are perceived as damaging to the source, such as Bill Gates admits Control-Alt-Delete was a mistake; since there can be no self-interest behind such statements, they may be perceived as more likely to be true.</p><p>Several of the cues with the lowest factuality co- efficients are predicates of belief: suggest, predict and think. The words suggest, think, and believe also purport to describe the private mental state of the source, but their framing function is the op- posite of the predicates of knowledge: they im- ply that it is important to mark the claim as the source's belief, and not a widely-accepted fact. For example, Mubarak clearly believes he has the military leadership's support.</p><p>A third group of interest are the predicates of report, which have widely-varying certainty coef- ficients.  are strongly predictive of certainty, but the cues claim and deny convey uncertainty. Both accord- ing and report are often used in conjunction with impersonal and institutional sources, e.g., Cuc- cinelli trails McAuliffe by 24 points , according to a new poll. In contrast, insist, claim, and deny im- ply that there is uncertainty about the quoted state- ment, e.g., Christie insists that Fort Lee Mayor was never on my radar. In this case, the fact that the predicate indicates a report is not enough to determine the framing: different sorts of reports carry radically different perceptions of factuality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related work</head><p>Factuality and Veridicality The creation of <ref type="bibr">FactBank (Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009</ref>) has en- abled recent work on the factuality (or "veridical- ity") of event mentions in text. Saurí and Puste- jovsky (2012) propose a two-dimensional factual- ity annotation scheme, including polarity and cer- tainty; they then build a classifier to predict an- notations of factuality from statements in Fact- Bank. Their work on source-introducing predi- cates provides part of the foundation for this re- search, which focuses on quoted statements in so- cial media text. de <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Marneffe et al. (2012)</ref> conduct an empirical evaluation of FactBank ratings from Mechanical Turk workers, finding a high degree of disagreement between raters. They also construct a statistical model to predict these ratings. We are unaware of prior work comparing the contribution of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g., source and journalist features) for factuality rat- ings. This prior work also does not measure the impact of individual cues and cue classes on as- sessment of factuality.</p><p>Credibility in social media Recent work in the area of computational social science focuses on understanding credibility cues on Twitter. Such studies have found that users express concern over the credibility of tweets belonging to certain topics (politics, news, emergency). By manipulating sev- eral features of a tweet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Morris et al. (2012)</ref> found that in addition to content, users often use addi- tional markers while assessing the tweet credibil- ity, such as the user name of the source. The search for reliable signals of information credibility in so- cial media has led to the construction of automatic classifiers to identify credible tweets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Castillo et al., 2011</ref>). However, this prior work has not ex- plored the linguistic basis of factuality judgments, which we show to depend on framing devices such as cue words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>Perceptions of the factuality of quoted content are influenced by the cue words used to introduce them, while extra-linguistic factors, such as the source and the author, did not appear to be rele- vant in our experiments. This result is obtained from real tweets written by journalists; a natural counterpart study would be to experimentally ma- nipulate this framing to see if the same perceptions apply. Another future direction would be to test whether the deployment of cue words as framing devices reflects the ideology of the journalist. We are also interested to group multiple instances of the same quote ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Leskovec et al., 2009)</ref>, and exam- ine how its framing varies across different news outlets and over time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Indirect quotations in Twitter</figDesc></figure>
