				<p>Cultural fit is widely believed to affect the success of individuals and the groups to which they belong. Yet it remains an elusive , poorly measured construct. Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation. By contrast, we develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic alignment, which estimates the influence of one person&apos;s word use on another&apos;s and distinguishes between two encultura-tion mechanisms: internalization and self-regulation. We use this measure to trace employees&apos; enculturation trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of individuals downstream outcomes , especially involuntary exit. Further predictive analyses suggest referential alignment plays an overlooked role in linguistic alignment.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Entering a new group is rarely easy. Adjusting to unfamiliar behavioral norms and donning a new identity can be cognitively and emotionally taxing, and failure to do so can lead to exclusion. But suc- cessful enculturation to the group often yields sig- nificant rewards, especially in organizational con- texts. Fitting in has been tied to positive career outcomes such as faster time-to-promotion, higher performance ratings, and reduced risk of being fired <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(O'Reilly et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goldberg et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A major challenge for enculturation research is distinguishing between internalization and self- regulation. Internalization, a more inwardly fo- cused process, involves identifying as a group member and accepting group norms, while self- regulation, a more outwardly oriented process, en- tails deciphering the group's normative code and adjusting one's behavior to comply with it. Ex- isting approaches, which generally rely on self- reports, are subject to various forms of reporting bias and typically yield only static snapshots of this process. Recent computational approaches that use language as a behavioral signature of group integration uncover dynamic traces of en- culturation but cannot distinguish between inter- nalization and self-regulation.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we introduce a dynamic measure of directed linguistic accommo- dation between a newcomer and existing group members. Our approach differentiates between an individual's (1) base rate of word use and (2) linguistic alignment to interlocutors. The former corresponds to internalization of the group's lin- guistic norms, whereas the latter reflects the ca- pacity to regulate one's language in response to peers' language use. We apply this language model to a corpus of internal email communica- tions and personnel records, spanning a seven-year period, from a mid-sized technology firm. We show that changes in base rates and alignment, especially with respect to pronoun use, are con- sistent with successful assimilation into a group and can predict eventual employment outcomes- continued employment, involuntary exit, or volun- tary exit-at levels above chance. We use this pre- dictive problem to investigate the nature of linguis- tic alignment. Our results suggest that the com- mon formulation of alignment as a lexical-level phenomenon is incomplete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit</head><p>Linguistic alignment Linguistic alignment is the tendency to use the same or similar words as one's conversational partner. Alignment is an instance of a widespread and socially impor- tant human behavior: communication accommo- dation, the tendency of two interacting people to nonconsciously adopt similar behaviors. Ev- idence of accommodation appears in many be- havioral dimensions, including gestures, postures, speech rate, self-disclosure, and language or di- alect choice (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Giles et al. (1991)</ref> for a review). More accommodating people are rated by their interlocutors as more intelligible, attractive, and cooperative <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Feldman, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ireland et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Triandis, 1960)</ref>. These perceptions have mate- rial consequences-for example, high accommo- dation requests are more likely to be fulfilled, and pairs who accommodate more in how they ex- press uncertainty perform better in lab-based tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buller and Aune, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fusaroli et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Although accommodation is ubiquitous, indi- viduals vary in their levels of accommodation in ways that are socially informative. Notably, more powerful people are accommodated more strongly in many settings, including trials ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gnisci, 2005)</ref>, online forums (Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Mizil et al., 2012)</ref>, and Twitter ( ). Most rel- evant for this work, speakers may increase their accommodation to signal camaraderie or decrease it to differentiate from the group. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bourhis and Giles (1977)</ref> found that Welsh En- glish speakers increased their use of the Welsh accent and language in response to an English speaker who dismissed it.</p><p>Person-group fit and linguistic alignment These findings suggest that linguistic alignment is a useful avenue for studying how people assimi- late into a group. Whereas traditional approaches to studying person-group fit rely on self-reports that are subject to various forms of reporting bias and cannot feasibly be collected with high gran- ularity across many points in time, recent stud- ies have proposed language-based measures as a means to tracing the dynamics of person-group fit without having to rely on self-reports. Building on Danescu-Niculescu- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Mizil et al. (2013)</ref>'s research into language use similarities as a proxy for so- cial distance between individuals, Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goldberg et al. (2016)</ref> devel- oped a measure of cultural fit based on the sim- ilarity in linguistic style between individuals and their colleagues in an organization. Their time- varying measure highlights linguistic compatibil- ity as an important facet of cultural fit and reveals distinct trajectories of enculturation for employees with different career outcomes.</p><p>While this approach can help uncover the dy- namics and consequences of an individual's fit with her colleagues in an organization, it cannot disentangle the underlying reasons for this align- ment. For two primary reasons, it cannot distin- guish between fit that arises from internalization and fit produced by self-regulation. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goldberg et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Srivastava et al. (forthcoming)</ref> define fit using a symmetric measure, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which does not take into account the direction of alignment. Yet the distinction between an individual adapting to peers versus peers adapting to the individual would ap- pear to be consequential. Second, this prior work considers fit across a wide range of linguistic cate- gories but does not interrogate the role of particu- lar categories, such as pronouns, that can be espe- cially informative about enculturation. For exam- ple, a person's base rate use of the first-person sin- gular (I) or plural (we) might indicate the degree of group identity internalization, whereas adjust- ment to we usage in response to others' use of the pronoun might reveal the degree of self-regulation to the group's normative expectations.</p><p>Modeling fit with WHAM To address these limitations, we build upon and extend the WHAM alignment framework  to analyze the dynamics of internalization and self- regulation using the complete corpus of email communications and personnel records from a mid-sized technology company over a seven-year period. WHAM uses a conditional measure of alignment, separating overall homophily (uncon- ditional similarity in people's language use, driven by internalized similarity) from in-the-moment adaptation (adjusting to another's usage, corre- sponding to self-regulation). WHAM also pro- vides a directed measure of alignment, in that it estimates a replier's adaptation to the other con- versational participant separately from the partici- pant's adaptation to the replier.</p><p>Level(s) of alignment The convention within linguistic alignment research, dating back to early work on Linguistic Style Matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002</ref>), is to look at lexical align- ment: the repetition of the same or similar words across conversation participants. From a commu- nication accommodation standpoint, this is justi- fied by assuming that one's choice of words repre- sents a stylistic signal that is partially independent of the meaning one intends to express-similar to the accommodation on paralinguistic signals dis- cussed above. The success of previous linguistic alignment research shows that this is valid.</p><p>However, words are difficult to divorce from their meanings, and sometimes repeating a word conflicts with repeating its referent. In particular, pronouns often refer to different people depending on who uses the pronoun. While there is evidence that one person using a first-person singular pro- noun increases the likelihood that her conversa- tion partner will as well , we may also expect that one person us- ing first-person singular pronouns may cause the other to use more second-person pronouns, so that both people are referring to the same per- son. This is especially important under the In- teractive Alignment Model view ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pickering and Garrod, 2004</ref>), where conversants align their en- tire mental representations, which predicts both lexical and referential alignment behaviors will be observed. Discourse-strategic explanations for alignment also predict alignment at multiple levels ( .</p><p>Since we have access to a high-quality corpus with meaningful outcome measures, we can inves- tigate the relative importance of these two types of alignment. We will show that referential align- ment is more predictive of employment outcomes than is lexical alignment, suggesting a need for alignment research to consider both levels rather than just the latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data: Corporate Email Corpus</head><p>We use the complete corpus of internal emails exchanged among full-time employees at a mid- sized US-based technology company between 2009 to 2014 (Srivastava et al., forthcoming). Each email was summarized as a count of word categories in its text. These categories are a sub- set of the Linguistic Information and Word Count system ( . The categories were chosen because they are likely to be indica- tive of one's standing/role within a group. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We divided email chains into message-reply pairs to investigate conditional alignment between a message and its reply. To limit these pairs to cases where the reply was likely related to the pre- ceding message, we removed all emails with more than one sender or recipient (including CC/BCC), identical sender and recipient, or where the sender or recipient was an automatic notification system or any other mailbox that was not specific to a sin- gle employee. We also excluded emails with no body text or more than 500 words in the body text, and pairs with more than a week's latency between message and reply.</p><p>Finally, because our analyses involve encultura- tion dynamics over the first six months of employ- ment, we excluded replies sent by an employee whose overall tenure was less than six months. This resulted in a collection of 407,779 message- reply pairs, with 485 distinct replying employ- ees. We combined this with monthly updates of employees joining and leaving the company and whether they left voluntarily or involuntarily. Of the 485, 66 left voluntarily, 90 left involuntarily, and 329 remained employed at the end of the ob- servation period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Privacy protections and ethical considerations</head><p>Research based on employees' archived electronic communications in organizational settings poses potential threats to employee privacy and com- pany confidentiality. To address these concerns, and following established ethical guidelines for the conduct of such research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Borgatti and Molina, 2003)</ref>, we implemented the following procedures: (a) raw data were stored on secure research servers behind the company's firewall; (b) messages ex- changed with individuals outside the firm were eliminated; (c) all identifying information such as email addresses was transformed into hashed identifiers, with the company retaining access to the key code linking identifying information to hashed identifiers; and (d) raw message content was transformed into linguistic categories so that identities could not be inferred from message con- tent. Per terms of the non-disclosure agreement we signed with the firm, we are not able to share the data underlying the analyses reported below.</p><p>We can, however, share the code and dummy test data, both of which can be accessed at http: //github.com/gabedoyle/acl2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Model: An Extended WHAM Framework</head><p>To assess alignment, we use the Word-Based Hi- erarchical Alignment Model (WHAM) framework . The core principle of WHAM is that alignment is a change, usually an increase, in the frequency of using a word category in a reply when the word category was used in the preceding message. For instance, a reply to the message What will we discuss at the meeting?, is likely to have more instances of future tense than a reply to the message What did we discuss at the meeting? Under this definition, alignment is the log-odds shift from the baseline reply frequency, the frequency of the word in a reply when the pre- ceding message did not contain the word. WHAM is a hierarchical generative modeling framework, so it uses information from related ob- servations (e.g., multiple repliers with similar de- mographics) to improve its robustness on sparse data ( . There are two key pa- rameters, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>: η base , the log-odds of a given word category c when the preceding mes- sage did not contain c, and η align , the increase in the log-odds of c when the preceding message did contain c.</p><p>A dynamic extension To understand encultura- tion, we need to track changes in both the align- ment and baseline over time. We add a month-by- month change term to WHAM, yielding a piece- wise linear model of these factors over the course of an employee's tenure. Each employee's tenure is broken into two or three segments: their first six months after being hired, their last six months be- fore leaving (if they leave), and the rest of their tenure. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The linear segments for their alignment are fit as an intercept term η align , based at their first month (for the initial period) or their last month (for the final period), and per-month slopes α. Baseline segments are fit similarly, with pa- rameters η base and β. 3 To visualize the align- 2 Within each segment, the employee's alignment model is similar to that of , who introduced a constant by-month slope parameter to model changes in parent-child alignment during early linguistic development. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The six month timeframe was chosen as previous re- search has found it to be a critical period for early encultura- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bauer et al., 1998</ref>  ment behaviors and the parameter values, we cre- ate "sawhorse" plots, with an example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>.</p><p>In our present work, we are focused on changes in cultural fit during the transitions into or out of the group, so we collapse observations outside the first/last six months into a stable point estimate, constraining their slopes to be zero. This simplifi- cation also circumvents the issue of different em- ployees having different middle-period lengths. 4</p><p>Model structure The graphical model for our instantiation of WHAM is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. For each word category c, WHAM's generative model represents each reply as a series of token- by-token independent draws from a binomial dis- tribution. The binomial probability µ is dependent on whether the preceding message did (µ align ) or did not (µ base ) contain a word from category c, and the inferred alignment value is the differ- ence between these probabilities in log-odds space (η align ).</p><p>The specific values of these variables depend on three hierarchical features: the word category c, the group g that a given employee falls into, and the time period t (a piece of the piece-wise in baseline usage over time showed roughly linear changes over the first/last six months, but our linearity assumption may mask interesting variation in the enculturation trajecto- ries. linear function: beginning, middle, or end). Note that the hierarchical ordering is different for the η chains and the α/β chains; c is above g and t for the η chains, but below them for the α/β chains. This is because we expect the static (η) values for a given word category to be relatively consistent across different groups and at different times, but we expect the values to be independent across the different word categories. Conversely, we expect that the enculturation trajectories across word cat- egories (α/β) will be similar, while the trajecto- ries may vary substantially across different groups and different times. Lastly, the month m in which a reply is written (measured from the start of the time period t) has a linear effect on the η value, as described below.</p><p>To estimate alignment, we first divide the replies up by group, time period, and calendar month. We separate the replies into two sets based on whether the preceding message contained the category c (the "alignment" set) or not (the "base- line" set). All replies within a set are then aggre- gated in a single bag-of-words representation, with category token counts C align c,g,t,m and C base c,g,t,m , and total token counts N base c,g,t,m and N base c,g,t,m compris- ing the observed variables on the far right of the model. Moving from right to left, these counts are assumed to come from binomial draws with prob- ability µ align c,g,t,m or µ base c,g,t,m . The µ values are then in turn generated from η values in log-odds space by an inverse-logit transform, similar to linear pre- dictors in logistic regression.</p><p>The η base variables are representations of the baseline frequency of a marker in log-odds space, and µ base is simply a conversion of η base to proba- bility space, the equivalent of an intercept term in a logistic regression. η align is an additive value, with µ align = logit −1 (η base + η align ), the equiv- alent of a binary feature coefficient in a logistic regression. The specific month's η variables are calculated as a linear function: η align c,g,t,m = η align c,g,t + mα c,g,t , and similarly with β for the baseline.</p><p>The remainder of the model is a hierarchy of normal distributions that integrate social structure into the analysis. In the present work, we have three levels in the hierarchy: category, group, and time period. In Analysis 1, employees are grouped by their employment outcome (stay, leave volun- tarily, leave involuntarily); in Analyses 2 &amp; 3, where we predict the employment outcomes, each group is a single employee. The normal distri- butions that connect these levels have identical standard deviations σ 2 = .25. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The hierarchies are headed by a normal distribution centered at 0, except for the η base hierarchy, which has a Cauchy(0, 2.5) distribution. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Message and reply length can affect alignment estimates; the WHAM model was developed in part to reduce this effect. As different employees had different email length distributions, we further accounted for length by dividing all replies into five quintile length bins, and treated each bin as separate observations for each employee. This de- sign choice adds an additional control factor, but results were qualitatively similar without it. All of our analyses are based on parameter estimates from RStan fits of WHAM with 500 iterations over four chains.</p><p>While previous research on cultural fit has em- phasized either its internalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(O'Reilly et al., 1991)</ref> or self-regulation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goldberg et al., 2016)</ref> components, our extension to the WHAM frame- work helps disentangle them by estimating them as separate baseline and alignment trajectories. For example, we can distinguish between an archetypal individual who initially aligns to her colleagues and then internalizes this style of com- munication such that her baseline use also shifts and another archetypal person who aligns to her colleagues but does not change her baseline usage. The former exhibits high correspondence between internalization and self-regulation, whereas the latter demonstrates an ability to decouple them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analyses</head><p>We perform three analyses on this data. First, we examine the qualitative behaviors of pro- noun alignment and how they map onto employee outcomes in the data. Second, we show that these qualitative differences in early encultura- tion are meaningful, with alignment behaviors predicting employment outcome above chance. Lastly, we consider lexical versus referential lev- els of alignment and show that predictions are im- proved under the referential formulation, suggest- ing that alignment is not limited to low-level word- repetition effects. Time Log−odds parameter estimates <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Sawhorse plots showing the dynam- ics of pronoun alignment behavior across employ- ees. Vertical axis shows log-odds for baseline and alignment. Top row shows estimated alignment, highest for we and smallest for you. Bottom row shows baseline dynamics, with employees shifting toward the average usage as they enculturate. The shaded region is one standard deviation over pa- rameter samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes</head><p>We begin with descriptive analyses of the behav- ior of pronouns, which are likely to reflect incor- poration into the company. In particular, we look at first-person singular (I), first-person plural (we), and second-person pronouns (you). We expect that increases in we usage will occur as the employee is integrated into the group, while I and you us- age will decrease, and want to understand whether these changes manifest on baseline usage (i.e., in- ternalization), alignment (i.e., self-regulation), or both.</p><p>Design We divided each employee's emails by calendar month, and separated them into the em- ployee's first six months, their last six months (if an employee left the company within the observa- tion period), and the middle of their tenure. Em- ployees with fewer than twelve months at the com- pany were excluded from this analysis, so that their first and last months did not overlap.</p><p>We fit two WHAM models in this analysis. The first aggregated all employees, regardless of em- ployment outcome, to minimize noise; the second separated them by outcome to analyze cultural fit differences.</p><p>Outcome-aggregated model We start with the aggregated behavior of all employees, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. For baselines, we see decreased use of I and you over the first six months, with we usage increasing over the same period, confirming the expected result that incorporating into the group is accompanied by more inclusive pronoun usage. Despite the baseline changes, alignment is fairly stable through the first six months. Alignment on first-person singular and second-person pronouns is lower than first-person plural pronouns, likely due to the fact that I or you have different referents when used by the two conversants, while both con- versants could use we to refer to the same group. We will consider this referential alignment in more detail in Analysis 3. Since employees with dif- ferent outcomes have much different experiences over their last six months, we will not discuss them in aggregate, aside from noting the sharp decline in we alignment near the end of the employees' tenures.</p><p>Outcome-separated model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows outcome-specific trajectories, with green lines showing involuntary leavers (i.e., those who are fired or downsized), blue showing voluntary leavers, and orange showing employees who re- mained at the company through the final month of the data. The use of I and you is similar to the aggregates in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, regardless of group. The last six months of I usage show an interesting dif- ference, where involuntary leavers align more on I but retain a stable baseline while voluntary leavers retain a stable alignment but increase I overall, which is consistent with group separation.</p><p>The most compelling result we see here, though, is the changes in we usage by different groups of employees. Employees who eventually leave the company involuntarily show signs of more self- regulation than internalization over the first six months, increasing their alignment while decreas- ing their baseline use (though they return to more similar levels as other employees later in their tenure). Employees who stay at the company, as well as those who later leave voluntarily, show signs of internalization, increasing their baseline usage to the company average, as well as adapting their alignment levels to the mean. This finding suggests that how quickly the employees internal- ize culturally-standard language use predicts their eventual employment outcome, even if they even- tually end up near the average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes</head><p>This analysis tests the hypothesis that there are meaningful differences in employees' initial en- culturation, captured by alignment behaviors. We examine the first six months of communications and attempt to predict whether the employee will leave the company. We find that, even with a sim- ple classifier, alignment behaviors are predictive of employment outcome.</p><p>Design We fit the WHAM model to only the first six months of email correspondence for all em- ployees who had at least six months of email. The model estimated the initial level of baseline use (η base ) and alignment (η align ) for each employee, as well as the slope (α, β) for baseline and align- ment over those first six months, over all 11 word categories mentioned in Section 3.</p><p>We then created logistic regression classifiers, using the parameter estimates to predict whether an employee would leave the company. We fit separate classifiers for leaving voluntarily or in- voluntarily. Our results show that early alignment behaviors are better at identifying employees who will leave involuntarily than voluntarily, consistent with Srivastava et al.'s (forthcoming) findings that voluntary leavers are similar to stayers until late in their tenure. We fit separate classifiers using the alignment parameters and the baseline parameters to investigate their relative informativity.</p><p>For each model, we report the area under the curve (AUC). This value is estimated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate over different classification thresh- olds. An AUC of 0.5 represents chance per- formance. We use balanced, stratified cross-validation to reduce AUC misestimation due to unbalanced outcome frequencies and high noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Parker et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Results The left column of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows the results over 10 runs of 10-fold balanced logis- tic classifiers with stratified cross-validation in R. The alignment-based classifiers are both above chance at predicting that an employee will leave the company, whether involuntarily or voluntarily. The baseline-based classifiers perform worse, es- pecially on voluntary leavers. This finding is con- sistent with the idea that voluntary leavers resem- ble stayers (who form the bulk of the employees) until late in their tenure when their cultural fit de- clines.</p><p>We fit a model using both alignment and base- line parameters, but this model yielded an AUC value below the alignment-only classifier. This suggests that where alignment and baseline be- haviors are both predictive, they do not provide substantially different predictive power and lead to overfitting. A more sophisticated classifier may overcome these challenges; our goal here was not to achieve maximal classification performance but to test whether alignment provided any useful in- formation about employment outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Analysis 3: Types of Alignment</head><p>Our final analysis investigates the nature of lin- guistic alignment: specifically, whether there is an effect of referential alignment beyond that of the more commonly used lexical alignment.</p><p>Testing this hypothesis requires a small change to the alignment calculations. Lexical alignment is based on the conditional probability of the replier using a word category c given that the preceding message used that same category c. For referential alignment, we examine the conditional probability of the replier using a word category c j given that the preceding message used the category c i , where c i and c j are likely to be referentially linked. We also consider cases where c i is likely to transition to c j throughout the course of the conversation, such as present tense verbs turning into past tense as the event being described recedes into the past. The pairs of categories that are likely to be refer- entially or transitionally linked are: (you, I); (we, I); (you, we); (past, present); (present, future); and (certainty, tentativity). We include both directions of these pairs, so this provides approximately the same number of predictor variables for both situa- tions to maximize comparability (12 for the refer- ential alignments, 11 for the lexical). This modifi- cation does not change the structure of the WHAM model, but rather changes its C and N counts by reclassifying replies between the baseline or align- ment pathways.</p><p>Results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> plots the differences in predic- tive model performance using lexical versus ref- erential alignment parameters. We find that the semantic parameters provide more accurate clas- sification than the lexical both for voluntarily and involuntarily-leaving employees. This suggests that while previous work looking at lexical align- ment successfully captures social structure, refer- ential alignment may reflect a deeper and more accurate representation of the social structure. It is unclear if this behavior holds in less formal situations or with weaker organizational structure and shared goals, but these results suggest that the traditional alignment approach of only measuring lexical alignment should be augmented with ref- erential alignment measures for a more complete analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>A key finding from this work is that pronoun usage behaviors in employees' email communi- cation are consistent with social integration into the group; employees use "I" pronouns less and "we" pronouns more as they integrate. Further- more, we see the importance of using an align- ment measure such as WHAM for distinguish- ing the base rate and alignment usage of words. Employees who leave the company involuntarily show increased "we" usage through greater align- ment, using "we" more when prompted by a col- league, but introducing it less of their own ac- cord. This suggests that these employees do not feel fully integrated into the group, although they are willing to identify as a part of it when a more fully-integrated group member includes them, cor- responding to self-regularization over internaliza- tion. The fact that these alignment measures alone, without any job productivity or performance met- rics, have some predictive capability for employ- ees' leaving the company suggests the potential for support or intervention programs to help high- performing but poorly-integrated employees inte- grate into the company better. More generally, the prominence of pronominally-driven communication changes suggest that alignment analyses can provide insight into a range of social integration settings. This may be especially helpful in cases where there is great pressure to integrate smoothly, and people would be likely to adopt a self-regulating approach even if they do not internalize their group membership. Such settings not only include the high-stakes situation of keeping one's job, but of transitioning from high school to college or moving to a new country or region. Maximizing the chances for new members to become comfort- able within a group is critical both for spreading useful aspects of the group's existing culture to new members and for integrating new ideas from the new members' knowledge and practices. Alignment-based approaches can be a useful tool in separating effective interventions that cause internalization of the group dynamics from those that lead to more superficial self-regularization changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>This paper described an effort to use directed linguistic alignment as a measure of cultural fit within an organization. We adapted a hierarchical alignment model from previous work to estimate fit within corporate email communications, focus- ing on changes in language during employees' en- try to and exit from the company. Our results showed substantial changes in the use of pronouns, with pronoun patterns varying by employees' out- comes within the company.The use of the first- person plural "we" during an employee's first six months is particularly instructive. Whereas stay- ers exhibited increased baseline use, indicating in- ternalization, those eventually departing involun- tarily were on the one hand decreasingly likely to introduce "we" into conversation, but increas- ingly responsive to interlocutors' use of the pro- noun. While not internalizing a shared identity with their peers, involuntarily departed employees were overly self-regulating in response to its invo- cation by others.</p><p>Quantitatively, rates of usage and alignment in the first six months of employment carried infor- mation about whether employees left involuntar- ily, pointing towards fit within the company cul- ture early on as an indicator of eventual employ- ment outcomes. Finally, we saw ways in which the application of alignment to cultural fit might help to refine ideas about alignment itself: prelimi- nary analysis suggested that referential, rather than lexical, alignment was more predictive of employ- ment outcomes. More broadly, these results sug- gest ways that quantitative methods can be used to make precise application of concepts like "cultural fit" at scale.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Sample sawhorse plot with key variables labelled.

			<note place="foot" n="4"> As shown in Figure 1, the pieces do not need to define a continuous function. Alignment behaviors continue to change in the middle of an employee&apos;s tenure (Srivastava et al., forthcoming), so alignment six months in to the job is unlikely to be equal to alignment six months from leaving, or the average alignment over the middle tenure.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> The deviation is not a theoretically motivated choice, and was chosen as a good empirical balance between reasonable parameter convergence (improved by smaller σ 2 ) and good model log-probability (improved by larger σ 2 ).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> As η base is the log-odds of each word in a reply being a part of the category c, it is expected to be substantially negative. For example, second person pronouns (you), are around 2% of the words in replies, approximately −4 in log-odds space. We follow Gelman et al. (2008)&apos;s recommendation of the Cauchy prior as appropriate for parameter estimation in logistic regression.</note>
