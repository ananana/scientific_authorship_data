				<p>The ambitious goal of this work is to develop a cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework for 282 languages that exist in Wikipedia. Given a document in any of these languages, our framework is able to identify name mentions, assign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an En-glish Knowledge Base (KB) if it is link-able. We achieve this goal by performing a series of new KB mining methods: generating &quot;silver-standard&quot; annotations by transferring annotations from En-glish to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties, refining annotations through self-training and topic selection, deriving language-specific morphology features from anchor links, and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links. Both name tagging and linking results for 282 languages are promising on Wikipedia data and on-Wikipedia data. All the data sets, resources and systems for 282 languages are made publicly available as a new benchmark 1 .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Information provided in languages which people can understand saves lives in crises. For exam- ple, language barrier was one of the main diffi- culties faced by humanitarian workers responding to the Ebola crisis in 2014. We propose to break language barriers by extracting information (e.g., entities) from a massive variety of languages and ground the information into an existing knowledge base which is accessible to a user in his/her own 1 http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/wikiann language (e.g., a reporter from the World Health Organization who speaks English only).</p><p>Wikipedia is a massively multi-lingual resource that currently hosts 295 languages and contains naturally annotated markups 2 and rich informa- tional structures through crowd-sourcing for 35 million articles in 3 billion words. Name mentions in Wikipedia are often labeled as anchor links to their corresponding referent pages. Each entry in Wikipedia is also mapped to external knowl- edge bases such as DBpedia <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , YAGO <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahdisoltani et al., 2015</ref>) and Freebase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bollacker et al., 2008</ref>) that contain rich properties. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of Wikipedia markups and KB prop- erties. We leverage these markups for develop-282 languages, and link them to an English KB (Wikipedia in this work). The major challenges and our new solutions are summarized as follows.</p><p>Creating "Silver-standard" through cross- lingual entity transfer. The first step is to classify English Wikipedia entries into certain entity types and then propagate these labels to other languages. We exploit the English Abstract Meaning Repre- sentation (AMR) corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Banarescu et al., 2013</ref>) which includes both name tagging and linking an- notations for fine-grained entity types to train an automatic classifier. Furthermore, we exploit each entry's properties in DBpedia as features and thus eliminate the need of language-specific features and resources such as part-of-speech tagging as in previous work <ref type="bibr">(Section 2.2)</ref>.</p><p>Refine annotations through self-training. The initial annotations obtained from above are too incomplete and inconsistent. Previous work used name string match to propagate labels. In contrast, we apply self-training to label other men- tions without links in Wikipedia articles even if they have different surface forms from the linked mentions (Section 2.4).</p><p>Customize annotations through cross-lingual topic transfer. For the first time, we propose to customize name annotations for specific down- stream applications. Again, we use a cross-lingual knowledge transfer strategy to leverage the widely available English corpora to choose entities with specific Wikipedia topic categories (Section 2.5).</p><p>Derive morphology analysis from Wikipedia markups. Another unique challenge for morpho- logically rich languages is to segment each to- ken into its stemming form and affixes. Previ- ous methods relied on either high-cost supervised learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Roth et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mahmoudi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahlberg et al., 2015)</ref>, or low-quality unsupervised learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grönroos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ruokolainen et al., 2016)</ref>. We exploit Wikipedia markups to automat- ically learn affixes as language-specific features (Section 2.3).</p><p>Mine word translations from cross-lingual links. Name translation is a crucial step to gener- ate candidate entities in cross-lingual entity link- ing. Only a small percentage of names can be di- rectly translated by matching against cross-lingual Wikipedia title pairs. Based on the observation that Wikipedia titles within any language tend to follow a consistent style and format, we propose an effective method to derive word translation pairs from these titles based on automatic align- ment (Section 3.2).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Overview</head><p>Our first step is to generate "silver-standard" name annotations from Wikipedia markups and train a universal name tagger. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows our overall procedure and the following subsections will elab- orate each component.</p><p>[ </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Initial Annotation Generation</head><p>We start by assigning an entity type or "other" to each English Wikipedia entry. We utilize the AMR corpus where each entity name men- tion is manually labeled as one of 139 types and linked to Wikipedia if it's linkable. In to- tal we obtain 2,756 entity mentions, along with their AMR entity types, Wikipedia titles, YAGO entity types and DBpedia properties. For each pair of AMR entity type t a and YAGO entity type t y , we compute the Pointwise Mutual Infor- mation (PMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ward Church and Hanks, 1990</ref>) of mapping t a to t y across all mentions in the AMR corpus. Therefore, each name mention is also assigned a list of YAGO entity types, ranked by their PMI scores with AMR types. In this way, our framework produces three levels of en- tity typing schemas with different granularity: 4 main types (Person (PER), Organization (ORG), Geo-political Entity (GPE), Location (LOC)), 139 types in AMR, and 9,154 types in YAGO.</p><p>Then we leverage an entity's properties in DB- pedia as features for assigning types. For example, an entity with a birth date is likely to be a per- son, while an entity with a population property is likely to be a geo-political entity. Using all DB- pedia entity properties as features (60,231 in to- tal), we train Maximum Entropy models to assign types with three levels of granularity to all English Wikipedia pages. In total we obtained 10 million English pages labeled as entities of interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nothman et al. (2013)</ref> manually annotated 4,853 English Wikipedia pages with 6 coarse- grained types (Person, Organization, Location, Other, Non-Entity, Disambiguation Page). Using this data set for training and testing, we achieved 96.0% F-score on this initial step, slightly better than their results (94.6% F-score).</p><p>Next, we propagate the label of each English Wikipedia page to all entity mentions in all lan- guages in the entire Wikipedia through mono- lingual redirect links and cross-lingual links.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Learning Model and KB Derived Features</head><p>We use a typical neural network architecture that consists of Bi-directional Long Short-Term Mem- ory and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) net- work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lample et al., 2016)</ref> as our underlying learning model for the name tagger for each lan- guage. In the following we will describe how we acquire linguistic features. When a Wikipedia user tries to link an en- tity mention in a sentence to an existing page, she/he will mark the title (the entity's canon- ical form, without affixes) within the mention using brackets " <ref type="bibr">[[]</ref>]", from which we can naturally derive a word's stem and affixes for free. For example, from the Wikipedia markups of the following Turkish sentence:</p><p>"Kıta )", we can learn the following suffixes: "den", "ne", "nden" and "na". We use such affix lists to perform basic word stemming, and use them as additional features to determine name boundary and type. For example, "den" is a noun suffix which indicates ablative case in Turkish.</p><p>[ <ref type="bibr">[Akdeniz]</ref>]den means "from Mediterranean Sea". Note that this approach can only perform morphology analysis for words whose stem forms and affixes are directly concatenated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Self-Training to Enrich and Refine Labels</head><p>The name annotations acquired from the above procedure are far from complete to compete with manually labeled gold-standard data. For exam- ple, if a name mention appears multiple times in a Wikipedia article, only the first mention is la- beled with an anchor link. We apply self-training to propagate and refine the labels. We first train an initial name tagger using seeds selected from the labeled data. We adopt an idea from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Guo et al., 2014</ref>) which com- putes Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bouma, 2009)</ref> between a tag and a token:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N P M I(tag, token) = ln p(tag,token) p(tag)p(token) − ln p(tag, token)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Then we select the sentences in which all annota- tions satisfy N P M I(tag, token) &gt; τ as seeds <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . For all Wikipedia articles in a language, we cluster the unlabeled sentences into n clusters 6 by collecting sentences with low cross-entropy into the same cluster. Then we apply the initial tagger to the first unlabeled cluster, select the automati- cally labeled sentences with high confidence, add them back into the training data, and then re-train the tagger. This procedure is repeated n times until we scan through all unlabeled data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Final Training Data Selection for Populous Languages</head><p>For some populous languages that have many mil- lions of pages in Wikipedia, we obtain many sen- tences from self-training. In some emergent set- tings such as natural disasters it's important to train a system rapidly. Therefore we develop the following effective methods to rank and select high-quality annotated sentences.</p><p>Commonness: we prefer sentences that in- clude common entities appearing frequently in Wikipedia. We rank names by their frequency and dynamically set the frequency threshold to select a list of common names. We first initialize the name frequency threshold S to 40. If the number of the sentences is more than a desired size D for train- ing <ref type="bibr">7</ref> , we set the threshold S = S + 5, otherwise S = S − 5. We iteratively run the selection algo- rithm until the size of the training set reaches D for a certain S.</p><p>Topical Relatedness: Various criteria should be adopted for different scenarios. Our previous work on event extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al., 2011)</ref> found that by carefully select 1/3 topically related train- ing documents for a test set, we can achieve the same performance as a model trained from the entire training set. Using an emergent disaster setting as a use case, we prefer sentences that include entities related to disaster related topics. We run an English name tagger ( ) and entity linker ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pan et al., 2015</ref>) on the Leidos corpus released by the DARPA LORELEI 5 τ = 0 in our experiment. 6 n = 20 in our experiment. 7 D = 30,000 in our experiment. program 8 . The Leidos corpus consists of doc- uments related to various disaster topics. Based on the linked Wikipedia pages, we rank the fre- quency of Wikipedia categories and select the top 1% categories (4,035 in total) for our experiments. Some top-ranked topic labels include "Interna- tional medical and health organizations", "Human rights organizations", "International development agencies", "Western Asian countries", "Southeast African countries"and "People in public health". Then we select the annotated sentences including names (e.g., "World Health Organization") in all languages labeled with these topic labels to train the final model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Overview</head><p>After we extract names from test documents in a source language, we translate them into English by automatically mined word translation pairs (Sec- tion 3.2), and then link translated English men- tions to an external English KB (Section 3.3).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Name Translation</head><p>The cross-lingual Wikipedia title pairs, generated through crowd-sourcing, generally follow a con- sistent style and format in each language.

For example, no Wikipedia titles contain the Turk- ish name "Pekin Teknoloji Enstitüsü (Beijing In- stitute of Technology)". We generate the fol- lowing 6 combinations: "Pekin", "Teknoloji", "Enstitüsü", "Pekin Teknoloji", "Teknoloji En- stitüsü" and "Pekin Teknoloji Enstitüsü", and then extract all cross-lingual Wikipedia title pairs containing each combination. Finally we run GIZA++ (Josef Och and Ney, 2003) to extract word for word translations from these title pairs, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Entity Linking</head><p>Given a set of tagged name mentions M = {m 1 , m 2 , ..., m n }, we first obtain their English translations T = {t 1 , t 2 , ..., t n } using the ap- proach described above. Then we apply an un- supervised collective inference approach to link T to the KB, similar to our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pan et al., 2015</ref>). The only difference is that we construct knowledge networks (KNs) g(t i ) for T based on their co-occurrence within a context window <ref type="bibr">9</ref> in- stead of their AMR relations, because AMR pars- ing is not available for foreign languages. For each translated name mention t i , an initial list of candi- date entities E(t i ) = {e 1 , e 2 , ..., e k } is generated based on a surface form dictionary mined from KB properties (e.g., redirects, names, aliases). If no surface form can be matched then we determine the mention as unlinkable. Then we construct KNs g(e j ) for each entity candidate e j in t i 's entity can- didate list E(t i ). We compute the similarity be- tween g(t i ) and g(e j ) based on three measures: salience, similarity and coherence, and select the candidate entity with the highest score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Performance on Wikipedia Data</head><p>We first conduct an evaluation using Wikipedia data as "silver-standard". For each language, we use 70% of the selected sentences for training and 30% for testing. For entity linking, we don't have ground truth for unlinkable mentions, so we only compute linking accuracy for linkable name men- tions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref> presents the overall performance for three coarse-grained entity types: PER, ORG and GPE/LOC, sorted by the number of name men- tions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> summarize the per- formance, with some example languages marked for various ranges of data size.  Not surprisingly, name tagging performs better for languages with more training mentions. The F-score is generally higher than 80% when there are more than 10K mentions, and it significantly drops when there are less than 250 mentions. The languages with low name tagging performance can be categorized into three types: (1) the number of mentions is less than 2K, such as Atlantic- Congo (Wolof), Berber (Kabyle), Chadic (Hausa), Oceanic (Fijian), Hellenic (Greek), Igboid (Igbo), Mande (Bambara), Kartvelian (Georgian, Mingre- lian), Timor-Babar (Tetum), Tupian (Guarani) and Iroquoian (Cherokee) language groups; Precision is generally higher than recall for most of these languages, because the small number of linked mentions is not enough to cover a wide variety of entities. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> there is no space between words, in- cluding Chinese, Thai and Japanese; (3) they are not written in latin script, such as the Dravidian group (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam).</p><p>The training instances for various entity types are quite imbalanced for some languages. For ex- ample, Latin data includes 11% PER names, 84% GPE/LOC names and 5% ORG names. As a re- sult, the performance of ORG is the lowest, while GPE and LOC achieve higher than 75% F-scores for most languages.  The linking accuracy is higher than 80% for most languages. Also note that since we don't have perfect annotations on Wikipedia data for any language, these results can be used to esti- mate how predictable our "silver-standard" data is, but they are not directly comparable to tradi- tional name tagging results measured against gold- standard data annotated by human.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Performance on Non-Wikipedia Data</head><p>In order to have more direct comparison with state-of-the-art name taggers trained from human annotated gold-standard data, we conduct experi- ments on non-Wikipedia data in 9 languages for which we have human annotated ground truths from the DARPA LORELEI program. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 4</ref> shows the data statistics. The documents are from news sources and discussion fora.</p><p>For fair comparison, we use the same learn- ing method and feature set as described in Sec- tion 2.3 to train the models using gold-standard data. Therefore the results of our models trained from gold-standard data are slightly different from some previous work such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Tsai et al., 2016)</ref>, mainly due to different learning algorithms and different features sets. For example, the gazetteers we used are different from those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Tsai et al., 2016)</ref>, and we did not use brown clusters as addi- tional features.</p><p>The name tagging results on LORELEI data set are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 5</ref>. We can see that our approach advances state-of-the-art language- independent methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zhang et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tsai et al., 2016)</ref> on the same data sets for most lan- guages, and achieves 6.5% -17.6% lower F-scores than the models trained from manually annotated gold-standard documents that include thousands of name mentions. To fill in this gap, we would need to exploit more linguistic resources.</p><p>Mayfield et al. (2011) constructed a cross- lingual entity linking collection for 21 languages, which covers ground truth for the largest number of languages to date. Therefore we compare our approach with theirs that uses a supervised name transliteration model ). The entity linking results on non-NIL mentions are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 6</ref>. We can see that except Romanian, our approach outperforms or achieves comparable accuracy as their method on all lan- guages, without using any additional resources or tools such as name transliteration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of Self-Training</head><p>Using Turkish as a case study, the learning curves of self-training on Wikipedia and non-Wikipedia test sets are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. We can see that self-training provides significant improve- ment for both Wikipedia (6% absolute gain) and non-Wikipedia test data (12% absolute gain). As expected the learning curve on Wikipedia data is more smooth and converges more slowly than that of non-Wikipedia data. This indicates that when the training data is incomplete and noisy, the model can benefit from self-training through iter- ative label correction and propagation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of Topical Relatedness</head><p>We also found that the topical relatedness measure proposed in Section 2.5 not only significantly re- duces the size of training data and thus speeds up the training process for many languages, but also consistently improves the quality. For example, the Turkish name tagger trained from the entire data set without topic selection yields 49.7% F- score on LORELEI data set, and the performance is improved to 51.5% after topic selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Wikipedia markup based silver standard gen- eration: Our work was mainly inspired from pre- vious work that leveraged Wikipedia markups to train name taggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nothman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dakka and Cucerzan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mika et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ringland et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alotaibi and Lee, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nothman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Althobaiti et al., 2014</ref>). Most of these previous methods manually classified many English Wikipedia entries into pre-defined entity types. In contrast, our approach doesn't need any manual annotations or language-specific fea- tures, while generates both coarse-grained and fine-grained types. Many fine-grained entity typing ap- proaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fleischman and Hovy, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Giuliano, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ekbal et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ling and Weld, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yosef et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nakashole et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gillick et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yogatama et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Del Corro et al., 2015</ref>) also created annotations based on Wikipedia anchor links. Our framework performs both name identification and typing and takes advantage of richer structures in the KBs. Pre- vious work on Arabic name tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Althobaiti et al., 2014</ref>) extracted entity titles as a gazetteer for stemming, and thus it cannot handle unknown names. We developed a new method to derive generalizable affixes for morphologically rich language based on Wikipedia markups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wikipedia as background features for IE:</head><p>Wikipedia pages have been used as addi- tional features to improve various Informa- tion Extraction (IE) tasks, including name tag- ging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kazama and Torisawa, 2007)</ref>, coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Paolo Ponzetto and Strube, 2006</ref>), re- lation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chan and Roth, 2010</ref>) and event extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hogue et al., 2014</ref>). Other automatic name annotation generation methods have been proposed, including KB driven distant supervi- sion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ren et al., 2015)</ref> and cross-lingual projection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Li et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wang and Manning, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zhang et al., 2016b</ref>).</p><p>Multi-lingual name tagging: Some recent re- search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zhang et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Littell et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tsai et al., 2016</ref>) under the DARPA LORELEI program focused on developing name tagging techniques for low-resource languages. These ap- proaches require English annotations for projec- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tsai et al., 2016)</ref>, some input from a native speaker, either through manual annotations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Littell et al., 2016)</ref>, or a linguistic survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zhang et al., 2016a</ref>). Without using any manual annotations, our name taggers outperform previous methods on the same data sets for many languages.</p><p>Multi-lingual entity linking: NIST TAC-KBP Tri-lingual entity linking ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ji et al., 2016</ref>) focused on three languages: English, Chinese and Span- ish. ) extended it to 21 lan- guages. But their methods required labeled data and name transliteration. We share the same goal as <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sil and Florian, 2016)</ref> to extend cross-lingual entity linking to all languages in Wikipedia. They exploited Wikipedia links to train a supervised linker. We mine reliable word translations from cross-lingual Wikipedia titles, which enables us to adopt unsupervised English entity linking tech- niques such as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pan et al., 2015)</ref> to directly link translated English name mentions to English KB.</p><p>Efforts to save annotation cost for name tag- ging: Some previous work including <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ji and Grishman, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Richman and Schone, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Althobaiti et al., 2013</ref>) exploited semi-supervised methods to save annotation cost. We observed that self-training can provide further gains when the training data contains certain amount of noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We developed a simple yet effective framework that can extract names from 282 languages and link them to an English KB. This framework follows a fully automatic training and testing pipeline, without the needs of any manual anno- tations or knowledge from native speakers. We evaluated our framework on both Wikipedia arti- cles and external formal and informal texts and ob- tained promising results. To the best of our knowl- edge, our multilingual name tagging and linking framework is applied to the largest number of lan- guages. We release the following resources for each of these 282 languages: "silver-standard" name tagging and linking annotations with mul- tiple levels of granularity, morphology analyzer if it's a morphologically-rich language, and an end- to-end name tagging and linking system. In this work, we treat all languages independently when training their corresponding name taggers. In the future, we will explore the topological structure of related languages and exploit cross-lingual knowl- edge transfer to enhance the quality of extraction and linking. The general idea of deriving noisy an- notations from KB properties can also be extended to other IE tasks such as relation extraction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fransası,</head><label></label><figDesc>güneyde [[Akdeniz]]den kuzeyde [[Mans¸DeniziMans¸Mans¸Denizi]] ve [[Kuzey Denizi]]ne, do˘ guda [[Ren Nehri]]nden batıda [[Atlas Okyanusu]]na kadar yayılan topraklarda yer alır.
