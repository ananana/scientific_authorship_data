				<p>Identifying the type of relationship between words provides a deeper insight into the history of a language and allows a better characterization of language related-ness. In this paper, we propose a computational approach for discriminating between cognates and borrowings. We show that orthographic features have discrimi-native power and we analyze the underlying linguistic factors that prove relevant in the classification task. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of this kind.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Natural languages are living eco-systems. They are subject to continuous change due, in part, to the natural phenomena of language contact and borrowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Campbell, 1998)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hall (1960)</ref>, there is no such thing as a "pure language" -a language "without any borrowing from a for- eign language". Although admittedly regarded as relevant factors in the history of a language <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McMahon et al., 2005</ref>), borrowings bias the ge- netic classification of the languages, characteriz- ing them as being closer than they actually are <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Minett and Wang, 2003</ref>). Thus, the need for discriminating between cognates and borrowings emerges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Heggarty (2012)</ref> acknowledges the ne- cessity and difficulty of the task, emphasizing the role of the "computerized approaches".</p><p>In this paper we address the task of automati- cally distinguishing between borrowings and cog- nates: given a pair of words, the task is to de- termine whether one is a historical descendant of the other, or whether they both share a common ancestor. A borrowing (also called loanword), is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Campbell (1998)</ref> as a "lexical item (a word) which has been 'borrowed' from another language, a word which originally was not part of the vocabulary of the recipient language but was adopted from some other language and made part of the borrowing language's vocabulary". The no- tion of cognate is much more relaxed, and vari- ous NLP tasks and applications use different def- initions of the cognate pairs. In some situations, cognates and borrowings are considered together, and are referred to as historically connected words <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kessler, 2001</ref>) or denoted by the term correlates <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Heggarty, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">McMahon et al., 2005</ref>). In some tasks, such as statistical machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kondrak et al., 2003</ref>) and sentence alignment, or when studying the similarity or intelligibility of the lan- guages, cognates are seen as words that have sim- ilar spelling and meaning, their etymology being completely disregarded. However, in problems of language classification, distinguishing cognates from borrowings is essential. Here, we account for the etymology of the words, and we adopt the following definition: two words form a cognate pair if they share a common ancestor and have the same meaning. In other words, they derive di- rectly from the same word, have a similar meaning and, due to various (possibly language-specific) changes across time, their forms might differ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In a natural way, one of the most investigated problems in historical linguistics is to determine whether similar words are related or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kondrak, 2002)</ref>. Investigating pairs of related words is very useful not only in historical and comparative lin- guistics, but also in the study of language relat- edness ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ng et al., 2010)</ref>, phylogenetic inference ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atkinson et al., 2005</ref>) and in identifying how and to what extent languages changed over time or in- fluenced each other.</p><p>Most studies in this area focus on automatically identifying pairs of cognates. For measuring the orthographic or phonetic proximity of the cog- nate candidates, string similarity metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Inkpen et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hall and Klein, 2010)</ref> and algo- rithms for string alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Delmestri and Cristianini, 2010</ref>) have been applied, both in cognate detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Koehn and Knight, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mulloni and Pekar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Navlea and Todirascu, 2011</ref>) and in cognate production ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beinborn et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mulloni, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Minett and Wang (2003)</ref> focus on identifying borrowings within a family of genet- ically related languages and propose, to this end, a distance-based and a character-based technique. Minett and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wang (2005)</ref> address the problem of identifying language contact, building on the idea that borrowings bias the lexical similarities among genetically related languages.</p><p>According to the regularity principle, the dis- tinction between cognates and borrowings benefits from the regular sound changes that generate reg- ular phoneme correspondences in cognates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kondrak, 2002</ref>). In turn, sound correspondences are represented, to a certain extent, by alphabetic char- acter correspondences <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Delmestri and Cristianini, 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our Approach</head><p>In light of this, we investigate whether cognates can be automatically distinguished from borrow- ings based on their orthography. More specifically, our task is as follows: given a pair of words in two different languages (x, y), we want to determine whether x and y are cognates or if y is borrowed from x (in other words, x is the etymon of y).</p><p>Our starting point is a methodology that has previously proven successful in discriminating be- tween related and unrelated words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ciobanu and Dinu, 2014b)</ref>. Briefly, the method comprises the following steps:</p><p>1) Aligning the pairs of related words using a string alignment algorithm;</p><p>2) Extracting orthographic features from the aligned words;</p><p>3) Training a binary classifier to discriminate between the two types of relationship.</p><p>To align the pairs of related words, we em- ploy the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment al- gorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970)</ref>, which is equivalent to the weighted edit distance algorithm. We consider words as input sequences and we use a very simple substitution matrix 1 , which assigns  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Statistics for the dataset of related words. Given a pair of languages (L 1 , L 2 ), the len 1 and len 2 columns represent the average word length of the words in L 1 and L 2 . The edit column rep- resents the average normalized edit distance be- tween the words. The values are computed only on the training data, to keep the test data unseen.</p><p>equal scores to all substitutions, disregarding dia- critics (e.g., we ensure that e andèand`andè are matched). As features, we use characters n-grams extracted from the alignment 2 . We mark word boundaries with $ symbols. For example, the Romanian word funct¸iefunct¸ie (meaning function) and its Spanish cognate pair función are aligned as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">$ f u n c t ¸ i e -$ $ f u n c -i ´ o n $</formula><p>The features for n = 2 are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">$f$f, fufu, unun, ncnc, ct¸cct¸c-, t ¸i-i, ieió, e-´ on, -$n$.</formula><p>For the prediction task, we experiment with two models, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Ma- chines. We extend the method by introducing ad- ditional linguistic features and we conduct an anal- ysis on their predictive power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and Results</head><p>In this section we present and analyze the experi- ments we run for discriminating between cognates and borrowings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data</head><p>Our experiments revolve around Romanian, a Ro- mance language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is sur- rounded by Slavic languages and its relationship with the big Romance kernel was difficult. Its ge- ographic position, at the North of the Balkans, put</p><p>Lang.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Borrowings</head><p>Cognates it in contact not only with the Balkan area, but also with the vast majority of Slavic languages. Polit- ical and administrative relationships with the Ot- toman Empire, Greece (the Phanariot domination) and the Habsburg Empire exposed Romanian to a wide variety of linguistic influences. We apply our method on four pairs of languages extracted from the dataset proposed by Ciobanu and Dinu (2014c):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">IT-RO baletto → balet (ballet) vittoria -victorie (victory) ↑ victoria (LAT) PT-RO selva → selv˘ a(selva) instinto -instinct (instinct) ↑ instinctus (LAT) ES-RO machete → macet˘ a (machete) castillo -castel (castle) ↑ castellum (LAT) TR-RO tütün → tutun (tobacco) aranjman -aranjament (arrangement) ↑ arrangement (FR)</formula><p>• Italian -Romanian (IT-RO);</p><p>• Portuguese -Romanian (PT-RO);</p><p>• Spanish -Romanian (ES-RO);</p><p>• Turkish -Romanian (TR-RO).</p><p>For the first three pairs of languages, which are formed of sister languages 3 , most cognate pairs have a Latin common ancestor, while for the fourth pair, formed of languages belonging to dif- ferent families (Romance and Turkic), most of the cognate pairs have a common French etymology, and date back to the end of the 19 th century, when both Romanian and Turkish borrowed massively from French. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> we provide examples of borrowings and cognates.</p><p>The dataset contains borrowings 4 and cognates that share a common ancestor. The words (and in- formation about their origins) were extracted from electronic dictionaries and their relationships were determined based on their etymology. We use a stratified dataset of 2,600 pairs of related words for each pair of languages. In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> we provide an initial analysis of our dataset. We report statis- tics regarding the length of the words and the edit distance between them. The difference in length between the related words shows what operations to expect when aligning the words. Romanian words are almost in all situations shorter, in av- erage, than their pairs. For TR-RO len 1 is higher than len 2 , so we expect more deletions for this pair of languages. The edit columns show how much words vary from one language to another based on their relationship (cognates or borrowings). For IT-RO both distances are small (0.26 and 0.29), as opposed to the other languages, where there is a more significant difference between the two (e.g., 0.26 and 0.52 for ES-RO). The small difference for IT-RO might make the discrimination between the two classes more difficult.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Baselines</head><p>Given the initial analysis presented above, we hypothesize that the distance between the words might be indicative of the type of relationship between them. Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Inkpen et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gomes and Lopes, 2011)</ref> show that related and non-related words can be distinguished based on the distance between them, but a finer-grained task, such as determining the type of relationship between the words, is probably more subtle. We compare our method with two baselines:</p><p>• A baseline which assigns a label based on the normalized edit distance between the words: given a test instance pair word 1 -word 2 , we subtract the average normalized edit distance between word 1 and word 2 from the aver- age normalized edit distance of the cognate pairs and from the average normalized edit distance between the borrowings and their et- ymons (computed on the training set; see Ta- ble 2), and assign the label which yields a smaller difference (in absolute value). In case of equality, the label is chosen randomly.</p><p>• A decision tree classifier, following the strat- egy proposed by Inkpen et al. <ref type="formula">(2005)</ref>: we use the normalized edit distance as single fea- ture, and we fit a decision tree classifier with the maximum tree depth set to 1. We per- form 3-fold cross-validation in order to se- lect the best threshold for discriminating be- tween borrowings and cognates. Using the best threshold selected for each language, we further assign one of the two classes to the pairs of words in our test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Task Setup</head><p>We experiment with Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to learn orthographic changes. We put our system together using the Weka 5 workbench ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hall et al., 2009</ref>). For SVM, we employ the radial basis function kernel (RBF) and we use the wrapper provided by Weka for LibSVM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chang and Lin, 2011</ref>). For each lan- guage pair, we split the dataset in two stratified subsets, for training and testing, with a 3:1 ra- tio. We experiment with different values for the n-gram size (n ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and we perform grid search and 3-fold cross validation over the train- ing set in order to optimize hyperparameters c and γ for SVM. We search over {1, 2, ..., 10} for c and over {10 −2 , 10 −1 , 10 0 , 10 1 , 10 2 } for γ. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> show the results of our ex- periment. The two baselines produce comparable results. For all pairs of languages, our method sig- nificantly improves over the baselines (99% con- fidence level) <ref type="bibr">6</ref> with values between 7% and 29% for the F 1 score, suggesting that the n-grams ex- tracted from the alignment of the words are bet- ter indicators of the type of relationship than the edit distance between them. The best results are obtained for TR-RO, with an F 1 score of 92.1, followed closely by PT-RO with 90.1 and ES-RO with 85.5. These results show that, for these pairs of languages, the orthographic cues are different with regard to the relationship between the words. For IT-RO we obtain the lowest F 1 score, 69.0. In this experiment, we know beforehand that there is a relationship between the words, and our aim is to identify the type of relationship. How- ever, in many situations this kind of a-priori in- formation is not available. In a real scenario, we would have either to add an intermediary clas- sifier for discriminating between related and un- related words, or to discriminate between three classes: cognates, borrowings, and unrelated. We augment our dataset with unrelated words (deter- mined based on their etymology), building a strat- 5 www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka 6 All the statistical significance tests reported in this paper are performed on 1,000 iterations of paired bootstrap resam- pling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Koehn, 2004</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Linguistic Factors</head><p>To gain insight into the factors with high predictive power, we perform several further experiments.</p><p>Part of speech. We investigate whether adding knowledge about the part of speech of the words leads to performance improvements. Verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjectives have language-specific endings, thus we assume that part of speech might be useful when learning orthographic patterns. We obtain POS tags from the DexOnline 8 machine-readable dictionary. We employ the POS feature as an additional categorical feature for the learning algorithm. It turns out that, except for PT-RO (F 1 score 92.3), the additional POS feature does not improve the performance of our method.</p><p>Syllabication. We analyze whether the system benefits from using the syllabified form of the words as input to the alignment algorithm. We are interested to see if marking the boundaries be- tween the syllables improves the alignment (and, thus, the feature extraction). We obtain the syl- labication for the words in our dataset from the RoSyllabiDict dictionary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbu, 2008)</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Weighted average precision (P ), recall (R), F 1 score (F 1 ) and optimal n-gram size for automatic discrimination between cognates and borrowings. For SVM we also report the optimal values for c and γ.</p><p>Consonants. We examine the performance of our system when trained and tested only on the aligned consonant skeletons of the words (i.e., a version of the words where vowels are discarded). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ashby and Maidment (2005)</ref>, conso- nants change at a slower pace than vowels across time; while the former are regarded as reference points, the latter are believed to carry less infor- mation useful for identifying the words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gooskens et al., 2008)</ref>. The performance of the system decreases when vowels are removed (95% confi- dence level). We also train and test the decision tree classifier on this version of the dataset, and its performance is lower in this case as well (95% confidence level), indicating that, for our task, the information carried by the vowels is helpful.</p><p>Stems. We repeat the first experiment using stems as input, instead of lemmas. What we seek to understand is whether the aligned affixes are in- dicative of the type of relationship between the words. We use the Snowball Stemmer 10 and we find that the performance decreases when stems are used instead of lemmas. Performing a χ 2 fea- ture ranking on the features extracted from mis- matches in the alignment of the related words re- veals further insight into this matter: for all pairs of languages, at least one feature containing the $ character (indicating the beginning or the end of a word) is ranked among the 10 most relevant fea- tures, and over 50 are ranked among the 500 most relevant features. This suggests that prefixes and suffixes (usually removed by the stemmer) vary with the type of relationship between the words.</p><p>Diacritics. We explore whether removing dia- critics influences the performance of the system. Many words have undergone transformations by the augmentation of language-specific diacritics <ref type="bibr">10</ref> http://snowball.tartarus.org when entering a new language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ciobanu and Dinu, 2014a)</ref>. For this reason, we expect diacritics to play a role in the classification task. We observe that, when diacritics are removed, the F 1 score on the test set is lower in almost all situations. Analyzing the ranking of the features extracted from mismatches in the alignment provides even stronger evidence in this direction: for all pairs of languages, more than a fifth of the top 500 features contain diacritics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we propose a computational method for discriminating between cognates and borrow- ings based on their orthography. Our results show that it is possible to identify the type of rela- tionship with fairly good performance (over 85.0 F 1 score) for 3 out of the 4 pairs of languages we investigate. Our predictive analysis shows that the orthographic cues are different for cognates and borrowings, and that underlying linguistic factors captured by our model, such as affixes and diacrit- ics, are indicative of the type of relationship be- tween the words. Other insights, such as the syl- labication or the part of speech of the words, are shown to have little or no predictive power. We intend to further account for finer-grained char- acteristics of the words and to extend our exper- iments to more languages. The method we pro- pose is language-independent, but we believe that incorporating language-specific knowledge might improve the system's performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Examples of borrowings and cognates.
