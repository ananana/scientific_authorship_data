				<p>To establish sophisticated dialogue systems , text planning needs to cope with congruent as well as incongruent interlocutor interests as given in everyday dialogues. Little attention has been given to this topic in text planning in contrast to dialogues that are fully aligned with anticipated user interests. When considering dialogues with congruent and incongru-ent interlocutor interests, dialogue partners are facing the constant challenge of finding a balance between cooperation and competition. We introduce the concept of fairness that operationalize an equal and adequate, i.e. equitable satisfaction of all interlocutors&apos; interests. Focusing on Question-Answering (QA) settings, we describe an answer planning approach that support fair dialogues under congruent and incongruent interlocutor interests. Due to the fact that fairness is subjective per se, we present promising results from an empirical study (N=107) in which human subjects interacted with a QA system implementing the proposed approach.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>For building dialogue systems that cope with con- tradictions and individual interests of dialog part- ners, text planning is required to process incon- gruent and congruent interests of interlocutors. So far, research on dialogue systems focusses on sup- porting dialogues that are fully aligned with antic- ipated user interests, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hovy, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grosz and Kraus, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore and Paris, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lochbaum, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rich and Sidner, 1997)</ref>, and, thus, max- imizing cooperativeness <ref type="bibr">(Bunt and Black, 2000, 191 p. 5)</ref>. Few approaches exist that investi- gate text planning with pure conflict, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jameson et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hadjinikolis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Black and Atkinson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Prakken, 2006</ref>). When con- sidering dialogues with congruent as well as in- congruent interlocutors interests, dialogue part- ners are facing the constant challenge of finding a balance between cooperation and competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Parikh, 2010)</ref>. We introduce the concept of fair- ness that operationalize an equal and adequate, i.e. equitable satisfaction of all interlocutors' in- terests <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Oxford Dictionaries, 2016)</ref>. Focusing on Question-Answering (QA) settings, we describe an answer planning approach that support fair dia- logues under congruent and incongruent interests of interlocutors. Due to the fact that fairness is subjective per se, we present results from an em- pirical study in which human subjects interacted with a QA system in various dialogue settings. When determining appropriate answers in text planning, approaches range from (1) wrong an- swer avoidance concepts technically checking the correctness of answers, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dong et al. (2011)</ref>, and (2) opponent models in persuasion dialogues for choosing most suitable arguments, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hadjinikolis et al. (2013)</ref>, to (3) the prediction of emo- tions of interlocutors to generate answers, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hasegawa et al. (2013)</ref>. Here, related work is rel- evant that focuses on the determination of appro- priate answers by processing concepts like users' intentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Levelt (1993)</ref>), desires (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rao &amp; Georgeff (1995)</ref>), preferences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al. (2013)</ref>), objectives (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schelling (1960)</ref>) and goals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Traum et al. (2008)</ref>) which we will hereafter subsume under the term motives. Mo- tives refer to objectives or situations that inter- locutors would like to accomplish, e.g., to find the best price when shopping. According to the belief-desire-intention model, motives can be de- scribed as desires in the sense of a motivational state ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Georgeff et al., 1998</ref>). Motives do not in-volve the mandatory purpose of being recogniz- able by other participants; so they are equivalent with the concept of intentions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Levelt, 1993)</ref>. Regarding the processing of congruent and incon- gruent motives, existing approaches rather focus on motives of single interlocutors or on joint mo- tives, e.g., Paquette (2012), <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al. (2013)</ref>. In the following, the aggregation of congruent and incongruent interlocutor motives in dialogues will be described as mixed motives. In this work, we propose a model that formalizes answer planning as psychological game <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bjorndahl et al., 2013</ref>) embedded in text planning ap- proaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mann and Thompson, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore and Paris, 1993</ref>) for creating dialogues perceived as fair by all interlocutors. Since traditional formal- ization of motives by means of utility functions is not sufficient to handle complex interactions as given in the considered dialogue setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bjorndahl et al., 2013)</ref>, psychological games enrich classical game settings with user models, i.e. in our case explicit representations of mixed motives. One appeal of the model is the consideration of an- swer planning as psychological game that lifts the process of finding appropriate answers from the short-term linguistic level to the long-term motive level in contrast to other approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(van Deemter, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stevens et al., 2015</ref>). Interlocutors do not have preferences for answers, but try to satisfy mo- tives. So, we assume that this approach enables a more sophisticated simulation of human behavior in mixed motive interactions as well as the estab- lishment of "cooperativeness in response formu- lation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bunt and Black, 2000</ref>, p. 5) for creat- ing dialogues perceived as fair. By exemplifying the model within a QA system as natural language sales assistant for conducting sales dialogues, we were able to evaluate the proposed approach in an empirical user study (N=107) in terms of per- ceived fairness of created dialogues with promis- ing results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Planning Answers given Mixed Motives</head><p>Adopting a computational pragmatics perspective, we intend to compute relevant linguistic aspects of answers based on contextual aspects given by mixed motives <ref type="bibr">(Bunt and Black, 2000, p.</ref> 3).</p><p>When searching for answers that support an eq- uitable satisfaction of mixed motives during dia- logue, Ω represents the solution space with poten- tial answers. An objective function f : Ω → R as- signs values to all answers x ∈ Ω for representing their potential in satisfying motives of interlocutor i ∈ I. Of course, all interlocutors I prefer an- swers x that satisfy best their motives;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x a x b ⇔ f (x a ) &gt; f (x b )</formula><p>. So, the goal would be to find an answer x ∈ Ω with highest satisfaction of motives f (x) of interlocutor i ∈ I in the sense of an opti- mal solution x * ; i.e. f (x * ) = max{f (x)|x ∈ Ω}. But, in order to achieve fair outcomes regarding an equitable, i.e. equal and adequate satisfaction of mixed motives, this definition is not sufficient. First, decision making takes places in the context of social dialogue interaction, i.e. answers have to be selected based on multiple objective functions since motives of all interlocutors i ∈ I shall be satisfied; f i : Ω → R. For capturing the aspect of equal motive satisfaction, the potential of answers has to be represented absolutely and relatively. In other words, the performance of an answer in sat- isfying motives of an interlocutor i ∈ I is com- bined with its performance in satisfying motives of counterparts −i ∈ I; max{f i,-i (x)|x ∈ Ω}. Second, the aforementioned conflict between co- operation and competition needs to be solved ade- quately. Since it is impossible to find an answer satisfying all motives of all interlocutors at any time in the dialogue, we search for a compromise in form of a solution i.e. an answer x + with a minimum quality s so that f (x + ) ≥ s. Adopt- ing the concept of satisficing by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Simon (1956)</ref>, an approach that attempts to find the best alternative available in contrast to optimal decision making, the goal is to find an answer x ∈ Ω with highest sufficient satisfaction of motives f (x) ≥ s of all interlocutors I in the sense of a satisficing solution</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x + ; i.e. f (x + ) = max{f i,-i (x) ≥ s|x ∈ Ω}.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model for Planning Satisficing Answers</head><p>To capture these issues, we defined a model for planning satisficing answers in dialogues with mixed motives. In the considered setting, a user with motives poses questions to a QA system that takes the role of a proxy for indirect interlocu- tors, e.g., retailers in online shopping scenarios.</p><p>The QA system adopts their motives and devel- ops strategies to satisfy them. Adopted motives as well as user motives that are anticipated by the system represent mixed motives in the dialogue. Task of the system is to process these mixed mo-tives with the objective to create a dialogue that is perceived as fair by all interlocutors after a fi- nite number of question answer pairs. As full sat- isfaction of all motives of all interlocutors at any time in a mixed motive dialogue is not possible, the QA system has to find a compromise, i.e. it has to plan answers that satisfice mixed motives during dialogue. Let us start by describing an ex- ample dialogue between a customer and a retailer in a shopping scenario: Q: Is the range of this wifi router appropriate for a house with 3 floors? A: In case of 3 floors, I would recommend an ad- ditional wifi repeater that got very good feedback by other customers. You can buy both router and repeater as a bundle with 15% discount.</p><p>In this dialogue snippet, the customer intends to get comprehensive product information regarding the wifi router; the retailer also wants to satisfy in- formational needs of the customer to establish ex- cellent services. Beyond these congruent motives, the retailer wants to increase revenue and to raise sales figures. A balance between mixed motives is found by giving information regarding the wifi router as well as preferences of other customers followed by a discounted bundle offer. In order to implement this kind of behavior into dialogue systems, the model for planning satisfic- ing answers separates linguistics from conceptual non-linguistic aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Traum and Larsson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allen et al., 2001</ref>) and consists of three main mod- ules: linguistic module, mapper and mixed motive module (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The linguistic module takes care for handling user questions as input as well for generating answers as output. Essential com- ponents of the linguistic module are the linguistic intention model and flexible text planning tech- nologies. For the latter, we apply text plans ac- cording to the Rhetorical Structure Theory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mann and Thompson, 1986</ref>) in form of plan operators (Moore and Paris, 1993) for generating answers. Each plan operator consists of a single compul- sive part, called nucleus, that is related with di- verse optional text segments, mentioned as satel- lites. We assume that beside supporting the effect of the nucleus, satellites represent an opportunity to satisfice mixed motives during dialogue. Satel- lites are linked with entities of the linguistic inten- tion model, means linguistic intentions that cap- ture the intended effects, i.e. functions of satel- lites within answers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Grosz and Sidner, 1986)</ref>. By means of second module -the mapper -linguis- tic intentions are mapped onto motives and vice versa (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Therefore domain-specific knowledge about correlations between linguistic intentions and mixed motives is required that is induced by a domain configurator and has to be derived empirically. Last, the mixed motive mod- ule combines an explicit representation and sit- uated processing of mixed motives <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cohen and Levesque, 1990</ref>) with a game-theoretical equilib- rium approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nash, 1951)</ref> to establish a psy- chological game setting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bjorndahl et al., 2013</ref>) (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Our approach operates by assum- ing that interlocutors are rational. That means they act strategically and purposively in pursuit of their own motives that they try to maximally sat- isfy. Therefore, we assume that game theory is an adequate prospect to deliver the analytical tools for planning answers in the context of mixed mo- tives. In game theory literature, equilibrium con- cepts are widely applied, e.g., Nash equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nash, 1951)</ref>. A Nash equilibrium is an outcome that holds because no involved actor has a ratio- nal incentive to deviate from it, i.e., the final result is "good enough" for all actors in the sense of a happy medium. Adapted to this work, this refers to a satisficing combination of motives at a partic- ular time in the dialogue, that is good enough for planning an answer that supports equitable satis- faction of mixed motives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Concepts</head><p>From a conceptual perspective, the model uses several core entities. First, we have players p ∈ P that represent interlocutors I. Players have domain-specific motives m for participating in the dialogue. For each player p ∈ P , we assume a M otiveSet that consists of individual motives, IndM , as well as of motives the player, i.e. the interlocutor anticipates from counterparts, AntM .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M otiveSetp = IndM p + AntM -p<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Mixed motives M M are represented by the non- redundant aggregation of 1. . . n M otiveSet of players p ∈ P in the dialogue.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M M = {M otiveSetp 1 . . . M otiveSetp n }<label>(2)</label></formula><p>All motives m ∈ M M are operationalized by means of real-valued weights for each player cov- ered by a weight vector − −−−− → W eight m . Motives are formed earlier and persist during dialogue, but players deliberate about weights of motives con- tinuously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bratman, 1987)</ref>. The achievement and thereby satisfaction of motives is supported by lin- guistic intentions li ∈ LI that are satisfied by satellites sat that are offered by plan operators and integrated into an answer. That means motives are achieved, if answers were given, that contributed to satisfaction of these motives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Algorithm and example</head><p>For introducing the proposed approach, we will give an example course of satisficing answer plan- ning starting with user question and ending with system answer. The description of the process will be supported by a model view marked with step numbers in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> as well as by an algorithmic view in Alg. 1. In the example, we apply domain- specific knowledge that was derived empirically in the retailing domain. Although, in literature re- view, customer and retailer motives in sales dia- logues were specified. Combinations of these mo- tives were analyzed in simulated sales conversa- tions between real retailers (N=3) and subjects act- ing as customers (N=12). Recorded as video files, conversations and identified motives were vali- dated in a web-based user study (N=120) regard- ing their naturalness and relevance. Sales conver- sations were transcribed, aggregated to a text cor- pus and analyzed regarding question and answer structures. So, the domain-specific knowledge representation used in the example bases on re- sults of this empirical analysis and covers all core model concepts introduced before: a mixed motive model with empirically derived default weights consisting of 19 customer and 4 retailer motives (cf. Tab. 1); 39 question and 33 answer schemata <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McKeown, 1985)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hobbs, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hovy, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mann and Thompson, 1986)</ref>, and exemplary product information. Imagine a sales conversation regarding consumer electronics between customer and retailer repre- sented by player (p a ) and player (p b ). Sets of mo- tives by players are equal regarding the motives included but differ in weights of individual and an- ticipated motives by players (cf. Tab. 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M M = M otiveSetp a + M otiveSetp b (3) M otiveSetp a = IndM pa + AntM p b M otiveSetp b = IndM p b + AntM pa</formula><p>The customer poses a question concerning products with a specific feature: "How many tablets offer the wifi features 802.11A, 802.11B, 802.11G, 802.11n?" Based on the identified ques- tion schema as well as the determined communica- tive function of the question, a dialogue system that instantiates the proposed model selects an ap- propriate plan operator (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1, step 1 &amp; 2)</ref>.   <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Extract of domain-specific linguistic in- tentions li ∈ LI with supported motives and de- scription 3.2.1 Definition of set S and determination of Satisf actionSet In our case, a plan operator named NUMBER OF PRODUCTS is selected that offers an obligatory nucleus and a set S of four optional satellites (cf. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>):</p><note type="other">Intention li ∈ LI supports m ∈ M M Description Advantages (li</note><formula xml:id="formula_5">S = {sat AAS , sat VER , sat DF , sat EUP }<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Overall objective is to determine set S + out of set S, that consists of satellites that -besides support- ing the effect of the nucleus -contribute to satis- ficing mixes motives of customer and retailer dur- ing dialogue (cf.

According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Grosz and Sidner, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore and Paris, 1993)</ref>, satel- lites are linked with linguistic intentions; i.e. they fulfill certain functions regarding the overall dia- logue. Set S is sent to the linguistic intention han- dler that specifies the Satisf actionSet (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  1</ref>, step 3 and Alg. 1, line 1-4). This set covers lin- guistic intentions that can be satisfied by satellites of set S (cf. Tab. 2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Satisf actionSet = {li A , li ER , li F , li MP }<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Figure 2: Plan operator NUMBER OF PRODUCTS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Mapping linguistic intentions onto mixed motives</head><p>Next, linguistic intentions have to be mapped onto motives. The m:n correlation between linguistic intentions and motives <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Moore and Paris, 1993)</ref> is domain-specific, has to be specified empirically and is induced by the domain configurator (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1, step 5)</ref>. Each motive is supported by a set of linguistic intentions that contribute to the achievement of this motive (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). On the other hand, each linguistic intention can support the achievement of several motives.

Therefore, the mapper sends the RelevanceSet to the mixed motive model handler for specifying the Satisf icingSet that consists of motives that (1) are sufficiently interesting for all interlocutors (i.e. weighted positively), and (2) have preferably low conflict potential (i.e. small differences in player weights) (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1, step 6</ref>). Satisficing mixed motives is considered as multi- player non-zero-sum game that is played for in- finitely many rounds, more precisely pairs of user questions and system answers.

Those two strategy profiles represent best answers for the player p as well as the whole group of play- ers P in the sense of a solution with minimum quality. No player has an incentive to deviate from those strategy profile because then its local pay- out would decrease. With − → s = {s 36 , s 36 }, we select the non-pareto-dominant option for finding the strategy profile with the lowest difference in local payouts following the idea of the model to create a balance between mixed motives. With each answer planning, players generate local pay- outs that are added during the course of dialogue to global payouts. Instead of gaining high global payouts, the objective of the model is to balance payouts of players during dialogue or to approx- imate them in case of drifting apart. We assume that similar global payouts of players can be re- garded as evidence for satisficed mixed motives. Based on the selected strategy profile, involved motives are aggregated to the Satisf icingSet = {m R , m ICR } that represents a combination of mixed motives that is satisficing for all players in this time in the dialogue (cf. Alg. 1, line 21).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Mapping mixed motives onto linguistic intentions</head><p>The resulting Satisf icingSet is forwarded to the mapper for mapping back motives onto linguistic intentions (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1, step 8 &amp; 9</ref>). In case, the Satisf icingSet covers zero motives, no mapping takes place, the process ends and none of the satel- lites in set S, cf. eq (4), will be considered in the actual answer planning. Otherwise, the mapper determines the set of supporting linguistic inten- tions by processing the inverse is-supported-by- relation between motives and linguistic intentions (cf. Alg. 1, line 22-30) (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). Comparing this set with the Satisf actionSet (cf. eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(5)</ref>), an intersection called SupportSet is created that represents the set of linguistic intentions that will be satisfied in current answer planning:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">SupportSet = {li A , li MP }<label>(10)</label></formula><p>3.2.5 Determination of set S + and generation of answer The linguistic intention handler determines the fi- nal set of satellites S + by analyzing 1:1 relations between linguistic intentions of the SupportSet and satellites of the set S (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1, step 10</ref> and Alg. 1, line 27). The resulting set S + = {sat AAS , sat EUP } consists of two satellites: Al- ternatives Advantages Survey (sat AAS ) and Emo- tion User Preferences (sat EUP ). The text plan lib handler adjusts the final text plan regarding the se- lected satellites before sending it to the answer generator (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1, step 11 &amp; 12)</ref>. Last, the text plan provided by the plan operator NUM- BER OF PRODUCTS is transformed into an answer. Thereby, answer schemata referenced by nucleus as well as satellites of set S + are instantiated (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, step 13): Q: "How many tablets offer the wifi features 802.11A, 802.11B, 802.11G, 802.11n?" A: "[ nuc The following tablets offer this feature: Sony SGPT122 Xperia.] [ sat AAS Due to its features, e.g., storage capacity: 32GB, Sony SGPT122 Xpe- ria has some advantages compared to other prod- ucts in this category.] [ sat EUP How about having a look at Sony SGPT122 Xperia by Sony?]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6">Summary</head><p>In summary, satisficing answer planning is con- sidered as a game consisting of four components P, S, F, A: the set of players P = {p a , p b }, strategies of players S = {S pa , S p b }, objective functions of players F = {f pa , f p b }, and a state space A = {a 1 . . . a t } that represents the rounds of the game, i.e. answers planned in the dialogue. The game starts in an initial state a 1 . At a partic- ular time t in the dialogue, the equilibrium iden- tifier observes the state a t characterized by P, S, and F and identifies best answers for all players; s t ∈ S p ; ∀p ∈ P . Consequential, a strategy pro- file meeting the Nash equilibrium condition, − → s t = {s t pa , s t p b }, is specified and resulting payouts are observed: </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f (a t , − → s t ) → LocalP ayout → R.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Implementation and Evaluation</head><p>Based on the proposed model (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), we implemented a German text-based QA system in form of a online shopping assistant (cf. <ref type="figure">Fig.  4</ref>) <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Users are able to construct questions term- by-term. Having tapped the last term of a ques- tion, the answer is given. The QA system uses the domain-specific knowledge representation men- tioned in section 3.2 formalized in RDF 2 .</p><p>Figure 4: Web-based QA system with posed ques- tion and given answer in German</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Setting</head><p>To evaluate our approach, we conducted a user study with the implemented prototype in German that was set up as lab experiment. Goal of this study was to assess the perceived fairness and naturalness of the dialogue with the QA system as well as the extent of motive satisfaction of participants. For that purpose, four randomized groups were formed. Each group was character- ized by a combination of motives by users (fair price of product (m FP ) or exclusive design of prod- uct (m ED )) and the QA system representing the re- tailer (increasing revenue (m IR ) or improving cus- tomer relationship (m ICR )) (cf. Tab. 3). These <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Groups and mixed motive combinations of user study mixed motives were combined systematically by means of scenarios given to users and a manipu- lated mixed motive model of the QA system. Be- fore interacting with the QA system that was em- bedded into a web-based questionnaire, partici- pants had to opportunity to get to know the QA system and interacting with it for the first time (cf. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>). Participants were then asked to pose questions to the QA system and to evaluate gener- ated answers against the background of their mo- tive (e.g., m FP ) and the related scenario, e.g.: "You are searching for a new tablet that shall be functional regarding standby and storage capac- ity. A fair price is important; no need for the lat- est innovation. You do not want to spend a lot of money for the new tablet. You are price con- scious." Participants were told to interact with the QA sys- tem as long as it needed to gain the information that was required by the scenario. Finally, seven- point Likert scales ranging from strongly disagree (1), neither (4) to strongly agree <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(7)</ref> were used to assess the perceived fairness of the dialogue, the naturalness of the dialogue and the motive satis- faction. Tab. 4 lists the questionnaire items for each of these constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>In summary, 120 subjects participated in the ex- periment. A complete dataset from 107 partici- pants (58,3% female) with an average age of 24.3 (SD=6.9) was considered for analysis. On av- erage, interactions between participants (N=107) and the QA system covered 5.19 question answer pairs (cf. example dialogue in appendix A). 556 questions were posed by subjects; 35.07% of them were propositional questions (e.g., "Is product A up-to-date?"), 62.41% set questions (e.g., "Where is the difference between product A and product B?") and 2.52% choice questions (e.g., "Which product is better than product A?"), cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bunt et al. (2010)</ref>. Due to the fact that Cronbachs alpha values for all three multi-item constructs lie clearly above the recommended threshold of .70 (Nunnally, 1967),  Additionally, results of one-sample t-tests are pro- vided to evaluate whether the aggregated scores lie significantly above or below the neutral scale value of 4. Results indicate that the participants were undecided with respect to the "Perceived Naturalness of Dialogue" with the QA system. We assume that this is owed to the restricted QA setting since there were no significant differences among the four groups (F(3,104) = 2.06, p = .11) (cf. Tab. 3). However, the data support the conclu- sion that participants perceived the dialogue as fair and that they were able to sufficiently satisfy their motives. Assuming rather conflicting motives of subject and QA system as given for instance in group #4 in Tab. 3, it could be assumed that per- ceived fairness and motive satisfaction should be smaller than in rather congruent motive combi- nations as shown in group #1. Nonetheless, the mean value of the construct "Perceived Fairness of Dialogue" was 5.17 across all groups (signifi- cant above mean value 4) and there were no signif- icant differences between the randomized groups (F(3,104) = 1.59, p = .20). Furthermore, "Motive Satisfaction" was rated with a mean value of 5.16 across all groups (significant above mean value 4) and again, there was not a significant effect of the group on motive satisfaction at the .05 level of sig- nificance (F(3,104) = 2.33, p = .08).</p><p>Overall, this indicates a positive evaluation of the QA system regarding its ability to generate satis- ficing answers despite of mixed motives of inter- locutors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We considered dialogues with congruent as well as incongruent interlocutor motives, where dialogue partners are facing the constant challenge of find- ing a balance between cooperation and competi- tion. Despite of the overall presence of dialogues with such mixed motives in everyday life, little at- tention has been given to this topic in text planning in contrast to scrutinized dialogue systems that support dialogues fully aligned with anticipated user interests. Focusing on Question-Answering (QA) settings, we introduced a model that formal- izes answer planning as psychological game em- bedded in text planning approaches for supporting fair dialogues under mixed motives. The model was exemplified within a QA sales assistant with domain-specific world knowledge for conducting sales dialogues. Due to the fact that fairness is sub- jective per se, we presented results from an empir- ical study (N=107) in which human subjects inter- acted with the QA system in various mixed motive settings. Results indicate a positive evaluation of the systems performance in planning answers that support fair dialogues despite of mixed motives of interlocutors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Model for planning satisficing answers in dialogues with mixed motives</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="4,140.03,62.81,317.48,157.39" type="bitmap" /></figure>
