				<p>We propose a new dependency parsing scheme which jointly parses a sentence and repairs grammatical errors by extending the non-directional transition-based formalism of Goldberg and El-hadad (2010) with three additional actions: SUBSTITUTE, DELETE, INSERT. Because these actions may cause an infinite loop in derivation, we also introduce simple constraints that ensure the parser termination. We evaluate our model with respect to dependency accuracy and gram-maticality improvements for ungrammat-ical sentences, demonstrating the robust-ness and applicability of our scheme.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Robustness has always been a desirable property for natural language parsers: humans generate a variety of noisy outputs, such as ungrammatical webpages, speech disfluencies, and the text in lan- guage learner's essays. Such non-canonical text contains grammatical errors such as substitutions, insertions, and deletions. For example, a non- native speaker of English might write "*I look in forward hear from you", where in is inserted, to is deleted, and hearing is substituted incorrectly.</p><p>We propose a novel dependency parsing scheme that jointly parses and repairs ungrammatical sen- tences with these sorts of errors. The parser is based on the non-directional easy-first (EF) parser introduced by <ref type="bibr">Goldberg and Elhadad (2010)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(GE herein)</ref>, which iteratively adds the most probable arc until the parse tree is completed. These ac- tions are called ATTACHLEFT and ATTACHRIGHT depending on the direction of the arc. We ex- tend the EF parsing scheme to be robust for un- grammatical inputs by correcting grammatical er-  <ref type="bibr">Goldberg and Elhadad (2010)</ref>. Dotted arcs correspond to ac- tions for each step. Following the notation by GE: arcs are directed from a child to its parent.</p><p>rors with three new actions: SUBSTITUTE, INSERT, and DELETE. These new actions do not add an arc between tokens but instead they edit a single to- ken. As a result, the parser is able to jointly parse and correct grammatical errors in the input sen- tence. We call this new scheme Error-Repair Non- Directional Easy-First parsing (EREF). Since the new actions may greatly increase the search space (e.g., infinite substitutions), we also introduce sim- ple constraints to avoid such issues. We first describe the technical details of EREF ( §2) and then evaluate our EREF parser with re- spect to dependency accuracy (robustness) and grammaticality improvements ( §3). Finally, we position this effort at the intersection of noisy text parsing and grammatical error correction ( §4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>Non-directional Easy-first Parsing Let us be- gin with a brief review of a non-directional easy- first (EF) parsing scheme proposed by GE, which is the foundation of our proposed scheme de- scribed in the following sections.</p><p>The EF parser has a list of partial structures p 1 , ..., p k (called pending) initialized with sen- tence tokens w 1 , ..., w n , and it keeps updating pending through derivations. Unlike left-to-right (e.g., shift-reduce) parsing algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Nivre, 2004</ref>), EF itera- tively selects the best pair of adjoining tokens and chooses the direction of attachment: ATTACHLEFT or ATTACHRIGHT. Once the action is committed, the corresponding dependency arc is added and the child token is removed from pending. The first two derivations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> depict ATTACHRIGHT and ATTACHLEFT. Pseudocode is shown in Algo- rithm 1 (lines 1, 3-12).</p><p>The parser is trained using the structured per- ceptron <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Collins, 2002</ref>) to choose actions to take given a set of features expanded from templates. The cost of actions is computed at every step by checking the validity: whether a new arc is in- cluded in the gold parse and whether the child al- ready has all its children. See GE for further de- scription of feature templates and structured per- ceptron training. Since it is possible that there are multiple valid sequence of actions and it is impor- tant to examine a large search space, the parser is allowed to explore (possibly incorrect) actions with a certain probability, termed learning with ex- ploration by <ref type="bibr">Goldberg and Nivre (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Error-repair variant of EF Error-repair non- directional easy-first parsing scheme (EREF) is a variant of EF. We add three new actions: SUBSTITUTE, DELETE, INSERT as Acts ER . We do not deal with a swapping action <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Nivre, 2009)</ref> to deal with word reordering errors, since the errors are even less frequent than other error types ( <ref type="bibr">Leacock et al., 2014</ref>). SUBSTITUTE replaces a token to a grammatically more probable token, DELETE removes an unnecessary token, and INSERT in- serts a new token at a designated index. These actions are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and Algorithm 1 (lines 13-25). Because the length of pend- ing decreases as an attachment occurs, the parser Algorithm 1: Error-repair non-directional parsing Input: ungrammatical sentence= w 1 ... w n Output: a set of dependency arcs (Arcs), repaired sentence (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ w 1 ... ˆ w m ) 1 Acts = { ATTACHLEFT, ATTACHRIGHT } 2 Acts ER = { DELETE, INSERT, SUBSTITUTE } 3 Arcs = { } 4 pending = p 1 ...p n ← w 1 ...w n 5 repaired = ˆ w 1 ... ˆ w n ← w 1 ...w n 6 while len (pending) &gt; 1 do 7 best ← argmax act∈Acts∪Acts ER score (act (i)) 8 s.t. 1 ≤ i ≤ len(pending) ∩ isLegal(act, pending) 9 if best ∈ Acts then 10 (parent, child) ← edgeFor(best) 11</formula><p>Arcs.add((parent, child)) 12 pending.remove(child)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">13 else if best = SUBSTITUTE then 14 c = bestCandidate(best, repaired) 15 pending.replace(p i , c) 16 repaired.replace( ˆ w p i .idx , c) 17 else if best = DELETE then 18 pending.remove(p i ) 19 repaired.remove( ˆ w p i .idx ) 20</formula><p>Arcs.updateIndex()</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">21 else if best = INSERT then 22 c = bestCandidate(best, repaired) 23 pending.insert(i, c) 24 repaired.insert(p i .idx, c) 25</formula><p>Arcs.updateIndex() <ref type="bibr">26</ref> end <ref type="bibr">27</ref> return Arcs, repaired also keeps the token indices in repaired (line 5), which holds all tokens in a sentence throughout the parsing process. Furthermore, the parser up- dates token indices in pending and repaired when INSERT or DELETE occurs. Technically, when a token at i is deleted/inserted, the parser decre- ments/increments the indices that are k &gt;= i (be- fore executing the action) in pending, repaired, and parents and children in a (partial) dependency tree (Arcs). To find the best candidate for SUBSTITUTE and INSERT efficiently, we restrict candidates to the same part-of-speech or pre-defined candidate list. We select the best candidate by comparing each n-gram language model score with the same sur- rounding context.</p><p>Similar to EF, while training the parser, the cost One serious concern of EREF is that the new actions may cause an infinite loop during pars- ing (e.g., infinite SUBSTITUTE, or an alternative DELETE and INSERT sequence.). To avoid this, we introduce two constraints: (1) edit flag and (2) edit limit. Edit flag is assigned for each to- ken as a property, and a parser is not allowed to execute Acts ER on a token if its flag is on. The flag is turned on when a parser executes Acts ER on a token whose flag is off. In INSERT action, the flag of the inserted token is activated, while the subsequent token (which gave rise to the INSERT) is not. Edit limit is set to be the number of to- kens in a sentence, and the parser is not allowed to perform Acts ER when the total number of ex- ecution of Acts ER exceeds the limit. These two constraints prevent the parser from falling into an infinite loop as well as parsing in the same order of time complexity as GE. We also add the follow- ing constraints to avoid unreasonable derivations: (i) a word with a dependent cannot be deleted and (ii) any child words cannot be substituted. All the constraints are implemented in the isLegal() func- tion in Algorithm 1 (line 8). We note that these constraints not only prevent undesirable deriva- tions but also leads to an efficiency in exploring the search space during training.</p><p>In the first experiment, as in GE, we train and evaluate our parser on the English dataset from the Penn Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Marcus et al., 1993</ref>) with the Penn2Malt conversion program (Sections 2-21 for training, 22 for tuning, and 23 for test). We use the PTB for the dependency experiment, since there are no ungrammatical text corpora that has depen- dency annotation on the corrected texts by human.</p><p>We choose the following most frequent error types that are used in <ref type="bibr">CoNLL 2013</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Rozovskaya and Roth (2014)</ref>, we focus on the most common can- didates for each error type, setting the determiner candidates to be {a, an, the, φ (as deletion)}, preposition candidates to be {on, about, from, for, of, to, at, in, with, by, φ}, and verb forms to be {VB(P|Z|G|D|N)}. We build a 5-gram language model on English Gigaword with the KenLM Toolkit (Heafield, 2011) for EREF to select the best candidate.</p><note type="other">shared task (Ng et al., 2013): 1. Determiner (substitution, deletion, insertion) 2. Preposition (substitution, deletion, insertion) 3. Noun number (singular vs. plural) 4. Verb form (tense and aspect) 5. Subject verb agreement Regarding the candidate sets for INSERT and SUBSTITUTE actions, following</note><p>We manually inject grammatical errors into PTB with certain error-rates similarly to the Gen- ERRate toolkit by <ref type="bibr">Foster and Andersen (2009)</ref>, which is designed to create synthetic errors into sentences to improve grammatical error detection.</p><p>We train and tune EREF models with different token-level error injection rates from 5% (E05) to 20% (E20), because language learner corpora have generally around 5% to 15% of token level errors depending on learners' proficiency ( <ref type="bibr">Leacock et al., 2014</ref>). Since the error injection is stochastic, we train each model with 10 runs and take an average of parser performance on the test set.</p><p>As a baseline, we use the original parser as de- scribed by GE, which is equivalent to EREF with training on an error-free corpus (E00). Since the EF baseline does not allow error correction dur- ing parsing, we pre-process the test data with a grammatical error correction system similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Rozovskaya and Roth (2014)</ref>, where a combination of classifiers for each error type corrects grammat- ical errors.</p><p>For evaluation, we jointly parse and correct grammatical errors in the test set with different  error injection rates (from 0% to 20%). It is im- portant to note that the number of tokens between the parser output and the oracle may be differ- ent because of error injection into the test set and Acts ER during parsing. To handle this mismatch, we evaluate the dependency accuracy with align- ment ( <ref type="bibr">Favre et al., 2010</ref>) in the spirit of SParseval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Roark et al., 2006</ref>), where tokens between a hy- pothesis and oracle are aligned prior to calculating the dependency accuracy.</p><note type="other">(%) Baseline E05 E10 E15 E20 0 91</note><p>In the second experiment, we use the Treebank of Learner English (TLE) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berzak et al., 2016)</ref> to see the grammaticality improvement in a real sce- nario. TLE contains 5,124 sentences and 2.69 (std 1.9) token errors per sentence. The average sen- tence length is 19.06 (std 9.47). TLE also pro- vides dependency labels and POS tags on the raw (ungrammatical) sentences. It is important to note that TLE has dependency annotation only for the original ungrammatical sentences, and therefore we do not compute the accuracy of dependency parse in this experiment. Since the corpus size is small, we train EREF (E05 to E20) on 100k sen- tences from Annotated Gigaword ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Napoles et al., 2012)</ref> and used TLE as a test set. Spelling errors are ignored because EREF can use the POS infor- mation. Grammaticality is evaluated by a regres- sion model <ref type="bibr">(Heilman et al., 2014</ref>), which scores grammaticality on the ordinal scale (from 1 to 4).</p><p>Results <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the result of unlabeled dependency accuracy (UAS). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As previously pre-Successful cases I 'm looking forward to <ref type="bibr">[-see-]</ref> {+seeing+} you next summer I 've never <ref type="bibr">[-approve-]</ref> {+approved+} his deal There is not {+a+} possibility to travel Failure cases I 've <ref type="bibr">[-assisted-]</ref> {+assisting+} your new musical show I am writing to complain <ref type="bibr">[-about-]</ref> {+with+} somethings I hope you liked {+the+} everything I said <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Successful and failure examples by EREF.

Adjacent pairs of deletion and insertion are considered as substitution.</p><p>sented <ref type="bibr">(Foster, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cahill, 2015)</ref>, our experi- ment also shows that parser performance deterio- rated as the error rate in the test corpus increased. On the error-free test set (0%), the baseline (EF pipeline) outperforms other EREF models; the ac- curacy is lower when the parser is trained on nois- ier data. The difference among the models be- comes small when the test set has 10% error injec- tion rate. As the rate increases further, the trend of parser accuracy reverses. When the test set has 15% or higher noise, the E20 is the most accu- rate parser. This trend is presented by the slope of deterioration = accuracy 20% −accuracy <ref type="bibr">0% 20</ref> in Ta- ble 1; a parser trained on noisier training data shows smaller decline and more robustness. 3 This indicates that the EREF is more robust than the vanilla EF on ungrammatical texts by jointly pars- ing and correcting errors. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> demonstrates the result of grammati- cality improvement (1-4 scale) on the TLE cor- pus, and <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows successful and failure corrections by EREF. Minimally trained models (E05 and E10) show little improvement in gram- maticality because the models are too conser- vative to make edits. The models with higher error-injection rates (E15 and E20) achieve 0.1 to 0.3 improvements that are statistically signifi- cant. There is still room to improve regarding the amount of corrections. This is probably because TLE contains a variety of errors (e.g., collocation, punctuation) in addition to the five error types we focus. To deal with other error types, we can ex- tend EREF by adding more actions, although it in- creases the search space.</p><p>From a practical perspective, the level of un- grammaticality should be realized ahead of time.

Our work could be considered an exten- sion via adding SUBSTITUTE and INSERT actions, although we depend on easy-first non-directional parsing framework instead of a left-to-right strat- egy. Importantly, the DELETE action is easier to handle than the SUBSTITUTE and INSERT actions, because they bring us challenging issues about a process of candidate word generation and avoiding an infinite loop in derivation. We have addressed these issues as explained in §2.</p><p>In terms of the literature from grammatical error correction, this work is closely related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dahlmeier and Ng (2012)</ref>, where they show an er- ror correction decoder with the easy-first strategy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented an error-repair variant of the non-directional easy-first dependency parser. We have introduced three new actions, SUBSTITUTE, INSERT, and DELETE into the parser so that it jointly parses and corrects grammatical errors in a sentence. To address the issue of parsing incom- pletion due to the new actions, we have proposed simple constraints that keep track of editing his- tory for each token and the total number of ed- its during derivation. The experimental result has demonstrated robustness of EREF parsers against EF and grammaticality improvement. Our work is positioned at the intersection of noisy text parsing and grammatical error correction. The EREF is a flexible formalism not only for grammatical error correction but other tasks with jointly editing and parsing a given sentence. <ref type="bibr">Benoit Favre, Bernd Bohnet, and Dilek Hakkani-Tür.</ref> 2010.
