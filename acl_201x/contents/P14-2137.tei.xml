				<p>This paper demonstrates the importance of relation equivalence for entity translation pair discovery. Existing approach of understanding relation equivalence has focused on using explicit features of co-occurring entities. In this paper, we explore latent features of temporality for understanding relation equivalence, and empirically show that the explicit and latent features complement each other. Our proposed hybrid approach of using both explicit and latent features improves relation translation by 0.16 F1-score, and in turn improves entity translation by 0.02.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Understanding relations is important in entity tasks. In this paper, we illustrate such importance using named entity (NE) translation mining prob- lem. Early research on NE translation used pho- netic similarities, for example, to mine the trans- lation 'Mandelson'→'曼 德 尔 森' <ref type="bibr">[ManDeErSen]</ref> with similar sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Knight and Graehl, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Wan and Verspoor, 1998</ref>). However, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, but they might be based on semantics (e.g., 'WTO'→'世 贸组织' <ref type="bibr">[ShiMaoZuZhi]</ref>), or even arbitrary (e.g., 'Jackie Chan'→'成龙' <ref type="bibr">[ChengLong]</ref>).</p><p>To address this challenge, current state-of-the- art approaches build an entity graph for each lan- guage corpus, and align the two graphs by prop- agating the seed translation similarities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Kim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">You et al., 2012</ref>). For exam- ple, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan, 成龙) can be obtained, if he is connected to his film 'Drunken Master' (醉拳) in both graphs. That is, we can propagate the seed translation similar- ity of (Drunken Master, 醉拳) to neighbor entities 'Jackie Chan' and '成龙' in each graph. When two graphs are obtained from parallel corpora, graphs are symmetric and "blind prop- agation" described above is effective. In con- trast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee and Hwang (2013)</ref> propose "selective propagation" for asymmetric graphs, of compar- ing the semantics of relations. A key contri- bution of this paper is using relation temporal- ity for determining relation equivalence. Exist- ing work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Nakashole et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Mohamed et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee and Hwang, 2013</ref>) uses only co- occurring entity pairs, or explicit features (EF). For example, for a relation pay an official visit to, with a statement (Bush, pay an official visit to, China), an entity pair (Bush, China) is in the "support set", which is a set of co-occurring entity pairs of pay an official visit to. When its support set is {(Bush, China), (Mandelson, Moscow), (Rice, Is- rael)}, and that of visit is {(Bush, China), (Rice, Israel), (Medvedev, Cuba)}, we can infer their se- mantic equivalence based on the set intersection: {(Bush, China), (Rice, Israel)}.</p><p>In contrast, we propose to explore corpus latent features (LF), to complement the sparsity problem of EF: Out of 158 randomly chosen correct re- lation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation transla- tions. Therefore, we leverage relation temporality, which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality <ref type="bibr">(Kle-mentiev and Roth, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">You et al., 2013</ref>). In particular, we discover three new challenges on using temporality for relation under- standing in comparable corpora, which we discuss in detail in Section 3.2. Based on these challenges, we identify three new features for LF.</p><p>We observe the complementary nature of EF and LF, then propose a hybrid approach combin- ing both features. Our new hybrid approach sig- nificantly improves the relation translation (0.16 higher F1-score than EF), and in turn improves the entity translation (0.02 higher F1-score).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preliminary: Entity Translation by Selective Propagation</head><p>Selective propagation, leveraging the statements extracted from bilingual comparable corpora, can be summarized by several steps.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">STEP 1 Initialize entity translation function T (0) N . STEP 2 Build relation translation function T (t) R us- ing T (t) N . STEP 3 Update entity translation function to ac- quire T (t+1) N using T (t) R .</formula><p>STEP 4 Repeat STEP 2 and STEP 3.</p><p>For STEP 1, an existing method for entity trans- lation is adopted. In our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation trans- lations) propagation approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">You et al., 2012)</ref> with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Lam et al., 2007</ref>) for a base translation ma- trix. The focus of this paper is STEP 2, building the translation score T (t) R (r E , r C ) of English relation r E and Chinese relation r C : We will discuss the detailed procedure of STEP 2 and propose how to improve it in Section 3. STEP 3 is the stage that selective propagation takes place. STEP 2 and STEP 3 reinforce each other to im- prove the final entity translation function. While STEP 3 is well-defined in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee and Hwang, 2013)</ref>, to propagate entity translation scores when the re- lation semantics of the edges are equivalent, STEP 2 has been restricted to the explicit feature, i.e., co- occurring entities or shared context. In clear con- trast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations. Note that we omit t for readability in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Relation Translation</head><p>In this section, we present our approaches to ob- tain relations of equivalent semantics across lan- guages (e.g., visit→访 问). Formally, our goal is to build the relation translation score function T R (r E , r C ) for English relation r E and Chinese relation r C .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Baseline: Explicit Feature Approach (EF)</head><p>In this section, we briefly illustrate a baseline method EF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee and Hwang, 2013)</ref>. As we mentioned in the introduction, traditional ap- proaches leverage common co-occurring entity- pairs. This observation also holds in the bilin- gual environment by exploiting seed entity trans- lations. For example, let us say that we have two extracted statements: (Bruce Willis, star in, The Sixth Sense) and (布 鲁 斯·威 利 斯 (Bruce Willis), 主演 (star in), 第六感 (The Sixth Sense)). Knowing a few seed entity translations using T N , 'Bruce Willis'→'布鲁斯·威利斯' and 'The Sixth Sense'→'第六感', we can find star in and 主演 are semantically similar.</p><p>Specifically, we quantify this similarity based on the number of such common entity pairs that we denote as |H(r E , r C )| for an English relation r E and a Chinese relation r C . The existing ap- proaches are variations of using |H(r E , r C )|. Our baseline implementation uses the one by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lee and Hwang, 2013)</ref>, and we refer the reader to the pa- per for formal definitions and processing steps we omitted due to the page limit.</p><p>Unfortunately, this approach suffers from spar- sity of the common entity pairs due to the incom- parability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by T N . Therefore, we lever- age corpus latent features as an additional signal to overcome this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Latent Feature Approach (LF) Temporal Feature Discovery</head><p>We exploit the temporal distribution d <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref>(t) of tex- tual element x during t-th week in statements; we count the occurrences of the element x on a weekly basis, and normalize them to observe ∑ t d <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref>(t) = 1. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 2a</ref> shows the relation temporal distribution d <ref type="bibr">[visit]</ref>(t) against week t. Unlike entities, we can easily observe the dissimilarity of the temporal distributions of semantically equivalent relations. We identify the  three big challenges in exploiting the temporality in relation translations.</p><p>[C1] Considering temporal distributions d <ref type="bibr">[r]</ref> of relations alone is not sufficient. For relations, such as visit, that involves diverse entities, the temporal distributions are highly noisy <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a)</ref>.</p><p>To address the first challenge, we use a finer- granularity unit for observing the temporality. More specifically, we exploit a coupling of a re- lation and an entity: d[e, r, * ] where e is an en- tity, r a relation, and * is a placeholder indicating that any noun phrase is accepted for the second ar- gument of a statement. 1 As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>, d[e, r, * ] is more distinctive and hence a key clue to find semantically equivalent relations.</p><p>[C2] Considering entity-relation coupling dis- tribution d[e, r, * ] alone is not sufficient due to the domination of individual temporality. For ex- ample, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> shows entity-dominating entity- relation temporality. If an entity has a peak at some period <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3a)</ref>, most relations that are coupled with the entity would have a peak at the very same period <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3b</ref>). This makes all re- lations that appear with this entity very similar to   [C3] Lastly, we have to eliminate false positives in relation temporality. To illustrate, two relations deploy and 在...部署 (deploy at) have similar temporal behaviors <ref type="figure">(Figure 2c)</ref>. However, the first relation takes <ref type="bibr">[person]</ref>, but the second relation <ref type="bibr">[location]</ref> for the second argument.</p><p>To address this, we check the common co- occurring entity pair of the relations. For exam- ple, we can obtain "Russia deployed an aircraft carrier", but not "Russia deployed at (在...部署) an aircraft carrier". Thus, we cannot acquire any common entity pair like (Russia, aircraft carrier) for deploy and 在...部署 (deploy at).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation Similarity Computation</head><p>We compute the similarity of two relations r E in English and r C in Chinese using the following 2- steps.</p><p>• Compute the similarity S CP (r E , r C , e E , e C ) of temporal distributions of entity-relation cou- plings for each bilingual entity pair (e E , e C ).</p><p>• Compute the translation score T LF R (r E , r C ) by aggregating the coupling similarities.</p><p>Considering the three challenges, we produce a list of features {f x (r E , r C , e E , e C )} to mea- sure the coupling similarity S CP (r E , r C , e E , e C ) as follows.</p><p>• [Base feature] f ET : T N (e E , e C ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Hybrid Approach LF+EF</head><p>We find that LF and EF are complementary. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Ta- ble 1</ref> shows the examples of relations and their translations. In general, LF can translate more re- lations (e.g., support and capture). However, in some cases like ratify, highly related relations may induce noise. That is, we always 讨论 (dis- cuss) before we 批 准 (ratify) something and hence the temporal behavior of 讨论 (discuss) is also very similar to that of ratify. On the other hand, it can be correctly translated using EF. Thus, we produce the hybrid relation transla- tion, and we empirically set λ = 0.4:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T LF+EF R (r E , r C ) = λT LF R (r E , r C )+(1 − λ)T EF R (r E , r C ) (3)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the proposed approach on the entity translation task and the relation trans- lation task. We extract English and Chinese state- ments from news articles in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee and Hwang (2013)</ref>. The number of English articles is 100,746, and that of Chinese articles is 88,031. As we can see from the difference in the numbers of the docu- ments, the news corpora are not direct translations, but they have asymmetry of entities and relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Entity Translation</head><p>In this section, we present experimental settings and results on translating entities using our pro- posed approaches. To measure the effectiveness,  we use a set of gold standard entity translation pairs which consist of 221 person entities and 52 organization entities. We measure precision, re- call, and F1-score based on the returned trans- lation pairs for each English entity as it is done in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee and Hwang, 2013)</ref>. We compare our hybrid approach, which is de- noted by LF+EF with EF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lee and Hwang, 2013)</ref>, a combined approach PH+SM of phonetic similar- ity and letter-wise semantic translation for better accuracy for organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Lam et al., 2007)</ref>, and the seed translations Seed that we adopt ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">You et al., 2012</ref>) with PH+SM as a base translation ma- trix. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We process one iteration of the entire frame- work (STEP 1-3) for both LF+EF and EF. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the comparison of the methods. Our proposed approach LF+EF shows higher F1- score than the baselines. In particular, our ap- proach outperforms EF. For example, 'Matthew Emmons' is a lesser known entity, and we have only few statements mentioning him in the cor- pora. The corpus explicit feature EF alone cannot translate the relation win and, in turn, 'Matthew Emmons'. However, LF+EF translates him cor- rectly into 马修·埃蒙斯 through the relation win.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Relation Translation</head><p>This section considers the relation translation task. Each relation translation method translates an En- glish relation r E into a list of Chinese relations, and we check whether a Chinese relation r C with the highest translation score is the correct transla- tion. We consider the relation translation is cor- rect when the semantics are equivalent. For ex- ample, 去 (leave for/go to) is a correct trans- lation of leave for, but 离开 (leave) is not. To- tal 3342 English-Chinese relation translation pairs returned by our method and the baselines are ran- domly shown and labeled. Out of 3342 pairs, 399 are labeled as correct.</p><p>Eng. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Rel. C1 C1+C2 C1+C2+C3 EF   visit  15  4  1  1   drop  21  14  1  -  capture  6  4</ref> 1 - <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Rank of correct relation translation. The symbol '-' indicates no correct translation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows the comparisons of LF, EF and their hybrid LF+EF. We can clearly see that LF shows higher recall than EF while EF shows higher precision. As we emphasized in Sec- tion 3.3, we can see their complementary property. Their hybrid LF+EF has both high precision and recall, thus has the highest F1-score.</p><p>Note that the absolute numbers (due to the harsh evaluation criteria) may look low. But the top translations are still relevant (e.g., fight is trans- lated to 驻 (deploy troops)). In addition, the lower ranked but correct relation translations also affect entity translation. Therefore, even lower- performing EF boosted the entity translations, and in effect, our approach could achieve higher F1- score in the entity translation task.</p><p>To illustrate the detailed effects of the corpus latent features, <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the ranks of correct Chinese translations for English relations by meth- ods using selected features for the challenges. For comparison, the ranks of the correct translations when using EF are shown. Our approach using the entity-relation coupling similarity feature for <ref type="bibr">[C1]</ref> alone often cannot find the correct transla- tions. But using all features removes such noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper studied temporality features for re- lation equivalence. With the proposed features, we devised a hybrid approach combining corpus latent and explicit features with complementary strength. We empirically showed the effectiveness of our hybrid approach on relation translation, and it, in turn, improved entity translation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Entity translation by propagation.</figDesc></figure>
