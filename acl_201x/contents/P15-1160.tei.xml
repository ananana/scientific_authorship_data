				<p>The development and proliferation of social media services has led to the emergence of new approaches for surveying the population and addressing social issues. One popular application of social media data is health surveillance, e.g., predicting the outbreak of an epidemic by recognizing diseases and symptoms from text messages posted on social media platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel task that is crucial and generic from the viewpoint of health surveillance: estimating a subject (carrier) of a disease or symptom mentioned in a Japanese tweet. By designing an annotation guideline for labeling the subject of a disease/symptom in a tweet, we perform annotations on an existing corpus for public surveillance. In addition, we present a supervised approach for predicting the subject of a disease/symptom. The results of our experiments demonstrate the impact of subject identification on the effective detection of an episode of a disease/symptom. Moreover, the results suggest that our task is independent of the type of disease/symptom.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Social media services, including Twitter and Face- book, provide opportunities for individuals to share their experiences, thoughts, and opinions. The wide use of social media services has led to the emergence of new approaches for survey- ing the population and addressing social issues. One popular application of social media data is flu surveillance, i.e., predicting the outbreak of in- fluenza epidemics by detecting mentions of flu in- fections on social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Culotta, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lampos and Cristianini, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aramaki et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Paul and Dredze, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Signorini et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collier, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gesualdo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Stoov√© and Pedrana, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies mainly relied on shallow tex- tual clues in Twitter posts in order to predict the number of flu infections, e.g., the number of oc- currences of specific keywords (such as "flu" or "influenza") on Twitter. However, such a simple approach can lead to incorrect predictions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Broniatowski et al. (2013)</ref> argued that media atten- tion increases chatter, i.e., the number of tweets that mention the flu without the poster being ac- tually infected. Examples include, "I don't wish the flu on anyone" and "A Harry Potter actor hos- pitalised after severe flu-like syndromes." <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lazer et al. (2014)</ref> reported large errors in Google Flu Trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carneiro and Mylonakis, 2009</ref>) on the ba- sis of a comparison with the proportion of doctor visits for influenza-like illnesses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lamb et al. (2013)</ref> aimed to improve the ac- curacy of detecting mentions of flu infections. Their method trains a binary classifier to distin- guish tweets reporting flu infections from those expressing concern or awareness about the flu, e.g., "Starting to get worried about swine flu." Ac- cordingly, they reported encouraging results (e.g., better correlations with CDC trends), but their ap- proach requires supervision data and a lexicon (word class features) specially designed for the flu. Moreover, even though this method is a reason- able choice for improving the accuracy, it is not readily applicable to other types of diseases (e.g., dengue fever) and symptoms (e.g., runny nose), which are also important for public health <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Velardi et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a more generalized task setting for public surveillance. In other words, our objective is to estimate the subject (carrier) of a disease or symptom mentioned in a Japanese tweet. More specifically, we are inter- ested in determining who has a disease/symptom (if any) in order to examine whether the poster suf- fers from the disease or symptom. For example, given the sentence "I caught a cold," we would predict that the first person ("I," i.e., the poster) is the subject (carrier) of the cold. On the other hand, we can ignore the sentence, "The TV pre- senter caught a cold" only if we predict that the subject of the cold is the third person, who is at a different location from the poster.</p><p>Although the task setting is simple and intuitive, we identify several key challenges in this study.</p><p>1. Novel task setting. The task of identifying the subject of a disease/symptom is similar to predicate-argument structure (PAS) anal- ysis for nominal predicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Meyers et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sasano et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Komachi et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gerber and Chai, 2010)</ref>. However, these studies do not treat diseases (e.g., "in- fluenza") and symptoms (e.g., "headache") as nominal predicates. To the best of our knowl- edge, this task has not been explored in natu- ral language processing (NLP) thus far.</p><p>2. Identifying whether the subject has a dis- ease/symptom. Besides the work on PAS analysis for nominal predicates, the most rel- evant work is PAS analysis for verb predi- cates. However, our task is not as simple as predicting the subject of the verb governing a disease/symptom-related noun. For exam- ple, the subject of the verb "beat" is the first person "I" in the sentence "I beat the flu," but this does not imply that the poster has the flu. At the same time, we can use a variety of expressions for indicating an infection, e.g., "I'm still sick!! This flu is just incredible...," "I can feel the flu bug in me," and "I tested positive for the flu."</p><p>3. Omitted subjects. We often come across tweets with omitted subjects, e.g., "Down with the flu feel" and "Thanks the flu for striking in hard this week" even in English tweets. Because the first person is omitted frequently, it is important to predict omitted subjects from the viewpoint of the applica- tion (public surveillance).</p><p>In this paper, we present an approach for iden- tifying the subjects of various types of diseases and symptoms. The contributions of this paper are three-fold.</p><p>1. In order to explore a novel and general task setting, we design an annotation guideline for labeling a subject of a disease/symptom in a tweet, and we deliver annotations in an exist- ing corpus for public surveillance. Further, we propose a method for predicting the sub- ject of a disease/symptom by using the anno- tated corpus.</p><p>2. The experimental results show that the task of identifying subjects is independent of the type of diseases/symptom. We verify the possibility of transferring supervision data to different targets of diseases and symptoms. In other words, we verify that it is possi- ble to utilize the supervision data for a par- ticular disease/symptom to improve the ac- curacy of predicting subjects of another dis- ease/symptom.</p><p>3. In addition, the experimental results demon- strate the impact of identifying subjects on improving the accuracy of the downstream application (identification of an episode of a disease/symptom).</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 describes the corpus used in this study as well as our annotation work for identify- ing subjects of diseases and symptoms. Section 3.1 presents our method for predicting subjects on the basis of the annotated corpus. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 report the performance of the proposed method. Section 3.4 describes the contributions of this study toward identifying episodes of dis- eases and symptoms. Section 4 reviews some re- lated studies. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our findings and concludes the paper with a brief dis- cussion on the scope for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Target corpus</head><p>We used a Japanese corpus for public surveil- lance of diseases and symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aramaki et al., 2011</ref>). The corpus targets seven types of dis- eases and symptoms: cold, cough, headache, chill, runny nose, fever, and sore throat. Tweets con- taining keywords for each disease/symptom were collected using the Twitter Search API: for exam- ple, tweets about sore throat were collected using the query "(sore OR pain) AND throat". Further, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>: Examples of annotations of subject labels.</p></div>

Alternatively, the sentence does not mention an occurrence of a disease/symptom.</p><p>I hate buyin cold medicine cuz I never know which one to buy <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Definitions of subject labels and example tweets.</p><p>the corpus consists of 1,000 tweets for each dis- ease/symptom besides cold, and 5,000 tweets for cold. The corpus was collected through whole years 2007-2008. This period was not in the A/H1N1 flu pandemic season. An instance in this corpus consists of a tweet text (in Japanese) and a binary label (episode la- bel, hereafter) indicating whether someone near the poster has the target disease/symptom 1 . A pos- itive episode indicates an occurrence of the dis- ease/symptom. In this study, we disregarded in- stances of sore throat in the experiments because most such instances were positive episodes 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Annotating subjects</head><p>In this study, we annotated the subjects of diseases and symptoms in the corpus described in Section 2.1. Specifically, we annotated the subjects in 500 tweets for each disease/symptom (except for sore throat). Thus, our corpus includes a total of 3,000 tweets in which the subjects of diseases and symp- toms are annotated. We annotated the subject labels of the dis- eases/symptoms in each tweet and identified those who had the target disease/symptom. The sub- ject labels indicate those who have the correspond- ing disease/symptom; they are described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">detail Label   FIRSTPERSON NEARBYPERSON FARAWAYPERSON NONHUMAN  NONE  Total  # tweets  2,153  129  201  40  401</ref> 2,924 # explicit subjects 70 (3.3%) 112 (86.8%) 175 (87.1%) 38 (95.0%) 0 (0.0%) <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">395  # positive episodes  1,833  99  2  0  16  1,950  # negative episodes  320  30  199  40  385  974  Positive ratio</ref> 85.1% 76.7% 1.0% 0.0% 4.0% 66.7% <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Associations between subject labels and positive/negative episodes of diseases and symptoms.</p><p>herein.</p><p>In addition to the subject labels, we annotated the text span that indicates a subject. However, the subjects of diseases/symptoms are often omitted in tweet texts. Example 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a case in which the subject is omitted. The information as to whether the subject is omitted is useful for analyzing the difficulty in predicting the subject of a disease/symptom. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the definitions of the subject la- bels with tweeted examples. Because it is impor- tant to distinguish the primary information (infor- mation that is observed and experienced by the poster) from the secondary information (informa- tion that is broadcasted by the media) for the ap- plication of public surveillance, we introduced five labels: FIRSTPERSON, NEARBYPERSON, FAR- AWAYPERSON, NONHUMAN, and NONE.</p><p>FIRSTPERSON is assigned when the subject of the disease/symptom is the poster of the tweet. When annotating this label, we ignore the modal- ity or factuality of the event of acquiring the dis- ease/symptom. For example, the example tweet corresponding to FIRSTPERSON in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> does not state that the poster has a fever but only that the poster has a desire to have a fever. Although such tweets may be inappropriate for identifying a disease/symptom, this study focuses on identify- ing the possessive relation between a subject and a disease/symptom. The concept underlying this decision is to divide the task of public surveillance into several sub-tasks that are sufficiently general- ized for use in other NLP applications. Therefore, the task of analyzing the modality lies beyond of scope of this study ( <ref type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., )</ref>. We apply the same criterion to the labels NEARBYPERSON, FARAWAYPERSON, and NONHUMAN.</p><p>NEARBYPERSON is assigned when the subject of the disease/symptom is a person whom the poster can directly see or hear. In the original cor- pus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aramaki et al., 2011</ref>), a tweet is labeled as positive if the person having a disease/symptom is in the same prefecture as the poster. However, it is extremely difficult for annotators to judge from a tweet whether the person mentioned in the tweet is in the same prefecture as the poster. Never- theless, we would like to determine from a tweet whether the poster can directly see or hear a pa- tient. For these reasons, we introduced the label NEARBYPERSON in this study.</p><p>FARAWAYPERSON applies to all cases in which the subject is a human, but not classified as FIRST- PERSON or NEARBYPERSON. This category fre- quently includes tweeted replies, as in the case of the example corresponding to FARAWAYPERSON in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We assign FARAWAYPERSON to such sentences because we are unsure whether the sub- ject of the symptom is a person whom the poster can physically see or hear.</p><p>NONHUMAN applies to cases in which the sub- ject is not a human but an object or a concept. For example, a sentence with the phrase "My room is so chill" is annotated with this label.</p><p>NONE indicates that the sentence does not men- tion a target disease or symptom even though it includes a keyword for the disease/symptom.</p><p>In order to investigate the inter-annotator agree- ment, we sampled 100 tweets of cold at random, and examined the Cohen's Œ∫ statistic by two an- notators. The Œ∫ statistic is 0.83, indicating a high level agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carletta, 1996)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> reports the distribution of subject la- bels in the corpus annotated in this study. When the subject of a disease/symptom is FIRSTPER- SON, only 3.3% of the tweets have explicit tex- tual clues for the first person 3 . In other words, when the subject of a disease/symptom is FIRST- PERSON, we rarely find textual clues in tweets. In contrast, there is a greater likelihood of finding ex- plicit clues for NEARBYPERSON, FARAWAYPER- SON, and NONHUMAN subjects. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> also lists the probability of positive episodes given a subject label, i.e., the posi- tive ratio. The likelihood of a positive episode is extremely high when the subject label of a disease/symptom is FIRSTPERSON (85.1%) or NEARBYPERSON (76.7%). In contrast, FAR- AWAYPERSON, NONHUMAN, and NONE sub- jects represent negative episodes (less than 5.0%). These facts suggest that identifying subject labels can improve the accuracy of predicting patient la- bels for diseases and symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Subject classifier</head><p>We built a classifier to predict a subject label for a disease/symptom mentioned in a sentence by us- ing the corpus described in the previous section. In our experiment, we merged training instances having the label NONHUMAN with those having the label NONE because the number of NONHU- MAN instances was small and we did not need to distinguish the label NONHUMAN from the label NONE in the final episode detection task. Thus, the classifier was trained to choose a subject la- bel from among FIRSTPERSON, NEARBYPER- SON, FARAWAYPERSON, and NONE. We dis- carded instances in which multiple diseases or symptoms are mentioned in a tweet as well as those in which multiple subjects are associated with a disease/symptom in a tweet. In addition, we removed text spans corresponding to retweets, replies, and URLs; the existence of these spans was retained for firing features. We trained an L2- regularized logistic regression model using Clas- sias 1.1 4 . The following features were used.</p><p>Bag-of-Words (BoW). Nine words included be- fore and after a disease/symptom keyword. We split a Japanese sentence into a sequence of words using a Japanese morphological analyzer, MeCab (ver.0.98) with IPADic (ver.2.7.0) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> .</p><p>Disease/symptom word (Keyword). The sur- face form of the disease/symptom keyword (e.g. "cold" and "headache").</p><p>2,3-gram. Character-based bigrams and tri- grams before and after the disease/symptom key- word within a window of six letters.</p><p>URL. A boolean feature indicating whether the tweet includes a URL.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>: Performance of the subject classifier.</p><p>RT &amp; reply. Boolean features indicating whether the tweet is a reply or a retweet.</p><p>Word list for NEARBYPERSON (NearWord). A boolean feature indicating whether the tweet contains a word that is included in the lexicon for NEARBYPERSON. We manually collected words that may refer to a person who is near the poster, e.g., "girlfriend," "sister," and "staff." The Near- Word list includes 97 words.</p><p>Word list for FARAWAYPERSON <ref type="bibr">(FarWord)</ref>. A boolean feature indicating whether the tweet contains a word that is included in the lexicon for FARAWAYPERSON. Similarly to the NearWord list, we manually collected 50 words (e.g., "in- fant") for compiling this list.</p><p>Title word. A boolean feature indicating whether the tweet contains a title word accom- panied by a proper noun. The list of title words includes expressions such as "" and "" (roughly corresponding to "Ms" and "Mr") that describe the title of a person.</p><p>Tweet length. Three types of boolean features that fire when the tweet has less than 11 words, 11 to 30 words, and more than 30 words, respectively.</p><p>Is-head. A boolean feature indicating whether the word following a disease/symptom keyword is a noun. In Japanese, when the word follow- ing a disease/symptom keyword is a noun, the dis- ease/symptom keyword is unlikely to be the head of the noun phrase.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Confusion matrix between predicted and correct subject labels. The surface form of the disease/symptom key- word was found to be the most effective feature in this task, the reasons for which are discussed in Section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation of the subject classifier</head><p>A retweet or reply tweet provides evidence that the poster has interacted with another person. Such meta-linguistic features may facilitate se- mantic and discourse analysis in web texts. How- ever, this feature is mainly limited to tweets.</p><p>The lexicon for NEARBYPERSON provided an improvement of 4.6 points in terms of the macro F1 score. This is because (i) around 90% of the subjects for NEARBYPERSON were explicitly stated in the tweets and (ii) the vocabulary of peo- ple near the poster was limited. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the confusion matrix between the correct labels and the predicted labels. The diag- onal elements (in bold face) represent the number of correct predictions. The figures in parentheses denote the number of instances for which the base- line feature set made incorrect predictions, but the full feature set made correct predictions. For ex- ample, the classifier predicted NEARBYPERSON subjects 48 times; 34 out of 48 predictions were correct. The full feature set increased the number of correct predictions by 22.</p><p>From the diagonal elements (in bold face), we can confirm that the number of correct predictions increased significantly from the baseline case, ex- cept for FIRSTPERSON. One of the reasons for the improved accuracy of NONE prediction is the imbalanced label ratio of each disease/symptom. NONE accounts for 14% of the entire corpus, but only 5% of the runny nose corpus. On the other hand, NONE accounts for more than 30% of the chill corpus. The disease/symptom keyword fea- ture adjusts the ratio of the subject labels for each disease/symptom, and the accuracy of sub- ject identification is improved.</p><p>As compared to the baseline case, the number of FIRSTPERSON cases that were predicted as FAR- AWAYPERSON increased. Such errors may be at- tributed to the reply feature. According to our annotation scheme, FARAWAYPERSON contains many reply tweets. Because the reply &amp; retweet features make the second-largest contribution in our experiment, the subject classifier tends to out- put FARAWAYPERSON if the tweet is a reply. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> summarizes the subject classification re- sults comparing the case in which the subject of a disease/symptom exists in the tweet with that in which the subject does not exist. The pre- diction of FIRSTPERSON is not affected by the presence of the subject because FIRSTPERSON subjects are often omitted (especially in Japanese tweets). The prediction of NEARBYPERSON and FARAWAYPERSON is difficult if the subject is not stated explicitly. In contrast, it is easy to correctly predict NONE even though the subject is not ex- pressed explicitly. This is because it is not easy to capture a variety of human-related subjects using Bag-of-Words, N-gram, or other simple features used in this experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Dependency on diseases/symptoms</head><p>The experiments described in Section 3.2 use training instances for all types of diseases and symptoms. However, each disease/symptom may have a set of special expressions for describing the state of an episode. For example, even though "catch a cold" is a common expression, we cannot  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Subject classification results comparing explicit subjects with omitted subjects.</p><p>Figure 2: F1 scores for predicting subjects of cold with different types and sizes of training data.</p><p>say "catch a fever" by combining the verb "catch" and the disease "fever." The corpus developed in Section 2.2 can be considered as the supervision data for weighting linguistic patterns that connect diseases/symptoms with their subjects. This view- point raises another question: how strongly does the subject classifier depend on specific diseases and symptoms?</p><p>In order to answer this question, we compare the performance of recognizing subjects of cold when using the training instances for all types of dis- eases and symptoms with that when using only the training instances for the target disease/symptom. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the macro F1 scores with all train- ing instances (dotted line) and with only cold training instances (solid line) <ref type="bibr">6</ref> .</p><p>In this case, training with cold instances is nat- urally more efficient than training with other types of diseases/symptoms. When trained with 400 in- stances only for cold, the classifier achieved an F1 score of 45.2. Moreover, we confirmed that adding training instances for other types of dis- eases/symptoms improved the F1 score: the max- <ref type="bibr">6</ref> For the solid line, we used 500 instances of "cold" as a test set, and we plotted the learning curve by increasing the number of training instances for other diseases/symptoms. For the dotted line, we fixed 100 instances for a test set, and we plotted the learning curve by increasing the number of training instances (100, 200, 300, and 400). imum F1 score was 54.6 with 2,900 instances. These results indicate the possibility of building a subject classifier that is independent of specific diseases/symptoms but applicable to a variety of diseases/symptoms. We observed a similar ten- dency for other types of diseases/symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Contributions to the episode classifier</head><p>The ultimate objective of this study is to detect outbreaks of epidemics by recognizing diseases and symptoms. In order to demonstrate the contri- butions of this study, we built an episode classifier that judges whether the poster or a person close to the poster suffers from a target disease/symptom. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the overall structure of the system. Given a tweet, the system predicts the subject la- bel for a disease/symptom, and integrates the pre- dicted subject label as a feature for the episode classifier. In addition to the features used in Ara- maki et al. (2011), we included binary features, each of which corresponds to a subject label pre- dicted by the proposed method. We trained an L2- regularized logistic regression model using Clas- sias 1.1. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> summarizes the performance of the episode classifier with different settings: without subject labels (baseline), with predicted subject la-  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Performance of the episode classifier.</p><p>bels , and with gold-standard subject labels. We measured the F1 scores via five-fold cross vali- dation <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . Further, we confirmed the contribution of subject label prediction, which achieved an im- provement of 1.3 points over the baseline method (85.8 vs. 84.5). When using the gold-standard subject labels, the episode classifier achieved an improvement of 5.9 points. These results highlight the importance of recognizing a subject who has a disease/symptom using the episode classifier. Considering the F1 score for each dis- ease/symptom, we observed the largest improve- ment for chill. This is because the Japanese word for "chill" has another meaning a cold air mass. When the word "chill" stands for a cold air mass in a tweet, the subject for "chill" is NONE. There- fore, the episode classifier can disambiguate the meaning of "chill' on the basis of the subject la- bels. Similarly, the subject labels improved the performance for "fever".</p><p>In contrast, the subject labels did not improve the performance for headache and runny nose con- siderably. This is because the subjects for these symptoms are mostly FIRSTPERSON, as we sel- dom mention the symptoms of another person in such cases. In other words, the episode classi- fier can predict a positive label for these symptoms without knowing the subjects of these symptoms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Twitter and NLP</head><p>NLP researchers have addressed two major direc- tions for Twitter: adapting existing NLP technolo- gies to noisy texts and extracting useful knowl- edge from Twitter. The former includes improving the accuracy of part-of-speech tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gimpel et al., 2011</ref>) and named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Plank et al., 2014</ref>), as well as normalizing ill-formed words into canonical forms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Han and Baldwin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chrupa≈Ça, 2014)</ref>. Even though we did not incor-porate the findings of these studies, they could be beneficial to our work in the future.</p><p>The latter has led to the development of sev- eral interesting applications besides health surveil- lance. These include prediction of future rev- enue <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asur and Huberman, 2010)</ref> and stock mar- ket trends ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Si et al., 2013</ref>), mining of public opin- ion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(O'Connor et al., 2010)</ref>, event extraction and summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sakaki et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Thelwall et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Marchetti-Bowick and Chambers, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Li et al., 2014a</ref>), user profil- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Han et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhou et al., 2014</ref>), disaster man- agement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Varga et al., 2013)</ref>, and extraction of common-sense knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Williams and Katz, 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Semantic analysis for nouns</head><p>Our work can be considered as a semantic anal- ysis that identifies an argument (subject) for a disease/symptom-related noun. NomBank <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Meyers et al., 2004</ref>) provides annotations of noun ar- guments in a similar manner to <ref type="bibr">PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)</ref>, which provides annotations of verbs. In NomBank, nominal predicates and their argu- ments are identified: for example, ARG0 (typi- cally, subject or agent) is "customer" and ARG1 (typically, objects, patients, themes) is "issue" for the nominal predicate "complaints" in the sen- tence "There have been no customer complaints about that issue." <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gerber and Chai (2010)</ref> im- proved the coverage of NomBank by handling im- plicit arguments. Some studies have addressed the task of identifying implicit and omitted arguments for nominal predicates in Japanese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Komachi et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sasano et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Our work shares a similar goal with the above- mentioned studies, i.e., identifying an implicit ARG0 for a disease and symptom. However, these studies do not regard a disease/symptom as a nom- inal predicate because they consider verb nom- inalizations as nominal predicates. In addition, they use a corpus that consists of newswire text, the writing style and word usage of which differ considerably from those of tweets. For these rea- sons, we proposed a novel task setting for identi- fying subjects of diseases and symptoms, and we built an annotated corpus for developing the sub- ject classifier and analyzing the challenges of this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented a novel approach to the identification of subjects of various types of diseases and symptoms. First, we constructed an annotated corpus based on an existing cor- pus for public surveillance. Then, we trained a classifier for predicting the subject of a dis- ease/symptom. The results of our experiments showed that the task of identifying the subjects is independent of the type of disease/symptom. In addition, the results demonstrated the contribu- tions of our work toward identifying an episode of a disease/symptom from a tweet.</p><p>In the future, we plan to consider a greater vari- ety of diseases and symptoms in order to develop applications for public health, e.g., monitoring the mental condition of individuals. Thus, we can not only improve the accuracy of subject identification but also enhance the generality of this task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 shows</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 shows examples of annotations in this study.

classifier measured via five-fold cross validation. 
We used 3,000 tweets corresponding to six types 
of diseases and symptoms for this experiment. The 
Bag-of-Words (BoW) feature achieved micro and 
macro F1 scores of 77.2 and 42.2, respectively. 
When all the features were used, the performance 
was boosted, i.e., micro and macro F1 scores of 
84.0 and 61.8 were achieved. Features such as dis-
ease/symptom keywords, retweet &amp; reply, and the 
lexicon for NEARBYPERSON were particularly ef-
fective in improving the performance.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> This label is positive if someone mentioned in the tweet is in the same prefecture as the poster. This is because the corpus was designed to survey the spread of a disease/symptom in every prefecture. 2 In Japanese tweets, sore throat or throat pain mostly describes the health condition of the poster.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> This ratio may appear to be extremely low, but it is very common to omit first person pronouns in Japanese sentences.</note>
