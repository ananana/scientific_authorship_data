				<p>How we teach and learn is undergoing a revolution, due to changes in technology and connectivity. Education may be one of the best application areas for advanced NLP techniques, and NLP researchers have much to contribute to this problem, especially in the areas of learning to write, mastery learning, and peer learning. In this paper I consider what happens when we convert natural language processors into natural language coaches.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Why Should You Care, NLP</head><p>Researcher?</p><p>There is a revolution in learning underway. Stu- dents are taking Massive Open Online Courses as well as online tutorials and paid online courses. Technology and connectivity makes it possible for students to learn from anywhere in the world, at any time, to fit their schedules. And in today's knowledge-based economy, going to school only in one's early years is no longer enough; in future most people are going to need continuous, life- long education. Students are changing too -they expect to interact with information and technology. For- tunately, pedagogical research shows significant benefits of active learning over passive methods. The modern view of teaching means students work actively in class, talk with peers, and are coached more than graded by their instructors.</p><p>In this new world of education, there is a great need for NLP research to step in and help. I hope in this paper to excite colleagues about the pos- sibilities and suggest a few new ways of looking at them. I do not attempt to cover the field of language and learning comprehensively, nor do I claim there is no work in the field. In fact there is quite a bit, such as a recent special issue on lan- guage learning resources ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sharoff et al., 2014</ref>), the long running ACL workshops on Building Edu- cational Applications using NLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tetreault et al., 2015)</ref>, and a recent shared task competition on grammatical error detection for second language learners ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ng et al., 2014</ref>). But I hope I am cast- ing a few interesting thoughts in this direction for those colleagues who are not focused on this par- ticular topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">How Awkward</head><p>Perhaps the least useful feedback that an instructor writes next to a block of prose on a learner's essay is 'awkward'. We know what this means: some- thing about this text does not read fluently. But this is not helpful feedback; if the student knew how to make the wording flow, he or she would have writ- ten it fluently in the first place! Useful feedback is actionable: it provides steps to take to make im- provements.</p><p>A challenge for the field of NLP is how to build writing tutors or coaches -as opposed to graders or scorers. There is a vast difference between a tool that performs an assessment of writing and one that coaches students to help them as they are attempting to write.</p><p>Current practice uses the output of scorers to give students a target to aim for: revise your essay to get a higher score. An alternative is to design a system that watches alongside a learner as they write an essay, and coaches their work at all levels of construction -phrase level, clause level, sen- tence level, discourse level, paragraph level, and essay level.</p><p>Grammar checking technology has been excel- lent for years now <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Heidorn, 2000</ref>), but instead of just showing the right answer as grammar check- ers do, a grammar coach should give hints and scaffolding the way a tutor would -not giving the answer explicitly, but showing the path and letting the learner fill in the missing information. When the learner makes incorrect choices, the parser can teach principles and lessons for the concep- tual stage that the learner is currently at. Different grammars could be developed for learners at dif- ferent competency levels, as well as for different first-second language pairings in the case of sec- ond language learning.</p><p>This suggests a different approach for building a parser than what is the current standard. I am not claiming that this has not been suggested in the past; for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schwind (1988)</ref> designed a parser to explain errors to learners. However, be- cause of the renewed interest in technology for teaching, this may be a pivotal time to recon- sider how we develop parsing technology: perhaps we should think fundamentally about parsers as coaches rather than parsers as critics.</p><p>This inversion can apply to other aspects of NLP technology as well. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dale and Kilgarriff (2011)</ref> have held a series of workshop to produce algorithms to identify errors introduced into texts by non-native writers in the warmly named "Helping Our Own" shared task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dale et al., 2012)</ref>. Using the technology developed for tasks like these, the challenge is to go beyond rec- ognizing and correcting the errors to helping the writer understand why the choices they are making are not correct. Another option is to target practice questions tailored for learners based on errors in a fun manner (as described below).</p><p>Of course, for decades, the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (VanLehn, 2011) has de- veloped technology for this purpose, so what is new about what I am suggesting? First, we know as NLP researchers that language analysis requires specific technology beyond standard algorithms, and so advances in Intelligent Tutoring Systems on language problems most likely requires col- laboration with experts in NLP. And, apparently such collaborations have not been as robust as they might be <ref type="bibr">(Borin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Meurers, 2012)</ref>. So there is an opportunity for new advances at the intersec- tion of these two fields.</p><p>And second, the newly expanded interest in on- line learning and technology makes possible the access of information about student writing be- havior on a large scale that was not possible in the past. Imagine thousands of students in cas- caded waves, tasked with writing essays on the same topic, and receiving real-time suggestions from different algorithms. The first wave of stu- dent responses to the feedback would be used to improve the algorithms and these results would be fed into the next wave of student work, and so on. Students and instructors could be encouraged to give feedback via the user interface. Very rapid cycles of iteration should lead to accelerated im- provements in understanding of how the interfaces and the algorithms could be improved. A revo- lution in understanding of how to coach student writing could result! Algorithms could be designed to give feedback for partially completed work: partially written sentences in the case of a parser; partially com- pleted paragraphs in the case of a discourse writ- ing tool, and so on, rather than only assessing completed work after the fact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Karaoke Anyone?</head><p>Beyond learning to write, new technology is changing other aspects of language learning in ways that should excite NLP researchers. In or- der to write well, a student must have a good vo- cabulary and must know syntax. Learning words and syntax requires exposure to language in many contexts, both spoken and written, for a student's primary language was well as for learning a sec- ond language.</p><p>Although computerized vocabulary tools have been around for quite some time, the rise of mo- bile, connected applications, the serious games movement, and the idea of "microtasks" which are done during interstices of time while out and about during the day, opens the door to new ways to expose students to repetitive learning tasks for acquiring language <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Edge et al., 2011</ref>). Some of the most innovative approaches for teaching lan- guage combine mobile apps with multimedia in- formation.</p><p>For example, the Tip Tap Tones project (Edge et al., 2012) attempts to help learners reduce the the challenge of mastering a foreign phonetic sys- tem by microtasking with minute-long episodes of mobile gaming. This work focuses in particular on helping learners acquire the tonal sound system of Mandarin Chinese and combines gesture swipes with audio on a smartphone.</p><p>The ToneWars app <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Head et al., 2014</ref>) takes this idea one step farther by linking second lan- guage learners with native speakers in real time to play a Tretis-like game against one another to better learn Chinese pronunciation. The second language learner feels especially motivated when they are able to beat the native speaker, and the native speaker contributes their expert tone record- ings to the database, fine-tunes their understanding of their own language, and enjoys the benefits of tutoring others in a fun context.</p><p>Going beyond phonemes, the DuoLingo second-language learning application <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(von Ahn, 2013</ref>) teaches syntax as well as vocabulary through a game-based interface. For instance, one of Duolingo's games consists of a display of a sentence in one language, and a jumbled list of words in the opposing language presented as cards to be dragged and dropped onto a tray in the correct order to form a sentence. In some cases the user must select between two confounding choices, such as the articles "le" or "la" to modify French nouns.</p><p>Our work on a game for children called Word- Craft takes this idea one step further <ref type="bibr">(Anand et al., 2015</ref>) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Children manipulate word cards to build sentences which, when grammati- cally well formed, come to life in a storybook-like animated world to illustrate their meaning. Pre- liminary studies of the use of Wordcraft found that children between the ages of 4 and 8 were able to observe how different sentence constructions re- sulted in different meanings and encouraged chil- dren to engage in metalinguistic discourse, espe- cially when playing the game with another child.</p><p>A karaoke-style video simulation is used by the Engkoo system to teach English to Chinese speak- ers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang et al., 2012</ref>). The interface not only generates audio for the English words, but also shows the lip and facial shapes necessary for form- ing English words using a 3D simulated model lip- syncing the words in a highly realistic manner. To generate a large number of sample sentences, the text was drawn from bilingual sentence pairs from the web.</p><p>These technologies have only become feasible recently because of the combination of multime- dia, fast audio and image processing, fast network connectivity, and a connected population. NLP re- searchers may want to let their imaginations con- sider the possibilities that arise from this new and potent combination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Closing the Cheese Gap</head><p>Salman Kahn, the creator of Kahn Academy, talks about the "Swiss cheese" model of learning in which students learn something only partly before they are forced to move on to the next topic, build- ing knowledge on a foundation filled with holes, like the cheese of the same name <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Khan, 2012)</ref>. This is akin to learning to ride a bicycle without perfecting the balancing part. In standard school- ing, students are made to move one from one les- son to the next even if they only got 70, 80, 90% correct on the test. By contrast, mastery learn- ing requires a deep understanding, working with knowledge and probing it from every angle, try- ing out the ideas and applying them to solve real problems.</p><p>In many cases, mastery learning also requires practicing with dozens, hundreds, or even thou- sands of different examples, and getting feedback on those examples. Automation can help with mastery learning by generating personalized prac- tice examples that challenge and interest students. Automatically generated examples also reduce the cost of creating new questions for instructors who are concerned about answer sharing among stu- dents from previous runs of a course.</p><p>Recently, sophisticated techniques developed in the programming languages field have begun to be applied to automate repetitive and structured tasks in education, including problem generation, solu- tion generation, and feedback generation for com- puter science and logic topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gulwani, 2014)</ref>. Closer to the subject at hand is the automated generation of mathematical word problems that are organized around themes of interest to kids, such as "School of Wizardry" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Polozov et al., 2015)</ref>. The method allows the student to specify personal preferences about the world and charac- ters, and then creates mini "plots" for each word problem by enforcing coherence across the sen- tences using constraints in a logic programming paradigm combined with hand-crafted discourse tropes (constraints on logical graphs) and a natu- ral language generation step. A sample generated word problem is Professor Alice assigns Elliot to make a luck potion. He had to spend 9 hours first reading the recipe in the textbook. He spends several hours brewing 11 por- tions of it. The potion has to be brewed for 3 hours per portion. How many hours did Elliot spend in total?</p><p>Results are close in terms of comprehensibility and solubility to those of a textbook. The project's ultimate goal is to have the word problems actu- ally tell a coherent story, but that challenge is still an open one. But the programs can generate an infinite number of problems with solutions. Other work by the same research team generated person- alized algebraic equation problems in a game en- vironment and showed that students could achieve mastery learning in 90 minutes or less during an organized educational campaign ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Another way that NLP can help with mastery learning is to aid instructors in the providing of feedback on short answer test questions. There has been significant work in this space <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kukich, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirschman et al., 2000</ref>). The standard ap- proach builds on the classic successful model of essay scoring which compares the student's text to model essays using a similarity-based technique such as LSA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Landauer et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009)</ref> or careful authoring of the answer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Leacock and Chodorow, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Recent techniques pair with learning techniques like Inductive Logic Programming with instructor editing to induce logic rules that describe permis- sible answers with high accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Willis, 2015)</ref>. Unfortunately most approaches require quite a large number of students' answers to be marked up manually by the instructor before the feedback is accurate enough to be reliably used for a given question; a recent study found on the order of 500- 800 items per question had to be marked up at minimum in order to obtain acceptable correla- tions with human scorers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Heilman and Madnani, 2015)</ref>. This high initial cost makes the develop- ment of hundreds of practice questions for a given conceptual unit a daunting task for instructors.</p><p>Recent research in Learning at Scale has pro- duced some interesting approaches to improving "feedback at scale." One approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brooks et al., 2014</ref>) uses a variation on hierarchical text cluster- ing in tandem with a custom user interface that al- lows instructors to rapidly view clusters and deter- mine which contain correct answers, incorrect an- swers, and partially correct answers. This greatly speeds up the markup time and allows instructors to assign explanations to a large group of answers with a click of a button.</p><p>An entirely different approach to providing feedback that is becoming heavily used in Massive Open Online Courses is peer feedback, in which students assign grades or give feedback to other students on their work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hicks et al., 2015)</ref>. Re- searchers have studied how to refine the process of peer feedback to train students to produce re- views that come within a grade point of that of in- structors, with the aid of carefully designed rubrics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kulkarni et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>However, to ensure accurate feedback, several peer assessments per assignment are needed in ad- dition to a training exercise, and students some- times complain about workload. To reduce the ef- fort, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kulkarni et al. (2014)</ref> experimented with a workflow that uses machine grading as a first step. After training a machine learning algorithm for a given assignment, assignments are scored by the algorithm. The less confident the algorithm is in its score, the more students are assigned to grade the assignment, but high-confidence assignments may need only one peer grader. This step was found to successfully reduce the amount of feed- back needed to be done with a moderate decrease in grading performance. That said, the algorithm did require the instructors to mark up 500 sam- ple assignments, and there is room for improve- ment in the algorithm in other ways, since only a first pass at NLP techniques was used to date. Nonetheless, mixing machine and peer grading is a promising technique to explore, as it has been found to be useful in other contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nguyen and Litman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kukich, 2000</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Are You a FakeBot?</head><p>Why is the completion rate of MOOCs so low? This question vexes proponents and opponents of MOOCs alike. Counting the window shopping en- rollees of a MOOC who do not complete a course is akin to counting everyone who visits a col- lege campus as a failed graduate of that univer- sity; many people are just checking the course out <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jordan, 2014)</ref>. That said, although the anytime, anywhere aspect of online courses works well for many busy professionals who are self-directed, re- search shows that most people need to learn in an environment that includes interacting with other people.</p><p>Learning with others can refer to instructors and tutors, and online tutoring systems have had suc- cess comparable to that of human tutors in some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(VanLehn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aleven et al., 2004</ref>). But another important component of learning with oth- ers refers to learning with other students. Lit- erally hundreds of research papers show that an effective way to help students learn is to have them talk together in small groups, called struc- tured peer learning, collaborative learning, or co- operative learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Johnson et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lord, 1998</ref>). In the classroom, this consists of activities in which students confer in small groups to discuss conceptual questions and to engage in problem- solving. Studies and meta-analyses show the sig- nificant pedagogical benefit of peer learning in- cluding improved critical thinking skills, retention of learned information, interest in subject matter, and class morale <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hake, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Millis and Cottell, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Springer et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Smith et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Deslauriers et al., 2011</ref>). Even studies of intelli- gent tutoring systems find it hard to do better than just having students discuss homework problems in a structured setting online ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kumar et al., 2007)</ref>. The reasons for the success of peer learning in- clude: students are at similar levels of understand- ing that experts can no longer relate to well, people learn material better when they have to explain it to others, and identify the gaps in their current un- derstanding, and the techniques of structured peer learning introduce activities and incentives to help students help one another. S2 I think E is the right answer S1 Hi, I think E is right, too S3 Hi! This seems to be a nurture vs nature question. S3 Can scent be learned, or only at birth? S2 Yeah, but answer A supports the author's conclusion S1 I felt that about A too S2 But the question was, which statement would weaken the author's conclusion S3 So I choose A, showing that scent can be learned at not only AT BIRTH. S2 That's why I think E is right S3 Are you real, or fake? S2 real S1 I didn't think that b or d had anything to do with the statement S3 Actually what you said makes sense. S1 So, do we all agree that E was the correct answer? S2 I think so, yes. S3 But I'm sticking with A since "no other water could stimulate olfactory sites" abd I suggests that other water could be de- tected. S3 *and S1 I thought about c for awhile but it didn't really seem to have anything to do with the topic of scent S3 It has to be A or E. Other ones don't have anything do do with the question. S2 but that "no other water" thing applies equally well to E S3 E is still about spawing ground water, I</p><p>think. this is a confusing question. S1 I thought E contradicted the statement the most S2 me too S3 I loving hits with other mturkers <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Transcript of a conversation among three crowdworkers who discussed the options for a multiple choice question for a GMAT logical rea- soning task. Note the meta-discussion about the prevalence of robots on the crowdsourcing plat- form.</p><p>In our MOOCChat research, we were inter- ested in bringing structured peer learning into the MOOC setting. We first tried out the idea on a crowdsourcing platform ( , showing that when groups of 3 workers discussed challenging problems together, and especially if they were incentivized to help each other arrive at the correct answer, they achieved better results than working alone. (A sample conversation is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.) We also found that provid- ing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and jus- tify their answers leads to further improvements, and combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the corresponding multiple-choice question in a group of 3 leads to significant improvements on that question. Crowd workers also expressed pos- itive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.</p><p>When we tested the synchronous small-group discussions in a live MOOC we found that, for those students that were successfully placed into a group of 3 for discussion, they were quite positive about the experience ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lim et al., 2014</ref>). However, there are significant challenges in getting students to coordinate synchronously in very large low-cost courses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kotturi et al., 2015</ref>).</p><p>There is much NLP research to be done to en- hance the online dialogues that are associated with student discussion text beyond the traditional role of intelligent tutoring systems. One idea is to mon- itor discussions in real time and try to shape the way the group works together <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2013)</ref>. Another idea is to automatically assess if students are discussing content at appro- priate levels on Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Krathwohl, 2002</ref>).</p><p>In our MOOCChat work with triad discussions we observed that more workers will change their answer from an incorrect to a correct one if at least one member of the group starts out correct than if no one is correct initially ). We also noticed that if all group members start out with the same answer -right or wrong -no one is likely to change their answer in any direc- tion. This behavior pattern suggests an interesting idea for large scale online group discussions that are not feasible in in-person environments: dy- namically assign students to groups depending on what their initial answers to questions are, and dy- namically regroup students according to the mis- conceptions and correct conceptions they have. Rather than building an intelligent tutoring sys- tem to prompt students with just the right state- ment at just the right time, a more successful strat- egy might be to mix students with other poeple who for that particular discussion point have the just the right level of conceptual understanding to move the group forward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper I am suggesting inverting the stan- dard mode of our field from that of processing, correcting, identifying, and generating aspects of language to one of recognizing what a person is doing with language: NLP algorithms as coaches rather than critics. I have outlined a number of specific suggestions for research that are currently outside the mainstream of NLP research but which pose challenges that I think some of my colleagues will find interesting. Among these are text ana- lyzers that explain what is wrong with an essay at the clause, sentence, discourse level as the student writes it, promoting mastery learning by generat- ing unlimited practice problems, with answers, in a form that makes practice fun, and using NLP to improve the manner in which peers learning takes place online. The field of learning and education is being disrupted, and NLP researchers should be helping push the frontiers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Wordcraft user interface showing a farm scene with four characters, a fully formed sentence, the word tray with candidate additional words colored by part of speech, and tool bar.
