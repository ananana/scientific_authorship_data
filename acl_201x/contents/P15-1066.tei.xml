				<p>In this paper we present a formal computational framework for modeling manipulation actions. The introduced formalism leads to semantics of manipulation action and has applications to both observing and understanding human manipulation actions as well as executing them with a robotic mechanism (e.g. a humanoid robot). It is based on a Combinatory Categorial Grammar. The goal of the introduced framework is to: (1) represent manipulation actions with both syntax and semantic parts, where the semantic part employs λ-calculus; (2) enable a probabilis-tic semantic parsing schema to learn the lambda-calculus representation of manipulation action from an annotated action corpus of videos; (3) use (1) and (2) to develop a system that visually observes manipulation actions and understands their meaning while it can reason beyond observations using propositional logic and axiom schemata. The experiments conducted on a public available large manipulation action dataset validate the theoretical framework and our implementation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Autonomous robots will need to learn the actions that humans perform. They will need to recognize these actions when they see them and they will need to perform these actions themselves. This re- quires a formal system to represent the action se- mantics. This representation needs to store the se- mantic information about the actions, be encoded in a machine readable language, and inherently be in a programmable fashion in order to enable rea- soning beyond observation. A formal represen- tation of this kind has a variety of other appli- cations such as intelligent manufacturing, human robot collaboration, action planning and policy <ref type="bibr">design, etc.</ref> In this paper, we are concerned with manipula- tion actions, that is actions performed by agents (humans or robots) on objects, resulting in some physical change of the object. However most of the current AI systems require manually defined semantic rules. In this work, we propose a com- putational linguistics framework, which is based on probabilistic semantic parsing with Combina- tory Categorial Grammar (CCG), to learn manip- ulation action semantics (lexicon entries) from an- notations. We later show that this learned lexicon is able to make our system reason about manipu- lation action goals beyond just observation. Thus the intelligent system can not only imitate human movements, but also imitate action goals.</p><p>Understanding actions by observation and exe- cuting them are generally considered as dual prob- lems for intelligent agents. The sensori-motor bridge connecting the two tasks is essential, and a great amount of attention in AI, Robotics as well as Neurophysiology has been devoted to investi- gating it. Experiments conducted on primates have discovered that certain neurons, the so-called mir- ror neurons, fire during both observation and ex- ecution of identical manipulation tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rizzolatti et al., 2001</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gazzola et al., 2007)</ref>. This suggests that the same process is involved in both the obser- vation and execution of actions. From a function- alist point of view, such a process should be able to first build up a semantic structure from obser- vations, and then the decomposition of that same structure should occur when the intelligent agent executes commands.</p><p>Additionally, studies in linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Steedman, 2002)</ref> suggest that the language faculty develops in humans as a direct adaptation of a more primi- tive apparatus for planning goal-directed action in the world by composing affordances of tools and consequences of actions. It is this more primitive apparatus that is our major interest in this paper. Such an apparatus is composed of a "syntax part" and a "semantic part". In the syntax part, every lin- guistic element is categorized as either a function or a basic type, and is associated with a syntactic category which either identifies it as a function or a basic type. In the semantic part, a semantic trans- lation is attached following the syntactic category explicitly.</p><p>Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) intro- duced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Steedman, 2000</ref>) is a theory that can be used to represent such structures with a small set of combinators such as functional application and type-raising. What do we gain though from such a formal description of action? This is simi- lar to asking what one gains from a formal descrip- tion of language as a generative system. Chom- skys contribution to language research was exactly this: the formal description of language through the formulation of the Generative and Transforma- tional Grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chomsky, 1957)</ref>. It revolution- ized language research opening up new roads for the computational analysis of language, provid- ing researchers with common, generative language structures and syntactic operations, on which lan- guage analysis tools were built. A grammar for action would contribute to providing a common framework of the syntax and semantics of action, so that basic tools for action understanding can be built, tools that researchers can use when develop- ing action interpretation systems, without having to start development from scratch. The same tools can be used by robots to execute actions.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an approach for learn- ing the semantic meaning of manipulation action through a probabilistic semantic parsing frame- work based on CCG theory. For example, we want to learn from an annotated training action corpus that the action "Cut" is a function which has two arguments: a subject and a patient. Also, the ac- tion consequence of "Cut" is a separation of the patient. Using formal logic representation, our system will learn the semantic representations of "Cut":</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Cut :=(AP \N P )/N P : λx.λy.cut(x, y) → divided(y)</formula><p>Here cut(x, y) is a primitive function. We will fur- ther introduce the representation in Sec. 3. Since our action representation is in a common calculus form, it enables naturally further logical reasoning beyond visual observation.</p><p>The advantage of our approach is twofold: 1) Learning semantic representations from annota- tions helps an intelligent agent to enrich automat- ically its own knowledge about actions; 2) The formal logic representation of the action could be used to infer the object-wise consequence after a certain manipulation, and can also be used to plan a set of actions to reach a certain action goal. We further validate our approach on a large publicly available manipulation action dataset (MANIAC) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aksoy et al., 2014</ref>), achieving promising ex- perimental results. Moreover, we believe that our work, even though it only considers the domain of manipulation actions, is also a promising example of a more closely intertwined computer vision and computational linguistics system. The diagram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref> depicts the framework of the system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Works</head><p>Reasoning beyond appearance: The very small number of works in computer vision, which aim to reason beyond appearance models, are also related to this paper. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Xie et al., 2013)</ref> proposed that be- yond state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, we could possibly infer implicit information (such as functional objects) from video, and they call them "Dark Matter" and "Dark Energy". ( ) used stochastic tracking and graph- cut based segmentation to infer manipulation con- sequences beyond appearance. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Joo et al., 2014</ref>) used a ranking SVM to predict the persuasive mo- tivation (or the intention) of the photographer who captured an image. More recently, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pirsiavash et al., 2014</ref>) seeks to infer the motivation of the per- son in the image by mining knowledge stored in a large corpus using natural language processing techniques. Different from these fairly general in- vestigations about reasoning beyond appearance, our paper seeks to learn manipulation actions se- mantics in logic forms through CCG, and further infer hidden action consequences beyond appear- ance through reasoning.</p><p>Action Recognition and Understanding: Hu- man activity recognition and understanding has been studied heavily in Computer Vision recently, and there is a large range of applications for this work in areas like human-computer interactions, biometrics, and video surveillance. Both visual recognition methods, and the non-visual descrip- tion methods using motion capture systems have been used. A few good surveys of the former can be found in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moeslund et al., 2006</ref>) and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Turaga et al., 2008</ref>). Most of the focus has been on recog- nizing single human actions like walking, jump- ing, or running etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ben-Arie et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yilmaz and Shah, 2005</ref>). Approaches to more complex ac- tions have employed parametric approaches, such as HMMs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kale et al., 2004</ref>) to learn the transi- tion between feature representations in individual frames e.g. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Saisan et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chaudhry et al., 2009</ref>). More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aksoy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aksoy et al., 2014</ref>) proposed a semantic event chain (SEC) representation to model and learn the se- mantic segment-wise relationship transition from spatial-temporal video segmentation.</p><p>There also have been many syntactic ap- proaches to human activity recognition which used the concept of context-free grammars, because such grammars provide a sound theoretical basis for modeling structured processes. Tracing back to the middle 90's, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brand, 1996)</ref> used a grammar to recognize disassembly tasks that contain hand manipulations. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ryoo and Aggarwal, 2006</ref>) used the context-free grammar formalism to recognize composite human activities and multi-person in- teractions. It is a two level hierarchical approach where the lower-levels are composed of HMMs and Bayesian Networks while the higher-level in- teractions are modeled by CFGs. To deal with errors from low-level processes such as tracking, stochastic grammars such as stochastic CFGs were also used <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ivanov and Bobick, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moore and Essa, 2002</ref>). More recently, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kuehne et al., 2014)</ref> proposed to model goal-directed human activi- ties using Hidden Markov Models and treat sub- actions just like words in speech. These works proved that grammar based approaches are prac- tical in activity recognition systems, and shed insight onto human manipulation action under- standing. However, as mentioned, thinking about manipulation actions solely from the viewpoint of recognition has obvious limitations. In this work we adopt principles from CFG based activ- ity recognition systems, with extensions to a CCG grammar that accommodates not only the hierar- chical structure of human activity but also action semantics representations. It enables the system to serve as the core parsing engine for both ma- nipulation action recognition and execution.</p><p>Manipulation Action Grammar: As men- tioned before, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chomsky, 1993)</ref> suggested that a minimalist generative grammar, similar to the one of human language, also exists for action under- standing and execution. The works closest related to this paper are ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pastra and Aloimonos, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Summers-Stay et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Guha et al., 2013)</ref>. (Pastra and Aloimonos, 2012) first discussed a Chomskyan grammar for understanding complex actions as a theoretical concept, and <ref type="bibr">(SummersStay et al., 2013</ref>) provided an implementation of such a grammar using as perceptual input only objects. More recently, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yang et al., 2014</ref>) pro- posed a set of context-free grammar rules for ma- nipulation action understanding, and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yang et al., 2015</ref>) applied it on unconstrained instructional videos. However, these approaches only con- sider the syntactic structure of manipulation ac- tions without coupling semantic rules using λ ex- pressions, which limits the capability of doing rea- soning and prediction.</p><p>Combinatory Categorial Grammar and Se- mantic Parsing: CCG based semantic parsing originally was used mainly to translate natural language sentences to their desired semantic rep- resentations as λ-calculus formulas <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mooney, 2008)</ref> presented a framework of grounded language acquisition: the interpre- tation of language entities into semantically in- formed structures in the context of perception and actuation. The concept has been applied success- fully in tasks such as robot navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Matuszek et al., 2011</ref>), forklift operation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tellex et al., 2014)</ref> and of human-robot interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Matuszek et al., 2014)</ref>. In this work, instead of grounding natural language sentences directly, we ground informa- tion obtained from visual perception into seman-tically informed structures, specifically in the do- main of manipulation actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A CCG Framework for Manipulation Actions</head><p>Before we dive into the semantic parsing of ma- nipulation actions, a brief introduction to the Com- binatory Categorial Grammar framework in Lin- guistics is necessary. We will only introduce re- lated concepts and formalisms. For a complete background reading, we would like to refer read- ers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Steedman, 2000</ref>). We will first give a brief introduction to CCG and then introduce a fun- damental combinator, i.e., functional application. The introduction is followed by examples to show how the combinator is applied to parse actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Manipulation Action Semantics</head><p>The semantic expression in our representation of manipulation actions uses a typed λ-calculus lan- guage. The formal system has two basic types: entities and functions. Entities in manipulation actions are Objects or Hands, and functions are the Actions. Our lambda-calculus expressions are formed from the following items: Constants: Constants can be either entities or functions. For example, Knife is an entity (i.e., it is of type N) and Cucumber is an entity too (i.e., it is of type N). Cut is an action function that maps entities to entities. When the event Knife Cut Cu- cumber happened, the expression cut(Knife, Cu- cumber) returns an entity of type AP, aka. Action Phrase. Constants like divided are status functions that map entities to truth values. The expression divided(cucumber) returns a true value after the event (Knife Cut Cucumber) happened.</p><p>Logical connectors: The λ-calculus expression has logical connectors like conjunction (∧), dis- junction (∨), negation(¬) and implication(→).</p><p>For example, the expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">connected(tomato, cucumber)∧ divided(tomato) ∧ divided(cucumber)</formula><p>represents the joint status that the sliced tomato merged with the sliced cucumber. It can be regarded as a simplified goal status for "mak- ing a cucumber tomato salad". The expression ¬connected(spoon, bowl) represents the status after the spoon finished stirring the bowl.</p><p>λx.cut(x, cucumber) → divided(cucumber) represents that if the cucumber is cut by x, then the status of the cucumber is divided.</p><p>λ expressions: lambda expressions represent functions with unknown arguments. For example, λx.cut(knif e, x) is a function from entities to en- tities, which is of type NP after any entities of type N that is cut by knife.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Combinatory Categorial Grammar</head><p>The semantic parsing formalism underlying our framework for manipulation actions is that of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Steedman, 2000)</ref>. A CCG specifies one or more logi- cal forms for each element or combination of ele- ments for manipulation actions. In our formalism, an element of Action is associated with a syntac- tic "category" which identifies it as functions, and specifies the type and directionality of their argu- ments and the type of their result. For example, ac- tion "Cut" is a function from patient object phrase (NP) on the right into predicates, and into func- tions from subject object phrase (NP) on the left into a sub action phrase (AP):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Cut := (AP \N P )/N P.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>As a matter of fact, the pure categorial gram- mar is a conext-free grammar presented in the ac- cepting, rather than the producing direction. The expression (1) is just an accepting form for Ac- tion "Cut" following the context-free grammar. While it is now convenient to write derivations as follows, they are equivalent to conventional tree structure derivations in <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref>  The semantic type is encoded in these cate- gories, and their translation can be made explicit in an expanded notation. Basically a λ-calculus expression is attached with the syntactic category. A colon operator is used to separate syntactical and semantic expressions, and the right side of the colon is assumed to have lower precedence than the left side of the colon. Which is intuitive as any explanation of manipulation actions should first obey syntactical rules, then semantic rules. Now the basic element, Action "Cut", can be further represented by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Cut :=(AP \N P )/N P : λx.λy.cut(x, y) → divided(y).</formula><p>(AP \N P )/N P denotes a phrase of type AP , which requires an element of type N P to specify what object was cut, and requires another element of type N P to further complement what effector initiates the cut action. λx.λy.cut(x, y) is the λ- calculus representation for this function. Since the functions are closely related to the state update, → divided(y) further points out the status expres- sion after the action was performed.</p><p>A CCG system has a set of combinatory rules which describe how adjacent syntatic categories in a string can be recursively combined. In the setting of manipulation actions, we want to point out that similar combinatory rules are also appli- cable. Especially the functional application rules are essential in our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Functional application</head><p>The functional application rules with semantics can be expressed in the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A/B : f B : g =&gt; A : f (g) (2) B : g A\B : f =&gt; A : f (g)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Rule. (2) says that a string with type A/B can be combined with a right-adjacent string of type B to form a new string of type A. At the same time, it also specifies how the semantics of the category A can be compositionally built out of the semantics for A/B and B. Rule. (3) is a symmetric form of Rule. (2). In the domain of manipulation actions, follow- ing derivation is an example CCG parse. This parse shows how the system can parse an ob- servation ("Knife Cut Cucumber") into a se- mantic representation (cut(knif e, cucumber) → divided(cucumber)) using the functional appli- cation rules.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Knife Cut Cucumber N N NP (AP \NP )/NP NP knife λx .λy.cut(x , y) cucumber knife → divided (y) cucumber &gt; AP \NP λx .cut(x , cucumber ) → divided (cucumber ) &lt; AP cut(knife, cucumber ) → divided (cucumber )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Learning Model and Semantic Parsing</head><p>After having defined the formalism and applica- tion rule, instead of manually writing down all the possible CCG representations for each entity, we would like to apply a learning technique to de- rive them from the paired training corpus. Here we adopt the learning model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005)</ref>, and use it to assign weights to the semantic representation of actions. Since an ac- tion may have multiple possible syntactic and se- mantic representations assigned to it, we use the probabilistic model to assign weights to these rep- resentations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Learning Approach</head><p>First we assume that complete syntactic parses of the observed action are available, and in fact a ma- nipulation action can have several different parses. The parsing uses a probabilistic combinatorial cat- egorial grammar framework similar to the one given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007</ref>). We as- sume a probabilistic categorial grammar (PCCG) based on a log linear model. M denotes a manipu- lation task, L denotes the semantic representation of the task, and T denotes its parse tree. The prob- ability of a particular syntactic and semantic parse is given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P (L, T |M ; Θ) = e f (L,T,M )·Θ (L,T ) e f (L,T,M )·Θ (4)</formula><p>where f is a mapping of the triple (L, T, M ) to feature vectors ∈ R d , and the Θ ∈ R d represents the weights to be learned. Here we use only lexi- cal features, where each feature counts the number of times a lexical entry is used in T . Parsing a ma- nipulation task under PCCG equates to finding L such that P (L|M ; Θ) is maximized:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">argmax L P (L|M ; Θ) = argmax L T P (L, T |M ; Θ).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We use dynamic programming techniques to calculate the most probable parse for the manipu- lation task. In this paper, the implementation from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baral et al., 2011</ref>) is adopted, where an inverse-λ technique is used to generalize new semantic rep- resentations. The generalization of lexicon rules are essential for our system to deal with unknown actions presented during the testing phase.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Manipulation Action (MANIAC) Dataset</head><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aksoy et al., 2014</ref>) provides a manipulation ac- tion dataset with 8 different manipulation actions (cutting, chopping, stirring, putting, taking, hid- ing, uncovering, and pushing), each of which con- sists of 15 different versions performed by 5 dif- ferent human actors <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . There are in total 30 differ- ent objects manipulated in all demonstrations. All manipulations were recorded with the Microsoft Kinect sensor and serve as training data here.</p><p>The MANIAC data set contains another 20 long and complex chained manipulation sequences (e.g. "making a sandwich") which consist of a to- tal of 103 different versions of these 8 manipula- tion tasks performed in different orders with novel objects under different circumstances. These serve as testing data for our experiments.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aksoy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aksoy and Wörgötter, 2015</ref>) developed a semantic event chain based model free decomposition approach. It is an un- supervised probabilistic method that measures the frequency of the changes in the spatial relations embedded in event chains, in order to extract the subject and patient visual segments. It also decom- poses the long chained complex testing actions into their primitive action components according to the spatio-temporal relations of the manipula- tor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Training Corpus</head><p>We first created a training corpus by annotating the 120 training clips from the MANIAC dataset, in the format of observed triplets (subject action patient) and a corresponding semantic representa- tion of the action as well as its consequence. The semantic representations in λ-calculus format are given by human annotators after watching each ac- tion clip. A set of sample training pairs are given in <ref type="table">Table.</ref>1 (one from each action category in the training set). Since every training clip contains one single full execution of each manipulation ac- tion considered, the training corpus thus has a total of 120 paired training samples.  We also assume the system knows that every "object" involved in the corpus is an entity of its own type, for example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Knif e := N : knif e Bowl := N : bowl ......</formula><p>Additionally, we assume the syntactic form of each "action" has a main type (AP \N P )/N P (see Sec. 3.2).

Briefly speaking, the event chain representation (Aksoy et al., 2011) of the observed long manipulation activity is first scanned to esti- mate the main manipulator, i.e. the hand, and ma- nipulated objects, e.g. knife, in the scene without employing any visual feature-based object recog- nition method. Solely based on the interactions between the hand and manipulated objects in the scene, the event chain is partitioned into chunks. These chunks are further fragmented into sub- units to detect parallel action streams. Each parsed Semantic Event Chain (SEC) chunk is then com- pared with the model SECs in the library to decide whether the current SEC sample belongs to one of the known manipulation models or represents a novel manipulation. SEC models, stored in the li- brary, are learned in an on-line unsupervised fash- ion using the semantics of manipulations derived from a given set of training data in order to create a large vocabulary of single atomic manipulations.</p><p>For the different testing sequence, the number of triplets detected ranges from two to seven. In to- tal, we are able to collect 90 testing detections and they serve as the testing corpus. However, since many of the objects used in the testing data are not present in the training set, an object model-free ap- proach is adopted and thus "subject" and "patient" fields are filled with segment IDs instead of a spe- cific object name. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3 and 4</ref> show several ex- amples of the detected triplets accompanied with a set of key frames from the testing sequences. Nev- ertheless, the method we used here can 1) gener- alize the unknown segments into the category of object entities and 2) generalize the unknown ac- tions (those that do not exist in the training corpus) into the category of action function. This is done by automatically generalizing the following two types of lexicon entries using the inverse-λ tech- nique from (Baral et al., 2011):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Object [ID] :=N : object [ID]</formula><p>U nknown :=(AP \N P )/N P : λx.λy.unknown(x, y)</p><p>Among the 90 detected triplets, using the learned lexicon we are able to parse all of them into semantic representations. Here we pick the representation with the highest probability after parsing as the individual action semantic represen- tation. The "parsed semantics" rows of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3 and  4</ref> show several example action semantics on test- ing sequences. Taking the fourth sub-action from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> as an example, the visually detected triplets based on segmentation and spatial decomposition is (Object 014, Chopping, Object 011). Af- ter semantic parsing, the system predicts that divided(Object 011). The complete training cor- pus and parsed results of the testing set will be made publicly available for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Reasoning Beyond Observations</head><p>As mentioned before, because of the use of λ- calculus for representing action semantics, the ob- tained data can naturally be used to do logical rea- soning beyond observations. This by itself is a very interesting research topic and it is beyond this paper's scope. However by applying a couple of common sense Axioms on the testing data, we can provide some flavor of this idea.</p><p>Case study one: See the "final action conse- quence and reasoning" row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> for case one. Using propositional logic and axiom schema, we can represent the common sense statement ("if an object x is contained in object y, and object z is on top of object y, then object z is on top of object x") as follows:   <ref type="bibr">and Wörgötter, 2015</ref>) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Axiom (1):</head><p>∃x, y, z, contained(y, x) ∧ on top(z, y) → on top(z, x).</p><p>Then it is trivial to deduce an additional fi- nal action consequence in this scenario that (on top(object 007, object 009)). This matches the fact: the yellow box which is put on top of the red bucket is also on top of the black ball.</p><p>Case study two: See the "final action conse- quence and reasoning" row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> for a more complicated case. Using propositional logic and axiom schema, we can represent three common sense statements: 1) "if an object y is contained in object x, and object z is contained in object y, then object z is contained in object x";</p><p>2) "if an object x is contained in object y, and object y is divided, then object x is divided";</p><p>3) "if an object x is contained in object y, and object y is on top of object z, then object x is on top of object z" as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Axiom (2): ∃x, y, z, contained(y, x) ∧ contained(z, y) → contained(z, x). Axiom (3): ∃x, y, contained(y, x) ∧ divided(y) → divided(x).</formula><p>Axiom (4): ∃x, y, z, contained(y, x) ∧ on top(y, z) → on top(x, z).</p><p>With these common sense Axioms, the system is able to deduce several additional final action consequences in this scenario: divided(object 005) ∧ divided(object 010) ∧ on top(object 005, object 012) ∧ on top(object 010, object 012).</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>, we can see that these additional consequences indeed match the facts: 1) the bread and cheese which are covered by ham are also di- vided, even though from observation the system only detected the ham being cut; 2) the divided bread and cheese are also on top of the plate, even though from observation the system only detected the ham being put on top of the plate.</p><p>We applied the four Axioms on the 20 testing action sequences and deduced the "hidden" conse- quences from observation. To evaluate our system performance quantitatively, we first annotated all the final action consequences (both obvious and "hidden" ones) from the 20 testing sequences as ground-truth facts. In total there are 122 conse- quences annotated. Using perception only <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aksoy and Wörgötter, 2015)</ref>, due to the decomposition errors (such as the red font ones in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>) the sys- tem can detect 91 consequences correctly, yielding a 74% correct rate. After applying the four Ax- ioms and reasoning, our system is able to detect 105 consequences correctly, yielding a 86% cor- rect rate. Overall, this is a 15.4% of improvement.</p><p>Here we want to mention a caveat: there are def- initely other common sense Axioms that we are not able to address in the current implementation. However, from the case studies presented, we can see that using the presented formal framework, our system is able to reason about manipulation action goals instead of just observing what is happening visually. This capability is essential for intelligent agents to imitate action goals from observation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we presented a formal computa- tional framework for modeling manipulation ac- tions based on a Combinatory Categorial Gram- mar. An empirical study on a large manipula- tion action dataset validates that 1) with the intro- duced formalism, a learning system can be devised to deduce the semantic meaning of manipulation actions in λ-schema; 2) with the learned schema and several common sense Axioms, our system is able to reason beyond just observation and deduce "hidden" action consequences, yielding a decent performance improvement.</p><p>Due to the limitation of current testing scenar- ios, we conducted experiments only considering a relatively small set of seed lexicon rules and log- ical expressions. Nevertheless, we want to men- tion that the presented CCG framework can also be extended to learn the formal logic representa- tion of more complex manipulation action seman- tics. For example, the temporal order of manipula- tion actions can be modeled by considering a seed rule such as AP \AP : λf.λg.bef ore(f (·), g(·)), where bef ore(·, ·) is a temporal predicate. For actions in this paper we consider seed main type (AP \N P )/N P . For more general manipulation scenarios, based on whether the action is transi- tive or intransitive, the main types of action can be extended to include AP \N P .</p><p>Moreover, the logical expressions can also be extended to include universal quantification ∀ and existential quantification ∃. Thus, manipulation action such as "knife cut every tomato" can be parsed into a representation as ∀x.tomato(x) ∧ cut(knif e, x) → divided(x) (the parse is given in the following chart). Here, the concept "every" has a main type of N P \N P and semantic mean- ing of ∀x.f (x). The same framework can also extended to have other combinatory rules such as composition and type-raising <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Steedman, 2002</ref>). These are parts of the future work along the line of the presented work. The presented computational linguistic frame- work enables an intelligent agent to predict and reason action goals from observation, and thus has many potential applications such as human inten- tion prediction, robot action policy planning, hu- man robot collaboration etc. We believe that our formalism of manipulation actions bridges com- putational linguistics, vision and robotics, and opens further research in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. As the robotics industry is moving towards robots that function safely, effectively and autonomously to perform tasks in real-world un- structured environments, they will need to be able to understand the meaning of actions and acquire human-like common-sense reasoning capabilities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A CCG based semantic parsing framework for manipulation actions.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,307.28,305.24,218.25,159.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
