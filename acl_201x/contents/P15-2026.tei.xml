				<p>Downstream processing of machine translation (MT) output promises to be a solution to improve translation quality, especially when the MT system&apos;s internal decoding process is not accessible. Both rule-based and statistical automatic post-editing (APE) methods have been proposed over the years, but with contrasting results. A missing aspect in previous evaluations is the assessment of different methods: i) under comparable conditions, and ii) on different language pairs featuring variable levels of MT quality. Fo-cusing on statistical APE methods (more portable across languages), we propose the first systematic analysis of two approaches. To understand their potential, we compare them in the same conditions over six language pairs having English as source. Our results evidence consistent improvements on all language pairs, a relation between the extent of the gain and MT output quality, slight but statistically significant performance differences between the two methods, and their possible complementarity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct sys- tematic machine translation (MT) errors. The problem is appealing for several reasons. On one side, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Parton et al. (2012)</ref>, APE systems can improve MT output by exploiting in- formation unavailable to the decoder, or by per- forming deeper text analysis that is too expensive at decoding stage. On the other side, and to our view more importantly, APE represents the only way to recover errors produced in "black-box" conditions in which the MT system is unknown or its internal decoding process is not accessible.</p><p>The task, firstly proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Knight and Chander (1994)</ref> to cope with article selection in Japanese to English translation, has been later ad- dressed in various ways. On one side, rule-based methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rosa et al., 2012</ref>) gained limited atten- tion, probably due to the extensive manual work they involve and their scarce portability across lan- guages. On the other side, the statistical approach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allen and Hogan (2000)</ref> reached ma- turity in the work by  and in- spired a number of further investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dugast et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dugast et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lagarda et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Béchara et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Béchara et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rosa et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lagarda et al., 2014</ref>, inter alia).</p><p>Such prior works address orthogonal aspects like: i) performance variations when APE is ap- plied to correct the output of rule-based vs. statis- tical MT, ii) the use of APE for error correction vs. domain adaptation, iii) the difference between training on general domain vs. domain-specific data, iv) performance variations when learning from reference translations vs. human post-edits. Their common trait is that the reported results are difficult to generalise. Indeed, most of the works focus on evaluating a specific method, 1 which is typically applied to one single dataset for a given language pair. As a result, the global landscape of the "planet of the APEs" is still blurred and open to more systematic explorations.</p><p>To shed light on the potential of statistical post- editing, in this paper we examine two alterna- tive approaches. One is the method proposed in ( , which to date is the most widely used. The other is the "context-aware" so- lution proposed in <ref type="bibr">(Béchara et al., 2011</ref>) which, to the best of our knowledge, represents the most significant variant of .</p><p>The major contribution of our work is the first systematic analysis of different APE approaches, which are tested in controlled conditions over sev- eral language pairs. To ensure the soundness of the analysis, our experimental setup consists of a dataset composed of the same English source sentences with automatic translations into six lan- guages and respective manual post-edits by pro- fessional translators. Overall, this represents the ideal condition to complement prior research with the missing answers to questions like: Q1: Does APE yield consistent MT quality im- provements across different language pairs? Q2: What is the relation between the original MT output quality and the APE results? Q3: Which of the two analysed APE methods has the highest potential?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Statistical APE methods</head><p>The two methods we analyse follow the same "sta- tistical phrase-based post-editing" strategy out- lined by , but differ in the way data is represented. Let's give them a closer look.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Method 1 (Simard et al., 2007)</head><p>The underlying idea is that APE components can be trained in the same way in which statistical MT systems are developed -i.e. starting from "paral- lel data". Since the goal is to transform rough MT output into its correct version, parallel data con- sists of MT output as source texts and correct (hu- man quality) sentences as target. In (  these are used to train a phrase-based MT system, which is then applied to correct the output of a commercial rule-based MT system.</p><p>Positive evaluation results are reported on English-French, and even better ones on French- English data. In both cases, statistical APE yields significant BLEU and TER improvements over the original MT output. However, since training and test data for the two language directions are dif- ferent (in content and size), the measured perfor- mance variations cannot be directly ascribed to the effectiveness of the method in the two settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Method 2 (Béchara et al., 2011)</head><p>One limitation of the "monolingual translation" approach proposed in (  is that the basic statistical APE pipeline is only trained on data in the target language (F), disregarding infor- mation about the source language (E): Correction rules learned from (f , f ) pairs 2 lose the connec- tion between the translated words (or phrases) and the corresponding source terms (e). This implies that information lost or distorted in the translation process is out of the reach of the APE component, and the resulting errors are impossible to recover.</p><p>To cope with this issue, Béchara et al. (2011) propose a "context-aware" variant to represent the data. For each word f , the corresponding source word (or phrase) e is identified through word alignment and used to obtain a joint rep- resentation f #e. The result is an intermediate language F #E that represents the new source side of the parallel data used to train the statis- tical APE component. Though in principle more precise, this method can be affected by two prob- lems. First, preserving the source context comes at the cost of a larger vocabulary size and, con- sequently, higher data sparseness. While the ba- sic statistical APE pipeline combines and exploits the counts of all the co-occurrences of f and f in the parallel data, its context-aware variant con- siders each f #e i as a separate term, thus break- ing down the co-occurrence counts of f and f into smaller numbers. Second, all these counts can be influenced by word alignment errors. To cope with data sparseness and unreliable word align- ment, Béchara et al. (2011) experiment with differ- ent thresholds set on word alignment strengths to filter context information. In particular, they dis- card the (f #e, f ) pairs in which the f #e align- ment score is smaller than the threshold.</p><p>The approach, applied to correct the output of a statistical phrase-based MT system, achieves am- biguous evaluation results. On French-English, significant improvements up to 2 BLEU points are observed both over the baseline (the original MT output) and the basic method of . On English-French, however, perfor- mance slightly drops. Moreover, follow-up exper- iments with the same method (Béchara, 2014) did not confirm these results. In light of these ambigu- ous results and the lack of a systematic compari- son between the two APE methods, our objective is to replicate them 3 for a fair comparison in a con- trolled evaluation setting involving different lan-guage pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Reimplementing the two methods</head><p>To obtain the statistical APE pipeline that repre- sents the backbone of both methods we used a phrase-based Moses system ( . Our training data (see Section 3) consists of (source, MT output, post-edition) triplets for six language pairs having English as source. While Method 1 uses only the last two elements of the triplet, all of them play a role in the context-aware Method 2. Apart from the different data represen- tation, the training process is identical.</p><p>Translation and reordering models were esti- mated following the Moses protocol with default setup using MGIZA++ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gao and Vogel, 2008</ref>) for word alignment. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For language modeling we used the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, 2011) for standard n-gram modeling with an n-gram length of 5. The APE system for each target language was tuned on comparable development sets (see below), op- timizing TER with Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003) using the post-edited sentences as ref- erences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Some lessons learned from prior works on sta- tistical APE methods <ref type="bibr">(Béchara, 2014</ref>) include: i) learning from human post-edits is more effec- tive than learning from (independent) reference translations, ii) learning from (and applying APE to) domain-specific data is more promising than working on general-domain data, iii) correcting the output of rule-based MT systems is easier than improving translations from statistical MT. Our work capitalizes on these findings (we learn from domain-specific post-edited data and apply APE to statistical MT), but fills a gap of previous research: a fair comparative study between different meth- ods in controlled conditions. The key enabling factor is the availability, for the first time, of data consisting of the same source sentences, machine- translated in several languages and post-edited by professional translators.</p><p>Data. We experiment with the Autodesk Post- Editing Data corpus, <ref type="bibr">5</ref>  To guarantee similar experimental conditions in the six language settings, we also train compara- ble target language models from external data (in- deed, the 12.2K post-edits would not be enough to train reliable LMs). We build our LMs from approximately 2.5M translations of the same En- glish sentences collected from Europarl ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Koehn, 2005</ref>), DGT-Translation Memory (Steinberger et al., 2012), JRC Acquis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Steinberger et al., 2006</ref>), OPUS IT (Tiedemann, ) and other Autodesk data common to all languages.</p><p>Evaluation metric. We evaluate the APE meth- ods based on their capability to reduce the distance between the MT output and a correct (fluent and adequate) translation. As a measure of the amount of the editing operations needed for the correction, TER and HTER <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Snover et al., 2006</ref>) fit for our purpose. TER and HTER measure the minimum edit distance between the MT output and its cor-  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Performance of the MT baseline and the APE methods for each language pair. Results for Method 2 marked with the " * " symbol are statistically significant compared to Method 1. rect version. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> This can be either a reference trans- lation created independently from the MT out- put (TER) or a human post-edition obtained by manually correcting the MT output (HTER). For the sake of simplicity, henceforth we will use the term TER to refer to both situations (though, when measuring the distance between the MT output and its human post-edition the actual metric is the HTER).</p><p>Baseline. Similar to all previous works on APE, our baseline is the MT output as is. Hence, base- line scores for each language pair correspond to the TER computed between the original MT out- put (produced by the "black-box" Autodesk in- house system) and the human post-edits. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> lists our results, with language pairs or- dered according to the respective baseline TER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The positive answer to Q1 ("Does APE yield con- sistent improvements to MT output?") is evident: both APE methods consistently improve MT qual- ity on all language pairs. TER reductions range from 3.06 to 5.27 points. Quality improvements are statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05, measured by bootstrap test <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Koehn, 2004</ref>).</p><p>In answer to Q2 ("What is the relation between original MT quality and APE results?"), our con- trolled experiments evidence for the first time in APE research that the higher the MT quality, the higher is the improvement, i.e. percentage of er- ror reduction, yielded by the APE methods. On one side, this interesting result may seem counter- intuitive because a larger room for improvement <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Edit distance is calculated as the number of edits (word insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) divided by the number of words in the correct translation. Lower TER/HTER values indicate better MT quality.</p><p>is expected for sentences of poor quality. On the other side, it reveals that learning from (and cor- recting) noisy data affected by many errors is par- ticularly difficult for statistical APE methods. This finding is violated by En-Fr, for which a reason- ably good MT quality does not induce a gain in performance comparable to language pairs featur- ing similar MT TER (En-It and En-Es). On fur- ther analysis of the data, we notice that all the tar- get languages except French keep a coherent be- haviour with respect to the domain-specific En- glish terms, which are always either preserved (It) or translated (other languages). Instead, French shows an alternation between the two conducts. One example is the English word "workflow", which appears in the French post-editions both as is (21 sentences) and translated into "flux de tra- vail" (34 sentences). In contrast, in the other lan- guage directions all the occurrences of 'workflow" are either translated or kept in English. These fre- quent ambiguities are difficult to manage (espe- cially if the two forms occur a similar number of times in the training data), and might motivate the smaller quality gains observed on En-Fr compared to the other language pairs.</p><p>In answer to Q3 ("Which method has the high- est potential?"), we observe slight TER reduc- tions when moving from Method 1 to its "context- aware" variant. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Although small (from 0.19 to 0.49 TER points), such gains are statistically sig- nificant (p &lt; 0.05), except for En-Fr (p &lt; 0.07). This suggests that linking the MT words to the source terms can help to recover adequacy errors that are out of the reach of Method 1.</p><p>To better understand to what extent the two methods behave differently, we calculated the re- sults of an Oracle system, similar to the one pro-posed by , defined by se- lecting for each test sentence the best post-edit (lower TER) produced by two approaches. As shown in the last column of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, such an ora- cle achieves a significant TER reduction (from 1.8 to 2.78 points) for all the language pairs. We inter- pret such gains as clues of a possible complemen- tarity between the two methods, which is worth to investigate.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 2.2, an advantage of Method 1 is its robust estimation of translation pa- rameters. In contrast, by exploiting contextual in- formation from the source, Method 2 is more pre- cise but potentially affected by data sparsity issues due to its highly increased vocabulary. In an at- tempt to use a less sparse model at the level of word alignment, we trained a SMT system based on the context-aware representation of Method 2 (f #e), but with word alignment computed on the representation of Method 1 (f ). Applying this method to the three language pairs for which the two original methods achieved the lowest TER re- ductions (i.e. En-De, En-Fr and En-Cs) shows that this simple way to combine Methods 1 and 2 is able to produce a TER decrement of 0.75 (42.04) for En-De, 0.60 (38.50) for En-Cs and 0.53 (28.98) for En-Fr. This seems to validate our intuition about the possible complementarity of Methods 1 and 2, suggesting a promising direction for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We explored the "planet of the APEs" in ideal conditions (quantity and quality of data) and with the right equipment (state-of-the-art meth- ods). The data available (the same English sen- tences, machine-translated in six languages and post-edited by professional translators) allowed us to compare for the first time different approaches in a fair setting (our first contribution). The two methods we analysed allowed us to measure con- sistent improvements on all language pairs (TER reductions from 7.3% to 14.7% -second contri- bution), and to observe interesting relations be- tween the extent of the gain and the original MT output quality (the higher the quality, the higher the gain yield by APE -third contribution). This first study represents a good starting point for fu- ture quests. A promising direction to explore is the possible complementarity between the two meth- ods and the room for mutual improvement. Now we just have a glimpse of the path (higher ora- cle results, slight gains with a first combination method -fourth contribution), but positive prelim- inary results confirm its existence.</p><p>To encourage the replication of our exper- iments by other researchers and the reuse of the selected Autodesk data for benchmark- ing purposes in the same setting, the scripts developed in this work have been publicly re- leased.
