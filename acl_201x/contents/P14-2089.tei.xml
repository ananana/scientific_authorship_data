				<p>Word embeddings learned on unlabeled data are a popular tool in semantics, but may not capture the desired semantics. We propose a new learning objective that incorporates both a neural language model objective (Mikolov et al., 2013) and prior knowledge from semantic resources to learn improved lexical semantic embed-dings. We demonstrate that our embed-dings improve over those learned solely on raw text in three settings: language mod-eling, measuring semantic similarity, and predicting human judgements.</p>

Our model builds on word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>), a neural network based language model that learns word embeddings by maximizing the probability of raw text. We extend the objective to include prior knowledge about synonyms from semantic resources; we consider both the Paraphrase Database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013)</ref> and WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fellbaum, 1999)</ref>, which an- notate semantic relatedness between words. The latter was also used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al., 2012</ref>) for training a network for predicting synset relation. The combined objective maximizes both the prob- ability of the raw corpus and encourages embed- dings to capture semantic relations from the re- sources. We demonstrate improvements in our embeddings on three tasks: language modeling, measuring word similarity, and predicting human judgements on word pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Learning Embeddings</head><p>We present a general model for learning word em- beddings that incorporates prior knowledge avail- able for a domain. While in this work we con- sider semantics, our model could incorporate prior knowledge from many types of resources. We be- gin by reviewing the word2vec objective and then present augmentations of the objective for prior knowledge, including different training strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Word2vec</head><p>Word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) is an algorithm for learning embeddings using a neural language model. Embeddings are represented by a set of latent (hidden) variables, and each word is rep- resented by a specific instantiation of these vari- ables. Training learns these representations for each word w t (the tth word in a corpus of size T ) so as to maximize the log likelihood of each token given its context: words within a window sized c:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">max 1 T T t=1 log p w t |w t+c t−c ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where w t+c t−c is the set of words in the window of size c centered at w t (w t excluded).</p><p>Word2vec offers two choices for modeling of Eq. (1): a skip-gram model and a continuous bag- of-words model (cbow). The latter worked better in our experiments so we focus on it in our presen- tation. cbow defines p(w t |w t+c t−c ) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">exp e wt · −c≤j≤c,j =0 e w t+j w exp e w · −c≤j≤c,j =0 e w t+j ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where e w and e w represent the input and output embeddings respectively, i.e., the assignments to the latent variables for word w. While some learn a single representation for each word (e w e w ), our results improved when we used a separate em- bedding for input and output in cbow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Relation Constrained Model</head><p>Suppose we have a resource that indicates rela- tions between words. In the case of semantics, we could have a resource that encodes semantic similarity between words. Based on this resource, we learn embeddings that predict one word from another related word. We define R as a set of rela- tions between two words w and w . R can contain typed relations (e.g., w is related to w through a specific type of semantic relation), and rela- tions can have associated scores indicating their strength. We assume a single relation type of uni- form strength, though it is straightforward to in- clude additional characteristics into the objective.</p><p>Define R w to be the subset of relations in R which involve word w. Our objective maximizes the (log) probability of all relations by summing over all words N in the vocabulary:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 N N i=1 w∈Rw i log p (w|w i ) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">p(w|w i ) = exp e w T e w i / ¯ w exp e ¯ w T e w i</formula><p>takes a form similar to Eq. (2) but without the context: e and e are again the input and output embeddings. For our semantic relations e w and e w are symmetrical, so we use a single embedding. Embeddings are learned such that they are predic- tive of related words in the resource. We call this the Relation Constrained Model (RCM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Joint Model</head><p>The cbow and RCM objectives use separate data for learning. While RCM learns embeddings suited to specific tasks based on knowledge re- sources, cbow learns embeddings for words not in- cluded in the resource but appear in a corpus. We form a joint model through a linear combination of the two (weighted by C):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 T T t=1 log p w t |w t+c t−c + C N N i=1 w∈Rw i log p (w|w i )</formula><p>Based on our initial experiments, RCM uses the output embeddings of cbow. We learn embeddings using stochastic gradient ascent. Updates for the first term for e and e are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">e w − α cbow σ(f (w)) − I [w=wt] · t+c j=t−c e w j e w j − α cbow w σ(f (w)) − I [w=wt] · e w ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ(x) = exp{x}/(1 + exp{x}), I [x] is 1 when x is true, f (w) = e w t+c j=t−c e w j .</formula><p>Second term updates are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">e w − α RCM σ(f (w)) − I [w∈Rw i ] · e w i e w i − α RCM w σ(f (w)) − I [w∈Rw i ] · e w ,</formula><p>where f (w) = e w e w i . We use two learning rates: α cbow and α RCM .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Parameter Estimation</head><p>All three models (cbow, RCM and joint) use the same training scheme based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al. (2013)</ref>. There are several choices to make in pa- rameter estimation; we present the best perform- ing choices used in our results.</p><p>We use noise contrastive estimation (NCE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mnih and Teh, 2012)</ref>, which approximately max- imizes the log probability of the softmax objec- tive (Eq. 2). For each objective (cbow or RCM), we sample 15 words as negative samples for each training instance according to their frequencies in raw texts (i.e. training data of cbow). Suppose w has frequency u(w), then the probability of sam-</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">pling w is p(w) ∝ u(w) 3/4 .</formula><p>We use distributed training, where shared em- beddings are updated by each thread based on training data within the thread, i.e., asynchronous stochastic gradient ascent. For the joint model, we assign threads to the cbow or RCM objective with a balance of 12:1(i.e. C is approximately 1 12 ). We allow the cbow threads to control convergence; training stops when these threads finish process- ing the data. We found this an effective method for balancing the two objectives. We trained each cbow objective using a single pass over the data set (except for those in Section 4.1), which we empir- ically verified was sufficient to ensure stable per- formances on semantic tasks.</p><p>Model pre-training is critical in deep learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bengio et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erhan et al., 2010</ref>). We eval- uate two strategies: random initialization, and pre- training the embeddings. For pre-training, we first learn using cbow with a random initialization. The resulting trained model is then used to initialize the RCM model. This enables the RCM model to benefit from the unlabeled data, but refine the em- beddings constrained by the given relations.</p><p>Finally, we consider a final model for training embeddings that uses a specific training regime. While the joint model balances between fitting the text and learning relations, modeling the text at the expense of the relations may negatively impact the final embeddings for tasks that use the embed- dings outside of the context of word2vec. There- fore, we use the embeddings from a trained joint model to pre-train an RCM model. We call this setting Joint→RCM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>For training cbow we use the New York Times (NYT) 1994-97 subset from Gigaword v5.0 (Parker et al., 2011). We select 1,000 paragraphs each for dev and test data from the December 2010 portion of the NYT. Sentences are tokenized using OpenNLP 1 , yielding 518,103,942 tokens for train- ing, 42,953 tokens for dev and 41,344 for test.</p><p>We consider two resources for training the RCM term: the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013</ref>) and WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fellbaum, 1999</ref>). For each semantic pair extracted from these resources, we add a relation to the RCM objective. Since we use both resources for evaluation, we divide each into train, dev and test.</p><p>PPDB is an automatically extracted dataset con- taining tens of millions of paraphrase pairs, in- cluding words and phrases. We used the "lexi- cal" version of PPDB (no phrases) and filtered to include pairs that contained words found in the 200,000 most frequent words in the NYT corpus, which ensures each word in the relations had sup- port in the text corpus. Next, we removed dupli- cate pairs: if &lt;A,B&gt; occurred in PPDB, we re- moved relations of &lt;B,A&gt;. PPDB is organized 1 https://opennlp.apache.org/</p></div>

Division into these sets is based on an automat- ically derived accuracy metric. Since S contains the most accurate paraphrases, we used these for evaluation. We divided S into a dev set (1582 pairs) and test set (1583 pairs). Training was based on one of the other sets minus relations from S. We created similar splits using WordNet, ex- tracting synonyms using the 100,000 most fre- quent NYT words. We divide the vocabulary into three sets: the most frequent 10,000 words, words with ranks between 10,001-30,000 and 30,001- 100,000. We sample 500 words from each set to construct a dev and test set. For each word we sample one synonym to form a pair. The remain- ing words and their synonyms are used for train- ing. However we did not use the training data be- cause it is too small to affect the results. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>The goal of our experiments is to demonstrate the value of learning semantic embeddings with infor- mation from semantic resources. In each setting, we will compare the word2vec baseline embed- ding trained with cbow against RCM alone, the joint model and Joint→RCM. We consider three evaluation tasks: language modeling, measuring semantic similarity, and predicting human judge- ments on semantic relatedness. In all of our ex- periments, we conducted model development and tuned model parameters (C, α cbow , α RCM , PPDB dataset, etc.) on development data, and evaluate the best performing model on test data. The mod- els are notated as follows: word2vec for the base- line objective (cbow or skip-gram), RCM-r/p and Joint-r/p for random and pre-trained initializations of the RCM and Joint objectives, and Joint→RCM for pre-training RCM with Joint embeddings. Un- less otherwise notes, we train using PPDB XXL. We initially created WordNet training data, but found it too small to affect results. Therefore, we include only RCM results trained on PPDB, but show evaluations on both PPDB and WordNet.   <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: LM evaluation on held out NYT data.</p><p>We trained 200-dimensional embeddings and used output embeddings for measuring similarity. Dur- ing the training of cbow objectives we remove all words with frequencies less than 5, which is the default setting of word2vec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Language Modeling</head><p>Word2vec is fundamentally a language model, which allows us to compute standard evaluation metrics on a held out dataset. After obtaining trained embeddings from any of our objectives, we use the embeddings in the word2vec model to measure perplexity of the test set. Measuring perplexity means computing the exact probability of each word, which requires summation over all words in the vocabulary in the denominator of the softmax. Therefore, we also trained the language models with hierarchical classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) strategy (HS). The averaged perplexi- ties are reported on the NYT test set. While word2vec and joint are trained as lan- guage models, RCM is not. In fact, RCM does not even observe all the words that appear in the train- ing set, so it makes little sense to use the RCM em- beddings directly for language modeling. There- fore, in order to make fair comparison, for every set of trained embeddings, we fix them as input embedding for word2vec, then learn the remain- ing input embeddings (words not in the relations) and all the output embeddings using cbow. Since this involves running cbow on NYT data for 2 it- erations (one iteration for word2vec-training/pre- training/joint-modeling and the other for tuning the language model), we use Joint-r (random ini- tialization) for a fair comparison. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the results for language mod- eling on test data. All of our proposed models improve over the baseline in terms of perplexity when NCE is used for training LMs. When HS is used, the perplexities are greatly improved. How- ever in this situation only the joint models improve the results; and Joint→RCM performs similar to the baseline, although it is not designed for lan- guage modeling. We include the optimal α RCM in the table; while set α cbow = 0.025 (the default setting of word2vec). Even when our goal is to strictly model the raw text corpus, we obtain im- provements by injecting semantic information into the objective. RCM can effectively shift learning to obtain more informative embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Measuring Semantic Similarity</head><p>Our next task is to find semantically related words using the embeddings, evaluating on relations from PPDB and WordNet. For each of the word pairs in the evaluation set &lt;A,B&gt;, we use the co- sine distance between the embeddings to score A with a candidate word B . We use a large sample of candidate words (10k, 30k or 100k) and rank all candidate words for pairs where B appears in the candidates. We then measure the rank of the cor- rect B to compute mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Our goal is to use word A to select word B as the closest matching word from the large set of candidates. Using this strategy, we evaluate the embeddings from all of our objectives and mea- sure which embedding most accurately selected the true correct word. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows MRR results for both PPDB and WordNet dev and test datasets for all models. All of our methods improve over the baselines in nearly every test set result. In nearly every case, Joint→RCM obtained the largest improvements. Clearly, our embeddings are much more effective at capturing semantic similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Human Judgements</head><p>Our final evaluation is to predict human judge- ments of semantic relatedness. We have pairs of words from PPDB scored by annotators on a scale of 1 to 5 for quality of similarity. Our data are the judgements used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ganitkevitch et al. (2013)</ref>, which we filtered to include only those pairs for which we learned embeddings, yielding 868 pairs.</p><p>We assign a score using the dot product between the output embeddings of each word in the pair, then order all 868 pairs according to this score. Using the human judgements, we compute the swapped pairs rate: the ratio between the number of swapped pairs and the number of all pairs. For pair p scored y p by the embeddings and judgedˆyjudgedˆ judgedˆy p by an annotator, the swapped pair rate is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p 1 ,p 2 ∈D I[(y p 1 − y p 2 ) (ˆ y p 2 − ˆ y p 1 ) &lt; 0] p 1 ,p 2 ∈D I[y p 1 = y p 2 ] (4)</formula><p>where I[x] is 1 when x is true.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Model  Dev  Test  Dev  Test  10k  30k  100k  10k  30k  100k  10k  30k  100k  10k  30k</ref>     <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: MRR on PPDB dev data for training on an increasing number of relations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows that all of our models obtain reductions in error as compared to the baseline (cbow), with Joint→RCM obtaining the largest re- duction. This suggests that our embeddings are better suited for semantic tasks, in this case judged by human annotations.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PPDB Dev</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Analysis</head><p>We conclude our experiments with an analysis of modeling choices. First, pre-training RCM models gives significant improvements in both measuring semantic similarity and capturing human judge- ments (compare "p" vs. "r" results.) Second, the number of relations used for RCM training is an important factor. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the effect on dev data of using various numbers of relations. While we see improvements from XL to XXL (5 times as many relations), we get worse results on XXXL, likely because this set contains the lowest quality relations in PPDB. Finally, <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> shows different learning rates α RCM for the RCM objective.</p><p>The baseline word2vec and the joint model have nearly the same averaged running times (2,577s and 2,644s respectively), since they have same number of threads for the CBOW objective and the joint model uses additional threads for the RCM objective. The RCM models are trained with sin- gle thread for 100 epochs. When trained on the PPDB-XXL data, it spends 2,931s on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a new learning objective for neural language models that incorporates prior knowledge contained in resources to improve learned word embeddings. We demonstrated that the Relation Constrained Model can lead to better semantic embeddings by incorporating resources like PPDB, leading to better language modeling, semantic similarity metrics, and predicting hu- man semantic judgements. Our implementation is based on the word2vec package and we made it available for general use 2 .</p><p>We believe that our techniques have implica- tions beyond those considered in this work. We plan to explore the embeddings suitability for other semantics tasks, including the use of re- sources with both typed and scored relations. Ad- ditionally, we see opportunities for jointly learn- ing embeddings across many tasks with many re- sources, and plan to extend our model accordingly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Model</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
