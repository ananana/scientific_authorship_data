				<p>Understanding open-domain text is one of the primary challenges in NLP. Machine comprehension evaluates the sys-tem&apos;s ability to understand text through a series of question-answering tasks on short pieces of text such that the correct answer can be found only in the given text. For this task, we posit that there is a hidden (latent) structure that explains the relation between the question, correct answer, and text. We call this the answer-entailing structure; given the structure, the correct-ness of the answer is evident. Since the structure is latent, it must be inferred. We present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs), and uses what it learns to answer machine comprehension questions on novel texts. We extend this framework to incorporate multi-task learning on the different sub-tasks that are required to perform machine comprehension. Evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows that our framework outperforms various IR and neural-network baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 67.8% (vs. 59.9%, the best previously-published result.)</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Developing an ability to understand natural lan- guage is a long-standing goal in NLP and holds the promise of revolutionizing the way in which peo- ple interact with machines and retrieve informa- tion (e.g., for scientific endeavor). To evaluate this ability, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Richardson et al. (2013)</ref> proposed the task of machine comprehension (MCTest), along with a dataset for evaluation. Machine comprehension evaluates a machine's understanding by posing a series of reading comprehension questions and as- sociated texts, where the answer to each question can be found only in its associated text. Solutions typically focus on some semantic interpretation of the text, possibly with some form of probabilistic or logical inference, in order to answer the ques- tions. Despite significant recent interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Weston et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Weston et al., 2015)</ref>, the problem remains unsolved.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an approach for ma- chine comprehension. Our approach learns latent answer-entailing structures that can help us an- swer questions about a text. The answer-entailing structures in our model are closely related to the inference procedure often used in various mod- els for MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blunsom and Cohn, 2006</ref>), RTE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">MacCartney et al., 2008</ref>), paraphrase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yao et al., 2013b</ref>), QA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yih et al., 2013)</ref>, etc. and correspond to the best (latent) alignment between a hypoth- esis (formed from the question and a candidate answer) with appropriate snippets in the text that are required to answer the question. An example of such an answer-entailing structure is given in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The key difference between the answer- entailing structures considered here and the align- ment structures considered in previous works is that we can align multiple sentences in the text to the hypothesis. The sentences in the text con- sidered for alignment are not restricted to occur contiguously in the text. To allow such a dis- contiguous alignment, we make use of the docu- ment structure; in particular, we take help from rhetorical structure theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mann and Thompson, 1988</ref>) and event and entity coreference links across sentences. Modelling the inference proce- dure via answer-entailing structures is a crude yet effective and computationally inexpensive proxy to model the semantics needed for the problem. Learning these latent structures can also be bene- <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: The answer-entailing structure for an example from MCTest500 dataset. The question and answer candidate are combined to generate a hypothesis sentence. Then latent alignments are found between the hypothesis and the appropriate snippets in the text. The solid red lines show the word alignments from the hypothesis words to the passage words, the dashed black lines show auxiliary co-reference links in the text and the labelled dotted black arrows show the RST relation (elaboration) between the two sentences. Note that the two sentences do not have to be contiguous sentences in the text. We provide some more examples of answer-entailing structures in the supplementary. ficial as they can assist a human in verifying the correctness of the answer, eliminating the need to read a lengthy document.</p><p>The overall model is trained in a max-margin fashion using a latent structural SVM (LSSVM) where the answer-entailing structures are latent. We also extend our LSSVM to multi-task set- tings using a top-level question-type classification. Many QA systems include a question classifica- tion component ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li and Roth, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang and Lee, 2003)</ref>, which typically divides the questions into semantic categories based on the type of the question or answers expected. This helps the sys- tem impose some constraints on the plausible an- swers. Machine comprehension can benefit from such a pre-classification step, not only to constrain plausible answers, but also to allow the system to use different processing strategies for each cate- gory. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Weston et al. (2015)</ref> defined a set of 20 sub-tasks in the machine comprehen- sion setting, each referring to a specific aspect of language understanding and reasoning required to build a machine comprehension system. They in- clude fact chaining, negation, temporal and spatial reasoning, simple induction, deduction and many more. We use this set to learn to classify ques- tions into the various machine comprehension sub- tasks, and show that this task classification fur- ther improves our performance on MCTest. By using the multi-task setting, our learner is able to exploit the commonality among tasks where pos- sible, while having the flexibility to learn task- specific parameters where needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of multi-task learning in a structured prediction model for QA.</p><p>We provide experimental validation for our model on a real-world dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Richardson et al., 2013</ref>) and achieve superior performance vs. a number of IR and neural network baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Problem</head><p>Machine comprehension requires us to answer questions based on unstructured text. We treat this as selecting the best answer from a set of can- didate answers. The candidate answers may be pre-defined, as is the case in multiple-choice ques- tion answering, or may be undefined but restricted (e.g., to yes, no, or any noun phrase in the text). Machine Comprehension as Textual Entail- ment: Let for each question q i ∈ Q, t i be the unstructured text and A i = {a i1 , . . . , a im } be the set of candidate answers to the question. We cast the machine comprehension task as a tex- tual entailment task by converting each question- answer candidate pair (q i , a i,j ) into a hypothe- sis statement h ij . For example, the question "What did Alyssa eat at the restaurant?" and answer candidate "Catfish" in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> can be combined to achieve a hypothesis "Alyssa ate Catfish at the restaurant". We use the question matching/rewriting rules described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cucerzan and Agichtein (2005)</ref> to achieve this transforma- tion. For each question q i , the machine com- prehension task reduces to picking the hypothe- sisˆhsisˆ sisˆh i that has the highest likelihood of being en- tailed by the text among the set of hypotheses h i = {h i1 , . . . , h im } generated for that question. Let h * i ∈ h i be the correct hypothesis. Now let us define the latent answer-entailing structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Latent Answer-Entailing Structures</head><p>The latent answer-entailing structures help the model in providing evidence for the correct hy-pothesis. We consider the quality of a one-to- one word alignment from a hypothesis to snippets in the text as a proxy for the evidence. Hypoth- esis words are aligned to a unique text word in the text or an empty word. For example, in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref>, all words but "at" are aligned to a word in the text. The word "at" can be assumed to be aligned to an empty word and it has no effect on the model. Learning these alignment edges typi- cally helps a model decompose the input and out- put structures into semantic constituents and de- termine which constituents should be compared to each other. These alignments can then be used to generate more effective features.</p><p>The alignment depends on two things: (a) snip- pets in the text to be aligned to the hypothesis and (b) word alignment from the hypothesis to the snippets. We explore three variants of the snippets in the text to be aligned to the hypothesis. The choice of these snippets composed with the word alignment is the resulting hidden structure called an answer-entailing structure. 1. Sentence Alignment: The simplest variant is to find a single sentence in the text that best aligns to the hypothesis. This is the structure considered in a majority of previous works in RTE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">MacCartney et al., 2008</ref>) and QA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yih et al., 2013)</ref> as they only reason on single sentence length texts. 2. Subset Alignment: Here we find a subset of sen- tences from the text (instead of just one sentence) that best aligns with the hypothesis. 3. Subset+ Alignment: This is the same as above except that the best subset is an ordered set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Method</head><p>A natural solution is to treat MCTest as a structured prediction problem of ranking the hypotheses h i such that the correct hypothesis is at the top of this ranking. This induces a constraint on the ranking structure that the correct hypothesis is ranked above the other competing hypotheses. For each text t i and hypotheses set h i , let Y i be the set of possible orderings of the hypotheses. Let y * i ∈ Y i be a correct ranking (such that the correct hypothesis is at the top of this ranking). Let the set of possible answer-entailing structures for each text hypoth- esis pair (t i , h i ) be denoted by Z i . For each text t i , with hypotheses set h i , an ordering of the hypotheses y ∈ Y i , and hidden structure z ∈ Z i. we define a scoring function Score w (t i , h i , z, y) parameterized by a weight vector w such that we have the prediction rule: (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y i , z i ) = arg max y∈Y i ,z∈Z i Score w (t i , h i , z, y).</formula><p>The learning task is to find w such that the predicted ordering y i is close to the optimal ordering y * i . Mathematically this can be written as min w</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 2 w 2 + C i ∆(y * i , z * i , y i , z i ) where z * i = arg max z∈Z i Score w (t i , h i , z, y * i )</formula><p>and ∆ is the loss function between the predicted and the actual ranking and latent structure. We simplify the loss function and assume it to be independent of the hidden structure</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(∆(y * i , z * i , y i , z i ) = ∆(y * i , y i )) and use a lin- ear scoring function: Score w (t i , h i , z, y) = w T φ(t i , h i , z, y)</formula><p>where φ is a feature map dependent on the text t i , the hypothesis set h i , an ordering of answers y and a hidden structure z. We use a convex upper bound of the loss function ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Yu and Joachims, 2009</ref>) to rewrite the objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min w 1 2 w 2 − C i w T φ(t i , h i , z * i , y * i ) (1) +C n i=1 max y∈Y i ,z∈Z i {w T φ(t i , h i , z, y) + ∆(y * i , y)}</formula><p>This problem can be solved using Concave- Convex Programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Yuille and Rangarajan, 2003</ref>) with the cutting plane algorithm for struc- tural SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Finley and Joachims, 2008)</ref>. We use phi partial order <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Joachims, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dubey et al., 2009</ref>) which has been used in previous structural ranking literature to incorporate ranking structure in the feature vector φ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">φ(t i , h i , z, y) = j:h ij =h * i c j (y)(ψ(t i , h * i , z * i ) −ψ(t i , h ij , z j )) (2)</formula><p>where, c j (y) = 1 if h * i is above h ij in the ranking y else −1. We use pair preference ( <ref type="bibr">Chakrabarti et al., 2008)</ref> as the ranking loss ∆(y * i , y). Here, ψ is the feature vector defined for a text, hypothesis and answer-entailing structure. Solution: We substitute the feature map definition (2) into Equation 1, leading to our LSSVM formu- lation. We consider the optimization as an alter- nating minimization problem where we alternate between getting the best z ij and ψ for each text- hypothesis pair given w (inference) and then solv- ing for the weights w given ψ to obtain an opti- mal ordering of the hypothesis (learning). The step for solving for the weights is similar to rankSVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Joachims, 2002</ref>). Algorithm 1 describes our over- all procedure Here, we use beam search for infer- </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">z ij = arg max z w T ψ(t i , h ij , z) ∀i, j 4:</formula><p>Compute ψ for each i, j 5:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C i = ∅ ∀i 6: repeat 7:</formula><p>for i = 1, . . . , n do 8:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r(y) = w T φ(t i , h i , z, y) + ∆(y * i , y) − w T φ(t i , h i , z * i , y * i ) 9: y i = arg max y∈Y i r(y)</formula><p>10:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ξ i = max{0, max y∈U i r(y)} 11:</formula><p>if r( y i ) &gt; ξ i + then 12:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C i = C i ∪ y i</formula><p>Solve : min</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">w,ξ 1 2 w 2 + C i ξ i ∀i, ∀y ∈ C i : w T φ(t i , h i , z * i , y * i ) ≥ w T φ(t i , h i , z, y) + ∆(y * i , y) − ξ i 13:</formula><p>until no change in any C i 14: until Convergence ring the latent structure z ij in step 3. Also, note that in step 3, when the answer-entailing structures are "Subset" or "Subset+", we can always get a higher score by considering a larger subset of sen- tences. To discourage this, we add a penalty on the score proportional to the size of the subset. Multi-task Latent Structured Learning: Ma- chine comprehension is a complex task which of- ten requires us to interpret questions, the kind of answers they seek as well as the kinds of inference required to solve them. Many approaches in QA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moldovan et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ferrucci, 2012)</ref> solve this by having a top-level classifier that categorizes the complex task into a variety of sub-tasks. The sub- tasks can correspond to various categories of ques- tions that can be asked or various facets of text un- derstanding that are required to do well at machine comprehension in its entirety.It is well known that learning a sub-task together with other related sub- tasks leads to a better solution for each sub-task. Hence, we consider learning classifications of the sub-tasks and then using multi-task learning.</p><p>We extend our LSSVM to multi-task settings. Let S be the number of sub-tasks. We assume that the predictor w for each subtask s is par- titioned into two parts: a parameter w 0 that is globally shared across each subtasks and a pa- rameter v s that is locally used to provide for the variations within the particular subtask: w = w 0 + v s . Mathematically we define the scoring function for text t i , hypothesis set h i of the sub- task s to be Score w 0 ,v,s (t i , h i , z, y) = (w 0 + v s ) T φ(t i , h i , z, y). The objective in this case is</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">min w 0 ,v λ 2 w 0 2 + λ 1 S S s=1 v s 2 (3) S s=1 n i=1 max y∈Y i ,z∈Z i {(w 0 + v s ) T φ(t i , h i , z, y) + ∆(y * i , y)} − C i (w 0 + v s ) T φ(t, h i , z * i , y * i )</formula><p>Now, we extend a trick that Evgeniou and Pon- til (2004) used on linear SVM to reformulate this problem into an objective that looks like (1). Such reformulation will help in using algorithm 1 to solve the multi-task problem as well. Lets define a new feature map Φ s , one for each sub-task s using the old feature map φ as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Φ s (t i , h i , z, y) = ( φ(t i , h i , z, y) µ , 0, . . . , 0 s−1 , φ(t i , h i , z, y), 0, . . . , 0 S−s )</formula><p>where µ = Sλ 2 λ 1 and the 0 denotes the zero vector of the same size as φ. Also define our new predictor as w = (</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">√ µw 0 , v 1 , . . . , v S ).</formula><p>Using this formulation we can show that</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">w T Φ s (t i , h i , z, y) = (w 0 + v s ) T φ(t i , h i , z, y)</formula><p>and w 2 = s v s 2 + µw 0 2 . Hence, if we now define the objective (1) but use the new fea- ture map and w then we will get back our multi- task objective (3). Thus we can use the same setup as before for multi-task learning after appropri- ately changing the feature map. We will explore a few definitions of sub-tasks in our experiments. Features: Recall that our features had the form ψ(t, h, z) where the hypothesis h was itself formed from a question q and answer candidate a. Given an answer-entailing structure z, we induce the following features based on word level sim- ilarity of aligned words: (a) Limited word-level surface-form matching and (b) Semantic word form matching: Word similarity for synonymy us- ing SENNA word vectors (Collobert et al., 2011), "Antonymy" 'Class-Inclusion' or 'Is-A' relations using Wordnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>. We compute ad- ditional features of the aforementioned kinds to match named entities and events. We also add features for matching local neighborhood in the aligned structure: features for matching bigrams, trigrams, dependencies, semantic roles, predicate- argument structure as well as features for match- ing global structure: a tree kernel for matching syntactic representations of entire sentences us- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Srivastava and Hovy (2013)</ref> <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>, the coref- erence link connecting the two "restaurant" words brings the snippets "Alyssa enjoyed the" and "had a special on catfish" closer making these features more effective. The answer-entailing structures should be intuitively similar to the question but also the answer. Hence, we add features that are the product of features for the text-question match and text-answer match. String edit Features: In addition to looking for features on exact word/phrase match, we also add features using two paraphrase databases ParaPara (Chan et al., 2011) and DIRT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lin and Pantel, 2001</ref>). The ParaPara database contains strings of the form string 1 → string 2 like "total lack of" → "lack of", "is one of" → "among", etc. Simi- larly, the DIRT database contains paraphrases of the form "If X decreases Y then X reduces Y", "If X causes Y then X affects Y", etc. Whenever we have a substring in the text can be transformed into another using these two databases, we keep match features for the substring with a higher score (ac- cording to w) and ignore the other substring. The sentences with discourse relations are related to each other by means of substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and lexical cohesion, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref> and can help us answer certain kinds of questions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jansen et al., 2014)</ref>. As an ex- ample, the "cause" relation between sentences in the text can often give cues that can help us an- swer "why" or "how" questions. Hence, we add additional features -conjunction of the RST label and the question word -to our feature vector. Sim- ilarly, the entity and event co-reference relations can allows the system to reason about repeating entities or events through all the sentences they get mentioned in. Thus, we add additional features of the aforementioned types by replacing entity men- tions with their first mentions. Subset+ Features: We add an additional set of fea- tures which match the first sentence in the ordered set to the question and the last sentence in the or- dered set to the answer. This helps in the case when a certain portion of the text is targeted by the question but then it must be used in combina- tion with another sentence to answer the question. For instance, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, sentence 2 mentions the target of the question but the answer can only be given when in combination with sentence 1. Negation We empirically found that one key lim- itation in our formulation is its inability to handle negation (both in questions and text). Negation is especially hurtful to our model as it not only results in poor performance on questions that re- quire us to reason with negated facts, it provides our model with a wrong signal (facts usually align well with their negated versions). We use a simple heuristic to overcome the negation problem. We detect negation (either in the hypothesis or a sen- tence in the text snippet aligned to it) using a small set of manually defined rules that test for presence of words such as "not", "n't", etc. Then, we flip the partial order -i.e. the correct hypothesis is now ranked below the other competing hypotheses. For inference at test time, we also invert the prediction rule i.e. we predict the hypothesis (answer) that has the least score under the model.</p><note type="other">. The local and global features can use the RST and coreference links enabling inference across sentences. For in- stance, in the example shown in</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>Datasets: We use two datasets for our evaluation.</p><p>(1) First is the MCTest-500 dataset 1 , a freely available set of 500 stories (split into 300 train, 50 dev and 150 test) and associated questions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Richardson et al., 2013</ref>). The stories are fictional so the answers can be found only in the story it- self. The stories and questions are carefully lim- ited, thereby minimizing the world knowledge re- quired for this task. Yet, the task is challenging for most modern NLP systems. Each story in MCTest has four multiple choice questions, each with four answer choices. Each question has only one cor- rect answer. Furthermore, questions are also anno- tated with 'single' and 'multiple' labels. The ques- tions annotated 'single' only require one sentence in the story to answer them. For 'multiple' ques- tions it should not be possible to find the answer to the question in any individual sentence of the passage. In a sense, the 'multiple' questions are harder than the 'single' questions as they typically require complex lexical analysis, some inference and some form of limited reasoning. Cucerzan- converted questions can also be downloaded from the MCTest website.</p><p>(2) The second dataset is a synthetic dataset released under the bAbI project 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Weston et al., 2015)</ref>. The dataset presents a set of 20 'tasks', each testing a different aspect of text understand- ing and reasoning in the QA setting, and hence can be used to test and compare capabilities of learning models in a fine-grained manner. For each 'task', 1000 questions are used for training and 1000 for testing. The 'tasks' refer to question categories such as questions requiring reasoning over single/two/three supporting facts or two/three arg. relations, yes/no questions, counting ques- tions, etc. Candidate answers are not provided but the answers are typically constrained to a small set: either yes or no or entities already appear- ing in the text, etc. We write simple rules to con- vert the question and answer candidate pairs to hy- potheses. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Baselines: We have five baselines. (1) The first three baselines are inspired from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Richardson et al. (2013)</ref>. The first baseline (called SW) uses a sliding window and matches a bag of words constructed from the question and hypothesized answer to the text. (2) Since this ignores long range dependencies, the second baseline (called SW+D) accounts for intra-word distances as well. As far as we know, SW+D is the best previ- ously published result on this task. 4 (3) The third baseline (called RTE) uses textual entail- ment to answer MCTest questions. For this base- line, MCTest is again re-casted as an RTE task by converting each question-answer pair into a statement (using <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cucerzan and Agichtein (2005)</ref>) and then selecting the answer whose statement has the highest likelihood of being entailed by the 2 https://research.facebook.com/researchers/1543934539189348 3 Note that the bAbI dataset is artificial and not meant for open-domain machine comprehension. It is a toy dataset gen- erated from a simulated world. Due to its restrictive nature, we do not use it directly in evaluating our method vs. other open-domain machine comprehension methods. However, it provides benefit in identifying interesting subtasks of ma- chine comprehension. As will be seen, we are able to lever- age the dataset both to improve our multi-task learning algo- rithm, as well as to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our model. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We also construct two additional baselines (LSTM and QUANTA) for comparison in this paper both of which achieve superior performance to SW+D. story. 5 (4) The fourth baseline (called LSTM) is taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Weston et al. (2015)</ref>. The base- line uses LSTMs <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> to accomplish the task. LSTMs have re- cently achieved state-of-the-art results in a vari- ety of tasks due to their ability to model long- term context information as opposed to other neu- ral networks based techniques. <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> The fifth base- line (called QANTA) 6 is taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Iyyer et al. (2014)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">and Roth (2002)</ref>. This classifies questions into dif- ferent semantic classes based on the possible se- mantic types of the answers sought. We call this QAClassification. Finally, we also learn a clas- sifier for the 20 tasks in the Machine Compre- hension gamut described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Weston et al. (2015)</ref>. The classification algorithm (called TaskClassifi- cation) was built on the bAbI training set. It is essentially a Naive-Bayes classifier and uses only simple unigram and bigram features for the ques- tion and answer. The tasks typically correspond to different strategies when looking for an answer in the machine comprehension setting. In our ex- periments we will see that learning these strategies is better than learning the question answer classi- fication which is in turn better than learning the question classification. Results: We compare multiple variants of our LSSVM 8 where we consider a variety of answer- entailing structures and our modification for nega- tion and multi-task LSSVM, where we consider three kinds of task classification strategies against the baselines on the MCTest dataset. We con- sider two evaluation metrics: accuracy (propor- tion of questions correctly answered) and NDCG 4  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>: Comparison of variations of our method against several baselines on the MCTest-500 dataset. The figure shows two statistics, accuracy (on the left) and NDCG4 (on the right) on the test set of MCTest-500. All differences between the baselines and LSSVMs, the improvement due to negation and the improvements due to multi-task learning are significant (p &lt; 0.01) using the two-tailed paired T-test. The exact numbers are available in the supplementary.</p><note type="other">. QANTA too uses a recursive neural net- work for question answering. Task Classification for MultiTask Learning: We consider three alternative task classifications for our experiments. First, we look at question classification. We use a simple question classi- fication based on the question word (what, why, what, etc.). We call this QClassification. Next, we also use a question/answer classification 7 from Li</note><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Järvelin and Kekäläinen, 2002</ref>). Unlike classifi- cation accuracy which evaluates if the prediction is correct or not, NDCG 4 , being a measure of rank- ing quality, evaluates the position of the correct answer in our predicted ranking. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> describes the comparison on MCTest. We can observe that all the LSSVM models have a better performance than all the five baselines (including LSTMs and RNNs which are state-of- the-art for many other NLP tasks) on both met- rics. Very interestingly, LSSVMs have a consid- erable improvement over the baselines for "mul- tiple" questions. We posit that this is because of our answer-entailing structure alignment strategy which is a weak proxy to the deep semantic in- ference procedure required for machine compre- hension. The RTE baseline achieves the best per- formance on the "single" questions. This is per- haps because the RTE community has almost en- tirely focused on single sentence text hypothesis pairs for a long time. However, RTE fares pretty poorly on the "multiple" questions indicating that of-the-shelf RTE systems cannot perform infer- ence across large texts. Here we observe a clear benefit of using the alignment to the best subset structure over alignment to best sentence structure. We furthermore see improvements when the best subset alignment structure is augmented with the subset+ features. We can observe that the negation heuristic also helps, especially for "single" ques- tions (majority of negation cases in the MCTest dataset are for the "single" questions).</p><p>It is also interesting to see that the multi-task learners show a substantial boost over the sin- gle task SSVM. Also, it can be observed that the multi-task learner greatly benefits if we can learn a separation between the various strategies needed to learn an overarching list of subtasks re- quired to solve the machine comprehension task. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The multi-task method (TaskClassification) which uses the Weston style categorization does better than the multi-task method (QAClassification) that learns the question answer classification. QAClas- sification in turn performs better than multi-task method (QClassification) that learns the question classification only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Strengths and Weaknesses</head><p>A good question to be asked is how good is struc- ture alignment as a proxy to the semantics of the problem? In this section, we attempt to tease out the strengths and limitations of such a structure alignment approach for machine comprehension. To do so, we evaluate our methods on various tasks in the bAbl dataset.For the bAbI dataset, we add additional features inspired from the "task" dis- tinction to handle specific "tasks".</p><p>In our experiments, we observed a similar gen- eral pattern of improvement of LSSVM over the baselines as well as the improvement due to multi- task learning. Again task classification helped the multi-task learner the most and the QA clas- sification helped more than the QClassification. It is interesting here to look at the performance within the sub-tasks. Negation improved the per- formance for three sub-tasks, namely, the tasks of modelling "yes/no questions", "simple nega- tions" and "indefinite knowledge" (the "Indefinite Knowledge" sub-task tests the ability to model statements that describe possibilities rather than certainties). Each of these sub-tasks contain a sig- nificant number of negation cases. Our models do especially well on questions requiring reasoning over one and two supporting facts, two arg. rela- tions, indefinite knowledge, basic and compound coreference and conjunction. Our models achieve lower accuracy better than the baselines on two sub-tasks, namely "path finding" and "agent mo- tivations". Our model along with the baselines do not do too well on the "counting" sub-task, al- though we get slightly better scores. The "count- ing" sub-task (which asks about the number of ob- jects with a certain property) requires the inference to have an ability to perform simple counting op- erations. The "path finding" sub-task requires the inference to reason about the spatial path between locations (e.g. Pittsburgh is located on the west of New York). The "agents motivations" sub-task asks questions such as 'why an agent performs a certain action'. As inference is cheaply mod- elled via alignment structure, we lack the ability to deeply reason about facts or numbers. This is an important challenge for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>The field of QA is quite rich. Most QA evaluations such as TREC have typically focused on short factoid questions. The solutions proposed have ranged from various IR based approaches ( <ref type="bibr">Mittal and Mittal, 2011</ref>) that treat this as a problem of re- trieval from existing knowledge bases and perform some shallow inference to NLP approaches that learn a similarity between the question and a set of candidate answers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Yih et al., 2013)</ref>. A majority of these approaches do not focus on doing any deeper inference. However, the task of machine compre- hension requires an ability to perform inference over paragraph length texts to seek the answer. This is challenging for most IR and NLP tech- niques. In this paper, we presented a strategy for learning answer-entailing structures that helped us perform inference over much longer texts by treat- ing this as a structured input-output problem.</p><p>The approach of treating a problem as one of mapping structured inputs to structured outputs is common across many NLP applications. Exam- ples include word or phrase alignment for bitexts in MT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blunsom and Cohn, 2006</ref>), text-hypothesis alignment in RTE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sammons et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">MacCartney et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yao et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sultan et al., 2014)</ref>, question-answer alignment in QA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yih et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yao and Van Durme, 2014</ref>), etc. Again all of these ap- proaches align local parts of the input to local parts of the output. In this work, we extended the word alignment formalism to align multiple sentences in the text to the hypothesis. We also incorpo- rated the document structure (rhetorical structures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref>) and co-reference to help us perform inference over longer documents.</p><p>QA has had a long history of using pipeline models that extract a limited number of high-level features from induced representations of question- answer pairs, and then built a classifier using some labelled corpora. On the other hand we learnt these structures and performed machine com- prehension jointly through a unified max-margin framework. We note that there exist some recent models such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yih et al. (2013)</ref> that do model QA by automatically defining some kind of alignment between the question and answer snippets and use a similar structured input-output model. However, they are limited to single sentence answers.</p><p>Another advantage of our approach is its sim- ple and elegant extension to multi-task settings. There has been a rich vein of work in multi-task learning for SVMs in the ML community. Evge- niou and Pontil (2004) proposed a multi-task SVM formulation assuming that the multi-task predictor w factorizes as the sum of a shared and a task- specific component. We used the same idea to propose a multi-task variant of Latent Structured SVMs. This allows us to use the single task SVM in the multi-task setting with a different feature mapping. This is much simpler than other compet- ing approaches such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhu et al. (2011)</ref> proposed in the literature for multi-task LSSVM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we addressed the problem of ma- chine comprehension which tests language under- standing through multiple choice question answer- ing tasks. We posed the task as an extension to RTE. Then, we proposed a solution by learning la- tent alignment structures between texts and the hy- potheses in the equivalent RTE setting. The task requires solving a variety of sub-tasks so we ex- tended our technique to a multi-task setting. Our technique showed empirical improvements over various IR and neural network baselines. The la- tent structures while effective are cheap proxies to the reasoning and language understanding re- quired for this task and have their own limitations. We also discuss strengths and limitations of our model in a more fine-grained analysis. In the fu- ture, we plan to use logic-like semantic represen- tations of texts, questions and answers and explore approaches to perform structured inference over richer semantic representations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 also</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 also compares the performance of LSSVM variants when various answer-entailing structures are considered.
