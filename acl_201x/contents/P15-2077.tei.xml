				<p>In this article, we first propose to exploit a new criterion for improving distri-butional thesauri. Following a bootstrap-ping perspective, we select relations between the terms of similar nominal compounds for building in an unsupervised way the training set of a classifier performing the reranking of a thesaurus. Then, we evaluate several ways to combine thesauri reranked according to different criteria and show that exploiting the complementary information brought by these criteria leads to significant improvements.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The work presented in this article aims at im- proving thesauri built following the distributional approach as implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Grefenstette, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Curran and Moens, 2002)</ref>. A part of the work for improving such thesauri focuses on the filtering of the components of the distribu- tional contexts of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Padró et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Polajnar and Clark, 2014</ref>) or their reweighting, ei- ther by turning the weights of these components into ranks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broda et al., 2009</ref>) or by adapting them through a bootstrapping method from the thesaurus to improve <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yamamoto and Asakura, 2010)</ref>. The other part implies more radical changes, includ- ing dimensionality reduction methods such as La- tent Semantic Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Padó and Lapata, 2007)</ref>, multi-prototype <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Reisinger and Mooney, 2010)</ref> or exemplar-based models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Erk and Pado, 2010)</ref>, neural approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> or the adoption of a Bayesian viewpoint ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kazama et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dinu and Lapata, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Our work follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferret, 2012)</ref>, which pro- posed a different way from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2009)</ref> to exploit bootstrapping by se- lecting in an unsupervised way a set of semanti- cally similar words from an initial thesaurus and training from them a classifier to rerank the se- mantic neighbors of the initial thesaurus entries. More precisely, we propose a new criterion for this selection, based on the similarity relations of the components of similar compounds, and we show two modes -early and late -of combination of thesauri reranked from different criteria, including ours, leading to significant further improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Reranking a distributional thesaurus</head><p>Distributional thesauri are characterized by het- erogeneous performance in their entries, even for high frequency entries. This is a favorable situa- tion for implementing a bootstrapping approach in which the results for "good" entries are exploited for improving the results of the other ones. How- ever, such idea faces two problems: first, detect- ing "good" entries; second, learning a model from them for improving the performance of the other entries.</p><p>The first issue consists in selecting without su- pervision a set of positive and negative examples of similar words that represents a good compro- mise between its error rate and its size. Straight- forward solutions such as using the similarity value between an entry and its neighbors or relying on the frequency of entries are not satisfactory in terms of error rate. Hence, we propose in Section 3 a new method, based on the semantic composi- tionality hypothesis of compounds, for achieving this selection in a more indirect way and show the interest to combine it with the criterion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferret, 2012)</ref> for building a large training set with a rea- sonable error rate.</p><p>We address the second issue by following ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hagiwara et al., 2009)</ref>, which defined a Sup- port Vector Machine (SVM) model for deciding whether two words are similar or not. In our con- text, a positive example is a pair of nouns that are semantically similar while a negative example is a pair of non similar nouns. The features of each pair of nouns are built by summing the weights of the elements shared by their distributional repre- sentations, which are vectors of weighted cooccur- rents. Cooccurrents not shared by the two nouns are given a null weight.</p><p>This SVM model is used for improving a the- saurus by reranking its semantic neighbors as fol- lows: for each entry E of the thesaurus, the rep- resentation as an example of the word pair (E, neighbor) is built for each of the neighbors of E and submitted to the SVM model in classification mode. Finally, all the neighbors of E are reranked according to the value of the decision function computed for each neighbor by the SVM model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Unsupervised example selection</head><p>The evaluation of distributional thesauri shows that a true semantic neighbor is more likely to be found when the thesaurus entry is a high frequency noun and the neighbor has a low rank. However, relying only on these two criteria doesn't lead to a good enough set of positive examples. For in- stance, taking as positive examples from the ini- tial thesaurus of Section 4 the first neighbor of its 2,148 most frequent entries, the number of pos- itive examples of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hagiwara et al., 2009)</ref>, only leads to 44.3% of correct examples. Moreover, this percentage exceeds 50% only when the num- ber of examples is less than 654, which represents a very small training set for this kind of task.</p><p>Hence, we propose a more selective approach for choosing positive examples among high fre- quency nouns to get a more balanced solution be- tween the number of examples and their error rate. This approach exploits a form of semantic compo- sitionality hypothesis of compounds. While much work has been done recently for defining the dis- tributional representation of compounds by com- posing the distributional representations of their components <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mitchell and Lapata, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Paperno et al., 2014</ref>), we adopt a kind of reverse viewpoint by exploiting the possibility to link the meaning of a compound to the meaning of its components. More precisely, we assume that the mono-terms of two semantically related compounds with the same syntactic role in their compound are likely to be semantically linked themselves.</p><p>In this work, we only consider compounds hav- ing one of these three term structures (with their percentage of the vocabulary of compounds):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(a) &lt;noun&gt; mod &lt;noun&gt; head (30) (b) &lt;adjective&gt; mod &lt;noun&gt; head (58) (c) &lt;noun&gt; head &lt;preposition&gt;&lt;noun&gt; mod (12)</formula><p>Each compound C i is represented as a pair (H i , M i ), where H i stands for the head of the compound whereas M i represents its modifier (mod). According to the assumption underlying our selection procedure, if a compound (H 2 , M 2 ) is a semantic neighbor of a compound (H 1 , M 1 ) (i.e. at most its c th neighbor in a distributional the- saurus of compounds), we can expect H 1 and H 2 on one hand and M 1 and M 2 on the other hand to be semantically similar. Since distributional the- sauri of compounds are far from being perfect, we added constraints on the matching of the compo- nents of two compounds. More precisely, the posi- tive examples of semantically similar nouns (noun pairs after →) are selected by the three following rules, where H 1 = H 2 means that H 1 is the same word as H 2 and H 1 ≡ H 2 means that H 2 is at most the m th neighbor of H 1 in the initial thesaurus of mono-terms (but is different from H 1 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(1) H 1 ≡ H 2 &amp; M 1 = M 2 → (H 1 , H 2 ) (2) M 1 ≡ M 2 &amp; H 1 = H 2 → (M 1 , M 2 ) (3) M 1 ≡ M 2 &amp; H 1 ≡ H 2 → (H 1 , H 2 ), (M 1 , M 2 )</formula><p>The selection of negative examples is also an important issue but benefits from the fact that the number of semantic neighbors of an entry that are actually semantically linked to this entry in a distributional thesaurus quickly decreases as their rank increase. In the experiments of Section 4, we built negative examples from positive exam- ples by turning each positive example (A,B) into two negative examples: (A, rank 10 A neighbor) and (B, rank 10 B neighbor). Choosing neighbors with a higher rank would have guaranteed fewer false negative examples but taking neighbors with a rather small rank for building negative examples is more useful in terms of discrimination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and evaluation 4.1 Building of distributional thesauri</head><p>The first step of the work we present is the build- ing of two distributional thesauri: the thesaurus of mono-terms to improve (A2ST) and a thesaurus of compounds (A2ST-comp). Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferret, 2012)</ref>, they were both built from the AQUAINT-2 corpus, a 380 million-word corpus of news arti- cles in English. The building procedure, defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferret, 2010)</ref>, was also identical to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferret, 2012)</ref>, with distributional contexts compared with the Cosine measure and made of window-based lemmatized cooccurrents (1 word before and af- ter) weighted by Positive Pointwise Mutual Infor- mation (PPMI). For the thesaurus of compounds, a preprocessing step was added to identify nom- inal compounds in texts. This identification was done in two steps: first, a set of compounds were extracted from the AQUAINT-2 corpus by rely- ing on a restricted set of morpho-syntactic pat- terns applied by the Multiword Expression Toolkit (mwetoolkit) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ramisch et al., 2010)</ref>; then, the most frequent compounds in this set (frequency &gt; 100) were selected as reference and their oc- currences in the AQUAINT-2 corpus were iden- tified by applying the longest-match strategy to the output of the TreeTagger part-of-speech tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schmid, 1994)</ref> 1 . Finally, distributional contexts made of mono-terms and compounds were built as stated above and neighbors were found for 29,174 compounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Example selection</head><p>We applied the three rules of Section 3 with all the entries of our thesaurus of compounds and the upper half in frequency of our mono-term entries. For mono-terms, we only took the first neighbor (m = 1) of each entry because of the rather low performance of the initial thesaurus while for com- pounds, a larger value (c = 3) was chosen for enlarging the number of selected examples since neighbors were globally more reliable (see results of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). As the selection method makes the definition of a development set quite difficult, the values of these two parameters were chosen in a conservative way. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> gives for each rule and two combina- tions of them the number of selected positive ex- amples (#pos. ex.) and the percentage of positive (%good pos.) and negative examples (%bad neg.) found in our Gold Standard resource for thesaurus evaluation. This resource results from the union of the synonyms of WordNet 3.0 and the associated words of the Moby thesaurus. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1 also</ref> gives the same data for examples selected by the method of (Ferret, 2012) (symmetry row, sym. for short), based on the fact that as similarity relations are symmetric, a pair of words (A,B) are more likely to be similar if the first neighbor of A is B and the first neighbor of B is A. The data for the union of the examples produced by the two methods also appear in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Concerning the method we propose, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows that rule (3), which is a priori the least reli- able of the three rules as it only requires similarity and not equality for both heads and modifiers, ac- tually produces a very small set of examples that tends to degrade global results. As a consequence, only the combination of rules <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> is used thereafter (row in bold). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> also suggests that the heads of two semantically linked compounds are more likely to be actually linked themselves if they have the same modifier than the modifiers of two semantically linked compounds having the same head. This confirms our expectation that the head of a compound is more related to the mean- ing of the compound than its modifier. More glob- ally, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows that the symmetry method has higher results than the second one but their associ- ation produces an interesting compromise between the number of examples, 1,710, and its error rate, 45.7. The fact that the two methods only share 201 noun pairs also illustrates their complementarity.</p><note type="other">method %good pos. %bad neg. #pos. ex. symmetry 59.7 12.4 796 (1) 56.9 16.1 921 (2) 44.7 14.7 308 (3) 46.2 16.9 40 rules (1,2) 53.0 16.1 1,115 rules (1,2,3) 52.4 15.9 1,131 sym. + (1,2) 54.3 15.0 1,710 sym. + (1,2,3) 53.9 14.5 1,725</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Reranking evaluation</head><p>For our SVM models, we adopted the RBF kernel, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hagiwara et al., 2009)</ref>, and a grid search strat- egy for optimizing both the γ and C parameters by applying a 5-fold cross validation procedure to our training set and adopting the precision mea- sure as the evaluation function to optimize. The models were built with LIBSVM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chang and Lin, 2001</ref>) and then applied to the neighbors of our ini- tial thesaurus. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> gives the results of the reranking for both the method we propose, compound (comp. for short), with examples selected by rules <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, and the one of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferret, 2012)</ref>, symmetry. In either case, they correspond to an intrinsic evalu- ation achieved by comparing the semantic neigh- bors of each thesaurus entry with the synonyms and related words of our Gold Standard resource for that entry. 12,243 entries with frequency &gt; 10 were present in this resource and evaluated in such a way. As the neighbors are ranked according to their similarity value with their entry, we adopted the classical evaluation measures of Information Retrieval by replacing documents with synonyms and queries with entries: R-precision (R-prec.), Mean Average Precision (MAP) and precision at different cut-offs (1, 5 and 10).</p><p>More precisely, the initial row of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> gives the values of these measures for our initial the- saurus of mono-terms while its A2ST-comp row corresponds to the measures for our thesaurus of compounds. It should be note that in the case of the A2ST-comp thesaurus, the number of evalu- ated entries is very small, restricted to 813 entries, with also a very small number of reference syn- onyms by entry. Hence, the results of the evalu- ation of A2ST-comp have to be considered with caution even if their high level for the very first se- mantic neighbors tends to confirm the positive im- pact of the low level of ambiguity of compounds compared to mono-terms.</p><p>The two following rows gives the results of the thesauri built from the best models of ( ), B14-count for the count model, whose main parameters are close or identical to ours, and B14-predict for the predict model, built from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. These results first illus- trate the known importance of corpus size, as the ( )'s corpus is more than 7 times larger than ours, and the fact that for building the- sauri, the count model is superior to the predict model. This last observation is confirmed by the results of the skip-gram model of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) with its best parameters 2 for our corpus (5 th row), which clearly exhibits worst results than ini- tial. For this Mikolov thesaurus and the follow- ing reranked ones, each value corresponds to the difference between the measure for the considered thesaurus and the measure for the initial thesaurus. All these differences were found statistically sig- nificant according to a paired Wilcoxon test with p-value &lt; 0.05. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> word2vec -cbow 0 -size 600 -window 10 -negative 0 -hs 0 -sample 1e-5  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Evaluation of our initial thesaurus and its reranked versions (values = percentages).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Thesaurus R-prec. MAP P@1 P@5 P@10 initial (A2ST) 7</formula><p>The analysis of the next two rows of Table 2 first shows that each criterion used for reranking our initial thesaurus leads to a global increase of results. The extent of this increase is quite sim- ilar for the two criteria: symmetry slightly out- performs compound but the difference is not sig- nificant. This increase is higher for P@{1,5,10} than for R-precision and MAP, which can be ex- plained by the high number of synonyms and re- lated words, 38.7 on average, that an entry of our initial thesaurus has in our reference. Hence, even a significant increase of P@{1,5,10} may have a modest impact on R-precision and MAP as the overall recall, equal to 9.8%, is low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Thesaurus fusion</head><p>Having several thesauri reranked according to dif- ferent criteria offers the opportunity to apply en- semble methods. Such idea was already experi- mented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Curran, 2002)</ref> for thesauri built with different parameters (window or syntactic based cooccurrents, etc). We tested more particularly two general strategies for data fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atrey et al., 2010)</ref>: early and late fusions. The first one con- sists in our case in fusing the training sets built from our two criteria. As for each criterion, a clas- sifier is then built from the fused training set and applied for reranking the initial thesaurus (see the sym.+comp. row of <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> illustrates qualitatively the impact of this first strategy for the entry esteem. Its Word- Net row gives all the synonyms for this entry in WordNet while its Moby row gives the first re- lated words for this entry in Moby. In our initial WordNet respect, admiration, regard Moby admiration, appreciation, accep- tance, dignity, regard, respect, ac- count, adherence, consideration, estimate, estimation, fame, great- ness, homage + 79 words more initial cordiality, gratitude, admiration, comradeship, back-scratching, perplexity, respect, ruination, appreciation, neighbourliness . . .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>sym.+comp.</head><p>respect, admiration, trust, recog- nition, gratitude, confidence, af- fection, understanding, solidarity, dignity, appreciation, regard, sym- pathy, acceptance . . . <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Reranking for the entry esteem with the early fusion strategy. thesaurus, the first two neighbors of esteem that are present in our reference resources are admira- tion (rank 3) and respect (rank 7). The reranking produces a thesaurus in which these two words ap- pear as the first two neighbors of the entry while its third synonym in WordNet raises from rank 22 to rank 12. Moreover, the number of neighbors among the first 14 ones that are present in Moby increases from 3 to 6.</p><p>The late fusion strategy relies on the methods used in Information Retrieval for merging ranked lists of retrieved documents. More precisely, we experimented the Borda, Condorcet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Nuray and Can, 2006</ref>) and Reciprocal Rank (RRF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cormack et al., 2009</ref>) fusions based on ranks and the Comb- Sum fusion based on similarity values, normalized in our case with the Zero-one method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wu et al., 2006</ref>). The corresponding thesauri were built by fusing, entry by entry, the lists of neighbors com- ing from the initial, symmetry and compound the- sauri.</p><p>Table 2 first shows that all the thesauri pro- duced by our ensemble methods outperform our first three thesauri, which confirms that initial, symmetry and compound can bring complemen- tary information, exploited by the fusion. It also shows that our late fusion methods are more ef- fective than our early fusion method. However, no specific element advocates at this stage for a generalization of this observation. The evaluation reported by Table 2 also suggests that for fusing distributional thesauri, the similarity of a neighbor with its entry is a more relevant criterion than its rank. Among the rank based methods, we observe that RRF is clearly superior to condorcet but only weakly superior to borda. Finally, the last row of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> -CS-w-Mik -illustrates one step fur- ther the interest of ensemble methods for distribu- tional thesauri: whereas the "Mikolov thesaurus" gets the worst results among all the thesauri of Ta- ble 2, adding it to the initial, symmetry and com- pound thesauri in the CombSum method leads to improve both R-precision and MAP, with a only small decrease of P@1 and P@5. From a more global perspective, it is interesting to note that our best method, CombSum, clearly outperforms the reranking method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ferret, 2013)</ref> with the same initial starting point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and perspectives</head><p>In this article, we have presented a method based on bootstrapping for improving distributional the- sauri. More precisely, we have proposed a new criterion, based on the relations of mono-terms in similar compounds, for the unsupervised selection of training examples used for reranking the seman- tic neighbors of a thesaurus. We have evaluated two different strategies for combining this crite- rion with an already existing one and showed that a late fusion approach based on the merging of lists of neighbors is particularly effective compared to an early fusion approach based on the merging of training sets.</p><p>We plan to extend this work by studying how the combination of the unsupervised selection of examples and their use for training supervised classifiers can be exploited for improving distribu- tional thesauri through feature selection. We will also investigated the interest of taking into account word senses in this framework, as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huang et al., 2012)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Reisinger and Mooney, 2010</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Selection of examples.
