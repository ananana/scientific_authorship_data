				<p>Semantic representation lies at the core of several applications in Natural Language Processing. However, most existing semantic representation techniques cannot be used effectively for the representation of individual word senses. We put forward a novel multilingual concept representation , called MUFFIN, which not only enables accurate representation of word senses in different languages, but also provides multiple advantages over existing approaches. MUFFIN represents a given concept in a unified semantic space irrespective of the language of interest, enabling cross-lingual comparison of different concepts. We evaluate our approach in two different evaluation benchmarks, semantic similarity and Word Sense Disam-biguation, reporting state-of-the-art performance on several standard datasets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Semantic representation, i.e., the task of represent- ing a linguistic item (such as a word or a word sense) in a mathematical or machine-interpretable form, is a fundamental problem in Natural Lan- guage Processing (NLP). The Vector Space Model (VSM) is a prominent approach for semantic rep- resentation, with widespread popularity in numer- ous NLP applications. The prevailing methods for the computation of a vector space represen- tation are based on distributional semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Harris, 1954</ref>). However, these approaches, whether in their conventional co-occurrence based form ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Salton et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Turney and Pantel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Landauer and Dooley, 2002</ref>), or in their newer predic- tive branch <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Collobert and Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2014</ref>), suffer from a major drawback: they are unable to model indi- vidual word senses or concepts, as they conflate different meanings of a word into a single vecto- rial representation. This hinders the functionality of this group of vector space models in tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) that re- quire the representation of individual word senses. There have been several efforts to adapt and apply distributional approaches to the representation of word senses <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pantel and Lin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brody and Lapata, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Reisinger and Mooney, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Huang et al., 2012</ref>). However, none of these techniques provides representations that are already linked to a standard sense inventory, and consequently such mapping has to be carried out either manually, or with the help of sense-annotated data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chen et al. (2014)</ref> addressed this issue and obtained vectors for individual word senses by leveraging WordNet glosses. NASARI <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Camacho-Collados et al., 2015</ref>) is another approach that obtains ac- curate sense-specific representations by combin- ing the complementary knowledge from Word- Net and Wikipedia. Graph-based approaches have also been successfully utilized to model individ- ual words <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hughes and Ramage, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Yeh et al., 2009)</ref>, or concepts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pilehvar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014</ref>), drawing on the structural properties of semantic networks. The applicability of all these techniques, however, is usually either constrained to a single language (usually English), or to a specific task.</p><p>We put forward MUFFIN (Multilingual, Uni- Fied and Flexible INterpretation), a novel method that exploits both structural knowledge derived from semantic networks and distributional statis- tics from text corpora, to produce effective rep- resentations of individual word senses or con- cepts. Our approach provides multiple advantages in comparison to the previous VSM techniques:</p><p>1. Multilingual: it enables sense representation in dozens of languages; 2. Unified: it represents a linguistic item, irre- spective of its language, in a unified seman- tic space having concepts as its dimensions, permitting direct comparison of different rep- resentations across languages, and hence en- abling cross-lingual applications;</p><p>3. Flexible: it can be readily applied to different NLP tasks with minimal adaptation.</p><p>We evaluate our semantic representation on two different tasks in lexical semantics: semantic sim- ilarity and Word Sense Disambiguation. To as- sess the multilingual capability of our approach, we also perform experiments on languages other than English on both tasks, and across languages for semantic similarity. We report state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and settings in both frameworks, which confirms the reliability and flexibility of our representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>Figure 1 illustrates our procedure for construct- ing the vector representation of a given con- cept. We use BabelNet 1 (version 2.5) as our main sense repository. <ref type="bibr">BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a</ref>) is a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary which merges WordNet with other lex- ical resources, such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary, thanks to its use of an automatic mapping al- gorithm. BabelNet extends the WordNet synset model to take into account multilinguality: a Ba- belNet synset contains the words that, in the vari- ous languages, express the given concept.</p><p>Our approach for modeling a BabelNet synset consists of two main steps. First, for the given synset we gather contextual information from Wikipedia by exploiting knowledge from the Ba- belNet semantic network (Section 2.1). Then, by analyzing the corresponding contextual informa- tion and comparing and contrasting it with the 1 http://www.babelnet.org whole Wikipedia corpus, we obtain a vectorial representation of the given synset (Section 2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">A Wikipedia sub-corpus for each concept</head><p>Let c be a concept, which in our setting is a Ba- belNet synset, and let W c be the set containing the Wikipedia page p corresponding to the con- cept c and all the Wikipedia pages having an out- going link to p. We further enrich W c with the corresponding Wikipedia pages of the hypernyms and hyponyms of c in the BabelNet network. W c is the set of Wikipedia pages whose contents are exploited to build a representation for the concept c. We refer to the bag of content words in all the Wikipedia pages in W c as the sub-corpus SC c for the concept c.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Vector construction: lexical specificity</head><p>Lexical specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lafon, 1980</ref>) is a statistical measure based on the hypergeometric distribu- tion. Due to its efficiency in extracting a set of highly relevant words from a sub-corpus, the measure has recently gained popularity in differ- ent NLP applications, such as textual data analy- sis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lebart et al., 1998</ref>), term extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Drouin, 2003)</ref>, and domain-based term disambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Camacho-Collados et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Billami et al., 2014</ref>). We leverage lexical specificity to com- pute the weights in our vectors. In our earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Camacho-Collados et al., 2015</ref>), we con- ducted different experiments which demonstrated the improvement that lexical specificity can pro- vide over the popular term frequency-inverse doc- ument frequency weighting scheme <ref type="bibr">(Jones, 1972, tf-idf )</ref>. Lexical specificity computes the vector weights for an item, i.e., a word or a set of words, by comparing and contrasting its contextual infor- mation with a reference corpus. In our setting, we take the whole Wikipedia as our reference corpus RC (we use the October 2012 Wikipedia dump).</p><p>Let T and t be the respective total number of to- kens in RC and SC c , while F and f denote the frequency of a given item in RC and SC c , respec- tively. Our goal is to compute a weight denoting the association of an item to the concept c. For no- tational brevity, we use the following expression to refer to positive lexical specificity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">specificity(T, t, F, f ) = − log 10 P (X ≥ f ) (1)</formula><p>where X represents a random variable following a hypergeometric distribution of parameters F , t and T . As we are only interested in a set of items that are representative of the concept be- ing modeled, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Billami et al. (2014)</ref> and only consider in our final vector the items which are relevant to SC c with a confidence higher than 99% according to the hypergeometric distribution (P (X ≥ f ) ≤ 0.01).</p><p>On the basis of lexical specificity we put for- ward two types of representations: lexical and uni- fied. The lexical vector representation lex c of a concept c has lemmas as its individual dimensions. To this end, we apply lexical specificity to every lemma in SC c in order to estimate the relevance of each lemma to our concept c. We use the lexical representation for the task of WSD (see Section 3.2). We describe the unified representation in the next subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Unified representation</head><p>Unlike the lexical version, our unified representa- tion has concepts as individual dimensions. Algo- rithm 1 shows the construction process of a con- cept's unified vector. The algorithm first clusters together those words that have a sense sharing the same hypernym (h in the algorithm) according to the BabelNet taxonomy (lines 2-4). Next, the specificity is computed for the set of all the hy- ponyms of h, even those that do not appear in the sub-corpus SC c (lines <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Applications</head><p>Thanks to their VSM nature and the sense- level functionality, our concept representations are highly flexible, allowing us to adapt and apply them to different NLP tasks with minimal adap- tation. In this section we explain how we use our representations in the tasks of semantic similarity (Section 3.1) and WSD (Section 3.2).</p><p>Associating concepts with words. Given that our representations are for individual word senses, a preliminary step for both tasks would be to as- sociate the set of concepts, i.e., BabelNet synsets, C w = {c 1 , ..., c n } with a given word w. In the case when w exists in the BabelNet dictionary, we obtain the set of associated senses of the word as defined in the BabelNet sense inventory.</p><p>In order to enhance the coverage in the case of  is a hyperlink that appears as dockside crane in the text, but takes the user to the Wikipedia page titled Crane (machine). These links provide Wikipedia editors with the ability to represent a Wikipedia article through a suitable lexicalization that pre- serves the grammatical structure, contextual co- herency, and flow of the sentence. This property provides an effective means of obtaining a set of concepts for the words not covered by BabelNet. For the case of our example, the BabelNet out-of- vocabulary word w = dockside crane will have in its set of associated concepts C w the BabelNet synset corresponding to the Wikipedia page titled Crane (machine).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Crane (bird) Crane (machine) English French German English French German shore bird 1 n ‡famille des oiseaux 1 n ‡vogel-familie 1 n * lifting device 1 n * dispositif de levage 1 n * hebevorrichtung 1 n bird 1 n * limicole 1 n * charadrii 1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Semantic Similarity</head><p>Once we have the set C w of concepts associated with each word w, we first retrieve the set of corresponding unified vector representations. We then follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Camacho-Collados et al. (2015)</ref> and use square-rooted Weighted Overlap (Pilehvar et al., 2013, WO) as our vector comparison method, a metric that has been shown to suit specificity- based vectors more than the conventional cosine. WO compares two vectors on the basis of their overlapping dimensions, which are harmonically weighted by their relative ranking:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">W O(v1, v2) = q∈O rank(q, v1) + rank(q, v2) −1 |O| i=1 (2i) −1 (2)</formula><p>where O is the set of overlapping dimensions (i.e. concepts) between the two vectors and rank(q, v i ) is the rank of dimension q in the vector v i . Finally, the similarity between two words w 1 and w 2 is calculated as the similarity of their clos- est senses, a prevailing approach in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Resnik, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">sim(w 1 , w 2 ) = max v 1 ∈Cw 1 ,v 2 ∈Cw 2 WO(v 1 , v 2 ) (3)</formula><p>where w 1 and w 2 can belong to different lan- guages. This cross-lingual similarity measure- ment is possible thanks to the unified language- independent space of concepts of our semantic representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation</head><p>In order to be able to apply our approach to WSD, we use the lexical vector lex c for each concept c. The reason for our choice of lexical vectors in this setting is that they enable a direct comparison of a candidate sense's representation with the context, which is also in the same lexical form. Algorithm 2 summarizes the general framework of our ap- proach. Given a target word w to disambiguate, our approach proceeds by the following steps:</p><p>1. Retrieve C w , the set of associated concepts with the target word w (line 1);</p><p>2. Obtain the lexical vector lex c for each con- cept c ∈ C w (cf. Section 2);</p><p>3. Calculate, for each candidate concept c, a confidence score (score c ) based on the har- monic sum of the ranks of the overlapping words between its lexical vector lex c and the context of the target word (line 5 in Algo- rithm 2).</p></div>

Similarly, when re- stricted to the WordNet inventory, we discard those BabelNet synsets that do not contain a Word- Net synset. In this setting, we also leverage re- lations from WordNet's semantic network and its disambiguated glosses 3 in order to obtain a richer set of Wikipedia articles in the sub-corpus con- struction. The enrichment of the semantic network with the disambiguated glosses has been shown to be beneficial in various graph-based disambigua- tion tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Navigli and Velardi, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pilehvar et al., 2013</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Semantic Similarity</head><p>As our semantic similarity experiment we opted for word similarity, which is one of the most pop- ular evaluation frameworks in lexical semantics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Datasets</head><p>Monolingual. We picked the RG-65 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965)</ref> as our mono- lingual word similarity dataset. The dataset com- prises 65 English word pairs which have been manually annotated by several annotators accord- ing to their similarity on a scale of 0 to 4. We also perform evaluations on the French (Joubarne and Inkpen, 2011) and German <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gurevych, 2005)</ref> adaptations of this dataset.</p><p>Cross-lingual. Hassan and Mihalcea (2009) de- veloped two sets of cross-lingual datasets based on the English MC-30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Miller and Charles, 1991)</ref> and WordSim-353 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Finkelstein et al., 2002</ref>) datasets, for four different languages: English, German, Romanian, and Arabic. However, the construc- tion procedure they adopted, consisting of trans- lating the pairs to other languages while preserv- ing the original similarity scores, has led to incon- sistencies in the datasets. For instance, the Span- ish dataset contains the identical pair mediodia- mediodia with a similarity score of 3.42 (in the scale <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>). Additionally, the datasets contain several orthographic errors, such as despliege and grua (instead of despliegue and grúa) and incor- rect translations (e.g., the English noun implement translated into the Spanish verb implementar). Kennedy and Hirst (2012) proposed a more reli- able procedure that leverages two existing aligned monolingual word similarity datasets for the con- struction of a new cross-lingual dataset. To this end, for each two word pairs a-b and a'-b' in the two datasets, if the difference in the correspond- ing scores is greater than one, the pairs are dis- carded. Otherwise, two new pairs a-b' and a'-b are created with a score equal to the average of the two original pairs' scores. In the case of repeated pairs, we merge them into a single pair with a sim- ilarity equal to their average scores. Using this procedure as a basis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kennedy and Hirst (2012)</ref> created an English-French dataset consisting of 100 pairs. We followed the same procedure and built two datasets for English-German (consisting of 125 pairs) and German-French (comprising 96 pairs) language pairs. 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Comparison systems</head><p>Monolingual. We benchmark our system against four other approaches that exploit   <ref type="bibr">, 2007)</ref>, and LSA-Wiki ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Granada et al., 2014</ref>). We also provide results for systems that use distributional semantics for mod- eling words, both the conventional co-occurrence based approach, i.e., PMI-SVD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2014</ref>), PMI and SOC-PMI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Joubarne and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Inkpen, 2011), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Retrofitting (Faruqui et al., 2015)</ref>, and the newer word embeddings, i.e., <ref type="bibr">Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>.

Finally, we also report the performance of our earlier work NASARI <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Camacho-Collados et al., 2015)</ref>, which combines knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia for the English language in its setting without the Wiktionary synonyms module.</p><note type="other">English ρ r German ρ r French ρ r MUFFIN 0</note><p>Cross-lingual. We compare the performance of our approach against the best configuration of the CL-MSR-2.0 system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kennedy and Hirst, 2012)</ref>, which exploits Pointwise Mutual Informa- tion (PMI) on a parallel corpus obtained from <ref type="bibr">5</ref> SSA involves several parameters tuned on datasets that are constructed on the basis of MC-30 and RG-65. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We report the best configuration of the systems on the RG-65 dataset out of their 48 configurations. The corpus used to train the models contained 2.8 billion tokens, includ- ing Wikipedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al., 2014</ref>). the English and French versions of WordNet. Since two of our cross-lingual datasets are newly- created, we developed three baseline systems to enable a more meaningful comparison. To this end, we first use Google Translate to translate the non-English side of the dataset to the English lan- guage. Accordingly, three state-of-the-art graph- based and corpus-based approaches were used to measure the similarity of the resulting English pairs. As English similarity measurement systems, we opted for ADW ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pilehvar et al., 2013)</ref>, and the best predictive ( <ref type="bibr">Mikolov et al., 2013, Word2Vec)</ref> and co-occurrence (i.e., PMI-SVD) models ob- tained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni et al.

Similarly to the monolingual experiments, our system proves highly reliable in the cross-lingual setting, improving the per- formance of the comparison systems on all three language pairs. Moreover, MUFFIN pivot attains the best results among the pivot systems on all datasets, confirming the reliability of our system in the monolingual setting. We note that since the cross-lingual datasets were built by translating the word pairs in the original English RG-65 dataset, the pivot-based comparison systems proved to be highly competitive, outperforming the CL-MSR- 2.0 system by a considerable margin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Wikipedia</head><p>In this setting, we selected the SemEval 2013 all- words WSD task ( ) as our eval- uation benchmark. The task provides datasets for five different languages: Italian, English, French, Spanish and German. There are on average 1123 words to disambiguate in each language's dataset.</p><p>As comparison system, we provide results for the best-performing participating system on each lan- guage. We also show results for the state-of-the- art WSD system of <ref type="bibr">Moro et al. (2014, Babelfy)</ref>, which relies on random walks on the BabelNet se- mantic network and a set of graph heuristic algo- rithms. Finally, we also report results for the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline provided by the task organizers. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moro et al. (2014)</ref> and back off to the MFS baseline in the case when our system's judgement does not meet a threshold θ. Similarly to Babelfy, we tuned the value of the threshold θ on the trial dataset provided by the organizers of the task. We tuned θ with step size 0.05 (hence, 21 possible values in <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>), obtaining an optimal value of 0.85 in the trial set, a value which we use across all languages. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> lists the F1 percentage performance of different systems on the five datasets of the SemEval-2013 all-words WSD task. Despite not being tuned to the task, our representations pro- vide competitive results on all datasets, outper- forming the sophisticated Babelfy system on the Spanish and German languages. The variant of our system not utilizing the MFS information in the disambiguation process (θ = 0), i.e., MUF- FIN, also shows competitive results, outperform- ing the best system in the SemEval-2013 dataset on all languages. Interestingly, MUFFIN proves highly effective on the French language, surpass- ing not only the performance of our system using the MFS information, but also attaining the best overall performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">WordNet</head><p>As regards the WordNet disambiguation task, we take as our benchmark the two recent SemEval English all-words WSD tasks: the SemEval-2013 task on Multilingual WSD (  and the SemEval-2007 English Lexical Sample, SRL and All-Words task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pradhan et al., 2007)</ref>. The all-words datasets of the two tasks contain 1644 instances (SemEval-2013) and 162 noun in- stances <ref type="bibr">(SemEval-2007)</ref>, respectively.</p><p>As comparison system, we report the per- formance of the best configuration of the top- performing system in the SemEval-2013 task, i.e., UMCC-DLSI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gutiérrez et al., 2013</ref>). We also show results for the state-of-the-art supervised system (Zhong and Ng, 2010, IMS), as well as for two graph-based approaches that are based on random walks on the WordNet graph (Agirre and Soroa, 2009, UKB w2w) and the BabelNet seman- tic network <ref type="bibr">(Moro et al., 2014, Babelfy)</ref>. We fol- low Babelfy and also exploit the WordNet's sense frequency information from the SemCor sense- annotated corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Miller et al., 1993)</ref>. However, instead of simply backing off to the most frequent sense, we propose a more meaningful exploitation of this information. To this end, we compute the relevance of a specific sense as the average of its normalized sense frequency and its corresponding  score (score c in Algorithm 2) given by our system. The sense with the highest overall relevance value is then picked as the intended sense. Additionally, we put forward a hybrid system that combines our system with IMS, hence bene- fiting from the judgements made by two systems that utilize complementary information. Our sys- tem makes judgements based on global contexts, whereas IMS exploits the local context of the tar- get word. To this end, we compute the relevance of a specific sense as the average of the normal- ized scores given by IMS and our system (score c in Algorithm 2). We refer to this hybrid system as MUFFIN+IMS. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> reports the F1 percentage performance of different systems on the datasets of <ref type="bibr">SemEval2013 and</ref><ref type="bibr">SemEval-2007</ref> English all-words WSD tasks. We also report the results for the MFS base- line, which always picks the most frequent sense of a word. Similarly to the disambiguation task on the Wikipedia sense inventory, MUFFIN proves to be quite competitive on the WordNet disam- biguation task, while surpassing the performance of all the comparison systems on the SemEval- 2013 dataset. On the SemEval-2007 dataset, IMS achieves the best performance, thanks to its usage of large amounts of manually and semi- automatically tagged data. Finally, our hybrid sys- tem, MUFFIN+IMS, provides the best overall per- formance on the two datasets, showing that our combination of the two WSD systems that utilize different types of knowledge was beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related work</head><p>We briefly review the recent literature on the two NLP tasks to which we applied our representa- tions, i.e., Word Sense Disambiguation and se- mantic similarity.  ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Navigli, 2009)</ref>. Supervised systems such as IMS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zhong and Ng, 2010)</ref> analyze sense-annotated data and model the context in which the various senses of a word usually appear. Despite their ac- curacy for the words that are provided with suit- able amounts of sense-annotated data, their appli- cability is limited to those words and languages for which such data is available, practically limit- ing them to a small subset of words mainly in the English language. Knowledge-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Navigli and Lapata, 2007;</ref>) significantly im- prove the coverage of supervised systems. How- ever, similarly to their supervised counterparts, knowledge-based techniques are usually limited to the English language. Recent years have seen a growing interest in cross-lingual and multilingual WSD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lefever and Hoste, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lefever and Hoste, 2013;</ref>. Multilinguality is usually offered by methods that exploit the structural informa- tion of large-scale multilingual lexical resources such as Wikipedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gutiérrez et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Manion and Sainudiin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hovy et al., 2013</ref>). Babelfy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moro et al., 2014</ref>) is an approach with state-of- the-art performance that relies on random walks on BabelNet multilingual semantic network <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a</ref>) and densest subgraph heuristics. However, the approach is limited to the WSD and Entity Linking tasks. In contrast, our approach is global as it can be used in different NLP tasks, including WSD.</p><p>Semantic similarity. Semantic similarity of word pairs is usually computed either on the ba- sis of the structural properties of lexical databases and thesauri, or by comparing vectorial represen- tations of words learned from massive text cor- pora. Structural approaches usually measure the similarity on the basis of the distance information on semantic networks, such as WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006</ref>), or thesauri, such as Ro- get's ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Morris and Hirst, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003</ref>). The semantic network of Word- Net has also been used in more sophisticated tech- niques such as those based on random graph walks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pilehvar et al., 2013)</ref>, or coupled with the complementary knowledge from Wikipedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Camacho-Collados et al., 2015)</ref>. How- ever, these techniques are either limited in the lan- guages to which they can be applied, or in their applicability to tasks other than semantic similar- ity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012b)</ref>.</p><p>Corpus-based techniques are more flexible, en- abling the training of models on corpora other than English. However, these approaches, either in their conventional co-occurrence based form ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Landauer and Dumais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Turney and Pantel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bullinaria and Levy, 2012)</ref>, or the more recent predic- tive models <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Collobert and Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), are re- stricted in two ways: (1) they cannot be used to compare word senses; and (2) they cannot be di- rectly applied to cross-lingual semantic similar- ity. Though the first problem has been solved by multi-prototype models <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Huang et al., 2012)</ref>, or by the sense-specific representations obtained as a result of exploiting WordNet glosses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chen et al., 2014)</ref>, the second problem remains unad- dressed. In contrast, our approach models word senses and concepts effectively, while providing a unified representation for different languages that enables cross-lingual semantic similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presented MUFFIN, a new multilingual, unified and flexible representation of individual word senses. Thanks to its effective combination of distributional statistics and structured knowl- edge, the approach can compute efficient represen- tations of arbitrary word senses, with high cover- age and irrespective of their language. We eval- uated our representations on two different NLP tasks, i.e., semantic similarity and Word Sense Disambiguation, reporting state-of-the-art perfor- mance on several datasets. Experimental results demonstrated the reliability of our unified repre- sentation approach, while at the same time also highlighting its main advantages: multilinguality, owing to its effective application within and across multiple languages; and flexibility, owing to its ro- bust performance on two different tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Our procedure for constructing a multilingual vector representation for a concept c.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,114.69,62.81,368.16,127.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
