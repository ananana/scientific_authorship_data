				<p>The prevalent use of too few references for evaluating text-to-text generation is known to bias estimates of their quality (hence-forth, low coverage bias or LCB). This paper shows that overcoming LCB in Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) evaluation cannot be attained by re-scaling or by increasing the number of references in any feasible range, contrary to previous suggestions. This is due to the long-tailed distribution of valid corrections for a sentence. Concretely, we show that LCB in-centivizes GEC systems to avoid correcting even when they can generate a valid correction. Consequently, existing systems obtain comparable or superior performance compared to humans, by making few but targeted changes to the input. Similar effects on Text Simplification further support our claims.</p>

Reference-based evaluation measures (RBM) are the common practice in GEC, including the stan- dard M 2 (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), GLEU ( ) and I-measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Felice and Briscoe, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The Low Coverage Bias (LCB) was previously discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryant and Ng (2015)</ref>, who showed that inter-annotator agreement in producing ref- erences is low, and concluded that RBMs under- estimate the performance of GEC systems. To address this, they proposed a new measure, Ra- tio Scoring, which re-scales M 2 by the inter- annotator agreement (i.e., the score of a human corrector), interpreted as an upper bound.</p><p>We claim that the LCB has more far-reaching implications than previously discussed. First, while we agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryant and Ng (2015)</ref> that a human correction should receive a perfect score, we show that LCB does not merely scale system performance by a constant factor, but rather that some correction policies are less prone to be bi- ased against. Concretely, we show that by only correcting closed class errors, where few possible corrections are valid, systems can outperform hu- mans. Indeed, in Section 2.3 we show that some existing systems outperform humans on M 2 and GLEU, while only applying few changes to the source.</p><p>We thus argue that the development of GEC sys- tems against low coverage RBMs disincentivizes systems from making changes to the source in cases where there are plentiful valid corrections (open class errors), as necessarily only some of them are covered by the reference set. To support our claim we show that (1) existing GEC systems under-correct, often performing an order of mag- nitude less corrections than a human does ( §3.2); (2) increasing the number of references alleviates under-correction ( §3.3); and (3) under-correction is more pronounced in error types that are more varied in their valid corrections ( §3.4).</p><p>A different approach for addressing LCB was taken by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bryant and Ng, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sakaguchi et al., 2016)</ref>, who propose to increase the number of ref- erences (henceforth, M ). In Section 2 we esti- mate the distribution of corrections per sentence, and find that increasing M is unlikely to overcome LCB, due to the vast number of valid corrections for a sentence and their long-tailed distribution. Indeed, even short sentences have over 1000 valid corrections on average. Empirically assessing the effect of increasing M on the bias, we find dimin- ishing returns using three standard GEC measures (M 2 , accuracy and GLEU), underscoring the dif- ficulty in this approach.</p><p>Similar trends are found when conducting such experiments to Text Simplification (TS) ( §4). Specifically we show that (1) the distribution of valid simplifications for a given sentence is long- tailed; (2) common measures for TS dramatically under-estimate performance; (3) additional refer- ences alleviate this under-prediction.</p><p>To recap, we find that the LCB hinders the relia- bility of RBMs for GEC, and incentivizes systems developed to optimize these measures not to cor- rect. LCB cannot be overcome by re-scaling or increasing M in any feasible range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Coverage in RBMs</head><p>We begin by formulating a methodology for study- ing the distribution of valid corrections for a sen- tence ( §2.1), and then turn to assessing the ef- fect inadequate coverage has on common RBMs ( §2.2). Finally, we compare human and system scores by common RBMs ( §2.3).</p><p>Notation. We assume each ungrammatical sen- tence x has a set of valid corrections Correct x , and a discrete distribution D x over them, where P Dx (y) for y ∈ Correct x is the probability a hu- man annotator would correct x as y.</p><p>Let X = x 1 . . . x N be the evaluated set of source sentences and denote D i := D x i . Each x i is independently sampled from some distribution L over input sentences, and is paired with M cor- rections</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y i = y 1 i , . . . , y M i</formula><p>, which are indepen- dently sampled from D i . Our analysis assumes a fixed number of references across sentences, but generalizing to sentence-dependent M is straight- forward. The coverage of a reference set Y i of size M for a sentence x i is defined as P y∼D i (y ∈ Y i ).</p><p>A system C is a function from input sentences to proposed corrections (strings). An evaluation measure is a function f : X × Y × C → R. We use the term "true measure" to refer to a measure's output where the reference set includes all valid corrections, i.e., ∀i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y i = Correct i .</formula><p>Experimental Setup. We conduct all experi- ments on the NUCLE test dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dahlmeier et al., 2013)</ref>. NUCLE is a parallel corpus of es- says written by language learners and their cor- rected versions, containing 1414 essays and 50 test essays, each of about 500 words.</p><p>We evaluate all participating systems in the CoNLL 2014 shared task, in addition to three of the best performing systems on this dataset, a hybrid system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rozovskaya and Roth, 2016)</ref>, a phrase-based MT system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2016</ref>) and a neural network system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xie et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Estimating the Corrections Distribution</head><p>Data. We turn to estimating the number of cor- rections per sentence, and their histogram. The ex- periments in the following section are run on a ran- dom sample of 52 short sentences from the NU- CLE test data, i.e. with 15 words or less. Through the length restriction, we avoid introducing too many independent errors that may drastically in- crease the number of annotation variants (as every combination of corrections for these errors is pos- sible), thus resulting in unreliable estimation for</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D x .</formula><p>Proven effective in GEC and related tasks such as MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Madnani et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Post et al., 2012</ref>), we use crowd- sourcing to sample from D x (see Appendix B). Aiming to judge grammaticality rather than flu- ency, we instructed the workers to correct only when necessary, not for styling. We begin by es- timating the histogram of D x for each sentence, using the crowdsourced corrections. We use UN- SEENEST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zou et al., 2016</ref>), a non-parametric al- gorithm to estimate a discrete distribution in which the individual values do not matter, only their probability. UNSEENEST aims to minimize the "earthmover distance", between the estimated his- togram and the histogram of the distribution. Intu- itively, if histograms are piles of dirt, UNSEEN- EST minimizes the amount of dirt moved times the distance it moved. UNSEENEST was originally developed and tested for estimating the histogram of variants a gene may have, including undiscov- ered ones, a setting similar to ours. Our manual tests of UNSEENEST with small artificially created datasets showed satisfactory results. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Our estimates show that most input sentences have a large number of infrequent corrections that account for much of the probability mass and a rather small number of frequent corrections. Ta- ble 1 presents the mean number of different cor- rections with frequency at least γ (for different γs), and their total probability mass. For instance, 74.34 corrections account for 75% of the probabil- ity mass, each occurring with frequency ≥ 0.1%. The high number of rare corrections raises the question of whether these can be regarded as noise. To test this we conducted another crowd- sourcing experiment, where 3 annotators were asked to judge whether a correction produced in the first experiment, is indeed valid. We plot the validity of corrections against their frequencies, finding that frequency has little effect, where even the rarest corrections are judged valid 78% of the time. Details in Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Under-estimation as a Function of M</head><p>After estimating the histogram of valid corrections for a sentence, we turn to estimating the result- ing bias (LCB), for different M values. We study sentence-level accuracy, F -Score and GLEU.</p><p>Sentence-level Accuracy. Sentence-level accu- racy is the percentage of corrections that exactly match one of the references. Accuracy is a ba- sic, interpretable measure, used in GEC by, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Rozovskaya and Roth (2010)</ref>. It is also closely related to the 0-1 loss function commonly used for training in GEC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chodorow et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rozovskaya and Roth, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Formally, given test sentences X = {x 1 , . . . , x N }, their references Y 1 , . . . , Y N and a system C, we define C's accuracy to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Acc (C; X, Y ) = 1 N N i=1 1 C(x i )∈Y i .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Note that C's accuracy is, in fact, an estimate of C's true accuracy, the probability to produce a valid correction for a sentence.

As M grows, Y better approximates Correct x , and b M tends to 0.</p><p>In order to abstract away from the idiosyn- crasies of specific systems, we consider an ideal- ized learner, which, when correct, produces a valid correction with the same distribution as a human annotator (i.e., according to D x ). Formally, we as-</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">sume that, if C(x) ∈ Correct x then C(x) ∼ D x .</formula><p>Hence the bias b M (Eq. 6) can be re-written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P (C(x) ∈ Correctx) · (1 − P Y ∼D M x ,y∼Dx (y ∈ Y )).</formula><p>We will henceforth assume that C is perfect (i.e., its true accuracy is 1). Note that assuming any other value for C's true accuracy would sim- ply scale b M by that accuracy. Similarly, assuming only a fraction p of the sentences require correc- tion scales b M by p.</p><p>We estimate b M empirically using its empirical mean on our experimental corpus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ˆ bM = 1 − 1 N N i=1 P Y ∼D M i ,y∼D i (y ∈ Y ) .</formula><p>Using the UNSEENEST estimations of D i , we can computê b M for any size of Y i (M ). However, as this is highly computationally demanding, we estimate it using sampling. Specifically, for every M = 1, ..., 20 and x i , we sample Y i 1000 times (with replacement), and estimate P (y ∈ Y i ) as the covered probability mass P D i {y : y ∈ Y i }. Based on that we compute the accuracy distribution and expectation (see Appendix D).</p><p>We repeated all our experiments where Y i is sampled without replacement, and find similar trends with a faster increase in accuracy reaching over 0.47 with M = 10. <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref> presents the expected accuracy of a perfect system (i.e., 1-ˆ b M ) for different M s.

The y-axis corresponds to the measure values, and the x-axis to the number of references M . For bootstrapping experiments points are paired with a confidence interval (p = .95).</p><p>accuracy is only around 0.5. As M increases, the contribution of each additional correction dimin- ishes sharply (the slope is 0.004 for M = 20).</p><p>We also experiment with a more relaxed mea- sure, Exact Index Match, which is only sensitive to the identity of the changed words and not to what they were changed to. Formally, two correc- tions c and c over a source sentence x match if for their word alignments with the source (computed as above) a : {1, ..., |x|} → {1, ..., |c| , N ull} and a : {1, ..., |x|} → {1, ..., |c | , N ull}, it holds that c a(i) = x i ⇔ c a (i) = x i , where c N ull = c N ull . Results, while somewhat higher, are still only 0.54 with M = 10. <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref> F -Score. While accuracy is commonly used as a loss function for training GEC systems, F α -score is standard for evaluating system performance. The score is computed in terms of edit overlap be- tween edits that constitute a correction and ones that constitute a reference, where edits are sub- string replacements to the source. We use the stan- dard M 2 scorer (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), which defines edits optimistically, maximizing over all possible annotations that generate the correction from the source. Since our crowdsourced correc- tions are not annotated for edits, we produce edits to the reference heuristically.</p><p>The complexity of the measure prohibits an an- alytic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Yeh, 2000</ref>). We instead use boot- strapping to estimate the bias incurred by not be- ing able to exhaustively enumerate the set of valid corrections. As with accuracy, in order to avoid confounding our results with system-specific bi- ases, we assume the evaluated system is perfect and sample its corrections from the human distri- bution of corrections D x .</p><p>Concretely, given a value for M and for N , we uniformly sample from our experimental corpus source sentences x 1 , ..., x N , and M corrections for each Y 1 , ..., Y N (with replacement). Setting a realistic value for N in our experiments is im- portant for obtaining comparable results to those obtained on the NUCLE corpus (see §2.3), as the expected value of F -score depends on N and the number of sentences that do not need correction (N cor ). Following the statistics of NUCLE's test set, we set N = 1312 and N cor = 136.</p><p>Bootstrapping is carried out by the accelerated bootstrap procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Efron, 1987)</ref>, with 1000 iter- ations. We also report confidence intervals (p = .95), computed using the same procedure.</p><p>Results <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b</ref>) again show the insufficiency of commonly-used M values for reliably estimat- ing system performance. For instance, the F 0.5 - score for our perfect system is only 0.42 with M = 2. The saturation effect, observed for ac- curacy, is even more pronounced in this setting.</p><p>GLEU. We repeat the procedure using the mean GLEU sentence score <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>, which was shown to better correlate with human judgments than M 2 ( . Results are about 2% higher than M 2 's with a similar saturation ef- fect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sakaguchi et al. (2016)</ref> observed a similar ef- fect when evaluating against fluency-oriented ref- erences; this has led them to assume that saturation is due to covering most of the probability mass, which we now show is not the case. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Figure 2: F0.5 values with M = 2 for different systems, including confidence interval (p = .95).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Human and System Performance</head><p>The bootstrapping method for computing the sig- nificance of the F -score ( §2.2) can also be used for assessing the significance of the differences in system performance reported in the literature. We compute confidence intervals of different systems on the NUCLE test data (M = 2).</p><p>Results <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>) present mixed trends: some differences between previously reported F -scores are indeed significant and some are not. For ex- ample, the best performing system is significantly better than all but the second one.</p><p>Considering the F -score of the best-performing systems, and comparing them to the F -score of a perfect system with M = 2 (in accordance with systems' reported results), we find that their scores are comparable, where the systems RoRo and JMGR surpass a perfect system's F -score. Similar experiments with GLEU show that the two systems obtain comparable or superior perfor- mance to humans on this measure as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Discussion</head><p>In this section we have established that (1) as sys- tems can surpass human performance on RBMs, re-scaling cannot be used to overcome the LCB, and that (2) as the distribution of valid corrections is long-tailed, the number of references needed for reliable RBMs is exceedingly high. Indeed, an average sentence has hundreds or more valid low-probability corrections, whose total probabil- ity mass is substantial. Our analysis with Exact In- dex Match suggests that similar effects are appli- cable to Grammatical Error Detection as well. The proposal of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sakaguchi et al. (2016)</ref>, to emphasize fluency over grammaticality in reference correc- tions, only compounds this problem, as it results in a larger number of valid corrections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Implications of the LCB</head><p>We discuss the adverse effects of LCB not only on the reliability of RBMs, but on the development of GEC systems. We argue that evaluation with inad- equate reference coverage incentivizes systems to under-correct, and to mostly target errors that have few valid corrections (closed-class). We first show that low coverage can lead to under-correction ( §3.1), then show that modern systems make far fewer corrections to the source, compared to hu- mans ( §3.2). §3.3 shows that increasing the num- ber of references can alleviate this effect. §3. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> shows that open-class errors are more likely to be under-corrected than closed-class ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Motivating Analysis</head><p>For simplicity, we abstract away from the details of the learning model and assume that systems attempt to maximize an objective function, over some training or development data. We assume maximization is achieved by iterating over the samples, as with the Perceptron or SGD.</p><p>Assume the system is faced with a phrase it pre- dicts to be ungrammatical. Assume p detect is the probability this prediction is correct, and p correct is the probability it is able to predict a valid correc- tion for this phrase (including correctly identify- ing it as erroneous). Finally, assume evaluation is against M references with coverage p coverage (the probability that a valid correction will be found among M randomly sampled references).</p><p>We will now assume that the system may ei- ther choose to correct with the correction it finds the most likely or not at all. If it chooses not to correct, its probability of being rewarded (i.e., its output is in the reference set) is (1 − p detect ). Otherwise, its probability of being rewarded is p correct · p coverage . A system is disincentivized from altering the phrase in cases where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">pcorrect · pcoverage &lt; 1 − p detect<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We expect Condition (7) to frequently hold in cases that require non-trivial changes, which are characterized both by low p coverage (as non-trivial changes are often open-class), and by lower sys- tem performance.</p></div>

NUCLEB This is especially relevant to people who are overseas. Precision-oriented measures (e.g., F 0.5 ) penal- ize invalidly correcting more harshly than not cor- recting an ungrammatical sentence. In these cases, Condition <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(7)</ref> should be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">pcorrect·pcoverage−(1 − pcorrect · pcoverage) α &lt; 1−p detect</formula><p>where α is the ratio between the penalty for in- troducing a wrong correction and the reward for a valid correction.

To strengthen our claim, we exclude all non- alphanumeric characters, both within tokens or as separate tokens. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> for an example.</p><p>We consider three types of divergences between the source and the reference. First, we measure the extent to which words were changed: altered, deleted or added. To do so, we compute word alignment between the source and the reference, casting it as a weighted bipartite matching prob- lem. Edge weights are assigned to be the token edit distances. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Following word alignment, we define WORDCHANGE as the number of aligned words and unaligned words changed. Second, we quantify word order differences using Spearman's ρ between the order of the words in the source sen- tence and the order of their corresponding-aligned words in the correction. ρ = 0 where the word order is uncorrelated, and ρ = 1 where the or- ders exactly match. We report the average ρ over all source sentence pairs. Third, we report how many source sentences were split and how many concatenated by the reference and by the systems. One annotator was arbitrarily selected for the <ref type="figure">fig- ures</ref>.</p><p>Results. Results <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref> show that humans make considerably more changes than systems ac- cording to all measures of under-correction, both in terms of the number of sentences modified and the number of modifications within them. Differ- ences are often an order of magnitude large. For example, 36 reference sentences include 6 word changes, where the maximal number of sentences with 6 word changes by any system is 5. We find similar trends on the references of the TreeBank of Learner English (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Higher M Alleviates Under-correction</head><p>This section reports an experiment for determin- ing whether increasing the number of references in training indeed reduces under-correction.

The bottom figure presents the counts of source sentences (y-axis) concatenated (right bars) or split (left bars) by the references (striped col- umn) and the outputs (coloured columns). See Appendix A for a legend of the systems. Under all measures, the gold standard references make substantially more changes to the source sentences than any of the systems, in some cases an order of magnitude more. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The expected effect of oracle re-ranking on under- correction. Values represent the probability of altering a sub- string of the input e, which is a proxy to the expected cor- rection rate. L val is the valid alterations in the k-best list. PY (L val ) is the probability that a valid correction from the list is also in the reference set Y , PY (e, L val ) is the proba- bility that, in addition, the reference that keeps e is not in Y . When M increases, the expected correction rate is expected to increase only if e is an error and a valid correction of it is found in the k-best list.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L val empty L val not empty e valid e error Small M 0 PY (e, L val ) PY (L val ) Large M 0 0 1 Correction Rate = ↓ ↑</formula><p>Figure 4: The amount of sentences (y-axis) with a given number of words changed (x-axis) following oracle reranking with different M values (column colors), where the amount for M = 1 is subtracted from them. All references are ran- domly sampled except the "all" column that contains all ten references. In conclusion, tuning against additional refer- ences indeed reduces under-correction.</p><p>acle re-ranking has no effect and can be ignored. The corrections in the k-best list can then be par- titioned to those that keep e as it is; those that in- validly alter e; and those that validly alter e. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> presents the probability that e will be altered in the different cases. Analysis shows that under-correction is likely to decrease with M only in the case where e is an error and the k-best list contains a valid correction of it. Whenever the ref- erence allows both keeping e and altering e, the re-ranker selects keeping e.</p><p>Indeed, our experimental results show that word changes increase with M <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>, indicating that low coverage may play a role in the observed tendency of GEC systems to under-correct. No significant difference is found for word order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Under-correction by Error Types</head><p>In this section we study the prevalence of under- correction according to edit types, finding that open-class types of errors (such as replacing a word with another word) are more starkly under- corrected, than closed-class errors. Evaluating with low coverage RBMs does not incentivize sys- tems to address open-class errors (in fact, it disin- centivizes them to). Therefore, even if LCB is not the cause for this trend, current evaluation proce- dures may perpetuate it.</p><p>We use the data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bryant et al. (2017)</ref>, which automatically assigned types to each edit in the output of all CoNLL 2014 systems on the NUCLE test set. As a measure of under-correction ten- dency, we take the ratio between the mean num- ber of corrections produced by the systems and by the references. We note that this analysis does not consider whether the predicted correction is valid or not, but only how many of the errors of each type the systems attempted to correct.</p><p>We find that all edit types are under-predicted on average, but that the least under-predicted ones are mostly closed-class types. Concretely, the top quarter of error types consists of orthographical errors, plurality inflection of nouns, adjective in- flections to superlative or comparative forms and determiner selection. The bottom quarter includes the categories verb selection, noun selection, par- ticle/preposition selection, pronoun selection, and the type OTHER, which is a residual category. The only exception to this regularity is the closed- class punctuation selection type, which is found in the lower quarter. See Appendix E. This trend cannot be explained by assuming that common error types are targeted more. Indeed, error type frequency is slightly negatively corre- lated with the under-correction ratio (ρ=-0.29 p- value=0.16). A more probable account of this ef- fect is the disincentive of GEC systems to correct open-class error types, for which even valid cor- rections are unlikely to be rewarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Similar Effects on Simplification</head><p>We now turn to replicating our experiments on Text Simplification (TS). From a formal point of view, evaluation of the tasks is similar: the output is obtained by making zero or more edits to the source. RBMs are the standard for TS evaluation, much like they are in GEC.</p><p>Our experiments on TS demonstrate that simi- lar trends recur in this setting as well. The ten- dency of TS systems to under-predict changes to the source has already been observed by previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alva-Manchego et al., 2017)</ref>, showing that TS systems under-predict word additions, dele- tions, substitutions, and sequence shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Zhang and Lapata, 2017)</ref>, and have low edit distance from the source <ref type="bibr">(Narayan and Gardent, 2016)</ref>. Our experiments show that LCB may account for this under-prediction. Concretely, we show that (1) the distribution of valid references for a given sen- tence is long-tailed; (2) common evaluation mea- sures suffer from LCB, taking SARI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Xu et al., 2016)</ref> as an example RBM (similar trends are ob- tained with Accuracy); (3) under-prediction is al- leviated with M in oracle re-ranking experiments.</p><p>We crowd-sourced 2500 reference simplifica- tions for 47 sentences, using the corpus and the an- notation protocol of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Xu et al. (2016)</ref>, and applying UNSEENEST to estimate D x (Appendix B). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  4</ref> shows that the expected number of references is even greater in this setting.</p><p>Assessing the effect of M on SARI, we find that SARI diverges from Accuracy and F -score in that its multi-reference version is not a maximum over the single-reference scores, but some combi- nation of them. This can potentially increase cov- erage, but it also leads to an unintuitive situation: an output identical to a reference does not receive a perfect score, but rather the score depends on how similar the output is to the other references. A more in-depth analysis of SARI's handling of multiple references is found in Appendix F. In order to neutralize this effect of SARI, we also report results with MAX-SARI, which coincides with SARI on M = 1, and is defined as the maxi- mum single-reference SARI score for M &gt; 1. <ref type="figure">Figure 1c</ref> presents the coverage of SARI and MAX-SARI of a perfect TS system that selects a random correction from the estimated distribution of corrections using the same bootstrapping pro- tocol as in §2.1. We also include the SARI score of a "lucky perfect" system, that randomly selects one of the given references (the MAX-SARI score for such a system is 1). Results show that SARI has a coverage of about 0.45, and that this score is largely independent of M . The score of predict- ing one of the available references drops with the number of references, indicating that SARI scores may not be comparable across different M values.</p><p>We therefore restrict oracle re-ranking experi-   ments to MAX-SARI, conducting re-ranking ex- periments on k-best lists in two settings: Moses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Koehn et al., 2007</ref>) with k = 100, and a neu- ral model ( <ref type="bibr">Nisioi et al., 2017</ref>) with k = 12. Our results indeed show that under-prediction is alle- viated with M in both settings. For example, the least under-predicting model (the neural one) did not change 50 sentences with M = 1, but only 29 weren't changed with M = 8. See Appendix G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We argue that using low-coverage reference sets has adverse effects on the reliability of reference- based evaluation, with GEC and TS as a test case, and consequently on the incentives offered to sys- tems. We further argue that these effects can- not be overcome by re-scaling or increasing the number of references in a feasible way. The pa- per makes two methodological contributions to the monolingual translation evaluation literature: (1) a methodology for evaluating evaluation measures by the scores they assign a perfect system, us- ing a bootstrapping procedure; (2) a methodology for assessing the distribution of valid monolingual translations. Our findings demonstrate how these tools can help characterize the biases of existing systems and evaluation measures. We believe our findings and methodologies can be useful for sim- ilar tasks such as style conversion and automatic post-editing of raw MT outputs. We note that the LCB further jeopardizes the reliability of common validation experiments for RBMs, that assess the correlation between human and measure rankings of system outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Grundkiewicz et al., 2015)</ref>. Indeed, if outputs all simi- larly under-correct, correlation studies will not be affected by whether an RBM is sensitive to under- correction. Therefore, the tendency of RBMs to reward under-correction cannot be detected by such correlation experiments (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choshen and Abend, 2018a</ref>).</p><p>Our results underscore the importance of de- veloping alternative evaluation measures that tran- scend n-gram overlap, and use deeper analysis tools, e.g., by comparing the semantics of the ref- erence and the source to the output (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lo and Wu, 2011)</ref>.  have made progress towards this goal in proposing a reference-less grammaticality measure, using Grammatical Error Detection tools, as did <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Asano et al. (2017)</ref>, who added a fluency measure to the grammaticality. In a recent project <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Choshen and Abend, 2018b</ref>), we proposed a complementary measure that mea- sures the semantic faithfulness of the output to the source, in order to form a combined semantic mea- sure that bypasses the pitfalls of low coverage. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Frequency</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
