				<p>This paper derives an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to obtain an oracle summary of the compressive sum-marization paradigm in terms of ROUGE. The oracle summary is essential to reveal the upper bound performance of the paradigm. Experimental results on the DUC dataset showed that ROUGE scores of compressive oracles are significantly higher than those of extractive oracles and state-of-the-art summarization systems. These results reveal that com-pressive summarization is a promising paradigm and encourage us to continue with the research to produce informative summaries.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Compressive summarization, a joint model inte- grating sentence extraction and sentence compres- sion within a unified framework, has been attract- ing attention in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Martins and Smith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Almeida and Martins, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Qian and Liu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kikuchi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Yao et al., 2015)</ref>. Since compressive sum- marization methods can use a sub-sentence as an atomic unit, they can pack more information into summaries than extractive methods, which em- ploy sentences as atomic units. Thus, compres- sive summarization is essential when we want to produce summaries under tight length constraints. There are two approaches to compress entire doc- ument(s) to be grammatical; one is trimming the phrase structure trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011</ref>) and the other is trimming the dependency trees obtained from the document(s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Martins and Smith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Almeida and Martins, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Qian and Liu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kikuchi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Yao et al., 2015)</ref>. This paper focuses on the latter approach because recently it has been receiving much atten- tion.</p><p>To measure the performance of compressive summarization methods, ROUGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lin, 2004</ref>), an automatic evaluation metric, is widely used. ROUGE evaluates a system summary by exploit- ing a set of human-made reference summaries to give a score in the range <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>. When n-gram occurrences of the system summary agree with those in a set of reference summaries, the value is 1. However, system summaries cannot achieve ROUGE=1 since summarization systems cannot reproduce reference summaries in most cases. In other words, the maximum ROUGE score that can be achieved by compressive summarization is un- clear. As a result, researchers cannot know how much room for further improvement is left. Thus, it is beneficial to reveal the upper bound summary that achieves the maximum ROUGE score and can be produced by the systems. The upper bound summary is known as the oracle summary. To obtain the oracle summary on extractive summa- rization paradigms, several approaches have been proposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sipos et al. (2012)</ref> utilized a greedy al- gorithm, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kubina et al. (2013)</ref> utilized exhaus- tive search based on heuristics. However, their oracle summaries do not always retain the opti- mal (maximum) ROUGE score. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hirao et al. (2017)</ref> derived an Integer Linear Program- ming (ILP) formulation to obtain the optimal or- acle summary. Their oracle summary can help researchers to comprehend the strict limitation of the extractive summarization paradigm. However, their method cannot be applied to obtain compres- sive oracle summaries.</p><p>To reveal the ultimate limitation of the compres- sive summarization paradigm, we propose an ILP formulation to obtain a compressive oracle sum- mary that maximizes the ROUGE score. We con-ducted experimental evaluation on the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004 dataset. The result demonstrated that ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries completely outper- formed those of extractive oracle summaries and those of state-of-the-art summarization methods. This indicates that compressive summarization is a promising paradigm for leveraging research re- sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Definition of Compressive Oracle Summaries</head><p>Before defining compressive oracle summary, we briefly describe ROUGE n . Given K reference summaries R={R 1 , . . . , R K } and a system sum- mary S. Let G={g n 1 , . . . , g n M } be the set of all n-grams appearing in reference summaries. Let |G|=M . ROUGE n is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ROUGE n (R, S) = K k=1 M j=1 min{N (g n j , R k ), N (g n j , S)} K k=1 M j=1 N (g n j , R k )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>g n j represents the j-th n-gram appearing in refer- ence summaries. N (g n j , R k ) and N (g n j , S) are the number of occurrences of n-gram g n j in R k and S, respectively. Thus, compressive oracle summaries are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">O = arg max S⊆T ROUGE n (R, S) s.t. (S) ≤ L max . (2)</formula><p>T is the set of all valid word subsequences 1 ob- tained from sentences contained in the input docu- ment(s), and L max is the length limitation of the oracle summary. (S) indicates the number of words in the summary. Neither approximation nor exact algorithms are known for solving this prob- lem.</p></div>

Since we can trim their depen- dency trees without loss of grammatical consis- tency, Thus, we employ the trees in our compres- sive summarization framework. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows examples.</p></div>

Equation <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> is the objective func- tion that corresponds to maximization of the nu- merator of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>. z k,j is the count of the j-th n-gram that is contained in both the k-th refer- ence summary and the oracle summary. Equation (4) ensures that the length of the oracle summary is less than L max . b i,u is a binary decision variable indicating whether u-th chunk in i-th sentence is contained in an oracle summary or not. i,u indi- cates the number of the words in u-th chunk in the i-th sentence. D is a set of sentences and E i is the number of chunks in the i-th sentence. Equa- tions (5) and (6) represent min operation in equa- tion (1). w i,v is the v-th possible word sequence whose length is n and that is contained in the i- th sentence, and m i,v is a binary decision vari- able indicating whether w i,v is contained in the oracle summary or not. T (g n j ) is a set of tuples consisting of indices (i, v) whose word sequence corresponds to g n j , i.e., [Most] c1,1 <ref type="bibr">[dolphins]</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Examples of trees that represent dependency relations between chunks, and word sequences (whose length is 2). Chunks are enclosed in square brackets. Note that we disregard word sequences that are generated by destroying the structure of chunks such as "live every" in S 1 , "dolphins in" in S 2 , "live wild" in S 3 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T (g n j )={(i, v)|w i,v =g n j }. Thus, z k,j = min{N (g n j , R k ), N (g n j , S)}.</formula><p>of a set of rooted subtrees of the sentences in the entire document(s). Function parent (i, u) returns the index of the parent chunk of the u-th chunk in the dependency tree obtained from the i-th sen- tence. Equations <ref type="formula">(8)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(9)</ref> represent the de- pendency relation between n-grams and chunks. When we include w i,v in the oracle summary, we have to include all chunks that contain the words in w i,v . In addition, when the above chunks have gap(s), we have to drop chunk(s) within the gap(s). Here, V i (w i,v ) is a set of indices of chunks that includes words in w i,v , and U i (w i,v ) is a set of indices of chunks within the gap(s), defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{h| min(V i (w i,v )) &lt; h &lt; max(V i (w i,v ))} and h / ∈ V i (w i,v ).</formula><p>We give an example to show how chunks and word sequences are related. When we pack a bigram "live in" in an oracle summary, there are four candidates in the source document <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Word subsequences, w 1,6 ,w 2,5 ,w 2,6 and w 3.9 match "live in". Thus, T (live in) = {(1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 9)}. Here, when we want to pack w 2,6 into the oracle summary, we have to pack both chunks c 2,2 and c 2,4 (b 2,2 = b 2,4 = 1) because U 2 (w 2,6 ) = {2, 4}. Then, we have to drop chunk c 2,3 (b 2,3 = 0) because c 2,3 is within the gap between chunks c 2,2 and c 2,4 (V 2 (w 2,6 ) = 3). Similarly, when we pack w 3,9 into an oracle summary, we have to pack both chunks c 3,3 and c 3,5 and drop chunk c 3,4 . However, this compres- sion is not allowed since there is no dependency relationship between c 3,3 and c 3,5 .</p><p>After solving the ILP problem, we can ob- tain compressive oracle summaries by collecting chunks according to b i,u =1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>To investigate the potential limitation of the com- pressive summarization paradigm, we compare ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries with those of extractive oracle summaries and those obtained from state-of-the-art summariza- tion systems. Extractive oracle summaries are ob- tained by solving the ILP formulation proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hirao et al., 2017</ref> sentences in the dataset to obtain dependency re- lations between words, and then we transformed them into trees that represent the dependency re- lations between chunks by applying Filippova's rules ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Filippova and Strube, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Filippova and Altun, 2013)</ref>. To solve the ILP problem, we uti- lized CPLEX version 12.5.1.0. We obtained and evaluated oracle summaries based on three variants of ROUGE, ROUGE 1 , ROUGE 2 and ROUGE-SU0, with the following conditions 3 : (1) ROUGE 1 , utilizing unigrams ex- cluding stopwords (2) ROUGE 2 , utilizing bigrams with stopwords, and (3) ROUGE-SU0, which is an extension of ROUGE n , utilizing unigram and bi- gram (excluding skip-bigram) statistics. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows ROUGE scores of compressive and extractive oracle summaries and those of RegSum ( ) that achieved the best ROUGE <ref type="bibr">1 and ICSISumm (Gillick and Favre, 2009;</ref>) that achieved the best ROUGE 2 on the DUC-2004 dataset, respectively.</p></div>

The dif- ferences are 8.3 points, 4.4 points and 4.9 points for ROUGE 1 , ROUGE 2 , ROUGE-SU0, respectively. As one of the reasons for the above results, com- pressive oracle summaries have a much larger number of (sub-)sentences than extractive oracle summaries for the same length limitation. This is an advantage of compressive summarization over extractive summarization. However, we have to note that compressive or- acle summaries optimized to ROUGE 1 may not be desirable since they are produced by com- pressing sentences by ignoring contexts. In fact, they obtained remarkable gain for ROUGE 1 score (8.3 points), while they obtained modest gains in ROUGE 2 and ROUGE-SU0 (0.7 and 3.6 points, re- spectively). This may suggest that the resultant summaries overfit to the unigrams in the reference summaries.</p><p>We compare ROUGE scores of compressive or- acle summaries with those of system summaries, ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries completely outperformed those of state-of-the-art systems. The differences are in a range from 11 to 17 points.</p><p>The results demonstrated that compressive sum- marization is a promising approach to produce more informative summaries, and room still exists for further improvement.
