				<p>In this paper, we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a two-phase approach. The first phase learns representations that capture regularities underlying web text. The representation is integrated as features into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger. Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the second phase. Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach achieves 93.15% average tagging accuracy , which is the best accuracy reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Analysing and extracting useful information from the web has become an increasingly important re- search direction for the NLP community, where many tasks require part-of-speech (POS) tag- ging as a fundamental preprocessing step. How- ever, state-of-the-art POS taggers in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Collins, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shen et al., 2007)</ref> are mainly opti- mized on the the Penn Treebank (PTB), and when shifted to web data, tagging accuracies drop sig- nificantly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Petrov and McDonald, 2012</ref>).</p><p>The problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation, where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data). Exploiting useful information from the web data can be the key to improving web domain tagging. Towards this end, we adopt the idea of learning representations which has been demonstrated useful in capturing hidden regular- ities underlying the raw input data (web text, in our case).</p><p>Our approach consists of two phrases. In the pre-training phase, we learn an encoder that con- verts the web text into an intermediate represen- tation, which acts as useful features for prediction tasks. We integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ratnaparkhi, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Collins, 2002</ref>) in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy- first POS tagger. We choose the easy-first tagging approach since it has been demonstrated to give higher accuracies than the standard left-to-right POS tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ma et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>In the fine-tuning phase, the parameters of the network are optimized on a set of labelled train- ing data using guided learning. The learned model preserves the property of preferring to tag easy words first. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate guided learning for neural networks.</p><p>The idea of learning representations from un- labelled data and then fine-tuning a model with such representations according to some supervised criterion has been studied before ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Glorot et al., 2011</ref>). While most previous work focus on in-domain se- quential labelling or cross-domain classification tasks, we are the first to learn representations for web-domain structured prediction. Previous work treats the learned representations either as model parameters that are further optimized in super- vised fine-tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Collobert et al., 2011</ref>) or as fixed features that are kept unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Glorot et al., 2011)</ref>. In this work, we investigate both strategies and give empirical comparisons in the cross-domain setting. Our re- sults suggest that while both strategies improve in-domain tagging accuracies, keeping the learned representation unchanged consistently results in better cross-domain accuracies.</p><p>We conduct experiments on the official data set provided by the SANCL 2012 shared task <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Petrov and McDonald, 2012)</ref>. Our method achieves a 93.15% average accuracy across the web-domain, which is the best result reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntac- tic parsers. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/majineu/TWeb.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Learning from Web Text</head><p>Unsupervised learning is often used for training encoders that convert the input data to abstract rep- resentations (i.e. encoding vectors). Such repre- sentations capture hidden properties of the input, and can be used as features for supervised tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bengio, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ranzato et al., 2007</ref>). Among the many proposed encoders, we choose the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been suc- cessfully used in many tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee et al., 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hinton et al., 2006</ref>). In this section, we give some background on RBMs and then show how they can be used to learn representations of the web text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Restricted Boltzmann Machine</head><p>The RBM is a type of graphical model that con- tains two layers of binary stochastic units v ∈ {0, 1} V and h ∈ {0, 1} H , corresponding to a set of visible and hidden variables, respectively. The RBM defines the joint probability distribution over v and h by an energy function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E(v, h) = −c h − b v − h Wv,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>which is factorized by a visible bias b ∈ R V , a hidden bias c ∈ R H and a weight matrix W ∈ R H×V . The joint distribution P (v, h) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (v, h) = 1 Z exp(E(v, h)),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Z is the partition function. The affine form of E with respect to v and h implies that the visible variables are conditionally independent with each other given the hidden layer units, and vice versa. This yields the conditional distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (v|h) = V j=1 P (v j |h) P (h|v) = H i=1 P (h i |v) P (v j = 1|h) = σ(b j + W ·j h)<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (h i = 1|v) = σ(c j + W i· v)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here σ denotes the sigmoid function. Parameters of RBMs θ = {b, c, W} can be trained efficiently using contrastive divergence learning (CD), see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hinton, 2002</ref>) for detailed descriptions of CD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Encoding Web Text with RBM</head><p>Most of the indicative features for POS disam- biguation can be found from the words and word combinations within a local context <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ratnaparkhi, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Collins, 2002</ref>). Inspired by this observa- tion, we apply the RBM to learn feature repre- sentations from word n-grams. More specifically, given the i th word w i of a sentence, we apply RBMs to model the joint distribution of the n-gram (w i−l , · · · , w i+r ), where l and r denote the left and right window, respectively. Note that the vis- ible units of RBMs are binary. While in our case, each visible variable corresponds to a word, which may take on tens-of-thousands of different values. Therefore, the RBM need to be re-factorized to make inference tractable. We utilize the Word Representation RBM (WR- RBM) factorization proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dahl et al. (2012)</ref>. The basic idea is to share word representa- tions across different positions in the input n-gram while using position-dependent weights to distin- guish between different word orders.</p><p>Let w k be the k-th entry of lexicon L, and w k be its one-hot representation (i.e., only the k-th component of w k is 1, and all the others are 0). Let v (j) represents the j-th visible variable of the WRRBM, which is a vector of length |L|. Then v (j) = w k means that the j-th word in the n-gram is w k . Let D ∈ R D×|L| be a projection matrix, then Dw k projects w k into a D-dimensional real value vector (embedding). For each position j, there is a weight matrix W (j) ∈ R H×D , which is used to model the interaction between the hid- den layer and the word projection in position j. The visible biases are also shared across different positions (b (j) = b ∀j) and the energy function is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E(v, h) = −c h − n j=1 (b v (j) + h W (j) Dv (j) ),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which yields the conditional distributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (v|h) = n j=1 P (v (j) |h) P (h|v) = i=1 P (h i |v) P (h i = 1|v) = σ(c i + n j=1 W (j) i· Dv (j) ) (6) P (v (j) = w k |h) = 1 Z exp(b w k + h W (j) Dw k )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Again Z is the partition function. The parameters {b, c, D, W (1) , . . . , W (n) } can be trained using a Metropolis-Hastings-based CD variant and the learned word representations also capture certain syntactic information; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dahl et al. (2012)</ref> for more details.</p><p>Note that one can stack standard RBMs on top of a WRRBM to construct a Deep Belief Network (DBN). By adopting greedy layer-wise training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hinton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bengio et al., 2007)</ref>, DBNs are capable of modelling higher order non-linear relations between the input, and has been demon- strated to improve performance for many com- puter vision tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hinton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bengio et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al., 2009a</ref>). However, in this work we do not observe further improvement by em- ploying DBNs. This may partly be due to the fact that unlike computer vision tasks, the input struc- ture of POS tagging or other sequential labelling tasks is relatively simple, and a single non-linear layer is enough to model the interactions within the input ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang and Manning, 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Neural Network for POS Disambiguation</head><p>We integrate the learned WRRBM into a neural network, which serves as a scorer for POS dis- ambiguation. The main challenge to designing the neural network structure is: on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model's discriminative power by utilizing well- established POS tagging features, such as those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ratnaparkhi (1996)</ref>. Our approach is to leverage the two sources of information in one neural network by combining them though a shared output layer, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Under the output layer, the network consists of two modules: the web-feature mod- ule, which incorporates knowledge from the pre- trained WRRBM, and the sparse-feature module, which makes use of other POS tagging features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Web-Feature Module</head><p>The web-feature module, shown in the lower left part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, consists of a input layer and two hidden layers. The input for the this module is the word n-gram (w i−l , . . . , w i+r ), the form of which is identical to the training data of the pre-trained WRRBM.</p><p>The first layer is a linear projection layer, where each word in the input is projected into a D- dimensional real value vector using the projection operation described in Section 2.2. The output of this layer o 1 w is the concatenation of the projec- tions of w i−l , . . . , w i+r :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">o 1 w =    M 1 w w i−l . . . M 1 w w i+r    (8)</formula><p>Here M 1 w denotes the parameters of the first layer of the web-feature module, which is a D × |L| projection matrix.</p><p>The second layer is a sigmoid layer to model non-linear relations between the word projections:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">o 2 w = σ(M 2 w o 1 w + b 2 w )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Parameters of this layer include: a bias vector b 2 w ∈ R H and a weight matrix M 2 w ∈ R H×nD . The web-feature module enables us to explore the learned WRRBM in various ways. First, it al- lows us to investigate knowledge from the WR- RBM incrementally. We can choose to use only the word representations of the learned WRRBM. This can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix D of the learned WRRBM:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">M 1 w ← D.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Alternatively, we can choose to use the hidden states of the WRRBM, which can be treated as the representations of the input n-gram. This can be achieved by also initializing the parameters of the second layer of the web-feature module using the position-dependent weight matrix and hidden bias of the learned WRRBM:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">b 2 w ← c (11) M 2 w ← (W (1) , . . . , W (n) )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Second, the web-feature module also allows us to make a comparison between whether or not to further adjust the pre-trained representation in the supervised fine-tuning phase, which corresponds to the supervised learning strategies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Turian et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011)</ref>, respectively. To our knowledge, no investigations have been pre- sented in the literature on this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Sparse-Feature Module</head><p>The sparse-feature module, as shown in the lower right part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, is designed to incorporate commonly-used tagging features. The input for this module is a vector of boolean values Φ(x) = (f 1 (x), . . . , f k (x)), where x denotes the partially tagged input sentence and f i (x) denotes a fea- ture function, which returns 1 if the correspond- ing feature fires and 0 otherwise. The first layer of this module is a linear transformation layer, which converts the high dimensional sparse vector into a fixed-dimensional real value vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">o s = M s Φ(x) + b s<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Depending on the specific task being considered, the output of this layer can be further fed to other non-linear layers, such as a sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent layer, to model more complex relations. For POS tagging, we found that a simple linear layer yields satisfactory accuracies. The web-feature and sparse-feature modules are combined by a linear output layer, as shown in the upper part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The value of each unit in this layer denotes the score of the corresponding POS tag.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">o o = M o o w o s + b o<label>(14)</label></formula><p>In some circumstances, probability distribution over POS tags might be a more preferable form of output. Such distribution can be easily obtained by adding a soft-max layer on top of the output layer to perform a local normalization, as done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Easy-first POS tagging with Neural Network</head><p>The neural network proposed in Section 3 is used for POS disambiguation by the easy-first POS tag- ger. Parameters of the network are trained using guided learning, where learning and search inter- act with each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Easy-first POS tagging</head><p>Pseudo-code of easy-first tagging is shown in Al- gorithm 1. Rather than tagging a sentence from left to right, easy-first tagging is based on a deter- ministic process, repeatedly selecting the easiest word to tag. Here "easiness" is evaluated based on a statistical model. At each step, the algorithm adopts a scorer, the neural network in our case, to assign a score to each possible word-tag pair (w, t), and then selects the highest score one ( ˆ w, ˆ t) to tag (i.e., tagˆwtagˆ tagˆw withˆtwithˆ withˆt). The algorithm repeats until all words are tagged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Training</head><p>The training algorithm repeats for several itera- tions over the training data, which is a set of sen- tences labelled with gold standard POS tags. In each iteration, the procedure shown in Algorithm 2 is applied to each sentence in the training set.</p><p>At each step during the processing of a training example, the algorithm calculates a margin loss based on two word-tag pairs (w, t) and ( ˆ w, ˆ t) (line 4 ∼ line 6). (w, t) denotes the word-tag pair that has the highest model score among those that are inconsistent with the gold standard, while ( ˆ w, ˆ t) denotes the one that has the highest model score among those that are consistent with the gold stan- dard. If the loss is zero, the algorithm continues to process the next untagged word. Otherwise, pa- rameters are updated using back-propagation.</p><p>The standard back-propagation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rumelhart et al., 1988</ref>) cannot be applied directly. This is because the standard loss is calculated based on a unique input vector. This condition does not hold in our case, becausê w and w may refer to different words, which means that the margin loss in line 6 of Algorithm 2 is calculated based on two different input vectors, denoted byˆwbyˆ byˆw and w, respectively.</p><p>We solve this problem by decomposing the mar- gin loss in line 6 into two parts:</p><p>• 1 + nn(w, t), which is associated with w;</p><p>• −nn( ˆ w, ˆ t), which is associated withˆwwithˆ withˆw.</p><p>In this way, two separate back-propagation up- dates can be used to update the model's parameters (line 8 ∼ line 11). For the special case wherê w and w do refer to the same word w, it can be easily verified that the two separate back-propagation up- dates equal to the standard back-propagation with a loss 1 + nn(w, t) − nn(w, ˆ t) on the input w. The algorithm proposed here belongs to a gen- eral framework named guided learning, where search and learning interact with each other. The algorithm learns not only a local classifier, but also the inference order. While previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhang and Clark, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010)</ref> apply guided learning to train a linear classifier by using variants of the percep- tron algorithm, we are the first to combine guided learning with a neural network, by using a margin loss and a modified back-propagation algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Baseline</head><p>We reimplemented the greedy easy-first POS tag- ger of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ma et al. (2013)</ref>, which is used for all the experiments. While the tagger of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ma et al. (2013)</ref> utilizes a linear scorer, our tagger adopts the neural network as its scorer. The neural network of our baseline tagger only contains the sparse-feature module. We use this baseline to examine the per- formance of a tagger trained purely on the source domain. Feature templates are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, which are based on those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ratnaparkhi (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shen et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>Accuracies of the baseline tagger are shown in the upper part of <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. Compared with the performance of the official baseline (row 4 of Ta- ble 6), which is evaluated based on the output of BerkeleyParser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Petrov et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Petrov and Klein, 2007)</ref>, our baseline tagger achieves com- parable accuracies on both the source and target domain data. With data preprocessing, the aver- age accuracy boosts to about 92.02 on the test set of the target domain. This is consistent with pre- vious work <ref type="bibr">(Le Roux et al., 2011</ref>), which found that for noisy data such as web domain text, data cleaning is a effective and necessary step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Exploring the Learned Knowledge</head><p>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation, which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation, which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web- feature module by the learned WRRBM. In each case, there can be two different training strate- gies depending on whether the learned representa- tions are further adjusted or kept unchanged dur- ing the fine-turning phrase. Experimental results under the 4 combined settings on the development sets are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2, 3 and 4</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Tagging accuracies on the source- domain data. "word" and "ngram" denote using word representations and n-gram representations, respectively. "fixed" and "adjust" denote that the learned representation are kept unchanged or fur- ther adjusted in supervised learning, respectively.    x-axis denotes the size of the training data and y- axis denotes tagging accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Effect of the Training Strategy</head><p>From <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> we can see that when knowl- edge from the pre-trained WRRBM is incorpo-  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Performance on the email domain.</p><p>rated, both the training strategies ("word-fixed" vs "word-adjusted", "ngram-fixed" vs "ngram- adjusted") improve accuracies on the source do- main, which is consistent with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al., 2011</ref>). In addition, adjusting the learned representation or keeping them fixed does not result in too much dif- ference in tagging accuracies.</p><p>On the web-domain data, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> and 4, we found that leaving the learned representation unchanged ("word-fixed", "ngram-fixed") yields consistently higher performance gains. This re- sult is to some degree expected. Intuitively, unsu- pervised pre-training moves the parameters of the WRRBM towards the region where properties of the web domain data are properly modelled. How- ever, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the source domain, adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimiz- ing source domain tagging accuracies would dis- rupt its ability in modelling the web domain data. Therefore, a better idea is to keep the representa- tion unchanged so that we can learn a function that maps the general web-text properties to its syntac- tic categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Word and N-gram Representation</head><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 2, 3 and 4</ref>, we can see that adopting the ngram-level representation consis- tently achieves better performance compared with using word representations only ("word-fixed" vs "ngram-fixed", "word-adjusted" vs "ngram- adjusted"). This result illustrates that the ngram- level knowledge captures more complex interac- tions of the web text, which cannot be recovered by using only word embeddings. Similar result was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dahl et al. (2012)</ref>, who found that using both the word embeddings and the hid- den units of a tri-gram WRRBM as additional fea- tures for a CRF chunker yields larger improve- ments than using word embeddings only.</p><p>Finally, more detailed accuracies under the 4 settings on the email domain are shown in <ref type="table">Table  4</ref>. We can see that the improvement of using word  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Effect of unlabelled data. "+acc" denotes improvement in tagging accuracy and "cov" de- notes the lexicon coverages.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">RBM-E RBM-W RBM-M</formula><p>representations mainly comes from better accu- racy of out-of-vocabulary (oov) words. By con- trast, using n-gram representations improves the performance on both oov and non-oov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Effect of Unlabelled Domain Data</head><p>In some circumstances, we may know beforehand that the target domain data belongs to a certain sub-domain, such as the email domain. In such cases, it might be desirable to train WRRBM using data only on that domain. We conduct experiments to test whether using the target domain data to train the WRRBM yields better performance com- pared with using mixed data from all sub-domains. We trained 3 WRRBMs using the email do- main data (RBM-E), weblog domain data (RBM- W) and mixed domain data (RBM-M), respec- tively, with each data set consisting of 300k sen- tences. Tagging performance and lexicon cover- ages of each data set on the development sets are shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. We can see that using the target domain data achieves similar improvements com- pared with using the mixed data. However, for the email domain, RBM-W yields much smaller im- provement compared with RBM-E, and vice versa. From the lexicon coverages, we can see that the sub-domains varies significantly. The results sug- gest that using mixed data can achieve almost as good performance as using the target sub-domain data, while using mixed data yields a much more robust tagger across all sub-domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Final Results</head><p>The best result achieved by using a 4-gram WR- RBM, (w i−2 , . . . , w i+1 ), with 300 hidden units learned on 1,000k web domain sentences are shown in row 3 of <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. Performance of the top 2 systems of the SANCL 2012 task are also shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. Our greedy tagger achieves 93% tagging accuracy, which is significantly better than the baseline's 92.02% accuracy (p &lt; 0.05 by Mc- Nemar's test). Moreover, we achieve the high- est tagging accuracy reported so far on this data set, surpassing those achieved using parser combi- nations based on self-training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Le Roux et al., 2012)</ref>. In addition, different from Le <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Roux et al. (2012)</ref>, we do not use any external resources in data cleaning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Learning representations has been intensively studied in computer vision tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bengio et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al., 2009a</ref>). In NLP, there is also much work along this line. In particular, Col- lobert et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2011)</ref>  Their work differs from ours in that their ap- proaches learn representations from the feature vectors for sentiment classification, which might be of thousands of dimensions. Such high di- mensional input gives rise to high computational cost and it is not clear whether those approaches can be applied to large scale unlabelled data, with hundreds of millions of training examples. Our method learns representations from only word n- grams with n ranging from 3 to 5, which can be easily applied to large scale-data. In addition, while Titov (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Glorot et al. (2011)</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Main results. "baseline-raw" and "baseline-clean" denote performance of our baseline tagger on the raw and cleaned data, respectively. "best-clean" is best performance achieved using a 4-gram WRRBM. The lower part shows accuracies of the official baseline and that of the top 2 participants.</p><p>(ASO) method of Ando and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Zhang (2005)</ref>. The idea is to project the original feature representa- tions into low dimensional representations, which yields a high-accuracy classifier on the target do- main. The new representations are induced based on the auxiliary tasks defined on unlabelled data together with a dimensionality reduction tech- nique. Such auxiliary tasks can be specific to the supervised task. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Plank (2009)</ref>, for many NLP tasks, defining the auxiliary tasks is a non-trivial engineering problem. Compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blitzer et al. (2006)</ref>, the advantage of using RBMs is that it learns representations in a pure unsuper- vised manner, which is much simpler.</p><p>Besides learning representations, another line of research addresses domain-adaptation by in- stance re-weighting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bickel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jiang and Zhai, 2007)</ref> or feature re-weighting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Satpal and Sarawagi, 2007)</ref>. Those methods assume that each example x that has a non-zero probability on the source domain must have a non-zero proba- bility on the target domain, and vice-versa. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Titov (2011)</ref>, such an assumption is likely to be too restrictive since most NLP tasks adopt word-based or lexicon-based features that vary significantly across different domains.</p><p>Regarding using neural networks for sequential labelling, our approach shares similarity with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011)</ref>. In particular, we both use a non-linear layer to model complex relations underling word embeddings. However, our net- work differs from theirs in the following aspects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011)</ref> model the dependency be- tween neighbouring tags in a generative manner, by employing a transition score A ij . Training the score involves a forward process of complexity O(nT 2 ), where T denotes the number of tags. Our model captures such a dependency in a discrimina- tive manner, by just adding tag-related features to the sparse-feature module. In addition, Collobert et al. (2011) train their network by maximizing the training set likelihood, while our approach is to minimize the margin loss using guided learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We built a web-domain POS tagger using a two-phase approach. We used a WRRBM to learn the representation of the web text and incorporate the representation in a neural net- work, which is trained using guided learning for easy-first POS tagging. Experiment showed that our approach achieved significant improve- ment in tagging the web domain text. In ad- dition, we found that keeping the learned repre- sentations unchanged yields better performance compared with further optimizing them on the source domain data. We release our tools at https://github.com/majineu/TWeb.</p><p>For future work, we would like to investigate the two-phase approach to more challenging tasks, such as web domain syntactic parsing. We be- lieve that high-accuracy web domain taggers and parsers would benefit a wide range of downstream tasks such as machine translation 2 .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The proposed neural network.
