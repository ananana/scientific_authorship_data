				<p>Domain adaptation is an active field of research in statistical machine translation (SMT), but so far most work has ignored the distinction between the topic and genre of documents. In this paper we quantify and disentangle the impact of genre and topic differences on translation quality by introducing a new data set that has controlled topic and genre distributions. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis showing that differences across topics only explain to a limited degree translation performance differences across gen-res, and that genre-specific errors are more attributable to model coverage than to sub-optimal scoring of translation candidates.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Training corpora for statistical machine translation (SMT) are typically collected from a wide variety of sources and therefore have varying textual char- acteristics such as writing style and vocabulary. The test set, on the other hand, is much smaller and usually more homogeneous. The resulting mis- match between the test data and the majority of the training data can lead to suboptimal translation performance. In such situations, it is beneficial to adapt the translation system to the translation task at hand, which is exactly the challenge of domain adaptation in SMT.</p><p>The concept of a domain, however, is not unam- biguously defined across existing domain adapta- tion methods. Commonly used interpretations of domains neglect the fact that topic and genre are two distinct properties of text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee and Myaeng, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Stein and Meyer Zu Eissen, 2006</ref>). Two texts can discuss a similar topic, but using different styles. Since most work on domain adaptation in SMT uses in-domain and out-of-domain data that differ on both the topic and the genre level, it is un- clear whether the proposed solutions address topic or genre differences.</p><p>In this work we take a step back and disentan- gle the concepts topic and genre, then we analyze and quantify their effect on SMT, which we be- lieve is a necessary step towards further improv- ing domain adaptation for SMT. Concretely, we address the following questions:</p><p>(i) Can we clarify the ambiguous use of the con- cept domain with regard to adaptation in SMT?</p><p>(ii) Which of two intrinsic text properties, topic and genre, presents a larger challenge to SMT?</p><p>(iii) To what extent do topic and genre differ with respect to SMT model coverage and observed out-of-vocabulary (OOV) types?</p><p>To answer these questions, we introduce a new data set with controlled topic-genre distributions, which we use for an in-depth analysis of the im- pact of topic and genre differences on SMT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Topic and genre differences in SMT</head><p>The definition of a domain varies across work on domain adaptation and is often imprecise. In this work we avoid using this ambiguous term, and in- stead focus on the text properties topic and genre.</p><p>Topic is the general subject of a document. Top- ics can be determined on multiple levels, rang- ing from very broad to more detailed. Examples of topics include sports, politics, and science (high-level), or football and tennis (low-level).</p><p>Genre is harder to define, as there is no single definition in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Swales, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Karlgren</ref> <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">, Topic   Newswire sentence  User-generated sentence   Culture  The 12 contestants competed during a May 3rd  Prime before a panel of judges and millions of  viewers across the Arab world.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2004</head><p>). Based on previous definitions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Santini (2004)</ref> concludes that the term genre is used as a concept complementary to topic, covering the non-topical text properties function, style, and text type. Like topics, genres can also ex- hibit different levels of granularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lee, 2001</ref>). Examples of genres include formal or informal text (high-level), and newswire, editorials, and user-generated text (low-level).</p><p>Topic and genre are both intrinsic properties of texts, but most work on domain adaptation uses provenance or subcorpus information to adapt SMT systems to a specific translation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Foster and Kuhn, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Duh et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bisazza et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sennrich, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bisazza and Federico, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Haddow and Koehn, 2012</ref>, among others). In recent years, some work has explicitly addressed topic adaptation for SMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Eidelman et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hewavitharana et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasler et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hasler et al., 2014c</ref>) using latent Dirich- let allocation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hasler et al. (2014b)</ref> showed that provenance and topic can serve as complements to each other, the effects of genre and topic on SMT have not been systemati- cally studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Gen&amp;Topic benchmark set</head><p>To analyze the impact of genre and topic differ- ences in SMT, we need a test set where both dimensions are controlled as much as possible.</p><p>Unfortunately, currently available and commonly used benchmarks meet this requirement only to a limited degree. For instance, while the NIST OpenMT sets do contain documents drawn from two genres, newswire and web, both genres ex- hibit a different distribution over topics, i.e., the same topic might not be equally represented across genres, and vice versa.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Statistics of the Arabic-English Gen&amp;Topic data set containing five topics and two genres: newswire (NW) and user-generated (UG) text. Tokens are counted on the Arabic side.</p><p>Gen&amp;Topic data set, that contains documents with controlled topic and genre distributions. This benchmark set consists of manually translated news articles crawled from the web with their corresponding, manually translated readers' com- ments and thus comprises the genres newswire (NW) and user-generated (UG) text. Since each pair of NW and UG documents originates from the same article, we can assume that both documents discuss the same topic, for which labels are pro- vided by the source websites. By including com- parable numbers of tokens per genre for each arti- cle, we enforce equal topic distributions across the genres. Two examples of NW-UG pairs are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Note that the selected UG sentences in the Gen&amp;Topic data set are well-formulated com- ments rather than dialog-oriented content such as SMS or chat messages, which pose substantially larger challenges to SMT than the Gen&amp;Topic comments (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wees et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>For parameter estimation purposes, we split the complete benchmark into a development and a test set, such that the development set contains approx- imately one-third of the data, while ensuring that articles in each set originate from non-overlapping time periods. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> lists the specifications of the complete benchmark, which we make available for download 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Quantifying the impact of genre and topic differences on SMT</head><p>To quantify the impact of multiple genres and top- ics in a test corpus, we run a series of experiments in which we measure translation quality, model coverage, and observed OOV types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Translation quality</head><p>We first run a translation experiment on the Gen&amp;Topic test set using our in-house phrase- based SMT system similar to <ref type="bibr">Moses (Koehn et al., 2007)</ref>. Features include lexicalized reordering, linear distortion with limit 5, and lexical weight- ing. In addition, we use a 5-gram linearly inter- polated language model, trained on 1.6B words with Kneser-Ney smoothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen and Goodman, 1999)</ref>, that covers all topics and genres contained in the benchmark. We tune our system on the Gen&amp;Topic development set using pairwise rank- ing optimization (PRO) (Hopkins and May, 2011). Naturally, performance differences across top- ics and genres depend on the degree to which both are represented in the parallel training data. To allow for fair comparison, we down-sample our available training data to be as balanced as pos- sible in terms of topics and genres. The resulting system is trained on approximately 200K sentence pairs with 6M source tokens per genre, as much as is available for UG. All data originates from the same web sources as the documents in the bench- mark. Our more competitive system (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wees et al., 2015</ref>) that uses also LDC-distributed data yields slightly higher BLEU scores, but is more fa- vorable for NW than for UG translation tasks. Due to the strict data requirements in terms of topic and genre distributions, as well as the availability of sizable parallel training data, our current experi- mental set-up covers Arabic-English only.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>: Arabic-to-English BLEU scores on the Gen&amp;Topic test set (1 reference translation) per topic-genre combination. Tuning was done on the complete Gen&amp;Topic development set. Variations in translation quality are represented by average pairwise BLEU score differences. lation performance fluctuates much more across genres than across topics: There is a large gap of 3.9 BLEU points between NW and UG, which can be entirely attributed to actual genre differences given the construction of the Gen&amp;Topic data set and the use of down-sampled training data. On the other hand, the gap between different topics is only 0.6 BLEU points on average, and at most 1.1 (between culture and politics). A translation qual- ity gap between genres has also been observed in past OpenMT evaluation campaigns. However, as the NIST benchmarks have not been controlled for topics across genres, it is unclear to what extent this gap can be attributed to genre differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Model coverage analysis</head><p>Next, to explain the large performance gap be- tween genres, we analyze the phrase lengths within Viterbi translations, source phrase and phrase pair recall, and phrase pair OOV of the Gen&amp;Topic test set <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>.</p><p>Average source-side phrase length We first compute the average number of source words con- tained in the phrases that our SMT system uses to produce the 1-best translations for the Gen&amp;Topic test set. One can see that UG is translated with shorter phrases than NW, and that differences be- tween genres are more pronounced than among topics. This difference, in turn, can be due to unreliable translation probabilities but also to the mere lack of translation options in the models. We quantify the impact of the latter by measuring phrase recall on each test portion.</p><p>Phrase recall and phrase pair OOV To com- pute phrase recall, we first automatically word-Gen&amp;Topic BLEU Avg.phr.</p><p>Source phrase recall Src-trg phrase pair recall <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Phr.pair  portion  length  1  2  3  4+  1  2  3</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Impact of genre and topic differences on various indicators of SMT model quality.</p><p>align the test set and extract from it a set of ref- erence phrase pairs using the same procedure ap- plied to the training data. Then, we count the num- ber of reference phrase pairs whose source side is covered by the translation models (source phrase recall) and the number of reference phrase pairs that are fully covered by the translation models (source-target phrase pair recall). Formally, we define the set of source-matching phrases as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M S = {( ¯ f , ¯ e) | ( ¯ f , · ) ∈ P test ∧ ( ¯ f , · ) ∈ P train },</formula><p>where P d refers to the set of phrase pairs ( ¯ f , ¯ e) that can be extracted from corpus d. Source phrase recall R S n for phrases of length n is then defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R S n = ( ¯ f ,¯ e)∈M S ∧| ¯ f |=n c test ( ¯ f , ¯ e) ( ¯ f ,¯ e)∈Ptest ∧| ¯ f |=n c test ( ¯ f , ¯ e) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where c test ( ¯ f , ¯ e) denotes the frequency of phrase pair ( ¯ f , ¯ e) in the test set. Analogously, we define the set of source-target-matching phrase pairs as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M S,T = {( ¯ f , ¯ e) | ( ¯ f , ¯ e) ∈ P test ∧ ( ¯ f , ¯ e) ∈ P train }</formula><p>and the source-target phrase pair recall R S,T n for phrases of length n as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R S,T n = ( ¯ f ,¯ e)∈M S,T ∧| ¯ f |=n c test ( ¯ f , ¯ e) ( ¯ f ,¯ e)∈Ptest ∧| ¯ f |=n c test ( ¯ f , ¯ e) .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Finally, we call phrase pair OOV the portion of reference phrase pairs that are not covered by the translation models, that is: 1 − N n R S,T n , where N is the phrase limit used for phrase extraction.</p><p>The results of our analysis, broken down by source phrase length, show that source phrase re- call is much lower in UG than in NW, while vari- ations among topics are only very small. The stronger impact of genre differences is even more visible on phrase pair recall: for instance, our system knows the correct translation of 73.8% of the single-source-word phrase pairs in the NW genre. In UG this is only 56.2%, despite the equal amounts of training data per genre in our system. These figures suggest that model coverage-both mono-and bilingual-is an important reason for the low SMT quality on UG data.</p><p>Most existing approaches to domain adaptation focus on domain-sensitive scoring or selection of existing translation candidates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Matsoukas et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Foster et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Axelrod et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013, among others)</ref>. This strat- egy is supported by the error analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Irvine et al. (2013)</ref>, who show that scoring errors are more common across domains than errors caused by OOVs, in the source as well as the target lan- guage. Across genres however, our results in <ref type="table">Ta- ble 4</ref> show that both word-level and phrase-level OOVs are a more likely explanation for the per- formance differences. This stresses the need to ad- dress model coverage, for example by paraphras- ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Callison-Burch et al., 2006</ref>) or translation synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Manual OOV analysis</head><p>To get a better understanding of the OOVs ob- served for the genres and topics in the Gen&amp;Topic set, we perform a fine-grained manual analysis 2 . For this analysis a bilingual speaker manually an- notated 500 sentences on the source side (equally distributed over genres and topics) to identify the class of each OOV. Annotations are done for top and sub-level classes (e.g., replaced letter, which   is a subclass of spelling errors). In total, we con- sider 17 subclasses which we group into five main classes, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> for examples. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> shows the type level percentages 3 for each main OOV class per genre or topic. When comparing the two genres, a number of observa- tions emerge. Firstly, rare but correct words (e.g., proper nouns and technical terms, both regular is- sues for adaptation in SMT) make up the vast ma- jority of the OOVs in NW, but are relatively in- frequent in UG. By contrast, OOVs containing un- seen morphological variants are equally common in both genres. Although complex morphology is language-specific, a rare morphological word in Arabic often maps to a rare multi-word phrase in English, resulting in phrase-level OOVs. Next, not entirely surprising, the majority of OOVs in UG are due to spelling errors. Finally, OOVs assigned to the remaining classes are never observed in NW but occasionally occur in UG.</p><p>Next, a comparison of the main OOV classes among the various topics shows a few notable</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and implications</head><p>Despite the fact that domain adaptation is an ac- tive field of research in SMT, there is little con- sensus on what exactly constitutes a domain. By introducing and analyzing a new benchmark with balanced topic and genre distributions, we have shown that earlier findings explaining the differ- ences across topics only explain to a limited de- gree translation performance differences across genres. Our analysis shows that genre-specific er- rors are more attributable to model-coverage er- rors than to suboptimal scoring of existing trans- lation candidates. This suggests that future work on improving SMT across genres needs to inves- tigate approaches that increase model coverage. Our fine-grained manual error analysis at the word level also suggests that source coverage could ben- efit from text normalization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bertoldi et al., 2010</ref>). Finally, we make both our benchmark and the manual OOV annotations publicly available.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>Table 3 compares</head><label>3</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>BLEU scores (Papineni et al.,

			<note place="foot" n="3"> We also collected token level frequencies which are very similar to the listed type level statistics, except for a small number of repeatedly occurring proper nouns. distributions. Dialectal forms, for example, are rare in all topics except politics, where they are commonly observed in the form of Egyptian future tense. This can be explained by the presence of news articles about elections in Egypt in the Gen&amp;Topic set. Next, while spelling errors are common in all topics, its abundance is most prominent in culture. Most spelling errors concern missing or inserted blanks, suggesting that comments are likely written on mobile devices. Finally, unseen morphological variants are more frequent in economy than in other topics, however with no conclusive explanation.</note>
