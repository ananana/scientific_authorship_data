				<p>This paper complements semantic role representations with spatial knowledge beyond indicating plain locations. Namely, we extract where entities are (and are not) located, and for how long (seconds, hours, days, etc.). Crowdsourced annotations show that this additional knowledge is intuitive to humans and can be annotated by non-experts. Experimental results show that the task can be automated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Extracting meaning from text is crucial for true text understanding and an important component of several natural language processing systems. Among many others, previous efforts have fo- cused on extracting causal relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bethard and Martin, 2008)</ref>, semantic relations between nom- inals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hendrickx et al., 2010)</ref>, spatial relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kordjamshidi et al., 2011</ref>) and temporal relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pustejovsky et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chambers et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In terms of corpora development and automated approaches, semantic roles are one of the most studied semantic representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Toutanova et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">M` arquez et al., 2008)</ref>. They have been proven useful for, among others, coreference reso- lution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ponzetto and Strube, 2006</ref>) and question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shen and Lapata, 2007)</ref>. While se- mantic roles provide a useful semantic layer, they capture a portion of the meaning encoded in all but the simplest statements. Consider the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and the semantic roles of drove (solid arrows). In addition to these roles, humans in- tuitively understand that (dashed arrow) (1) John was not located in Berlin before or during drove, (2) he was located in Berlin after drove for a short period of time (presumably, until he was done picking up the package, i.e., for a few minutes to an hour), and then left Berlin and thus (3) was not located there anymore. Some of this addi- tional spatial knowledge is inherent to the mo- tion verb drive: people cannot drive to the loca- tion where they are currently located, and they will be located at the destination of driving af- ter driving takes place. But determining for how long the agent of drive remains at the destina- tion depends on the arguments of drive: from <ref type="bibr">[John]</ref> AGENT <ref type="bibr">[drove]</ref> v <ref type="bibr">[home]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">DESTINATION</ref> [after an exhausting work day] TIME , it is reasonable to be- lieve that John will be located at home overnight.</p><p>This paper manipulates semantic roles in order to extract temporally-anchored spatial knowledge. We extract where entities are and are not located, and temporally anchor this information. Tempo- ral anchors indicate for how long something is (or is not) located somewhere, e.g., for 5 minutes be- fore (or after) an event. We target additional spa- tial knowledge not only between arguments of mo- tion verbs as exemplified above, but also between intra-sentential arguments of any verb. The main contributions are: (1) crowdsourced annotations on top of OntoNotes 1 indicating where something is and is not located (polarity), and for how long (temporal anchors); (2) detailed annotation analy- sis using coarse-and fine-grained labels (yes / no vs. seconds, minutes, years, etc.); and (3) exper- iments detailing results with several feature com- binations, and using gold-standard and predicted linguistic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Definitions and Background</head><p>We use R(x, y) to denote a semantic relationship R between x and y. R(x, y) can be read "x has R y", e.g., AGENT(drove, John) can be read "drove has AGENT John." By definition, semantic roles are semantic relationships between predicates and their arguments-for all semantic roles R(x, y), x is a predicate and y is an argument of x. Generally speaking, semantic roles capture who did what to whom, how, when and where.</p><p>We use the term additional spatial knowledge to refer to spatial knowledge not captured with se- mantic roles, i.e., spatial meaning between x and y where (1) x is not a predicate or (2) x is a predicate and y is not an argument of x. As we shall see, we go beyond extracting "x has LOCATION y" with plain LOCATION(x, y) relations. We extract where entities are and are not located, and for how long they are located (and not located) somewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Semantic Roles in OntoNotes</head><p>OntoNotes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hovy et al., 2006</ref>) is large corpus (â‰ˆ64K sentences) that includes verbal semantic role annotations, i.e., the first argument x of any role R(x, y) is a verb. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> OntoNotes semantic roles follow PropBank framesets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). It uses a set of numbered arguments (ARG 0 -ARG 5 ) whose meanings are verb-dependent, e.g., ARG 2 is used for "employer" with verb work.01 and "expected terminus of sleep" with verb sleep.01. Additionally, it uses argument modifiers which share a common meaning across verbs (ARGM- LOC, ARGM-TMP, ARGM-PRP, ARGM-CAU, etc.). For a detailed description of OntoNotes seman- tic roles, we refer the reader to the LDC catalog <ref type="bibr">3 and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). To improve readability, we often rename numbered arguments, e.g., AGENT instead of ARG 0 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Approaches to extract PropBank-style semantic roles have been studied for years <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carreras and M` arquez, 2005</ref>), state-of-the-art tools sobtain F- measures of 83.5 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lewis et al., 2015)</ref>. In this pa- per, we complement semantic role representations with temporally-anchored spatial knowledge.</p><p>Extracting additional meaning on top of popu- lar corpora is by no means a new problem. <ref type="bibr">Ger-ber and</ref><ref type="bibr">Chai (2010) augmented NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004</ref>) annotations with additional num- bered arguments appearing in the same or previ- ous sentences, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Laparra and Rigau (2013)</ref> pre- sented an improved algorithm for the same task. The <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2010</ref><ref type="bibr">Task 10 (Ruppenhofer et al., 2009</ref>) targeted cross-sentence missing arguments in FrameNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker et al., 1998) and</ref><ref type="bibr">PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Silberer and Frank (2012)</ref> casted the SemEval task as an anaphora resolu- tion task. We have previously proposed an un- supervised framework to compose semantic rela- tions out of previously extracted relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blanco and Moldovan, 2011)</ref>, and a supervised approach to infer additional argument modifiers (ARGM) for verbs in PropBank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blanco and Moldovan, 2014</ref>). Unlike the current work, these previous efforts (1) improve the semantic representation of verbal and nominal predicates, or (2) infer relations between arguments of the same predicate.</p><p>More recently, we showed that spatial rela- tions can be inferred from PropBank-style seman- tic roles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blanco and Vempala, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Vempala and Blanco, 2016)</ref>. In this paper, we expand on this idea as follows. First, we not only extract whether "x has LOCATION y" before, during or after an event, but also specify for how long before and af- ter (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc.). Second, we release crowdsourced an- notations for 1,732 potential additional spatial re- lations. Third, we experiment with both gold and predicted linguistic information.</p><p>Spatial semantics has received considerable at- tention in the last decade.</p><p>The task of spatial role labeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kordjamshidi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kolomiyets et al., 2013</ref>) aims at rep- resenting spatial information with so-called spa- tial roles, e.g., trajector, landmark, spatial and mo- tion indicators, etc. Unlike us, spatial role label- ing does not aim at extracting where entities are not located or temporally-anchored spatial infor- mation. But doing so is intuitive to humans, as the examples and crowdsourced annotations in this paper show. Spatial knowledge is intuitively as- sociated with motion events, e.g., drive, go, fly, walk, run. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hwang and Palmer (2015)</ref> presented a classifier to detect caused motion constructions triggered by non-motion verbs, e.g., The crowd laughed the clown off the stage (i.e., the crowd made the clown leave the stage). Our work does not target motion verbs or motion constructions, as the examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> show, non-motion con- structions triggered by non-motion verbs also al- low us to infer temporally-anchored spatial mean- ing, e.g., played, honored, taught, fighting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Corpus Creation and Analysis</head><p>Our goal is to complement semantic role represen- tations with additional spatial knowledge. Specifi- cally, our goal is to infer temporally-anchored spa- tial knowledge between x and y, where semantic roles ARG i (x verb , x) and ARGM-LOC(y verb , y) ex- ists in the same sentence. In order to achieve this goal, we follow a two-step methodology. First, we automatically generate potential additional spatial knowledge by combining selected semantic roles. Second, we crowdsource annotations, including polarity and temporal anchors, to validate or dis- card the potential additional knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Generating Potential Spatial Knowledge</head><p>We generate potential additional relations LOCA- TION(x, y) by combining all ARG i (x verb , x) and ARGM-LOC(y verb , y) semantic roles within a sen- tence (x verb and y verb need not be the same). Then, we enforce the following restrictions:</p><p>1. x and y must not overlap;</p><p>2. the head of x must be a named entity person, org, work of art, fac, norp, product or event;</p><p>3. the head of y must be a noun subsumed by physical entity.n.01 in WordNet, or a named entity fac, gpe, loc, or org; 4 and 4. the heads of x and y must be different than the heads of all previously generated pairs.</p><p>These restrictions were designed after manual analysis of randomly selected combinations of ARG i and ARGM-LOC semantic roles with two goals in mind: to (1) reduce the annotation effort and (2) generate the least amount of invalid po- tential additional spatial knowledge without arbi- trarily discarding any predicates (e.g., focus only on motion verbs). Additional relations not satisfy- ing restriction 1 are nonsensical, and restriction 4 simply discards potential additional relations that have already been generated. Restrictions 2 and 3 are designed to improve the likelihood that the potential additional spatial knowledge will not be discarded when crowdsourcing annotations, e.g., locations whose head is an adverb such as here and there (11% of all ARGM-LOC roles) do not yield valid additional spatial knowledge.</p><p>OntoNotes annotates 9,612 ARGM-LOC seman- tic roles, and the number of potential LOCATION relations generated is 1,732. Thus, our methodol- ogy aims at adding 18% of additional spatial rela- tions on top of OntoNotes semantic roles. If we consider each temporal anchor as a different spa- tial relation, we aim at adding 54% additional spa- tial relations. As we shall see, over 69% of the ad- ditional potential relations are valid (Section 4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Crowdsourcing Spatial Knowledge</head><p>Once potential spatial knowledge is generated, it must be validated or discarded. We are interested in additional spatial knowledge as intuitively un- derstood by humans, so we avoid lengthy annota- tion guidelines and ask simple questions to non- experts via Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p><p>After in-house pilot annotations, it became clear that asking "Is x located in/at y" for each poten- tial LOCATION(x, y) and forcing annotators to an- swer yes or no is suboptimal. For example, con- sider again <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and question "Is John located in Berlin?". An unabridged natural answer would be "not before or during drove, but certainly after drove for a few minutes until he was done picking up the package." In other words, it is intuitive to consider polarity (whether x is or is not located at y) and temporal anchors (for how long?).</p><p>We designed the interface in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> to gather annotations including polarity and temporal an- chors, and accounting for granularity levels. An- swers map to the following coarse-grained labels:</p><p>â€¢ Before and after: yes, no, unk and inv.</p><p>â€¢ During: yes (first 2 options), no, unk and inv.</p><p>Label unk stands for unknown and inv for invalid. Furthermore, yes maps to these fine- grained labels indicating specific periods of time:</p><p>â€¢ Before and after: an integer and a unit of time (secs, mins, hours, days, weeks, months or years) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , or inf for infinity.</p><p>â€¢ During: entire or some.  n/a n/a During n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 97.77 2.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Percentage of fine-grained labels for instances annotated with coarse-grained label yes. We created one Human Intelligence Task (HIT) per potential LOCATION(x, y), and recruited an- notators with previous approval rate â‰¥ 95% and 5,000 or more previous approved HITs. A to- tal of 74 annotators participated in the task, on average, they annotated 163.24 HITs (maximum: 1,547, minimum: 1). We rejected submissions that took unusually short time compared to other sub- missions, and those from annotators who always chose the same label. Overall, we only rejected 1.2% of submissions. We collected 7 annotations per HIT and paid $0.05 per HIT. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the percentage of coarse-grained labels per temporal anchor. Labels yes and no combined account for 67.7% of labels (before), 77.4% (during) and 63.1% (after). Note that both yes and no yield valid additional spatial knowl- edge: whether x is (or is not) located at y. Anno- tators could not commit to yes or no in 16.1% of questions on average (unk), with a much smaller percentage for during temporal anchor (5.8%; be- fore: 18.7%, after: 23.7%). This is not surprising, as arguments of some verbs, e.g., AGENT of play, must be located at the location of the event dur- ing the event, but not necessarily before or after. Finally, inv only accounts for 14.6% of labels (before: 13.7%, during: 16.9%, after: 13.2%), thus most potential additional knowledge automat- ically generated (Section 4.1) can be understood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Annotation Analysis</head><p>Percentages of fine-grained labels per temporal span, i.e., refinements of yes coarse-grained la- bels, are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The vast majority of times (97.77%) annotators believe an entity is at a location during an event, the entity is there for the entire duration of the event (entire). Annotators barely used label secs (before: 0.20% and after: 0.50%), but percentages range between 3.34% and 46.72% for other units of time (uniform distribu- tion would be 1/8 = 12.5%). Labels years and inf, which indicate that an entity is located some- where for years or indefinitely before (or after) an event, are the most common fine-grained labels for before and after (14.91-46.72%). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> presents agreement measures. Pearson correlations are the weighted averages between each annotator and the majority label and are cal- culated following this mapping: (coarse labels): yes: 1, unk/inv: 0, no: âˆ’1; (fine labels): be- fore/after: secs: 1, mins: 1 + 1/7, hours:</p></div>

Statement (3) exemplifies no label. Poten- tial additional spatial knowledge includes whether Maidenform is located at University of Wisconsin, which is never true (no).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Inferring Temporally-Anchored Spatial Knowledge</head><p>We follow a standard machine learning approach, and use the training, development and test sets released by the organizers of the <ref type="bibr">CoNLL-2011</ref><ref type="bibr">Shared Task (Pradhan et al., 2011</ref>). We first gen- erate additional spatial knowledge deterministi- cally as described in Section 4.1. Then, for each additional LOCATION(x, y), we generate one in- stance per temporal anchor and discard those an- notated inv. The total number of instances is 1,732 Ã— 3 âˆ’ 754 = 4,442. We trained SVM mod- els with RBF kernel using scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>). The feature set and SVM parameters were tuned using 10-fold cross-validation with the train and development sets, and results are calcu- lated using the test set. During the tuning pro- cess, we discovered that it is beneficial to train one SVM per temporal anchor instead of a single model for the 3 temporal anchors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Feature Selection</head><p>We use a mixture of standard features from seman- tic role labeling, and semantic features designed for extracting temporally-anchored spatial knowl- edge from semantic roles. In order to determine whether x is (or is not) located at y and for how long, we extract features from x and y, the verbs to which they attach (x verb and y verb ) and all se- mantic roles of x verb and y verb (x roles and y roles ).</p><p>Basic, lexical and heads features are standard in role labeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002</ref>). Basic features are the word form and part-of-speech of x verb and y verb . Lexical features capture the first and last words of x and y and their part-of-speech tags, as well as a binary flag indicating whether x occurs before or after y. Heads features capture the heads of x and y and their part-of-speech tags, as well as their named entity types, if any.</p><p>Semantic features include features 20-27. Fea- ture 20 indicates the semantic role linking x and x verb (ARG 0 , ARG 1 , ARG 2 , etc.); recall that the se- mantic role between y and y verb is always ARGM- LOC (Section 4.1). Features 21-24 are counts of ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC semantic roles in the verb-argument structures to which x and y attach. Features 25-26 are the same counts of roles, but taking into account all the roles in the sentence to which x and y belong. Finally, feature 27 signals whether x and y attach to the same verb.</p><p>We tried many other features, including counts of all roles, heads of all semantic roles present, se- mantic role ordering, VerbNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schuler, 2005</ref>) and Levin ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Levin, 1993)</ref> verb classes, and WordNet hypernyms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Miller, 1995)</ref>, but they did not yield any improvements during the tuning process.</p><p>We exemplify features with pair (x: George Koskotas, self-confessed embezzler, y: a jail cell in <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref>, from where) from Statement 4 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>:</p><p>â€¢ Basic: features 1-4: {residing, VBG, fight- ing, VBG}.</p><p>â€¢ Lexical: feature 5-12: {George, NNP, Koskotas, NNP, a, DT, where, WRB}, fea- tures 13: {before}.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Predicting Coarse-Grained Labels</head><p>Best results for all labels and temporal anchors are obtained with all features (basic, lexical, heads and semantics). Overall F-measure is 0.65, and during instances obtain higher F-measure (0.78) than before (0.60) and after (0.52). Regarding la- bels, yes obtains best results (overall 0.77), fol- lowed by no (0.64) and unk (0.36). Not surpris- ingly, the most frequent label per temporal anchor obtains the best results with all features (before: no, 0.71; during: yes, 0.90; after: no, 0.61).</p><p>Before and after instances benefit the most from learning with all features with respect to the base- line (before: 0.32 vs. 0.60, after: 0.23 vs. 0.52). While during instances also benefit, the difference in F-measure is lower (0.67 vs. 0.78).</p><p>Feature Ablation. The bottom 3 blocks in Ta- ble 5 present results using several feature types incrementally. Basic features yield an overall F- measure of 0.56, and surprisingly good results for during instances (0.76). Indeed, the best perfor- mance obtained with during instances is 0.78 (all features), suggesting that the verbs to which x and y attach are very strong features.</p><p>Lexical and heads features are most useful for before (0.44 vs. 0.54, +22.7%) and after (0.44 vs. 0.50, +13.6%) instances, and are actually detri- mental for during instances (0.76 vs. 0.74, -2.6%). Including semantic features, however, improves results with respect to basic features for all tempo- ral anchors: before: 0.44 vs. 0.60, 36.4% during: 0.76 vs. 0.78, 2.6% after: 0.44 vs. 0.52, 18.2%.</p><p>Differences in overall F-measure are not statis- tically significant between basic and basic + lex- ical + heads (0.56 vs. 0.61, Z-test, two-tailed, p-value = 0.05), but the difference including se- mantic features is significant (0.50 vs. 0.65, Z-test, two-tailed, p-value = 0.009).</p></div>

Most fine-grained labels for before and after are infrequent <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>), our best model is un- able to predict labels secs, hours, weeks and months for before, and secs, mins, hours, days, weeks and months for after (other rows). But these labels account for relatively few instances: individually, between 0.2% and 11.33%, and among all of them, 23.46% for be- fore and 34.38% for after instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Predicting Fine-Grained Labels</head><p>It is worth noting that mins, days and inf obtain relatively high F-measures for before: 0.80, 0.67 and 0.50 respectively. In other words, we can distinguish whether an entity is somewhere only for a few minutes or days (but not longer) before an event, or at all times before an event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Predicted Linguistic Annotations</head><p>In order to make an honest evaluation in a realistic environment, we also experiment with predicted linguistic annotations. The major disadvantage of doing so is that predicted semantic roles and named entities are often incorrect or missing, thus we generate spurious additional spatial knowledge and miss some additional spatial knowledge be- cause the potential relation cannot be generated. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 7</ref> presents results using predicted linguis- tic annotations. The additional label spurious is used for instances generated from incorrect se- mantic roles or named entities, as these instances do not appear in the crowdsourced annotations (Section 4). Due to space constraints, we only present results using coarse-grained labels, but provide results per temporal anchor.</p><p>The baseline, which predicts the most likely label per temporal anchor, always predicts spurious since 50% of generated additional po- tential knowledge does not appear in the crowd- sourced annotations. Using all features clearly outperforms basic features (overall F-measure: 0.79 vs 0.55), thus we focus on the former.</p><p>Using all features, spurious is always pre- dicted correctly. While useful to discard addi- tional spatial knowledge that should not have been generated, spurious does not allow us to make meaningful inferences. The labels that we are most interested in, yes and no, obtain overall F- measures of 0.64 and 0.51 (compared to 0.77 and .64 with gold linguistic annotations). Regarding labels, yes can only be reliably predicted for dur- ing instances (F-measure: 0.80), and no is pre- dicted with modest F-measures for all temporal anchors: before: 0.55, during: 0.31, after: 0.44.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>This paper demonstrates that semantic roles are a reliable semantic layer from which one can infer whether entities are located or not located some- where, and for how long (seconds, minutes, days, years, etc.). Crowdsourced annotations show that this kind of inferences are intuitive to humans. Moreover, most potential additional spatial knowl- edge generated following a few simple determin- istic rules was validated by annotators (yes and no; before: 67.7%, during: 77.4%, after: 63.1%).</p><p>Experimental results with gold-standard seman- tic roles and named entities show that inference can be done with standard supervised machine learning (overall F-measure: 0.65, yes: 0.77, no: 0.64). Using predicted linguistic information, re- sults decrease substantially (yes: 0.64, no: 0.51). This is mostly due to the fact that predicted se- mantic roles and named entities are often wrong or missing, and this fact unequivocally makes the inference process more challenging.</p><p>We believe that combining semantic roles and other semantic representation in a similar fashion to the one used in this paper could be useful to in- fer knowledge beyond spatial inferences. For ex- ample, one could infer who is in POSSESSION of something over time by manipulating the events in which the object in question participates in. chored spatial knowledge: Crowdsourced annota- tions and experiments.

We include all potential additional spatial knowledge (Section 4.1) and annotations per temporal anchor. Two additional LOCATION(x, y) can be inferred from Statement (1): whether Hsia and Hisao Chin are located in Milan before, during and af- ter stopped. Annotators understood that Hsia was in Milan temporarily: for a few minutes before stopped, during the full duration of stopped and for a few hours after stopped. In other words, Hsia was elsewhere, then went to Milan and left after visiting with Hsiao for a few hours. Regarding Hsiao, annotators interpreted that Milan is her per- manent location: for years before and after Hsia stopped to visit her. While somehow ambiguous, these annotations are reasonably intuitive. Statement (2) has 2 ARGM-LOC roles and 4 po- tential additional relations. Annotations for during are straightforward: both President Clinton and Senator Clinton were located in New York City during played and at Madison Square Garden dur- ing honored. Annotations for before and after are more challenging: both Clintons where located in New York City for hours (not days) before and af- ter played, but at Madison Square Garden for a few minutes (not hours) before and after honored.</figDesc><table></table></figure>
