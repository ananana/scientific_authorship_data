				<p>We replace the overlap mechanism of the Lesk algorithm with a simple, general-purpose Naive Bayes model that measures many-to-many association between two sets of random variables. Even with simple probability estimates such as maximum likelihood, the model gains significant improvement over the Lesk algorithm on word sense disambiguation tasks. With additional lexical knowledge from Word-Net, performance is further improved to surpass the state-of-the-art results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>To disambiguate a homonymous word in a given context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lesk (1986)</ref> proposed a method that mea- sured the degree of overlap between the glosses of the target and context words. Known as the Lesk algorithm, this simple and intuitive method has since been extensively cited and extended in the word sense disambiguation (WSD) commu- nity. Nonetheless, its performance in several WSD benchmarks is less than satisfactory <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Vasilescu et al., 2004</ref>). Among the popular explanations is a key limita- tion of the algorithm, that "Lesk's approach is very sensitive to the exact wording of definitions, so the absence of a certain word can radically change the results." <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Navigli, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Compounding this problem is the fact that many Lesk variants limited the concept of overlap to the literal interpretation of string matching (with their own variants such as length-sensitive match- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002</ref>), etc.), and it was not until recently that overlap started to take on other forms such as tree-matching ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2009)</ref> and vector space models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdalgader and Skabar, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Raviv et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006</ref>). To address this limitation, a Naive Bayes model (NBM) is proposed in this study as a novel, probabilistic treatment of over- lap in gloss-based WSD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In the extraordinarily rich literature on WSD, we focus our review on those closest to the topic of Lesk and NBM. In particular, we opt for the "sim- plified Lesk" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000)</ref>, where inventory senses are assessed by gloss- context overlap rather than gloss-gloss overlap. This particular variant prevents proliferation of gloss comparison on larger contexts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mihalcea et al., 2004</ref>) and is shown to outperform the origi- nal Lesk algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Vasilescu et al., 2004</ref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, NBMs have been employed exclusively as classifiers in WSD - that is, in contrast to their use as a similarity mea- sure in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gale et al. (1992)</ref> used NB classifier resembling an information retrieval sys- tem: a WSD instance is regarded as a document d, and candidate senses are scored in terms of "rel- evance" to d. When evaluated on a WSD bench- mark ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Vasilescu et al., 2004</ref>), the algorithm com- pared favourably to Lesk variants (as expected for a supervised method). Pedersen (2000) pro- posed an ensemble model with multiple NB clas- sifiers differing by context window size. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hristea (2009)</ref> trained an unsupervised NB classifier using the EM algorithm and empirically demonstrated the benefits of WordNet-assisted <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref> feature selection over local syntactic features.</p><p>Among Lesk variants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerjee and Pedersen (2002)</ref> extended the gloss of both inventory senses and the context words to include words in their re- lated synsets in WordNet. Senses were scored by the sum of overlaps across all relation pairs, and the effect of individual relation pairs was evalu- ated in a later work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003)</ref>. Overlap was assessed by string matching, with the number of matching words squared so as to assign higher scores to multi-word overlaps.</p><p>Breaking away from string matching, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wilks et al. (1990)</ref> measured overlap as similarity be- tween gloss-and context-vectors, which were ag- gregated word vectors encoding second order co- occurrence information in glosses. An extension by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006)</ref> differentiated context word senses and extended shorter glosses with related glosses in WordNet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Patwardhan et al. (2003)</ref> measured overlap by concept similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006</ref>) between each inven- tory sense and the context words. Gloss overlaps from their earlier work actually out-performed all five similarity-based methods.</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al. (2009)</ref> pro- posed a tree-matching algorithm that measured gloss-context overlap as the weighted sum of dependency-induced lexical distance. Abdalgader and Skabar (2012) constructed a sentential simi- larity measure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al., 2006</ref>) using lexical simi- larity measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006</ref>), and overlap was measured by the cosine of their re- spective sentential vectors. A related approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Raviv et al., 2012</ref>) also used Wikipedia-induced concepts to encoded sentential vectors. These sys- tems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense fre- quency information, they are essentially super- vised methods.</p><p>Distributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (2000)</ref> proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Miller et al. (2012)</ref> used distributional thesauri as a knowledge base to increase overlaps, which were, again, assessed by string matching.</p><p>In conclusion, the majority of Lesk variants focused on extending the gloss to increase the chance of overlapping, while the proposed NBM aims to make better use of the limited lexical knowledge available. In contrast to string match- ing, the probabilistic nature of our model offers a "softer" measurement of gloss-context associa- tion, resulting in a novel approach to unsupervised WSD with state-of-the-art performance in more than one WSD benchmark (Section 4).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Naive Bayes Model</head><p>Formally, given two sets e = {e i } and f = { f j } each consisting of multiple random events, the proposed model measures the probabilistic asso- ciation p(f|e) between e and f. Under the assump- tion of conditional independence among the events in each set, a Naive Bayes treatment of the mea- sure can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(f|e) = ∏ j p( f j |{e i }) = ∏ j p({e i }| f j )p( f j ) p({e i }) = ∏ j [p( f j ) ∏ i p(e i | f j )] ∏ j ∏ i p(e i ) ,</formula><p>(1) In the second expression, Bayes's rule is applied not only to take advantage of the conditional inde- pendence among e i 's, but also to facilitate proba- bility estimation, since p({e i }| f j ) is easier to esti- mate in the context of WSD, where sample spaces of e and f become asymmetric (Section 3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Model Application in WSD</head><p>In the context of WSD, e can be regarded as an instance of a polysemous word w, while f repre- sents certain lexical knowledge about the sense s of w manifested by e. 1 WSD is thus formulated as identifying the sense s * in the sense inventory S of w s.t.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s * = arg max s∈S p(f|e)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In one of their simplest forms, e i 's correspond to co-occurring words in the instance of w, and f j 's consist of the gloss words of sense s. Conse- quently, p(f|e) is essentially measuring the asso- ciation between context words of w and definition texts of s, i.e., the gloss-context association in the simplified Lesk algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000</ref>). A major difference, however, is that instead of using hard, overlap counts between the two sets of words from the gloss and the context, this probabilistic treatment can implicitly model the distributional similarity among the elements e i and f j (and consequently between the sets e and f) over a wider range of contexts. The result is a "softer" proxy of association than the binary view of overlaps in existing Lesk variants.</p><p>The foregoing discussion offers a second mo- tivation for applying Bayes's rule on the second Senses Hypernyms Hyponyms Synonyms factory building complex, complex brewery, factory, mill, ...</p><p>works, industrial plant life form organism, being perennial, crop... flora, plant life <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Lexical knowledge for the word plant un- der its two meanings factory and life form.</p><p>expression in Equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>: it is easier to estimate p(e i | f j ) than p( f j |e i ), since the vocabulary for the lexical knowledge features ( f j ) is usually more limited than that of the contexts (e i ) and hence esti- mation of the former suffices on a smaller amount of data than that of the latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Incorporating Additional Lexical Knowledge</head><p>The input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is straightforward to incorporate var- ious forms of lexical knowledge (LK) for word senses: by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the existing knowledge representation f, while the similarity measure remains unchanged. The availability of LK largely depends on the sense inventory used in a WSD task. WordNet senses are often used in Senseval and SemEval tasks, and hence senses (or synsets, and possibly their corresponding word forms) that are seman- tic related to the inventory senses under WordNet relations are easily obtainable and have been ex- ploited by many existing studies.</p><p>As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Patwardhan et al. (2003)</ref>, however, "not all of these relations are equally helpful." Relation pairs involving hyponyms were shown to result in better F-measure when used in gloss overlaps ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003)</ref>. The authors attributed the phenomenon to the the multitude of hyponyms compared to other rela- tions. We further hypothesize that, beyond sheer numbers, synonyms and hyponyms offer stronger semantic specification that helps distinguish the senses of a given ambiguous word, and thus are more effective knowledge sources for WSD.</p><p>Take the word plant for example. Selected hy- pernyms, hyponyms, and synonyms pertaining to its two senses factory and life form are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Hypernyms can be overly general terms (e.g., being). Although conceptually helpful for humans in coarse-grained WSD, this generality is likely to inflate the hypernyms' probabilistic esti- mation. Hyponyms, on the other hand, help spec- ify their corresponding senses with information that is possibly missing from the often overly brief glosses: the many technical terms as hyponyms in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> -though rare -are likely to occur in the (possibly domain-specific) contexts that are highly typical of the corresponding senses. Par- ticularly for the NBM, the co-occurrence is likely to result in stronger gloss-definition associations when similar contexts appear in a WSD instance.</p><p>We also observe that some semantically related words appear under rare senses (e.g., still as an alcohol-manufacturing plant, and annual as a one- year-life-cycle plant; omitted from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). This is a general phenomenon in gloss-based WSD and is beyond the scope of the current discussion. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Overall, all three sources of LK may complement each other in WSD tasks, with hyponyms particu- larly promising in both quantity and quality com- pared to hypernyms and synonyms. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Probability Estimation</head><p>A most open-ended question is how to estimate the probabilities in Equation (1). In WSD in particu- lar, the estimation concerns the marginal and con- ditional probabilities of and between word tokens. Many options are available to this end in statis- tical machine learning (MLE, MAP, etc.), infor- mation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Church and Hanks, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Turney, 2001)</ref>, as well as the rich body of research in lex- ical semantic similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Resnik, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jiang and Conrath, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006</ref>).</p><p>Here we choose maximum likelihood -not only for its simplicity, but also to demonstrate model strength with a relatively crude probability estimation. To avoid underflow, Equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> is estimated as the following log probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∑ i log c( f j ) c(·) + ∑ i ∑ j log c(e i , f j ) c( f j ) − |f| ∑ j log c(e i ) c(·) =(1 − |e|) ∑ i log c( f j ) − |f| ∑ j log c(e i ) + ∑ i ∑ j log c(e i , f j ) + |f|(|e| − 1) log c(·),</formula><p>where c(x) is the count of word x, c(·) is the corpus size, c(x, y) is the joint count of x and y, and |v| is the dimension of vector v. Nonetheless, we do investigate how model per- formance responds to estimation quality. Specif- ically in WSD, a source corpus is defined as the source of the majority of the WSD instances in a given dataset, and a baseline corpus of a smaller size and less resemblance to the instances is used for all datasets. The assumption is that a source corpus offers better estimates for the model than the baseline corpus, and difference in model per- formance is expected when using probability esti- mation of different quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data, Scoring, and Pre-processing</head><p>Various aspects of the model discussed in Section 3 are evaluated in the English lexical sample tasks from Senseval-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Edmonds and Cotton, 2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pradhan et al., 2007</ref>. Training sections are used as development data and test sections held out for final testing. Model perfor- mance is evaluated in terms of WSD accuracy us- ing Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> as the scoring function. Accu- racy is defined as the number of correct responses over the number of instances. Because it is a rare event for the NBM to produce identical scores, 4 the model always proposes a unique answer and accuracy is thus equivalent to F-score commonly used in existing reports.</p><p>Multiword expressions (MWEs) in the Senseval-2 sense inventory are not explicitly marked in the contexts. Several of the top-ranking systems implemented their own MWE detection algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Litkowski, 2002)</ref>. Without digressing to the details of MWE detection -and meanwhile, to ensure fair comparison with existing systems -we implement two variants of the prediction module, one completely ignorant of MWE and defaulting to INCORRECT for all MWE-related answers, while the other assuming perfect MWE detection and performing regular disambiguation algorithm on the MWE-related senses (not de- faulting to CORRECT). All results reported for Senseval-2 below are harmonic means of the two outcomes.</p><p>Each inventory sense is represented by a set of LK tokens (e.g., definition texts, synonyms, etc.) from their corresponding WordNet synset (or in the coarse-grained case, a concatenation of tokens from all synsets in a sense group). The MIT-JWI library <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Finlayson, 2014</ref>) is used for accessing WordNet. Usage examples in glosses (included by the library by default) are removed in our experi- ments. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Basic pre-processing is performed on the con- texts and the glosses, including lower-casing, stop- word removal, lemmatization on both datasets, and tokenization on the Senseval-2 instances. 6 Stanford CoreNLP 7 is used for lemmatization and tokenization. Identical procedures are applied to all corpora used for probability estimation.</p><p>Binomial test is used for significance testing, and with one exception explicitly noted in Sec- tion 4.3, all differences presented are statistically highly significant (p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparing Lexical Knowledge Sources</head><p>To study the effect of different types of LK in WSD (Section 3.3), for each inventory sense, we choose synonyms (syn), hypernyms (hpr), and hy- ponyms (hpo) as extended LK in addition to its gloss. The WSD model is evaluated with gloss- only (glo), individual extended LK sources, and the combination of all four sources (all). The re- sults are listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> together with existing re- sults (1st and 2nd correspond to the results of the top two unsupervised methods in each dataset). <ref type="bibr">8</ref> By using only glosses, the proposed model already shows statistically significant improve- ment over the basic Lesk algorithm (92.4% and 140.5% relative improvement in Senseval- 2 coarse-and fine-grained tracks, respectively). <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Moreover, comparison between coarse-and fine- grained tracks reveals interesting properties of dif- ferent LK sources. Previous hypotheses (Section 3.3) are empirically confirmed that WSD perfor- <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We also compared the two Lesk baselines (with and without usage examples) on the development data but did not observe significant differences as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The SemEval-2007 instances are already tokenized. 7 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ corenlp.shtml.</p><p>8 We excluded the results of UNED ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fernández-Amorós et al., 2001</ref>) in Senseval-2 because, by using sense frequency information that is only obtainable from sense-annotated cor- pora, it is essentially a supervised system. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Comparisons are made against the simplified Lesk al- gorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000</ref>) without usage examples.

Specifically, highly similar, fine- grained sense candidates apparently share more hypernyms in the fine-grained case than in the coarse-grained case; adding to the generality of hypernyms (both semantic and distributional), we postulate that their probability in the NBM is uni- formly inflated among many sense candidates, and hence they decrease in distinguishability. Syn- onyms might help with regard to semantic spec- ification, though their limited quantity also limits their benefits. These patterns on the LK types are consistent in all three experiments. When including all four LK sources, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems with sta- tistical significance in both coarse-grained tasks. For the fine-grained track, it achieves 2nd place after that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tugwell and Kilgarriff (2001)</ref>, which used a decision list <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yarowsky, 1995)</ref> on manu- ally selected corpora evidence for each inventory sense, and thus is not subject to loss of distin- guishability in the glosses as Lesk variants are.</p><note type="other">Dataset glo syn hpr hpo all 1st 2nd Lesk Senseval-2 Coarse</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Probability Estimation</head><p>To evaluate model response to probability esti- mation of different quality (Section 3.4), source corpora are chosen as the majority value of the doc-source attribute of instances in each dataset, namely, the British National Corpus for Senseval- 2 (94%) and the Wall Street Journal for SemEval- 2007 (86%). The Brown Corpus is shared by both datasets as the baseline corpus. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the comparison on the SemEval-2007 dataset. Across all experiments, higher WSD accuracy is consis- tently witnessed using the source corpus; differ- ences are statistically highly significant except for hpo (which is significant with p &lt; 0.01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We have proposed a general-purpose Naive Bayes model for measuring association between two sets of random events. The model replaced string matching in the Lesk algorithm for word sense dis- ambiguation with a probabilistic measure of gloss- context overlap. The base model on average more than doubled the accuracy of Lesk in Senseval-2 on both fine-and coarse-grained tracks. With ad- ditional lexical knowledge, the model also outper- formed state of the art results with statistical sig- nificance on two coarse-grained WSD tasks.</p><p>For future work, we plan to apply the model in other shared tasks, including open-text WSD, so as to compare with more recent Lesk variants. We would also like to explore how to incorpo- rate syntactic features and employ alternative sta- tistical methods (e.g., parametric models) to im- prove probability estimation and inference. Other NLP problems involving compositionality in gen- eral might also benefit from the proposed many- to-many similarity measure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Model response to probability estimates of different quality on the SemEval-2007 dataset.
