				<p>We present the ICARUS Coreference Explorer , an interactive tool to browse and search coreference-annotated data. It can display coreference annotations as a tree, as an entity grid, or in a standard text-based display mode, and lets the user switch freely between the different modes. The tool can compare two different annotations on the same document, allowing system developers to evaluate errors in automatic system predictions. It features a flexible search engine, which enables the user to graphically construct search queries over sets of documents annotated with coreference.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Coreference resolution is the task of automatically grouping references to the same real-world entity in a document into a set. It is an active topic in cur- rent NLP research and has received considerable attention in recent years, including the 2011 and 2012 CoNLL shared tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pradhan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pradhan et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Coreference relations are commonly repre- sented by sets of mentions, where all mentions in one set (or coreference cluster) are considered coreferent. This type of representation does not support any internal structure within the clusters. However, many automatic coreference resolvers establish links between pairs of mentions which are subsequently transformed to a cluster by tak- ing the transitive closure over all links, i.e., placing all mentions that are directly or transitively classi- fied as coreferent in one cluster. This is particu- larly the case for several state-of-the-art resolvers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fernandes et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Durrett and Klein, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Björkelund and Kuhn, 2014</ref>). These pairwise de- cisions, which give rise to a clustering, can be ex- ploited for detailed error analysis and more fine- grained search queries on data automatically an- notated for coreference.</p><p>We present the ICARUS Coreference Explorer (ICE), an interactive tool to browse and search coreference-annotated data. In addition to stan- dard text-based display modes, ICE features two other display modes: an entity-grid ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barzilay and Lapata, 2008</ref>) and a tree view, which makes use of the internal pairwise links within the clusters. ICE builds on ICARUS <ref type="bibr">(Gärtner et al., 2013</ref>), a platform for search and exploration of dependency treebanks. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> ICE is geared towards two (typically) distinct users: The NLP developer who designs corefer- ence resolution systems can inspect the predic- tions of his system using the three different dis- play modes. Moreover, ICE can compare the pre- dictions of a system to a gold standard annotation, enabling the developer to inspect system errors in- teractively. The second potential user is the cor- pus linguist, who might be interested in brows- ing or searching a document, or a (large) set of documents for certain coreference relations. The built-in search engine of ICARUS now also allows search queries over sets of documents in order to meet the needs of this type of user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data Representation</head><p>ICE reads the formats used in the 2011 and 2012 CoNLL shared tasks as well as the SemEval 2010 format ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Recasens et al., 2010</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Since these for- mats cannot accommodate pairwise links, an aux- iliary file with standoff annotation can be pro- vided, which we call allocation. An allocation is a list of pairwise links between mentions. Multiple allocations can be associated with a single docu- ment and the user can select one of these for dis- play or search queries. An allocation can also in- clude properties on mentions and links. The set of possible properties is not constrained, and the user can freely specify properties as a list of key- value pairs. Properties on mentions may include, e.g., grammatical gender or number, or informa- tion status labels. Additionally, a special property that indicates the head word of a mention can be provided in an allocation. The head property en- ables the user to access head words of mentions for display or search queries.</p><p>The motivation for keeping the allocation file separate from the CoNLL or SemEval files is two- fold: First, it allows ICE to work without hav- ing to provide an allocation file, thereby making it easy to use with the established formats for coref- erence. The user is still able to introduce addi- tional structure by the use of the allocation file. Second, multiple allocation files allow the user to switch between different allocations while explor- ing a set of documents. Moreover, as we will see in Section 3.3, ICE can also compare two different allocations in order to highlight the differences.</p><p>In addition to user-specified allocations, ICE will always by default provide an internal structure for the clusters, in which the correct antecedent of every mention is the closest coreferent mention with respect to the linear order of the document (this is equivalent to the training instance creation heuristic proposed by <ref type="bibr">Soon et al. (2001)</ref>). There- fore, the user is not required to define an allocation on their own.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Display Modes</head><p>In this section we describe the entity grid and tree display modes by means of screenshots. ICE addi- tionally includes a standard text-based view, sim- ilar to other coreference visualization tools. The example document is taken from the CoNLL 2012 development set (Pradhan et al., 2012) and we use two allocations: (1) the predictions output by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Björkelund and Kuhn (2014)</ref> system (predicted) and (2) a gold allocation that was obtained by running the same system in a restricted setting, where only links between coreferent mentions are allowed (gold). The complete document can be seen in the lower half of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Entity grid</head><p>Barzilay and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lapata (2008)</ref> introduce the entity grid, a tabular view of entities in a document. Specifically, rows of the grid correspond to sen- tences, and columns to entities. The cells of the ta- ble are used to indicate that an entity is mentioned in the corresponding sentence. Entity grids pro- vide a compact view on the distribution of men- tions in a document and allow the user to see how the description of an entity changes from mention to mention. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows ICE's entity-grid view for the example document using the predicted allocation. When clicking on a cell in the entity grid the im- mediate textual context of the cell is shown in the lower pane. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the cell with the blue background has been clicked, which corresponds to the two mentions firms from Taiwan and they. These mentions are thus highlighted in the lower pane. The user can also right-click on a cell and jump straight to the tree view, centered around the same mentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Label Patterns</head><p>The information that is displayed in the cells of the entity grid (and also on the nodes in the tree view, see Section 3.3) can be fully customized by the user. The customization is achieved by defin- ing label patterns. A label pattern is a string that specifies the format according to which a mention will be displayed. The pattern can extract infor- mation on a mention according to three axes: (1) at the token-level for the full mention, extracting, e.g., the sequence of surface forms or the part-of- speech tags of a mention; (2) at the mention-level, extracting an arbitrary property of a mention as de- fined in an allocation; (3) token-level information from the head word of a mention.</p><p>Label patterns can be defined interactively while displaying a document and the three axes are referenced by dedicated operators. For instance, the label pattern $form$ extracts the full surface form of a mention, whereas #form# only extracts the surface form of the head word of a mention. All properties defined by the user in the allocation (see Section 2) are accessible via label patterns.</p><p>For example, the allocations we use for Fig- ure 1 include a number of properties on the mentions, most of which are internally com- puted by the coreference system: The TYPE of a mention, which can take any of the values {Name, Common, Pronoun} and is inferred from the part-of-speech tags in the CoNLL file; The grammatical NUMBER of a mention, which is as- signed based on the number and gender data com- piled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bergsma and Lin (2006)</ref> and can take the values {Sin, Plu, Unknown}. The label pat- tern for displaying the number property associated with a mention would be %Number%.</p><p>The label pattern used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is defined as ("$form$" -%Type% -%Number%). This pat- tern accesses the full surface form of the mentions ($form$), as well as the TYPE (%Type%) and gram- matical NUMBER (%Number%) properties defined in the allocation file.</p><p>Custom properties and label patterns can be used for example to display the entity grid in the form proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barzilay and Lapata (2008)</ref>: In the allocation, we assign a coarse-grained gram- matical function property (denoted GF) to every mention, where each mention is tagged as either subject, object, or other (denoted S, O, X, respec- tively). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The label pattern %GF% then displays the grammatical function of each mention in the entity grid, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Tree view</head><p>Pairwise links output by an automatic coreference system can be treated as arcs in a directed graph. Linking the first mention of each cluster to an ar- tificial root node creates a tree structure that en- codes the entire clustering in a document. This representation has been used in coreference re- <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The grammatical function was assigned by converting the phrase-structure trees in the CoNLL file (which lack grammatical function information) to Stanford dependencies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">de Marneffe and Manning, 2008)</ref>, and then extracting the grammatical function from the head word in each mention. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Example entity grid, using the labels by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barzilay and Lapata (2008)</ref>. solvers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fernandes et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Björkelund and Kuhn, 2014</ref>), but ICE uses it to display links be- tween mentions introduced by an automatic (pair- wise) resolver. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows three examples of the tree view of the same document as before: The gold allo- cation (3a), the predicted allocation (3b), as well as the differential view, where the two allocations are compared (3c). Each mention corresponds to a node in the trees and all mentions are directly or transitively dominated by the artificial root node. Every subtree under the root constitutes its own cluster and a solid arc between two mentions de- notes that the two mentions are coreferent accord- ing to a coreference allocation. The information displayed in the nodes of the tree can be cus- tomized using label patterns.</p><p>In the differential view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3c</ref>  In this case, the coreference system erro- neously clustered these two mentions. The correct antecedent is indicated by the dashed arc that originates from the document root.</p><p>This error is particularly interesting since the system effectively merges the two clusters corresponding to Shantou and Shantou' s new high level technology development zone. The tree view, however, shows that the error stems from a single link between these two men- tions, and that the developer needs to address this.</p><p>Since the tree-based view makes pairwise de- cisions explicit, the differential view shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3c</ref> is more informative to NLP develop- ers when inspecting errors by automatic system than comparing a gold standard clustering to a pre- dicted one. The problem with analyzing the error on clusterings instead of trees is that the clusters would be merged, i.e., it is not clear where the ac- tual mistake was made.</p><p>Additional error types not illustrated by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 3c</ref> include false positive mentions, where the system invents a mention that is not part of the gold allocation. When a false positive mention is assigned as an antecedent of another mention, the corresponding link is marked as an invented antecedent. Links that erroneously start a new cluster when it is coreferent with other men- tions to the left is marked as false new.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Searching</head><p>The search engine in ICE makes the annotations in the documents searchable for, e. g., a corpus lin- guist who is interested in specific coreference phe- nomena. It allows the user to express queries over mentions related through the tree. Queries can ac- cess the different layers of annotation, both from the allocation file and the underlying document, using various constructs such as, e.g., transitivity, regular expressions, and/or disjunctions. The user can construct queries either textually (through a query language) or graphically (by creating nodes and configuring constraints in dialogues). For a further discussion of the search engine we refer to the original ICARUS paper <ref type="bibr">(Gärtner et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows a query that matches cataphoric pronouns, i.e., pronouns that precede their an- tecedents. The figure shows the query expressed as a subgraph (on the left) and the corresponding results (right) obtained on the development set of the English CoNLL 2012 data using the manual annotation represented in the gold allocation.</p><p>The query matches two mentions that are di- rectly or transitively connected through the graph. The first mention (red node) matches mentions of the type Pronoun that have to be attached to the document root node. In the tree formalism we adopt, this implies that it must be the first men- tion of its cluster. The second mention (green node) matches any mention that is not of the type Pronoun. The search results are grouped along two axes: the surface form of the head word of the first (red) node, and the type property of the second mention (green node), indicated by the special grouping operator &lt; * &gt; inside the boxes. The correspond- ing results are shown in the right half of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, where the first group (surface form) runs verti- cally, and the second group (mention type) runs horizontally. The number of hits for each configu- ration is shown in the corresponding cell. For ex- ample, the case that the first mention of a chain is the pronoun I and the closest following coreferent mention that is not a pronoun is of type Common, occurs 6 times. By clicking on a cell, the user can jump straight to a list of the matches, and browse them using any of the three display modes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Two popular annotation and visualization tools for coreference are PAlinkA (Or˘ asan, 2003) and MMAX2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Müller and Strube, 2006</ref>), which fo- cus on a (customizable) textual visualization with highlighting of clusters. The TrED (Pajas andŠtěpánek andˇandŠtěpánek, 2009) project is a very flexible multi- level annotation tool centered around tree-based annotations that can be used to annotate and vi- sualize coreference. It also features a powerful search engine. Recent annotation tools include the web-based BRAT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Stenetorp et al., 2012</ref>) and its extension WebAnno ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Yimam et al., 2013)</ref>. A ded- icated query and exploration tool for multi-level annotations is ANNIS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zeldes et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The aforementioned tools are primarily meant as annotation tools. They have a tendency of lock- ing the user into one type of visualization (tree-or text-based), while often lacking advanced search functionality. In contrast to them, ICE is not meant to be yet another annotation tool, but was designed as a dedicated coreference exploration tool, which enables the user to swiftly switch between differ- ent views. Moreover, none of the existing tools provide an entity-grid view.</p><p>ICE is also the only tool that can graphically compare predictions of a system to a gold standard with a fine-grained distinction on the types of dif- ferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kummerfeld and Klein (2013)</ref> present an algorithm that transforms a predicted corefer- ence clustering into a gold clustering and records the necessary transformations, thereby quantify- ing different types of errors. However, their algo- rithm only works on clusterings (sets of mentions), not pairwise links, and is therefore not able to pin- point some of the mistakes that ICE can (such as the foreign antecedent described in Section 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We presented ICE, a flexible coreference visual- ization and search tool. The tool complements standard text-based display modes with entity-grid and tree visualizations. It is also able to dis- play discrepancies between two different corefer- ence annotations on the same document, allow- ing NLP developers to debug coreference sys- tems in a graphical way. The built-in search en- gine allows corpus linguists to construct complex search queries and provide aggregate result views over large sets of documents. Being based on the ICARUS platform's plugin-engine, ICE is extensi- ble and can easily be extended to cover additional data formats.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Entity grid over the predicted clustering in the example document.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,83.34,62.81,430.87,161.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>
