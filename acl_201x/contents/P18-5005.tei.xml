<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Idioms and metaphors are characteristic to all ar- eas of human activity and to all types of dis- course. Their processing is a rapidly growing area in NLP, since they have become a big chal- lenge for NLP systems. Their omnipresence in language has been established in a number of cor- pus studies and the role they play in human rea- soning has also been confirmed in psychological experiments. This makes idioms and metaphors an important research area for computational and cognitive linguistics, and their automatic identi- fication and interpretation indispensable for any semantics-oriented NLP application.</p><p>This tutorial aims to provide attendees with a clear notion of the linguistic characteristics of id- ioms and metaphors, computational models of id- ioms and metaphors using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, their relevance for the intersection of deep learning and natural language processing, what methods and resources are available to sup- port their use, and what more could be done in the future. Our target audience are researchers and practitioners in machine learning, parsing (syn- tactic and semantic) and language technology, not necessarily experts in idioms and metaphors, who are interested in tasks that involve or could benefit from considering idioms and metaphors as a per- vasive phenomenon in human language and com- munication.</p><p>This tutorial consists of four parts. Part I starts with an introduction to MWEs and their linguis- tic dimensions, that is, idiomaticity, syntactic and semantic fixedness, specificity, etc., as well as their statistical characteristics (variability, recur- rence, association, etc.). The second half of this part focuses on the specific characteristics of id- ioms and metaphors (linguistic, conceptual and extended metaphor).</p><p>Part II surveys systems for processing idioms and metaphors which incorporate state-of-the-art NLP methods. The second half of this part is ded- icated to resources for idioms and metaphors, as well as evaluation.</p><p>Part III offers a thorough overview of how and where research on idioms and metaphors can con- tribute to the intersection of NLP and Deep Learn- ing, particularly focusing on recent advances in the computational treatment of MWEs in the frame- work of Deep Learning.</p><p>Part IV of the tutorial concludes with concrete examples of where idioms and metaphors treat- ment can contribute to language technology appli- cations such as sentiment analysis, educational ap- plications, dialog systems and digital humanities.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2</head><label></label><figDesc>Tutorial Outline 1.
