				<p>This paper addresses the tasks of automatic seed selection for bootstrapping relation extraction, and noise reduction for distantly supervised relation extraction. We first point out that these tasks are related. Then, inspired by ranking relation instances and patterns computed by the HITS algorithm, and selecting cluster cen-troids using the K-means, LSA, or NMF method, we propose methods for selecting the initial seeds from an existing resource, or reducing the level of noise in the distantly labeled data. Experiments show that our proposed methods achieve a better performance than the baseline systems in both tasks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Bootstrapping for relation extraction (RE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Riloff et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agichtein and Gravano, 2000</ref>) is a class of minimally supervised meth- ods frequently used in machine learning: initial- ized by a small set of example instances called seeds, to represent a particular semantic relation, the bootstrapping system operates iteratively to ac- quire new instances of a target relation. Selecting "good" seeds is one of the most important steps to reduce semantic drift, which is a typical phe- nomenon of the bootstrapping process.</p><p>Another approach, called "distant supervision" (DS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mintz et al., 2009)</ref>, does not require any la- bels on the text. The assumption of DS is that if two entities participate in a known Freebase rela- tion, any sentence that contains those two entities might express that relation. However, this tech- nique often introduces noise to the generated train- ing data. As a result, DS is still limited by the quality of training data, and noise existing in pos- itively labeled data may affect the performance of supervised learning.</p><p>In this study, we propose methods that can be applied for both automatic seed selection and noise reduction by formulating these tasks as rank- ing problems according to different ranking crite- ria. Our methods are inspired by ranking instances and patterns computed by the HITS algorithm, and selecting cluster centroids using K-means, latent semantic analysis, or the non-negative matrix fac- torization method. The main contributions of this paper are (a) an annotated dataset of 5,727 part- whole relations 1 , which contains 8 subtypes for the bootstrapping RE system; (b) methods for au- tomatic seed selection for bootstrapping RE and noise reduction for distant supervised RE; and (c) experimental results showing that the proposed models outperform baselines on two datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Automatic Seed Selection for Bootstrapping RE</head><p>As manually selecting the seeds requires tremen- dous effort, some research proposed methods to select the seed automatically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Eisner and Karakos (2005)</ref> used a "strapping" approach to evaluate many candidate seeds automatically for a word sense disambiguation task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kozareva and Hovy (2010)</ref> proposed a method for measuring seed quality using a regression model and applied it to the extraction of unary semantic relations, such as"people" and "city". <ref type="bibr">Kiso</ref>   ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Movshovitz-Attias and Cohen (2012)</ref> gen- erated a ranking based on pointwise mutual infor- mation (PMI) to pick up the seeds from existing resources in the biomedical domain. Given the seed set of a target relation, the goal of the boot- strapping method is to find instances similar to initial seeds by harvesting instances and patterns iteratively over large corpora, e.g., Wikipedia or ClueWeb.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Noise Reduction for Distantly Supervised RE</head><p>The DS assumption is too strong and leads to wrongly labeled data that affects performance. Many studies focused on methods of noise re- duction in DS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Intxaurrondo et al. (2013)</ref> filtered out noisy mentions from the distantly supervised dataset using their frequencies, PMI, or the sim- ilarity between the centroids of all relation men- tions and each individual mention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Xiang et al. (2016)</ref> introduced ranking-based methods accord- ing to different strategies to select effective train- ing groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Li et al. (2017)</ref> proposed three novel heuristics that use lexical and syntactic informa- tion to remove noise in the biomedical domain. The data generated by the noise reduction process can be used by supervised learning algorithms to train models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Problem Formulation</head><p>Let R * be the set of target relations. The goal is to find instances, or pairs of entities, upon which the relation holds. For each target relation r ∈ R * , we assume there is a set D r of triples rep- resenting the relation r. The triples in D r have the form (e 1 , p, e 2 ), where e 1 and e 2 denote en- tities, and p denotes the pattern that connects the two entities. A pair of entities (e 1 , e 2 ) is called an instance. This terminology is similar to the one used in open information extraction systems, such as <ref type="bibr">Reverb (Fader et al., 2011</ref>). For example, in triple (Barack Obama, was born in, Honolulu), (Barack Obama, Honolulu) is the instance, and "was born in" is the pattern. The two tasks we address are defined as follows:</p><p>Seed Selection for Bootstrapping RE: In au- tomatic seed selection, a set R * of target rela- tions and sets of instance-pattern triples D r = {(e 1 , p, e 2 )} representing each target relation r ∈ R * are given as input. These triples are extracted from existing corpus or database, e.g., WordNet.</p><p>With these inputs, the task is to choose good seeds from the instances appearing in D r for each r ∈ R * , such that they work effectively in bootstrap- ping RE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Noise Reduction for Distantly Supervised RE:</head><p>In noise reduction for distantly supervised RE, the input is the target relations R * and the sets D r of triples 2 generated automatically by DS for each relation r ∈ R * . Because the data is generated automatically by DS, D r may contain noise, i.e., triples (e 1 , p, e 2 ) for which relation r does not ac- tually hold between e 1 and e 2 . The goal of noise reduction is to filter out these noisy triples, so that they do not deteriorate the quality of the triple classifier trained subsequently.</p><p>Formulation as Ranking Tasks: As we can see from the task definitions above, both seed selec- tion and noise reduction are the task of selecting triples from a given collection. Indeed, the two tasks essentially have a similar goal in terms of the ranking-based perspective. We thus formulate them as the task of ranking instances (in seed se- lection) or triples (in noise reduction), given a set of (possibly noisy) triples. In the seed selection task, we use the k highest ranked instances as the seeds for bootstrapping RE. Likewise, in noise re- duction for DS, we only use the k highest ranked triples from the DS-generated data to train a clas- sifier. Note that the value of k in noise reduction may be much larger than in seed selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Approaches to Automatic Seed Selection and Noise Reduction</head><p>In this section, we propose several methods that can be applied for both automatic seed selec- tion and noise reduction tasks, inspired by rank- ing relation instances and patterns computed by the HITS algorithm, and picking cluster cen- troids using the K-means, latent semantic anal- ysis (LSA), or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">K-means-based Approach</head><p>The first method we describe is a K-means-based approach. It is described as follows: (1) De- termine the number k of instances/triples that should be selected <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> Run the K-means clus- tering algorithm to partition all instances in the in- put triples (see Section 3) into k clusters. Each data point is represented by the embedding vec- tor difference between its entities; e.g., the in- stance I = (Barack Obama, Honolulu) corre- sponds to: vec(I) = vec("Barack Obama") − vec("Honolulu"). We use pre-trained vectors published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mikolov et al. (2013)</ref>. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> The in- stance closest to the centroid is selected in each cluster. Given that the number of clusters is k, the same number of instances/triples will be chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">HITS-based Approach</head><p>Hypertext-induced topic search (HITS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kleinberg, 1999</ref>), also known as the hubs-and- authorities algorithm, is a link analysis method for ranking web pages. In HITS, a good hub is a page that points to many good authorities and vice versa; a good authority is a page that is pointed to by many good hubs. These hubs and authorities form a bipartite graph, where we can compute the hubness score of each node. In our task, let A be the instance-pattern co- occurrence matrix. We can compute the hubness score for each instance on the bipartite graph of instances and patterns induced by the matrix A. Inspired by the way HITS ranks hubs and authori- ties, our HITS-based seed selection strategy can be explained as follows: (1) Determine the number k of triples that should be selected.(2) Build the bi- partite graph of instances and patterns based on the instance-pattern co-occurrence matrix A. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> presents three possible ways of building a bipar- tite graph. For the first type of graph, we consider each instance/pattern as a node in the graph. This representation is similar to that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kiso et al. (2011)</ref>. In the second graph representation, pat- terns and instances are treated as nodes and edges, respectively. Similarly, instances and patterns are treated as nodes and edges, respectively in the last representation. (3) For the first and third types, we simply retain the top-k instances with the high- est hubness scores as the outputs (we sort the in- stances in descending order based on their hub- ness scores). For the second type, k instances as- sociated with the highest scoring patterns are cho- sen (we first sort the patterns in descending order based on their hubness scores).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">HITS-and K-means-based Approach</head><p>In the combined method of HITS and K-means algorithms, we first rank the instances and pat- terns based on their bipartite graph and then run K-means to cluster instances in our annotated dataset. However, instead of choosing the instance nearest to the centroid, we retain the one that has the highest HITS hubness score in each cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">LSA-based Approach</head><p>Latent semantic analysis (LSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Deerwester et al., 1990</ref>) is also a widely used method for the au- tomatic clustering of data along multiple dimen- sions. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to construct a low-rank approximation of the instance-pattern co-occurrence matrix A. The SVD projection is performed by decomposing the matrix A ∈ R M ×N into the product of three matrices, namely an SVD instance matrix I ∈ R M ×K , a diagonal matrix of singular values S ∈ R K×K , and an SVD pattern matrix P ∈ R K×N :</p><p>A ≈ ISP T Our LSA-based seed selection strategy is as follows: (1) Specify the desired number k of triples. (2) Use the LSA algorithm to decompose the instance-pattern co-occurrence matrix A into three matrices I, S, and P. We set the number of LSA dimensions to K = k. (3) We can consider LSA as a form of soft clustering, with each column of the SVD instance matrix I corresponding to a cluster. Then, we select the k instances that have the highest absolute values from each column of I.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Datasets and Settings</head><p>We provide an annotated dataset of part-whole re- lations as a reliable resource for selecting seeds. Our dataset was collected from Wikipedia and ClueWeb, and annotated by two annotators. One of its special characteristics is that the part-whole relation is a collection of relations, not a single re- lation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Iris, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Winston et al., 1987)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gives the frequencies of each sub- type of part-whole relations. There are 5,727 in- stances of 8 subtypes that were annotated with the same labels by both annotators. We use Espresso+Word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Phi and Matsumoto, 2016)</ref>, which is an improved version for the origi- nal Espresso algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006</ref>). Espresso+Word2vec outperformed the Espresso system for harvesting part-whole rela- tions by utilizing the Similarity Ranker, which uses the embedded vector difference between in- stance pairs of relations. The performance is mea- sured with <ref type="bibr">Precision@N (Manning et al., 2008)</ref>, N = 50. In total, 5,000 instances are checked by</p></div>

We vary the number k of seeds between 5 and 50 with a step of 5 to report the average P@50 of each seed selection method. For the noise reduction task, we use the training and testing set developed by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Riedel et al., 2010)</ref>, which contains 53 relation classes. This dataset was generated by aligning Freebase relations with the New York Times corpus. After removing noisy triples from the dataset using the proposed meth- ods, we use the filtered data to train two kinds of convolutional neural networks (CNN) (the CNN model in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zeng et al., 2014</ref>) and the PCNN model in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zeng et al., 2015</ref>)) with at-least-one multi- instance learning (ONE) used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>, and the sentence-level attention (ATT) used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lin et al., 2016</ref>). Finally, we report the area under the precision-recall (AUCPR) of each noise reduction method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Performance on Automatic Seed Selection Task</head><p>The performances of the seed selection methods are presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. For the HITS-based and HITS+K-means-based methods, we display the P@50 with three types of graph representation as shown in Section 4.2. We use random seed se- lection as the baseline for comparison. As <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows, the random method achieved a precision of 0.75. The relation extraction system that uses the random method has the worst average P@50 among all seed selection strategies. The HITS- based method's P@50s when using Graph1 and Graph3 are confirmed to be better than when us- ing Graph2. This indicates that relying on reli- able instances is better than reasoning over pat- terns (recall that for the Graph2, we first choose  the patterns, then select the instances associated with those patterns), as there is a possibility that a pattern can be ambiguous, and therefore, instances linked to that pattern can be incorrect. The K- means-based seed selection method provides the best average P@50 with a performance of 0.96. The HITS+K-means-based method performs bet- ter than using only the HITS strategy, while the LSA-based and NMF-based methods have a com- parable performance. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> presents the performance of noise re- duction methods. Recall that the K-means-based method achieves a high P@50 for the seed selection method. Our assumption is that each cluster may represent a set in which elements have similar semantic properties. However, we observed that as the number of relations is relatively high and there is no distinct def- inition between some relations in the distantly labeled data (e.g., the following three relations are quite similar:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Performance on Noise Reduction Task</head><p>/location/country/capital, /location/province/capital, and /location/us state/capital, we decided not to perform the K-means-based method for our noise reduction task. The performances of the HITS-based, LSA-based, and NMF-based noise reduction methods are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. We experimentally set the portion of retained data from the distantly labeled data to 90%, given that the performance can be affected if too many sentences are removed from the original data. We also perform experiments with an ensem- ble method that combines the HITS-based and LSA-based strategies to merge rankings from their outputs, with half of the triples coming from the LSA-based method and the other half from the HITS-based method. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> indicates that our proposed methods improved the performance of all CNN and PCNN models. Our ensemble method achieved the best improvements for three out of four systems, except that the HITS-based method obtained the best score for CNN+ONE.</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> To be precise, in each triple (e1, s, e2) generated by DS, s is not a pattern but a sentence that contains entities e1 and e2. However, we can easily convert each instance-sentence triple (e1, s, e2) to an instance-pattern triple (e1, p, e2) by looking for a pattern p that connects two entities in sentence s.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Depending on the task, instances or triples will be selected: instances for the automatic seed selection task, and triples for the noise reduction task. As instances are pairs of entities which are included in triples, we can simply convert between the instance and the triple, and apply a proposed method to both tasks.</note>
