				<p>FREEBASE contains entities and relation information but is highly incomplete. Relevant information is ubiquitous in web text, but extraction deems challenging. We present JEDI, an automated system to jointly extract typed named entities and FREEBASE relations using dependency pattern from text. An innovative method for constraint solving on entity types of multiple relations is used to disambiguate pattern. The high precision in the evaluation supports our claim that we can detect entities and relations together, alleviating the need to train a custom classifier for an entity type 1 .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Finding, tagging and extracting relations in web text is one of the more challenging tasks in In- formation Extraction (IE). It consists of correctly labeling entities as instances of a particular type (such as Person, Organization or Location) and de- tecting relations between them, such as worksIn, bornIn or even more fine grained ones such as re- ceiveDegree. These relations are stored for fur- ther analysis in knowledge bases, but often exist- ing ones are highly incomplete. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Min et al. (2013)</ref> report that in the collaborative-edited FREEBASE 2 knowledge base 93.8% of the person entities are missing a place of birth entry. To close the cap au- tomated methods are needed that can detect these relations, by analyzing the abundance of web text.</p><p>A typical process to detect relations uses the linking words (pattern) between two entities to la- bel a relation, but this poses the challenge of deal- ing with ambiguous pattern. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Demonstrator is available at jedi.textmining.tu-berlin.de <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Freebase is available at www.freebase.com Consider the following sentences that both con- tain the pattern receive indicating completely dif- ferent relations: "Bill received his B.A. in Bibli- cal Studies from Wheaton College.", and "Leo re- ceived an Oscar for Revenant.".</p><p>The first sentence contains the binary relation receiveDegree, linking a person to a degree, but in the second, the same pattern indicates the per- sonAward relation. To correctly disambiguate, we need to incorporate context. This paper proposes the novel method of using the entity types of mul- tiple binary relations to solve the disambiguation.</p><p>Motivation Typically labeling relations and en- tities is done in sequence, leading to a pipeline architecture which first detects entities and subse- quently tries to link them to extract relations. As detection errors can easily propagate, there is po- tential in executing these steps jointly. It is driven by the motivation that instead of focusing on indi- vidual binary assignments, multiple entities found in the text can be used to constraint and restrict each other's entity and relation types. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an overview of the entire solu- tion. Entity mentions and potential relations indi-cated by a pattern form a multi graph. Selecting a particular type for an entity prunes the number of potential relations that this entity can partici- pate in. Furthermore, having established a relation between a pair of entities further restricts the po- tential relations that can hold between any other entity and one of the pair's members due to in- ferred type restrictions. Thus all candidate entities in a sentence are considered together to support or restrict any contained relations.</p><p>Contributions This paper presents and evalu- ates JEDI a system to translate the relation detec- tion problem into a constraint satisfaction prob- lem. The graph of entities and potential relations forms a resolution graph, where each entity is con- strained on the potential types it can hold. Solv- ing this problem jointly resolves entity and rela- tion types without training an entity classifier, al- lowing to detect the large number of relation and types defined in FREEBASE.</p><p>The evaluation shows high precision across a variety of texts and relations. We furthermore re- lease the implementation as open source and pro- vide a web demonstrator to showcase the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Most prominent for relation extraction is the idea that entities that co-occur with a similar context have similar meanings, driven by the distribu- tional hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Harris, 1954)</ref>. The shortest path kernel is a good estimator for approximat- ing the distribution and has been used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bunescu and Mooney (2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Culotta and Sorensen (2004)</ref> showed that it is possible to train a relation clas- sifier on the extracted pattern to predict a small number of relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kate and Mooney (2010)</ref> proposed a card style resolution algorithm, which infers recursively the most probable relation assignment for a given en- tity pair, but still requires an entity classifier and only works for a small number of relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mintz et al. (2009)</ref> proposed to use clustering to group together entity co-occurrences based on their shortest path, to extract relation types. This eliminates the need for a classifier for relation de- tection, but requires one for entity extraction. Pat- tern can only be assigned to one relation and thus capture only the most dominating meaning. The problem of relation extraction can also be solved using matrix decomposition, as shown by . Their work targets FREEBASE rela- tions, but demands a complex training step which decomposes the co-occurrence matrix and is de- pendent on the text domain as well.</p><p>The SOFIE system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Suchanek et al., 2009</ref>) uses logical reasoning to find instances of a relation in text. It does not require any pre-training as it learns the extraction rules alongside the relation detection, but is limited in the amount of data it can process, because of the costly resolution step. Similar to our approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Singh et al. (2013)</ref> pro- posed to model the entity tagging and relation ex- traction problem jointly, using belief propagation to find relation instances, but targeting a much smaller number of relations. The idea to incorpo- rate types into the relation extraction process was explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Koch et al. (2014)</ref> improving the re- lation detection performance.</p><p>Contrary to existing systems JEDI does not need a pre-trained entity classifier. We leverage a very large corpus of shortest path patterns as reference and use constraint propagation to solve ambigui- ties. Our system also maps into the large number of predefined FREEBASE relations, alleviating the need to manually specify any relations. The sys- tem can be easily incorporated into a more com- plex IE pipeline that uses the results for example for entity linking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Pattern Corpus</head><p>To detect meaningful patterns we use FREEPAL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kirschnick et al., 2014)</ref>. A dataset of 10 mil- lion lexico-syntactic pattern-relation assignments built using distant supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mintz et al., 2009)</ref>. Each pattern was generated from a shortest depen- dency path between two known FREEBASE enti- ties in a sentence that participate in a known rela- tion. The corpus uses CLUEWEB09 as text basis and the FACC1 entity annotations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gabrilovich et al., 2013</ref>) to generate a distribution of relations over pattern. An entropy score indicates the degree of ambiguity, which we use for scoring the relation assignments. Overall more than 75% of the con- tained pattern were observed with more than one relation, requiring a disambiguation method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Jointly Detecting Entities and Relations</head><p>The process of detecting relations is described in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and consists of the following steps, de- scribed in the following:</p><p>• Pre-process input text [X] receive <ref type="bibr">[Y]</ref> 5. Entity Multigraph receive <ref type="bibr">[X]</ref> from <ref type="bibr">[Y]</ref> Figure 2: Solution overview: Candidate Entities (2) are selected from the source text (1). Shortest path in the dependency tree is extracted (3), pruned against pattern-relation assignment database (4), type information is translated into a multi graph (5) which defines the constraint satisfaction problem (6). The solution yields an assignment of entity types and relations <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>. (Types are omitted for readability)</p><p>• Selection of candidate entities • Extract shortest dependency path (pattern) between all pairwise candidate entities • Match the pattern using the FREEPAL corpus to determine candidate relations • Translate the relation detection into a con- straint satisfaction problem which determines the potential types of all entities and thus the connecting relations</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pre-Processing</head><p>The target text is annotated with part-of-speech tags and dependency information using the Stan- ford CoreNLP Toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Manning et al., 2014</ref>). Co- reference resolution is applied to further link en- tity mentions across sentence boundaries provid- ing more link targets between entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Selecting Candidate Entities</head><p>Instead of trying to find any of the 10 million pat- tern from the pattern corpus in a given text, where every match would provide a candidate subject and object pair for a relation, we reverse the prob- lem and produce a set of candidate entities and try to match the connecting pattern with the corpus.</p><p>JEDI works with any candidate entities, pro- duced for example by an existing entity tagger or just based on simple heuristics. One such simple heuristic is to use nouns, with the extension to join together adjacent nouns to effectively form noun phrases. Nouns are grouped, if they are directly adjacent and connected through a dependency link of the type poss or nsubj, while also allowing the connecting word "of". This captures entities of the form "University of Illinois" and "Wheaton College", but fails to separate appositions such as "Bishop Oldham" or "Professor Smith", but this can be later rectified. This heuristic can be easily changed as the remaining processing does not de- pend on the text form or type of the entities. Using nouns also helps in finding entities generally not covered by specific NER systems, such as "bibli- cal studies" as a field of study, without specifically training a tagger for this target type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Extracting the Shortest Path</head><p>Finding the shortest path between two entities equals finding a path in the dependency graph be- tween the head words of each entity. We use a simplified instance of Collins Head finding rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Collins, 2003)</ref> to determine the head in multi- word entities. The pattern is derived by picking up all tokens in their lemmatized form on the path, substituting the start with X and the end with the label Y. To make the pattern more readable, all to- kens are sorted based on their appearance in the source text.</p><p>This produces pattern of the form <ref type="bibr">[X]</ref> receive <ref type="bibr">[Y]</ref> [1-dobj-2,1-nsubj-0]. The pattern is further enriched with the individual dependency annota- tions to differentiate similar textual pattern 3 .</p><p>Conjunctions We apply a simple normalization to conjunctions inspired by CLAUSIE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Corro and Gemulla, 2013)</ref>. Removing the last token in pat- terns containing a conjunction dependency.</p><p>Coreference Resolution Coreference informa- tion expands mentions across sentence bound- aries. Mentions that are connected through a chain are treated as if they are the same entity, if the source of the chain is marked as a candidate entity. Thus we substitute the coreference target with the source in the extraction process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Pattern-Relation Assignments</head><p>The shortest path generation process generates a large number of pattern. To reduce the search space, all extracted pattern are matched against the FREEPAL corpus. This produces for each match a list of potential relations that this pattern has been observed with. Only pattern with an entropy smaller than 3.7 <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and that have been observed at least five times are considered. This reduces the noise by filtering out very unspecific pattern such as <ref type="bibr">[X]</ref> be <ref type="bibr">[Y]</ref>, but at the same time still allows for a lot of ambiguous pattern.</p><p>Each pattern is associated with a list of FREE- BASE relations, for which the argument types are retrieved. This is used to restrict the X and Y en- tity types of the pattern respectively. We use the FREEBASE type normalization presented in FIGER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ling and Weld, 2012)</ref> to reduce the number of en- tity types down to 112.</p><p>To address the problem of arbitrary granularity, we broaden the accepted argument types using a simple type hierarchy. For example, the diedIn relation, which indicates that a person died in a particular location, restricts the subject argument to be of type deceased person. While this is very specific it prevents linking to this entity in other relations, which only accept the more generic per- son type. The type hierarchy is generated by re- trieving the type hints category for each type, us- ing the FREEBASE API. While this does not pro- duce a complete type hierarchy, it adds the most commonly used sub types for a given type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Constraint Solving using Type Inference</head><p>The extracted pattern for each pair of entities form a multi-graph, where edges are assigned a confi- dence score based on the FREEPAL entropy. The resolution process tries to eagerly generate a type assignment for each entity, so that at least one edge between connected vertices, a particular relation, holds according to the type requirements. The choco library <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Prud'homme et al., 2015</ref>) is used for constraint solving. Each edge is transformed into a constraint, using logical conjunctions be- tween all connected vertex pairs and disjunction for each edge between two vertices and their types. This emits for each relation a constraint with all possible type and subtype combinations.</p><p>Scoring Constraint solving produces more than one potential solution. We use a scoring mecha- nism to rank the different solutions, taking into ac- count the number of matched entities, the entropy score taken from the FREEPAL dataset, as well as the type hierarchy. This ensures that if possible, the most specific type assignment for a large num- ber of entities is favored in the resolution process.</p><p>Backtracking If there is no assignment possi- ble -there is a conflict in the graph. Conflicts can arise when detecting relations that are not part of the corpus for a given pattern or wrong pat- tern as a result of erroneously linking entities in a co-reference chain. Backtracking is used to re- peatedly remove vertices and all associated edges from the graph until either a solution is found or all nodes are removed in which case there is no solution. To find the highest scoring assignment backtracking is used to evaluate multiple different graphs, even when a solution is found. Relation P R F Education Degree 0 0 0 Place of Birth 0.76 0.60 0.68 Place of Death 0.89 0.27 0.41 Student Graduate 0.78 0.41 0.53 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Baseline performance. Precision, Re- call and F-measure without Coreference Resolu- tion and type inference using the Noun strategy.</p><p>Stopping The search is terminated early when an adjustable time limit is hit, to ensure that the most probable solution is found early. This trade- off guarantees that the algorithm finishes in fi- nite time, at the expense of not always finding the global optimal solution.</p><p>Result Once a solution is found, all vertices of the graph are bound to a type. The qualifying re- lation between any two connected vertices is se- lected as the one which has the highest score as- sociated with it. This produces triples of the form &lt;entity, entity, relation&gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>The "Relation Extraction Corpus" 5 is used for evaluation -comparing precision, recall and F- measure. The corpus contains text snippets for four separate relations: person holding an educa- tion degree educationDegree (1580 triples), place of death (1955 triples), place of birth (8703 triples) and person graduated from education in- stitute studentGraduate (32653 triples). Each ex- cerpt is annotated by humans as to whether it sup- ports a particular binary relation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Results</head><p>Baseline <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the baseline perfor- mance of the noun strategy without constraint solving, using the most likely relation for an iden- tified pattern based on the FREEPAL entropy score.</p><p>The results show high precision for all relations except for education degree. This supports the use of the FREEPAL dataset for relation extrac- tion, as it covers already a large variety of pattern instances. No instances of the education degree relation were found as almost all pattern for this relation are dominated by the received award rela- tion. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> https://code.google.com/p/relation-extraction-corpus/ Relation P R F Education Degree 0.94 0.61 0.74 Place of Birth 0.77 0.60 0.67 Place of Death 0.88 0.35 0.50 Student Graduate 0.76 0.37 0.50  Type Inference The effect of type inference can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Instances of the degree rela- tion are found with high precision, while the other relations are still found, highlighting that the reso- lution process is not introducing errors. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows the performance of the entity candidate selection strategy (See section 4.2), in- cluding Coreference Resolution. The Noun strat- egy is compared with Named Entities obtained with the Stanford NER classifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Finkel et al., 2005</ref>). For reference we present the results from , where the authors used a man- ual process to find a set of extraction pattern for a given relation.</p><p>Using the simple NOUNS strategy for selecting candidate entities performs on par or better to the NER strategy. Coreferences further improve the F-measure by up to .11 points. This supports our claim that we can detect entities and relations to- gether, alleviating the need to train a custom clas- sifier for an entity type -nouns are sufficient. The education degree relation (not part of the results) is a good example for an entity type, where the standard NER tagger almost always fails to iden- tify the degree entity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We present JEDI a system to extract typed named entities and FREEBASE relations together. Short- est dependency pattern are used to link entities, and constraint solving on the relation argument types is used to disambiguate pattern with multi- ple meanings.</p><p>The evaluation shows that the method increases the precision and recall scores for ambiguous re- lations significantly. As the resolution takes ad- vantage of entities that are connected in chains, it is further possible to detect n-ary relations using only binary pattern. The method proves to work well without any pre-training of NER classifiers and validates that pattern learned using distant su- pervision are effective. This makes it possible to expand existing knowledge bases with information found in web text.</p><p>A web demonstrator of the complete sys- tem as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> is available at jedi.textmining.tu-berlin.de. The system is imple- mented as an UIMA module such that it can be easily incorporated into existing IE pipelines, the source code is hosted at github.com/jkirsch/jedi.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: JEDI System Overview.
