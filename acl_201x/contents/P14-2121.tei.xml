				<p>This paper presents the first computationally-derived scalar measurement of metaphoricity. Each input sentence is given a value between 0 and 1 which represents how metaphoric that sentence is. This measure achieves a correlation of 0.450 (Pearson&apos;s R, p &lt;0.01) with an experimental measure of metaphoricity involving human participants. While far from perfect, this scalar measure of metaphoricity allows different thresholds for metaphoricity so that metaphor identification can be fitted for specific tasks and datasets. When reduced to a binary classification evaluation using the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, the system achieves an F-Measure of 0.608, slightly lower than the comparable binary classification system&apos;s 0.638 and competitive with existing approaches.</p>

The most comprehensive non- computational study of metaphoric expressions in large corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Steen, et al., 2010)</ref> found that up to 18.5% of words in the British National Cor- pus were used metaphorically. This means that metaphorically used words not only have very dif- ferent interpretations than literally used words, but they are also common enough to pose a significant challenge for computational linguistics.</p><p>Starting with <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wilks (1978)</ref>, the problem of metaphor has been approached as an identifica- tion task: first identify or detect metaphoric ex- pressions and then (1) prevent them from inter- fering with computational treatments of literal ex- pressions and (2) use them to gain additional in- sight about a text (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carbonell, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Neuman &amp; Nave, 2009)</ref>. The identification or detection task has been approached as a binary classification problem: for a given unit of language (e.g., word, phrase, sentence) decide whether it is metaphoric or non-metaphoric. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wilks (1978)</ref> used selectional restrictions for this purpose; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mason (2004)</ref> used hand-crafted knowledge resources to detect sim- ilar selectional mismatches; another approach is to detect selectional mismatches using statistically created resources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shutova &amp; Sun, 2013)</ref>. A second general approach to the binary classification problem has been to use mismatches in properties like abstractness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gandy, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Assaf, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tsvetkov, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Turney, et al., 2011</ref>), semantic similarity <ref type="bibr">(Li &amp; Sporleder, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sporleder &amp; Li, 2010)</ref>, and domain membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dunn, 2013a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dunn, , 2013b</ref>) to identify metaphoric units of language. A third ap- proach has been to use forms of topic modelling to identify linguistic units which represent both a metaphoric topic and a literal topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Strzalkowski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bracewell, et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mohler, et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>The single constant across all of these ap- proaches is that the task is viewed as a binary clas- sification problem of distinguishing metaphoric language from non-metaphoric language. This binary distinction assumes a clear boundary be- tween the two; in other words, it assumes that metaphoricity is a discrete property. However, three strands of theoretical research show that metaphoricity is not a discrete property. First, psycholinguistic studies of metaphor processing show that there is no difference between the pro- cessing of metaphoric and non-metaphoric lan- guage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Coulson &amp; Matlock, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gibbs, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Evans, 2010)</ref>. The most plausible interpretation of this psycholinguistic evidence is that most lin- guistic units fall somewhere between metaphoric and literal, so that metaphoricity is a scalar value which influences processing gradually (and is dif- ficult to uncover because of related factors like salience; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Giora, 2002</ref>). Second, linguistic stud- ies of metaphor have found that the metaphoric- ity of a linguistic unit can be predicted given certain factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dunn, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dunn, , 2013c</ref>). Third, the high frequency of metaphorically used language implies that it is hard to set a boundary beyond which a word is used metaphorically. In other words, it seems clear that 18.5% of the BNC is not highly metaphoric, but rather is the sort of slightly metaphoric language that speakers are not con- sciously aware of because it is used so frequently. This paper introduces a system for produc- ing a scalar measurement of metaphoricity which places sentences anywhere between 0 (literal) and 1 (highly metaphoric). The goal is to produce a computationally derived measurement that mod- els the gradient nature of metaphoricity, with the result that metaphors which are clearly and con- sciously seen as metaphors score closer to 1 and metaphors which are not realized by speakers to be metaphoric score further from 1. This scalar measurement approach has two advantages: (1) it adheres more closely to the current theoretical un- derstanding of metaphor, thus being more cogni- tively accurate; (2) it allows applications to control the threshold of metaphoricity when identifying metaphor, thus allowing the treatment of metaphor to be optimized for a given task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Measuring Gradient Metaphoricity</head><p>An experiment was conducted to set a standard for evaluating scalar measurements of metaphoricity. A corpus of 60 sentences of varying metaphoric- ity, drawn equally from four top-level domains (PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SOCIAL, and ABSTRACT), was created using the Corpus of Contemporary American English. Each domain was represented by five verbs and each verb by three sentences: one literal, one slightly metaphoric, and one very metaphoric (as judged by the author).</p><p>The selection of various domains, verbs, and hypothesized metaphoricity levels helps to control for other factors, like abstractness, which might be only indirectly related to metaphoricity. It also en- sures that the experiment covers a wide-range of metaphors. It should be noted that the purpose of the experiment is not to (1) test a three-way distinction between metaphoricity levels (which is simply used to ensure a representative selection of metaphors) or (2) test the author's intuitions of metaphoricity. Rather, the purpose is to have a representative selection of metaphors rated for metaphoricity against which to test scalar mea- surements of metaphoricity.</p><p>Three survey tasks were used.</p><p>The first tested speakers' ability to consistently separate metaphoric and non-metaphoric sentences. Partic- ipants were given a sentence and asked to iden- tify it as "Literal" or "Metaphoric." The second task tested speakers' ability to consistently label a given sentence as "Not Metaphoric", "Slightly Metaphoric", and "Very Metaphoric." The addi- tional label was added in order to provide partic- ipants with a middle ground between metaphoric and literal. The third task tested speakers' ability to consistently rank three sentences according to their metaphoricity. In order to ensure comparabil- ity, each set of three sentences contained a literal, a slightly metaphoric, and a very metaphoric use of a single verb (e.g., three uses of "butcher"). The purpose of this task was to allow participants to directly compare different uses of the same verb.</p><p>The surveys were conducted using the Mechan- icalTurk platform. Each participant took a particu- lar survey only once and the sentences to be rated were drawn randomly from the corpus. Partici- pants were given eight questions for the identifica- tion and labeling tasks and four questions for the ranking task. This was done in order to keep the survey short and prevent participants from losing interest. All participants were asked if they had at- tended a primary or elementary school conducted in English in order to ensure consistent language ability. Further, a test question was positioned part way through the survey to ensure that participants read the prompts correctly. Only answers valid ac- cording to these two tests are considered in the fol- lowing results. Each task had 100 unique partici- pants who gave valid answers, for a total of 300 participants. Participants did not see any domain information for the sentence prompts.</p><p>For the first task, the binary identification task, the metaphoricity of a sentence was computed by taking the percentage of participants who iden- tified it as metaphoric. Thus, if all participants agreed that a sentence was metaphoric, then it re- ceives a 1, while if half of the participants agreed, then it receives a 0.5. The idea here is that high metaphoricity is consciously available to partici- pants, so that the more agreement there is about metaphor the more the participants are aware of the sentence's metaphoricity and thus the higher its metaphoricity value should be. The results of this first experiment are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> with the mean, standard deviation, and range of the metaphoricity measurements. The results are strong on the low end of the scale, with every domain having sentences with either 0 values or close to 0 values. The high end is more problem- atic, with the highest values in each domain be- ing below 0.9. This is a result of not having per- fect agreement across all participants. However, in spite of this, the measure makes a good distinc- tion between utterances. For example, it assigns the metaphoricity value of 0.833 to the sentence in (1), but a metaphoricity value of only 0.153 to the sentence in (2). This reflects a distinction in metaphoricity, although the extreme top and bot- tom of the scale are problematic.</p><p>(1) "A lady on high heels clacked along, the type my mother says invests all of her brainpower in her looks."</p><p>(2) "The banks and the corporations in America today have lots of money that they can invest right now." The second experiment asks participants to label metaphoricity, this time including a dis- tinction between slightly metaphoric and highly metaphoric sentences. The purpose of this is not to test a three-way distinction in metaphoricity values, but rather to improve the scale by mov- ing intermediate sentences out of the Literal or Metaphoric categories. The metaphoricity values for this experiment were calculated in the same way: the percentage of participants who rated a sentence as highly metaphoric. Thus, this mea- surement also is based on the idea that more participants will be consciously aware of highly metaphoric sentences, with a third category avail- able to allow an extra distinction to be made. This measurement, summarized in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, is more ac- curate at the lower end of the scale, with many sentences receiving a 0 because participants were able to choose a category other than metaphoric. At the same time, the values tend to be further from 1 at the upper end of the scale. The sentence in (2) above, for example, received a 0; however, the sentence in (1) above received only a 0.571, which, while high given the range of values, is still far from 1. Thus, while the measurement makes distinctions at the top of the scale, it does not ap- proach 1.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Metaphoricity by labelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain</head><p>The third task gathered ordering information by presenting participants with three sentences, all of which contained the same main verb. The par- ticipants were asked to order the sentences from the least metaphoric to the most metaphoric. The purpose of this experiment was to give partici- pants context in the form of other uses of a given verb against which to make their judgments. The metaphoricity value was computed by taking the percentage of participants who identified a sen- tence as the most metaphoric of the three given sentences. This measurement, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, has similar averages across domains, unlike the previous measurements. It tends to be better than the previous measures on the upper bound, likely because of the contextual comparison it allows. However, because sentences with the same main verb were forced into a three-way ordering, par- ticipants could not, for example, label two of the sentences as equally metaphoric. Thus, it is possi- ble that some of this advantage on the upper bound is a result of the task itself.</p><p>Given these three experiments for measuring the metaphoricity of sentences, <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the correlations between each measure using Pear- son's R. Each correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). The highest correlation is between the first and second tasks, at 0.819. The lowest is between the first and third (which differ in the Domain Mean Std. Dev.   This section has put forward a robust series of scalar measurements of metaphoricity. Each ex- periment had 100 participants and operationalized the task of rating metaphoricity in different ways across a representative section of domains, verbs, and metaphoricity levels. The resulting highly cor- related measures show that we have a good stan- dard of metaphoricity against which to evaluate computational models which produce scalar mea- surements of metaphoricity. The next section in- troduces such a system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Description of the System</head><p>We approach the problem by starting with an exist- ing binary identification system and converting it to a scalar system. In principle any of the property- based systems listed above could be converted in this way. We have chosen to start with the do- main interaction system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dunn, 2013a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dunn, , 2013b</ref>, which performed competitively in an evaluation with other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dunn, 2013b</ref>). The original system uses the properties of domain-membership and event-status of concepts to identify metaphors at the sentence-level using a logistic regression classifier. The scalar version of the system will have to evaluate the features in a different way.</p><p>The first step is to increase the robustness of the system's representation of sentences by adding ad- ditional properties. We split the original system's domain membership feature into two: the domain of a word's referent and the domain of a word's sense. The idea is to capture cases like MINISTER, in which a physical object (a human) is defined by its social role (being a minister). The event-status property is unchanged.</p><p>Several additional properties are added; these properties were not used in the original system. First, animacy-status allows a distinction to be made between inanimate objects like rocks and stones and animate or human objects. Second, the fact-status property allows a distinction to be made between objects which exist as such in- dependently of humans (e.g., rocks and stones) and those which exist to some degree dependent on human consciousness (e.g., laws and ideas). Third, the function-status property allows a dis- tinction to be made between objects which en- code a function (e.g., a screwdriver is specifically an object meant to turn screws) and those which do not encode a function (e.g., rocks are simply objects). A finer distinction within the function- status property distinguishes social functions (e.g., laws) from physical-use functions (e.g., screw- drivers).</p><p>Following the original system, these properties are taken from a knowledge-base and used to cre- ate feature vectors. The text is first processed us- ing Apache OpenNLP for tokenization, named en- tity recognition, and part of speech tagging. Mor- pha <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Minnen, et al., 2001</ref>) is used for lemmati- zation. At this point word sense disambiguation is performed using SenseRelate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pedersen &amp; Kolhatkar, 2009)</ref>, mapping the lexical words to the corresponding WordNet senses. These WordNet senses are first mapped to SynSets and then to con- cepts in the SUMO ontology, using existing map- pings <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Niles &amp; Pease, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, 2003</ref>).</p><p>Thus, each sentence is represented by the SUMO concepts which it contains and each concept is represented by its six concept properties. The fea- tures used are computed as follows: First, the rela- tive frequency of each value of each concept prop- erty in the sentence is determined; Second, the number of instances of the most common value for each property is determined, as well as the number of instances of all other values (both relativized to the number of concepts present in the sentence). Third, the number of types of values for each con- cept property is determined, relative to the number of possible types. This gives a total of 41 features for each sentence.</p><p>These features were computed for each of the sentences used in the experiments and then the correlation between the features and the metaphoricity measurements were computed us- ing Pearson's R. Those features which had a sig- nificant positive relationship with the experimen- tal results, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, were added to- gether to create a rough computational measure of metaphoricity and then converted so that they fall between 0 and 1. The resulting computationally- derived measure correlates significantly with each of the experiments: 0.450, 0.416, and 0.337.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>A scalar measurement of metaphoricity allows the threshold for metaphor in metaphor identifi- cation tasks to be fitted for specific purposes and datasets. The scalar system was evaluated on the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Steen, et al., 2010</ref>) which consists of 200,000 words from the British National Corpus divided into four gen- res (academic, news, fiction, and spoken; per- formance on the spoken genre was not evaluated for this task because it consists of many short fragmentary utterances) and manually annotated for metaphor by five raters. Previous evaluations using this corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dunn, 2013b</ref>) concluded that prepositions annotated as metaphoric in the cor- pus should not be considered metaphoric for com- putational purposes. Thus, metaphorically used prepositions have been untagged as metaphoric. Further, we have also untagged the ambiguously metaphoric sentences. Sentences with an insuffi- ciently robust conceptual representation were re- moved (e.g., fragments). The evaluation dataset thus consists of 6,893 sentences, distributed as shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>For the purposes of this evaluation, the thresh- <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Academic  759  1,550  2,309  Fiction  1,215  1,389  2,604  News  366  1,614  1,980  Total  2,340</ref> 4,553 6,893 <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Size of evaluation dataset in sentences.</p></div>

Thus, for the num- ber x of metaphors in the genre, the x sentences with the top metaphoricity values were identified as metaphoric. This illustrates the flexibility of such a scalar approach to metaphor identification. The baseline results are taken from a binary classi- fication evaluation of the corpus using the full set of 41 features produced by the system and eval- uated using the logistic regression algorithm with 100-fold cross-validation.  <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Evaluation results.</p><p>The binary classification system, with access to the full range of features, out-performs the scalar measurement in most cases. It is important to note, however, that the binary classification system re- quires labelled training data and is restricted to a single threshold of metaphoricity, in this case the threshold embedded in the corpus by the raters. The scalar system, however, was trained only on the experimental data and was not influenced by the evaluation corpus (except, of course, that it had access to the number of metaphoric sentences in the dataset, which is a parameter and not part of the model itself). Further, it can be applied to any English text without the need for labelled training data. Thus, the scalar approach performs competitively on a binary task (0.608 vs. 0.638 F-Measure) but can also produce scalar identifica- tions, which binary systems cannot produce.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3" validated="false"><head>Table 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Metaphoricity by ordering.
