			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a method for improving the dependency parsing of complex sentences. This method assumes segmentation of input sentences into clauses and does not require to retrain a parser of one&apos;s choice. We represent a sentence clause structure using clause charts that provide a layer of embedding for each clause in the sentence. Then we formulate a parsing strategy as a two-stage process where (i) coordinated and subordinated clauses of the sentence are parsed separately with respect to the sentence clause chart and (ii) their dependency trees become subtrees of the final tree of the sentence. The object language is Czech and the parser used is a maximum spanning tree parser trained on the Prague Dependency Treebank. We have achieved an average 0.97% improvement in the un-labeled attachment score. Although the method has been designed for the dependency parsing of Czech, it is useful for other parsing techniques and languages.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Syntactic parsing is an integral part of a complex text processing pipeline whose quality impacts the overall performance of the text processing system.</p><p>For illustration, we share our experience with a system focused on extracting semantic relations from unstructured texts. Namely, we have de- veloped the RExtractor system, 1 which processes texts by linguistically-aware tools and extracts en- tities and relations using queries over dependency trees. The language used for testing RExtrac- tor was Czech and the legal domain was chosen to be explored in detail ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kríž et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kríž and Hladká, 2015)</ref>. We evaluated RExtractor on the Czech Legal Text Treebank (CLTT) enriched with manually annotated entities and their rela- tions ( <ref type="bibr">Kríž et al., 2016)</ref>. Because of the lack of any Czech gold legal-domain treebank, we used a parser trained on newspaper texts to parse CLTT. The RExtractor system achieved precision of 80.6% and recall of 63.2% and we identified three sources of errors: (i) incorrect dependency tree (59.7%), (ii) missing or incorrectly formu- lated extraction query (38.3%), (iii) missing or in- correctly recognized entity (2.1%).</p><p>One can see that the errors are caused mainly by the insufficient quality of dependency parsing. The main reason why it happens is that newspa- per texts differ from legal texts in several language phenomena influenced by the high frequency of very long sentences in legal texts. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> pro- vides evidence of difficulty with dependency pars- ing long sentences -as the sentence length in- creases, the unlabeled attachment score decreases. The numbers are provided for two Czech depen- dency treebanks, namely the Prague Dependency Treebank with the development and evaluation test subsets 2 (PDT, dtest, etest, resp.) and the Czech Academic Corpus (CAC) 3 , see <ref type="bibr">Bejček et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hladká et al. (2008)</ref>, resp. This paper describes our method how to use information about a sentence clause structure in full-scale dependency parsing. Section 2 lists a number of previous approaches to improve depen- dency parsing including selected works on pars- ing Czech. The data and tools used in our experi- ments are summarized in Section 3. We represent sentence clause structures using clause charts de- fined and quantitatively studied in Section 4. In  Section 5, we propose an original strategy to parse pairs of coordinated and subordinated clauses and apply it on the data. Section 6 outlines our future plans towards better parsing long sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Several approaches which deal with the idea of di- viding the parsing process into several parts were presented. The idea of cascaded parsing exploits a cascade of specialized parsers instead of having one very complex general parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abney, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ciravegna and Lavelli, 1999</ref>). The identification of chunks, syntactically related non-overlapping groups of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000)</ref>, was used mainly in shallow parsing strate- gies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Federici et al., 1996)</ref>. Clausal parsing was designed to parse Hindi texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Husain et al., 2011</ref>). However, there is no work on exploiting chunks for full-scale parsing. A very interesting approach dividing the parsing process into several parts has been introduced in the XDG theory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Debusmann et al., 2005</ref>). Most recent approaches to depen- dency parsing focus almost exclusively on im- proving full-scale parsing algorithms using mostly neural networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pei et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Weiss et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Zhu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>We address the issue of parsing sentences that are already segmented into clauses. The ideas and concepts of segmentation of Czech sentences are presented by <ref type="bibr">Kuboň (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kuboň et al. (2007)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Lopatková and Holan (2009)</ref>. They present the concept of segments and show that it is possi- ble to draw the segmentation charts which reflect the mutual position of segments in complex sen- tences without applying syntactic parsing of the whole sentence first. The method is based on the identification of separators (segment boundaries) and their classification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lopatková et al. (2012)</ref> show how clauses form- ing complex sentences can be identified based on the sentence segment annotation. In addition, they present the project aiming at building a collection of Czech sentences enriched with manually anno- tated clauses and their relationships. <ref type="bibr">Krůza and Kuboň (2014)</ref> use this collection to develop an automatic procedure for recognizing clauses and their mutual relationship. Another automatic pro- cedure for clause identification over dependency trees is introduced by <ref type="bibr">Bejček et al. (2013)</ref> achieved F-measure 97.51% and was used for the clause an- notation of the Prague Dependency Treebank.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data and Tools</head><p>We experimented with two manually annotated dependency treebanks, namely the Prague Depen- dency Treebank 3.0 (PDT 3.0) and the Czech Aca- demic Corpus 2.0 (CAC 2.0). Both corpora are enriched with the clause annotation done automat- ically using the procedure presented by <ref type="bibr">Bejček et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Our goal is to beat the MST dependency parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">McDonald et al., 2005</ref>) trained on the PDT 3.0 train set. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Part of the treebank (Split), the number of sentences (Sent.), the number of tokens (Tokens) and the unlabeled attachment score (UAS) of MST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Clause Charts</head><p>A clause chart is defined to visualize relationships between clauses within the sentence and captures the layer of embedding of each individual clause. It is an m × n table where n is the number of clauses in the sentence and m is the number of layers. A cell (i, j) stands for relationship between the j-th clause and the i-th layer of embedding. Its value is initialized to the value of 0 corresponding to no relationship. We defined four rules for changing the cell value from 0 to 1, i.e., for assigning a layer of embedding to each clause in the sentence: (1) All main clauses belong to the basic layer 0. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> The clauses that depend on the clauses at the k-th layer belong to the (k + 1)-th layer. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> The coordinated clauses and the clauses in apposition belong to the same layer. <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> The clauses in parentheses belong to the (k +1)-th layer with respect to the k-th layer of their adjacent clauses.</p><p>Our definition is analogous to a segmentation chart defined by <ref type="bibr">Lopatková and Holan (2009)</ref>. However, we handle the following situations dif- ferently: (1) subordinating conjunctions at the be- ginning of each clause are considered as bound- aries and are excluded from the clause; (2) clauses split into two parts by an embedded subordinated clause are considered as two different clauses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Generating Clause Charts</head><p>We designed a simple procedure that generates a clause chart from a dependency tree with the clause annotation. Particularly, it generates a clause tree first and then a clause chart.</p><p>We assume a dependency tree where each non- boundary node has a special attribute bearing the identification of the clause it belongs to. The nodes with the same clause number belong to the same clause and thus generating a clause chart is uniquely determined by the clause identification. A layer of embedding of the clause is defined as its depth in a sentence clause tree where its nodes contain tokens with the same clause identification. While failure is usually an orphan, the success tends to have many fathers, claiming eagerly that particularly they were present at its conception.</p><p>This sentence consists of four clauses delimited by the boundaries printed in bold, namely while, that, and two commas. In general, clause bound- aries are either a single token or a sequence of tokens. Clause boundaries are not components of the clause tree. They are displayed there for failure is usually an orphan the success tends to have many fathers claiming eagerly particularly they were present at its conception understanding a linear representation of a clause chart, see B1B0B1B2 where B stands for a clause boundary and the numbers are the layers of clause embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Exploring Clause Charts</head><p>We explored PDT 3.0 and CAC 2.0 to study dif- ferent types of clause charts. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> provides statistics for the five most frequent clause charts that occur in the treebanks. For example, 14.4% of the sentences in PDT 3.0 and CAC 2.0 con- tain a main clause and a subordinated clause de- scribed with the 0B1 pattern. Moreover, we mea- sure the MST parser performance on the sentences having the given clause charts. For example, MST achieved UAS of 92.9% on the 0B1B0 sentences in the PDT training data set. The texts in the treebanks come from newspa- pers. Thus there is no surprise that the most fre- quent sentences in the treebanks are simple one clause sentences (0). They present more than half of the data. The second most frequent sentence structure consists of one main clause and one sub- ordinated clause (0B1). It is quite surprising that the parser processes these sentences better than the one clause sentences. Even more, we observe de- crease in the parser performance on coordination of two main clauses (i.e., on the 0B0 sentence).</p><p>For curiosity's sake, the most complex sentence in the treebanks consists of 36 clauses and the 0B1B2B3B4B5B6 clause chart is a chart with the highest number of layers of embedding.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Methods and Experiments</head><p>We present a method for improving dependency parsing of long sentences. In particular, we formu- late an algorithm for parsing the two most frequent clause structures, namely coordinated clauses 0B0 and governing and dependent clauses 0B1. The other types of clause structures are processed as usual using full-scale parsing. The experiments exploit an existing dependency parser trained on complete sentences, namely the MST parser -see Section 3 for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Parsing Coordinated Clauses</head><p>Given the clause chart representation, we can recognize coordinated clauses in sentences in a straightforward way. Thus, we consider neighbor- ing coordinated clauses C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n on the same layer (n &gt; 1) and we propose the following parsing strategy that we call clause chart parsing (CCP):</p><p>1. Using MST parse C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n individu- ally to get dependency trees T 1 , T 2 , . . . , T n with the r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n root nodes, respec- tively.</p><p>2. Create a sequence S = r 1 B 1,2 r 2 B 2,3 . . . r n where B i,i+1 is a boundary between C i and C i+1 .</p><p>3. Using MST parse the sequence S to get a de- pendency tree T S .</p><p>4. Build a final dependency tree so that the trees T 1 , . . . , T n become subtree of T S .</p><p>For illustration, we assume the sentence John loves Mary and Linda hates Peter. The sentence consists of two coordinated clauses C 1 = {John loves Mary}, C 2 = {Linda hates Peter} and one clause boundary B 1,2 = {and}. Therefore, the clause chart of the sentence is 0B0. In Step 1, C 1 and C 2 are parsed to get T 1 and T 2 with the root nodes r 1 = loves and r 2 = hates, resp. In Step 2, the sequence S = loves and hates is created. In</p><p>Step 3, S is parsed to get T S and, finally, in Step 4, T 1 and T 2 become subtrees of T S .</p><p>We evaluated the proposed parsing strategy only on the sentences having the 0B0 clause chart, i.e., on the subsets of the treebank datasets. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> presents the unlabeled attachment score achieved for</p><p>• full-scale parsing, i.e., parsing complete sen- tences using MST (FS)</p><p>• parsing individual clauses instead of parsing complete sentences, i.e., MST performance is measured on individual clauses (Clauses)</p><p>• full-scale parsing using the CCP strategy</p><p>We observe that parsing performance measured on complete sentences is the highest when pars- ing individual clauses. Using the CCP method we achieved an average 1.36% improvement in UAS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Parsing governing and dependent clauses</head><p>We observe almost no improvement when pars- ing individual clauses.

Given this observation, we proposed the follow- ing strategy for parsing subordinated clauses and we updated the CCP method as follows:</p><p>1. Find the longest sequence of neighboring subordinated clauses C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n so that layer(C i+1 ) = layer(C i ) + 1 where layer stands for a layer of embedding in a clause chart.</p><p>2. Create a sequence S = C 1 B 1,2 C 2 B 2,3 . . . C n where B i,i+1 is a boundary between C i and C i+1 .</p><p>3. Using MST parse sequence S to get a depen- dency tree T S .</p><p>Using the CCP strategy for parsing the 0B0 and 0B1 sentences, we can parse the 0B1B0 sen- tences so that we apply the CCP strategy for sub- ordinated clauses first and subsequently for coor- dinated clauses.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>: Parsing evaluation on the 0B1B0 sen- tences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">CCP as Full-scale Parsing</head><p>We have learned from the experiments that 1. it is efficient to parse coordinated clauses individually and connect their trees subse- quently;</p><p>2. it is effective to parse a sequence of govern- ing and dependent clauses at once.</p><p>Therefore we proposed and evaluated a final al- gorithm for dependency parsing that exploits sen- tence clause charts and a given dependency parser. The algorithm works in iterations. In each itera- tion, at least one layer of embedding in the clause chart is eliminated using the CCP strategy for 0B0 and 0B1 clauses. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6 and Table 7</ref> present the final comparison of full-scale parsing and the CCP strategy. The figures in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref> exclude simple sentences (one- clause sentences) from evaluation. We achieved an average 0.97% improvement in UAS when parsing all the sentences in the treebanks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Future Work</head><p>Our motivation to address the task of parsing of long sentences arises from a project of extracting entities and relations from legal texts. We plan to apply the CCP strategy on the Czech Legal Text Treebank that contains significantly large number of long sentences than PDT 3.0. Consequently, we will do an eccentric evaluation of the RExtractor system to see whether better parsing results influ- ence the extraction. A sentence clause structure used in our exper- iments was generated automatically. However, the used procedure requires gold standard depen- dency trees on the input. We plan to develop an automatic procedure for obtaining the clause charts. This procedure will not require gold stan- dard dependency trees on the input. Some ex- periments have been already done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Krůza and Kuboň (2009)</ref>. In addition, we see several differ-ent approaches which could be implemented and evaluated.</p><p>In the presented experiments, we used the parser trained on complete sentences. However, the CCP strategy parses individual clauses in some situations. We believe that training a new model especially for clauses will bring a significant im- provement. Another model could be trained for parsing sequences defined in Step 3 of proposed algorithm from Section 5.1.</p><p>Our parsing strategy is formulated to be lan- guage independent. The English part of the Czech-English Prague Dependency Treebank con- tains the entire Penn Treebank that is enhanced with segmentation of sentences into clauses. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We plan to apply the CCP strategy on this dataset.</p></div>
