			<abstract>
				<p>We describe the design, development, and API of ODIN (Open Domain INformer), a domain-independent, rule-based event extraction (EE) framework. The proposed EE approach is: simple (most events are captured with simple lexico-syntactic patterns), powerful (the language can capture complex constructs, such as events taking other events as arguments, and regular expressions over syntactic graphs), robust (to recover from syntactic parsing errors , syntactic patterns can be freely mixed with surface, token-based patterns), and fast (the runtime environment processes 110 sen-tences/second in a real-world domain with a grammar of over 200 rules). We used this framework to develop a grammar for the biochemical domain, which approached human performance. Our EE framework is accompanied by a web-based user interface for the rapid development of event grammars and vi-sualization of matches. The ODIN framework and the domain-specific grammars are available as open-source code.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Rule-based information extraction (IE) has long en- joyed wide adoption throughout industry, though it has remained largely ignored in academia, in favor of ma- chine learning (ML) methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chiticariu et al., 2013</ref>). However, rule-based systems have several advantages over pure ML systems, including: (a) the rules are interpretable and thus suitable for rapid development and domain transfer; and (b) humans and machines can contribute to the same model. Why then have such sys- tems failed to hold the attention of the academic com- munity? One argument raised by <ref type="bibr">Chiticariu et al.</ref> is that, despite notable efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Appelt and Onyshkevych, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Levy and Andrew, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hunter et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cunningham et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chang and Manning, 2014</ref>), there is not a standard language for this task, or a "stan- dard way to express rules", which raises the entry cost for new rule-based systems.</p><p>Here we aim to address this issue with a novel event extraction (EE) language and framework called ODIN (Open Domain INformer). We follow the simplicity principles promoted by other natural language process- ing toolkits, such as Stanford's CoreNLP, which aim to "avoid over-design", "do one thing well", and have a user "up and running in ten minutes or less" ). In particular, our approach is:</p><p>Simple: Taking advantage of a syntactic dependency 1 representation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">de Marneffe and Manning, 2008)</ref>, our EE language has a simple, declarative syntax (see Ex- amples 1 &amp; 2) for n-ary events, which captures single or multi-word event predicates (trigger) with lexi- cal and morphological constraints, and event arguments (e.g., theme) with (generally) simple syntactic patterns and semantic constraints.</p><p>Powerful: Despite its simplicity, our EE framework can capture complex constructs when necessary, such as: (a) recursive events 2 , (b) complex regular expres- sions over syntactic patterns for event arguments. In- spired by Stanford's Semgrex 3 , we have extended a standard regular expression language to describe pat- terns over directed graphs 4 , e.g., we introduce new &lt; and &gt; operators to specify the direction of edge traver- sal in the dependency graph. Finally, we allow for (c) optional arguments <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and multiple arguments with the same name.</p><p>Robust: To recover from unavoidable syntactic errors, SD patterns (such as the ones in Examples 1 and 2) can be can be freely mixed with surface, token-based patterns, using a language inspired by the Allen Insti- 1 Hereafter abbreviated as SD. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Events that take other events as arguments (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and the corresponding Example (2) for such an event in the biochemical domain. The Positive Regulation takes a Phosphorylation event as the Controlled argu- ment) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> nlp.stanford.edu/software/tregex. shtml <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Here we use syntactic dependencies. 5 cause in Example 1. tute of Artificial Intelligence's Tagger <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . These patterns match against information extracted in our text process- ing pipeline <ref type="bibr">7</ref> , namely a token's part of speech, lem- matized form, named entity label, and the immediate incoming and outgoing edges in the SD graph. Exam- ple 3 shows an equivalent rule to the one in Example 1 using surface patterns (i.e. a pattern that is independent of a token sequence's underlying syntactic structure).</p><p>Fast: Our EE runtime is fast because our rules use event trigger phrases, captured with shallow lexico- morphological patterns, as starting points. Only when event triggers are detected is the matching of more complex syntactic patterns for arguments attempted. This guarantees quick executions. For example, in the biochemical domain (discussed in Section 2), our framework processes an average of 110 sentences/sec- ond 8 with a grammar of 211 rules on a laptop with an i7 CPU and 16GB of RAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Building a Domain from Scratch</head><p>We next describe how to use the proposed framework to build an event extractor for the biochemical domain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ohta et al., 2013</ref>) from scratch.</p><p>Rule-based systems have been shown to perform at the state-of-the-art for event extraction in the biology domain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Peng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bui et al., 2013)</ref>. The do- main, however, is not without its challenges. For exam- ple, it is not uncommon for biochemical events to con- tain other events as arguments. Consider the example sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The sentence contains two events, one event referring to the biochemical process known as phosphorylation, and a recursive event describing a biochemical regulation that controls the mentioned phosphorylation. We will introduce a minimal set of rules that capture these two events. Here, we will as- sume the simple entities (denoted in bold in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) have already been detected through a named entity rec- ognizer. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> When a rule matches, the extracted token spans for trigger and arguments, together with the corre- sponding event and argument labels (here the event <ref type="bibr">6</ref> https://github.com/allenai/taggers 7 https://github.com/sistanlp/ processors 8 after the initial text processing pipeline <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Though the discussion focuses on event extraction, our framework can also be applied to the task of entity recogni- tion. Example 1: An example of a rule using syntactic structure. For the phosphorylation event, our selected event trigger (LINE 5) is a nominal predicate with the lemma phosphorylation. This trigger serves as the starting point for the syntactic patterns that extract event arguments.</p><p>When searching for a theme to the Phosphorylation event, we begin at the specified trigger and look for an incoming dependent that is the object of the preposition of.</p><p>The pattern fragment (nn|conj and|cc) * targets entities that appear as modifiers in noun phrases (e.g., . . . of the cyclin-D1 protein), or a series of arguments in a coordinated phrase. The entity mention associated with our theme must be a named entity with the label PhysicalEntity (LINE 7), a hypernym of several more specialized types identified in an earlier iteration. The cause argument is marked as optional (denoted by the ? symbol). label is Phosphorylation, and the argument labels are theme &amp; cause) are dispatched to a labeling action. By default, these actions simply create an EventMention Scala object with the corresponding event label, and the extracted named arguments. Exam- ple 5 summarizes the EventMention class. Custom actions may be defined as Scala code, and be attached to specific rules. For example, a custom action may trigger coreference resolution when a rule matches a common noun, e.g., the protein, instead of the expected named entity.</p><p>The second rule, shown in Example 2, captures the recursive event in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Importantly, this rule takes other events as arguments, e.g., the controlled ar- gument must be an event mention, here generated by the rule in Example 1. To guarantee correct execution, the runtime repeatedly applies the given EE grammar on each sentence until no rule matches. For example, here the rule in Example 2 would not match in the first 128 1 -name: Positive_regulation_1  Example 3: An alternative rule to Example 1 that uses a surface pattern. Surface patterns match event triggers and arguments over sequences of tokens and other mentions (e.g., the theme matches over an entire named entity of type PhysicalEntity).</p><p>Event triggers (trigger) match the whole sequence of tokens encompassed in parentheses. Argument names preceded by the @ symbol, e.g., @theme, require the specification of an event type (denoted by :type). This pattern is shorthand for matching the span of an entire named entity with the specified type. iteration because no event mentions have been created yet, but would match in the second iteration. This pro- cess can optionally be optimized with rule priorities (as shown in the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>. For example, the priorities assigned to Examples 1 and 2 enforce that the second rule is executed only in an iteration following the first rule. Utilizing rule priorities allows for a derivational construction of complex events or complete grammars from their components.</p><p>Once the grammar has been defined, the entire sys- tem can be run in less than 10 lines of code, as shown in Example 4. The output of this code is a collection of event mentions, i.e., instances of the EventMention class outlined in Example 5.</p></div>

The web inter- face is implemented as a client-server Grails 10 web ap- plication which runs the EE system on the server and displays the results on the client side. The applica- tion's client-side code displays both entity and event mentions, as well as the output of the text preprocessor (to help with debugging) using Brat ( <ref type="bibr">Stenetorp et al., 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>We extended the grammar introduced previously to capture 10 different biochemical events, with an av- erage of 11 rules per event type. Using this grammar we participated in a recent evaluation by DARPA's Big Mechanism program <ref type="bibr">11</ref> , where systems had to perform deep reading of two research papers on cancer biology. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes our results.</p><p>Our system was ranked above the median, with re- spect to overall F1 score. We find these results en- couraging for two reasons. First, inter-annotator agree- ment on the task was below 60%, which indicates that our system roughly approaches human performance, especially for precision. Second, the lower recall is partially explained by the fact that annotators marked also indirect biological relations (e.g., A activates B), which do not correspond to actual biochemical reac- tions but, instead, summarize sequences of biochemi- cal reactions. Our grammar currently recognizes only direct biochemical reactions.</p><p>System Precision Recall F1 Submitted run 54% 29% 37.3% Ceiling system 82.1% 81.8% 82% <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Results from the January 2015 DARPA Big Mechanism Dry Run evaluation on reading biomedical papers, against a known biochemical model. In addition to event extraction, this eval- uation required participants to identify if the ex- tracted information corroborates, contradicts, or ex- tends the given model. Here, extending the model means proposing a biochemical reaction that is not contained in the model, but it involves at least a bio- chemical entity from the model. The ceiling system indicates idealized performance of the rule-based framework, after a post-hoc analysis.</p><p>More importantly, this evaluation offers a good plat- form to analyze the potential of the proposed rule-based framework, by estimating the ceiling performance of our EE system, when all addressable issues are fixed. We performed this analysis after the evaluation dead- line, and we manually:</p><p>1. Removed the keys that do not encode direct bio- chemical reactions.</p><p>2. Corrected three rules, to better model one event and one entity type.</p><p>3. Fixed system bugs, including XML parsing errors, which caused some meta data to appear in text and be misinterpreted as biological entities, and a syn- tax error in one rule, which caused several false positives.</p><p>The results of this ceiling system are listed in the sec- ond row in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. This analysis highlights an encour- aging finding: the current rule framework is expressive: it can capture approximately 80% of the events in this complex domain. The remaining 20% require corefer- ence resolution and complex syntactic patterns, which were not correctly captured by the parser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Despite the dominant focus on machine learning mod- els for IE in the literature, previous work includes sev- eral notable rule-based efforts. For example, GATE <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cunningham et al., 2011)</ref>, and the Common Pat- tern Specification Language (Appelt and Onyshkevych, 1998) introduce a rule-based framework for IE, imple- mented as a cascade of grammars defined using surface patterns. The ICE system offers an active-learning sys- tem that learns named entity and binary relation pat- terns built on top of syntactic dependencies (He and Grishman, 2011). Stanford's Semgrex <ref type="bibr">12 and Tregex (Levy and Andrew, 2006</ref>) model syntactic patterns, while a separate tool from the same group, Token- sRegex ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chang and Manning, 2014</ref>), defines surface patterns over token sequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chiticariu et al. (2011)</ref> demonstrated that a rule-based NER system can match or outperform results achieved with machine learning approaches, but also showed that rule-writing is a la- bor intensive process even with a language specifically designed for the task.</p><p>In addition to the above domain-independent frame- works, multiple previous works focused on rule-based systems built around specific domains. For exam- ple, in bioinformatics, several dedicated rule-based sys- tems obtained state-of-the-art performance in the ex- traction of protein-protein interactions (PPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hunter et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang et al., 2004</ref>).</p><p>Our work complements and extends the above ef- forts with a relatively simple EE platform that: (a) hybridizes syntactic dependency patterns with surface patterns, (b) offers support for the extraction of recur- sive events; (c) is coupled with a fast runtime environ- ment; and (d) is easily customizable to new domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have described a domain-independent, rule-based event extraction framework and rapid development en- vironment that is simple, fast, powerful, and robust. It is our hope that this framework reduces the entry cost in the development of rule-based event extraction sys- tems.</p><p>We demonstrated how to build a biomedical domain from scratch, including rule examples and simple Scala code sufficient to run the domain grammar over free text. We recently extended this grammar to participate in the DARPA Big Mechanism evaluation, in which our system achieved an F1 of 37%. By modeling the under- lying syntactic representation of events, our grammar for this task used an average of only 11 rules per event; this indicates that the syntactic structures of events are largely generalizable to a small set of predicate frames and that domain grammars can be constructed with rel- atively low effort. Our post-hoc analysis demonstrated that the system's true ceiling is 82%. This important result demonstrates that the proposed event extraction framework is expressive enough to capture most com- plex events annotated by domain experts.</p><p>Finally, to improve the user experience by aiding in the construction of event grammars, our framework is accompanied by a web-based interface for testing rules and visualizing matched events.</p><p>This whole effort is available as open- source code at:</p><p>https://github.com/ sistanlp/processors.</p><p>See also: https: //github.com/sistanlp/processors/ wiki/ODIN-(Open-Domain-INformer), for ODIN documentation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example sentence containing a recursive event.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,128.69,62.81,340.15,89.07" type="bitmap" /></figure>
