			<abstract>
				<p>Previous works in computer science, as well as political and social science, have shown correlation in text between political ideologies and the moral foundations expressed within that text. Additional work has shown that policy frames, which are used by politicians to bias the public towards their stance on an issue, are also correlated with political ideology. Based on these associations, this work takes a first step towards modeling both the language and how politicians frame issues on Twitter, in order to predict the moral foundations that are used by politicians to express their stances on issues. The contributions of this work includes a dataset annotated for the moral foundations, annotation guidelines, and probabilistic graph-ical models which show the usefulness of jointly modeling abstract political slogans, as opposed to the unigrams of previous works, with policy frames for the prediction of the morality underlying political tweets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Social media microblogging platforms, specifi- cally Twitter, have become highly influential and relevant to current political events. Such plat- forms allow politicians to communicate with the public as events are unfolding and shape public discourse on various issues. Furthermore, politi- cians are able to express their stances on issues and by selectively using certain political slogans, reveal their underlying political ideologies and moral views on an issue. Previous works in po- litical and social science have shown a correlation between political ideology, stances on political is- sues, and the moral convictions used to justify these stances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graham et al., 2009)</ref>. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> presents a tweet, by a prominent member of the U.S. Congress, which expresses concern</p><p>We are permitting the incarceration and shooting of thousands of black and brown boys in their formative years. about the fate of young individuals (i.e., incarcer- ation, shooting), specifically for vulnerable mem- bers of minority groups. The Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Haidt and Joseph, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Haidt and Graham, 2007</ref>) provides a theoretical framework for explaining these nuanced distinctions. The the- ory suggests that there are five basic moral values which underlie human moral perspectives, emerg- ing from evolutionary, social, and cultural origins. These are referred to as the moral foundations (MF) and include Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, and Pu- rity/Degradation <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref> provides a more de- tailed explanation). The above example reflects the moral foundations that shape the author's per- spective on the issue: Harm and Cheating.</p><p>Traditionally, analyzing text based on the MFT has relied on the use of a lexical resource, the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Haidt and Graham, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graham et al., 2009</ref>). The MFD, similar to LIWC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pennebaker et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010)</ref>, associates a list of related words with each one of the moral foun- dations. Therefore, analyzing text equates to counting the number of occurrences of words in the text which also match the words in the MFD. Given the highly abstract and generalized nature of the moral foundations, this approach often falls short of dealing with the highly ambiguous text politicians use to express their perspectives on specific issues. The following tweet, by another prominent member of the U.S. Congress, reflects the author's use of both the Harm and Cheating moral foundations.</p><p>30k Americans die to gun violence. Still, I'm moving to North Carolina where it's safe to go to the bathroom. While the first foundation (Harm) can be di- rectly identified using a word match to the MFD (as shown in red), the second foundation requires first identifying the sarcastic expression referring to LGBTQ rights and then using extensive world knowledge to determine the appropriate moral foundation. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Relying on a match of safe to the MFD would indicate the Care MF is being used instead of the Cheating foundation.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to solve this chal- lenge by suggesting a data-driven approach to moral foundation identification in tweets. Pre- vious work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Garten et al., 2016</ref>) has looked at classification-based approaches over tweets specifically related to Hurricane Sandy, augment- ing the textual content with background knowl- edge using entity linking ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lin et al., 2017)</ref>. Dif- ferent from this and similar works, we look at the tweets of U.S. politicians over a long period of time, discussing a large number of events, and touching on several different political issues. Our approach is guided by the intuition that the ab- stract moral foundations will manifest differently in text, depending on the specific characteristics of the events discussed in the tweet. As a result, it is necessary to correctly model the relevant contex- tualizing information.</p><p>Specifically, we are interested in exploring how political ideology, language, and framing interact to represent morality on Twitter. We examine the interplay of political slogans (for example "repeal and replace" when referring to the Affordable Care Act), and policy framing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boydstun et al., 2014;</ref> as features for predicting the underlying moral values which are expressed in politicians' tweets. Additionally, we identify high-level themes characterizing the main point of the tweet, which allows the model to identify the author's perspective on specific is- sues and generalize over the specific wording used (for example, if the tweet mentions Religion or Political Maneuvering).</p><p>This information is incorporated into global probabilistic models using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), a graphical probabilistic modeling framework ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bach et al., 2013)</ref>. PSL specifies high level rules over a relational representation of these features, which are compiled into a graphi- cal model called a hinge-loss Markov random field that is used to make the final prediction. Our ex- periments show the importance of modeling con- textualizing information, leading to significant im- provements over dictionary driven approaches and purely lexical methods.</p><p>In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: (1) This work is among the first to explore jointly modeling language and polit- ical framing techniques for the classification of moral foundations used in the tweets of U.S. politicians on Twitter. (2) We provide a descrip- tion of our annotation guidelines and an annotated dataset of 2,050 tweets. 2 (3) We suggest compu- tational models which easily adapt to new policy issues, for the classification of the moral founda- tions present in tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Works</head><p>In this paper, we explore how political ideol- ogy, language, framing, and morality interact on Twitter.

The association between Twitter and framing in molding public opinion of events and issues ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burch et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Harlow and Johnson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Meraz and Papacharissi, 2013</ref>; Jang and Hart, 2015) has also been studied.</p><p>The connection between morality and politi- cal ideology has been explored in the fields of psychology and sociology ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graham et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Graham et al., , 2012</ref>. Moral foundations were also used to in- form downstream tasks, by using the MFD to identify the moral foundations in partisan news sources ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fulgoni et al., 2016)</ref>, or to construct fea- tures for other downstream tasks ( <ref type="bibr">Volkova et al., 2017)</ref>. Several recent works have looked into us- ing data-driven methods that go beyond the MFD to study tweets related to Hurricane Sandy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Garten et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lin et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Annotation</head><p>The Moral Foundations Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Haidt and Graham, 2007</ref>) was proposed by sociologists and psy- chologists as a way to understand how morality develops, as well as its similarities and differences across cultures. The theory consists of the five moral foundations shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The goal of this work is to classify the tweets of the Congres- sional Tweets Dataset ( ) with the moral foundation implied in the tweet.</p><p>We first attempted to use Amazon Mechanical Turk for annotation, but found that most Mechani- cal Turkers would choose the Care/Harm or Fair- ness/Cheating label a majority of the time. Ad- ditionally, annotators preferred choosing first the foundation branch (i.e., Care/Harm) and then its sentiment (positive or negative) as opposed to the choice of each foundation separately, i.e., given the choice between Harm or Care/Harm and Neg- ative, annotators preferred the latter. Based on these observations, two annotators, one liberal and one conservative (self-reported), manually anno- tated a subset of tweets. This subset had an inter-annotator agreement of 67.2% using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. The annotators then discussed and agreed on general guidelines which were used to label the remaining tweets of the dataset. The resulting dataset has an inter-annotator agreement of 79.2% using Cohen's Kappa statistic. The over- all distribution, distributions by political party, and distributions per issue of the labeled dataset are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> lists the frames that most frequently co-occured with each MF. As ex- pected, frames concerning Morality and Sympathy are highly correlated with the Purity foundation, while Subversion is highly correlated with the Le- gal and Political frames.</p><p>Labeling tweets presents several challenges. First, tweets are short and thus lack the context often necessary for choosing a moral viewpoint. Tweets are often ambiguous, e.g., a tweet may ex- press care for people who are being harmed by a policy. Another major challenge was overcoming the political bias of the annotator. For example, if a tweet discusses opposing Planned Parenthood because it provides abortion services, the liberal annotator typically viewed this as Harm (i.e., hurt- ing women by taking away services from them), while the conservative annotator tended to view this as Purity (i.e., all life is sacred and should be protected). To overcome this bias, annota- tors were given the political party of the politician who wrote the tweets and instructed to choose the moral foundation from the politician's perspec- tive. To further simplify the annotation process, all tweets belonging to one political party were la- beled together, i.e., all Republican tweets were la- beled and then all Democrat tweets were labeled. Finally, tweets present a compound problem, of- ten expressing two thoughts which can further be contradictory. This results in one tweet having multiple moral foundations. Annotators chose a primary moral foundation whenever possible, but were allowed a secondary foundation if the tweet presented two differing thoughts.</p><p>Several recurring themes continued to appear throughout the dataset including "thoughts and prayers" for victims of gun shooting events or rhetoric against the opposing political party. The annotators agreed to use the following moral foun- dation labels for these repeating topics as follows:</p><p>(1) The Purity label is used for tweets that relate to <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Morals  OVERALL  PARTY  ISSUE  REP DEM  ABO ACA GUN IMM LGBTQ TER  Care  524  156  368  37  123  215  33  34  113  Harm  355  151  204  26  64  141  19  34  101  Fairness  268  55  213  41  81  19  11  86  39  Cheating  82  37  45  14  27  11  10  9  13  Loyalty  303  63  240  28  29  128  36  38  58  Betrayal  53  25  28  10  4  9  6  3  22  Authority  192  62  130  24  44  50  38  10  34  Subversion  419  251  168  34  169  75  73  25  60  Purity  174  86  88  24  3  102  5  24  41  Degradation  66  34  32  5  0  31  0  4</ref>    prayers or the fight against ISIL/ISIS. (2) Loyalty is for tweets that discuss "stand(ing) with" others, American values, troops, or allies, or reference a demographic that the politician belongs to, e.g. if the politician tweeting is a woman and she dis- cusses an issue in terms of its effects on women. (3) At the time the dataset was collected, the Pres- ident was Barack Obama and the Republican party controlled Congress. Therefore, any tweets specif- ically attacking Obama or Republicans (the con- trolling party) were labeled as Subversion. <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> Tweets discussing health or welfare were labeled as Care. <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> Tweets which discussed limiting or restricting laws or rights were labeled as Cheating.</p><p>(6) Sarcastic attacks, typically against the oppos- ing political party, were labeled as Degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Feature Extraction for PSL Models</head><p>For this work, we designed extraction models and PSL models that were capable of adapting to the dynamic language used on Twitter and predicting the moral foundation of a given tweet. Our ap- proach uses weakly supervised extraction models, whose only initial supervision is a set of unigrams and the political party of the tweet's author, to extract features for each PSL model. These fea- tures are represented as PSL predicates and com- bined into the probabilistic rules of each model, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, which successively build upon the rules of the previous model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Global Modeling Using PSL</head><p>PSL is a declarative modeling language which can be used to specify weighted, first-order logic rules that are compiled into a hinge-loss Markov ran- dom field. This field defines a probability distri- bution over possible continuous value assignments to the random variables of the model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bach et al., 2015)</ref> and is represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (Y | X) = 1 Z exp − M r=1 λ r φ r (Y , X)</formula><p>where Z is a normalization constant, λ is the weight vector, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">φ r (Y, X) = (max{l r (Y, X), 0}) ρr</formula><p>is the hinge-loss potential specified by a linear function l r . The exponent ρ r ∈ 1, 2 is optional. Each potential represents the instantiation of a rule, which takes the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">λ 1 : P 1 (x) ∧ P 2 (x, y) → P 3 (y) λ 2 : P 1 (x) ∧ P 4 (x, y) → ¬P 3 (y)</formula><p>P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , and P 4 are predicates (e.g., party, is- sue, and frame) and x, y are variables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Feature Extraction Models</head><p>For each aspect of the tweets that composes the PSL models, scripts are written to first identify and then extract the correct information from the tweets. Once extracted, this information is format- ted into PSL predicate notation and input to the PSL models. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> presents the information that composes each PSL model, as well as an example of how rules in the PSL model are constructed.</p><p>Language: Works studying the Moral Founda- tions Theory typically assign a foundation to a body of text based on a majority match of the words in the text to the Moral Foundations Dic- tionary (MFD), a predefined list of unigrams asso- ciated with each foundation. These unigrams cap- ture the conceptual idea behind each foundation. Annotators noted, however, that when choosing a foundation they typically used a small phrase or the entire tweet, not a single unigram. Based on this, we compiled all of the annotators' phrases per foundation into a unique set to create a new list of unigrams for each foundation. These un- igrams are referred to as "Annotator's Rationale (AR)" throughout the remainder of this paper. The PSL predicate UNIGRAM M (T, U) is used to input any unigram U from tweet T that matches the M list of unigrams (either from the MFD or AR lists) into the PSL models. An example of a rule using this predicate is shown in the first row of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. During annotation, we observed that often a tweet has only one match to a unigram, if any, and therefore a majority count approach may fail. Fur- ther, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, many tweets have one unigram that matches one foundation and another unigram that matches a different foundation. In such cases, the correct foundation cannot be de- termined from unigram counts alone. Based on these observations and the annotators' preference for using phrases, we incorporate the most fre- quent bigrams and trigrams for each political party (BIGRAM P (T, B) and TRIGRAM P (T, TG)) and for each party on each issue (BIGRAM P I (T, B) and TRIGRAM P I (T, TG)). These top 20 bigrams and trigrams contribute to a more accurate predic- tion than unigrams alone ).</p><p>Ideological Information: Previous works have shown a strong correlation between ideology and the moral foundations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Haidt and Graham, 2007)</ref>, as well as between ideology and policy is- sues ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boydstun et al., 2014</ref>). Annotators were able to agree on labels when instructed to label from the ideological point of view of the tweet's author, even if it opposed their own views. Based on these positive correlations, we incorporate both the issue of the tweet (ISSUE(T, I)) and the political party of the author of the tweet (PARTY(T, P)) into the PSL models. Examples of how this information is represented in the PSL models are shown in rows two and three of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>Abstract Phrases: As described previously, annotators reported that phrases were more use- ful than unigrams in determining the moral foun- dation of the tweet. Due to the dynamic nature of language and trending issues on Twitter, it is impracticable to construct a list of all possible phrases one can expect to appear in tweets. How- ever, because politicians are known for sticking to certain talking points, these phrases can be ab- stracted into higher-level phrases that are more stable and thus easier to identify and extract.</p><p>For example, a tweet discussing "President Obama's signing a bill" has two possible concrete phrases: President Obama's signing and signing a bill. Each phrase falls under two possible abstrac- tions: political maneuvering (Obama's actions) and mentions legislation (signing of a bill). In this paper we use the following high-level abstrac- tions: legislation or voting, rights and equality, emotion, sources of danger or harm, positive benefits or effects, solidarity, politi- cal maneuvering, protection and prevention, American values or traditions, religion, and promo- tion. For example, if a tweet mentions "civil rights" or "equal pay", then these phrases indicate that the rights and equality abstraction is being used to express morality. Some of these abstractions correlate with the corresponding MF or frame, e.g., the religion abstraction is highly correlated with the Purity foundation and political maneuvering is correlated with the Political Factors &amp; Implications Frame.</p><p>To match phrases in tweets to these abstrac- tions, we use the embedding-based model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. (2017)</ref>. This phrase similarity model was trained on the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) (Gan- itkevitch et al., 2013) and incorporates a Convo- lutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture sen- tence structures. This model generates the em- beddings of our abstract phrases and computes the cosine similarities between phrases and tweets as the scores. The input tweets and phrases are rep- resented as the average word embeddings in the input layer, which are then projected into a con- volutional layer, a max-pooling layer, and finally two fully-connected layers. The embeddings are thus represented in the final layer. The learning objective of this model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">min Wc,Ww &lt;x 1 ,x 2 &gt;∈X max(0, δ − cos(g(x 1 ), g(x 2 )) + cos(g(x 1 ), g(t 1 ))) +max(0, δ − cos(g(x 1 ), g(x 2 ))) + cos(g(x 2 ), g(t 2 )) +λ c ||W c || 2 + λ w ||W init − W w || 2 ,</formula><p>where X is all the positive input pairs, δ is the margin, g(·) represents the network, λ c and λ w are the weights for L2-regularization, W c is the network parameters, W w is the word embeddings, W init is the initial word embeddings, and t 1 and t 2 are negative examples that are randomly selected.</p><p>All tweet-phrase pairs with a cosine similarity over a given threshold are used as input to the PSL model via the predicate PHRASE(T, PH), which indicates that tweet T contains a phrase that is similar to an abstracted phrase (PH). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Rows four, eight, and twelve of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> show examples of the phrase rules as used in our modeling procedure.</p><p>Nuanced Framing: Framing is a political strategy in which politicians carefully word their statements in order to bias public opinion towards their stance on an issue. This technique is a fine- grained view of how issues are expressed. Frames are associated with issue, political party, and ide- ologies. For example, if a politician emphasizes the economic burden a new bill would place on the public, then they are using the Economic frame. Different from this, if they emphasize how peo- ple's lives will improve because of this bill, then they are using the Quality of Life frame.</p><p>In this work, we explore frames in two settings: (1) where the actual frames of tweets are known and used to predict the moral foundation of the tweets and (2) when the frames are unknown and predicted jointly with the moral foundations. Us- ing the Congressional Tweets Dataset as the true labels for 17 policy frames, this information is in- put to the PSL models using the FRAME(T, F) predicate as shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Conversely, the same predicate can be used as a joint prediction target predicate, with no initialization, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Results</head><p>In this section, we present an analysis of the re- sults of our modeling approach. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> summa- rizes our overall results and compares the tradi- tional BoW SVM classifier 4 to several variations of our model. We provide an in-depth analysis, broken down by the different types of moral foun- dations, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Tables 7 and 8</ref>.</p><p>We also study the relationship between moral foundations, policy framing, and political ideol- ogy.  Evaluation Metrics: Since each tweet can have more than one moral foundation, our prediction task is a multilabel classification task. The preci- sion of a multilabel model is the ratio of how many predicted labels are correct:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P recision = 1 T T t=1 |Y t ∩ h(x t )| |h(x t )|<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The recall of this model is the ratio of how many of the actual labels were predicted:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Recall = 1 T T t=1 |Y t ∩ h(x t )| |Y t |<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In both formulas, T is the number of tweets, Y t is the true label for tweet t, x t is a tweet example, and h(x t ) are the predicted labels for that tweet. The F 1 score is computed as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. Additionally, the last lines of <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Tables 7 and 8</ref> provide the macro-weighted aver- age F 1 score over all moral foundations.</p><p>Analysis of Supervised Experiments: We con- ducted supervised experiments using five-fold cross validation with randomly chosen splits. Ta- ble 6 shows an overview of the average results of our supervised experiments for five of the PSL models. The first column lists the SVM or PSL model. The second column presents the results of a given model when using the MFD as the source of the unigrams for the initial model (M1). The final column shows the results when the AR uni- grams are used as the initial source of supervision. The first two rows show the results of predicting the morals present in tweets using a bag-of-words (BoW) approach. Both the SVM and PSL models perform poorly due to the eleven predictive classes and noisy input features. The third row shows the results when taking a majority vote over the pres- ence of MFD unigrams, similar to previous works. This approach is simpler and less noisy than M1, the PSL model closest to this approach. The last five lines of this table also show the overall trends of the full results shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Tables 7  and 8</ref>. As can be seen in all three tables, as we add more information with each PSL model, the overall results continue to improve, with the final model (M13) achieving the highest F 1 score for both sources of unigrams.</p><p>An interesting trend to note is that the AR un- igrams based models result in better average per- formance for most of the models until M9. Mod- els M9 and above incorporate the most power- ful features: bigrams and trigrams with phrases and frames. This suggests that the AR unigrams, designed specifically for the political Twitter do- main, are more useful than the MFD unigrams, when only unigrams are available. Conversely, the MFD unigrams are designed to conceptu- ally capture morality, and therefore have weaker performance in the unigram-based models, but achieve higher performance when combined with the more powerful features of the higher models. For all models, incorporating phrases and frames results in a more accurate prediction than when us- ing unigrams alone.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">.

These tasks are highly related as shown by the large increase in score between the baseline and skyline measurements in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 9</ref> once frames are incorporated into the models. Both moral foundations and frame classification are challenging multilabel classification tasks, the former using 11 possible foundations and the lat- ter consisting of 17 possible frames. Furthermore, joint learning problems are harder to learn due to a larger numbers of parameters, which in turn also affects learning and inference. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 9</ref> shows the macro-weighted average F 1 scores for three different models. The BASELINE model shows the results of predicting only the MORAL of the tweet using the non-joint model M13, which uses all features with frames initial- ized. The JOINT model is designed to predict both the moral foundation and frame of a tweet simulta- neously (as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>), with no frame ini- tialization. Finally, the SKYLINE model is M13 with all features, where the frames are initialized with their known values.</p><p>The joint model using AR unigrams outper- forms the baseline, showing that there is some benefit to modeling moral foundations and frames together, as well as using domain-specific uni- grams. However, it is unable to beat the MFD- based unigrams model. This is likely due to the large amount of noise introduced by incorrect frame predictions into the joint model. As ex- pected, the joint model does not outperform the skyline model which is able to use the known val- ues of the frames in order to accurately classify the moral foundations associated with the tweets.</p><p>Finally, the predictions for the frames in the joint model were quite low, going from an average F 1 score of 26.09 in M1 to an average F 1 score of 27.99 in M13. This likely has two causes: (1) frame prediction is a challenging 17-label classifi- cation task, with a random baseline of 6% (which our approach is able to exceed) and (2) the lower performance is because the frames are predicted with no initialization. In previous works, the frame prediction models are initialized with a set of unigrams expected to occur for each frame. Different from this approach, the only informa- tion our models provide to the frames are politi- cal party, issue, associated bigrams and trigrams, and the predicted values for the moral founda- tions from using this information. The F 1 score of 27.99 with such minimal initialization indicates that there is indeed a relationship between pol- icy frames and the moral foundations expressed in tweets worth exploring in future work.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Qualitative Results</head><p>Previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Makazhanov and Rafiei, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Preot¸iucPreot¸iuc-Pietro et al., 2017</ref>) have shown the use- fulness of moral foundations for the prediction of political party preference and the political ideolo- gies of Twitter users. The moral foundation in- formation used in these tasks is typically repre- sented as word-level features extracted from the MFD. Unfortunately, these dictionary-based fea- tures are often too noisy to contribute to highly accurate predictions.</p><p>Recall the example tweets shown in Figures 1 and 2. Both figures are examples of tweets that are mislabeled by the traditional MFD-based ap- proach, but correctly labeled using PSL Model M13. Using the MFD, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is labeled as Au- thority due to "permit", the only matching un- igram, while <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> is incorrectly labeled as Care, even though there is one matching unigram for Harm and one for Care. To further demon- strate this point we compare the dictionary fea- tures to features extracted from the MORAL pre- dictions of our PSL model. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref> shows the results of using the differ- ent feature sets for the prediction of political af- filiation of the author of a given tweet. All three models use moral information for prediction, but this information is represented differently in each of the models. The MFD model (line 1) uses the MFD unigrams to directly predict the politi- cal party of the author. The PSL model (line 2) uses the MF prediction made by the best perform- ing model (M13) as features. Finally, the GOLD model (line 3) uses the actual MF annotations.</p><p>The difference in performance between the GOLD and MFD results shows that directly map- ping the expected MFD unigrams to politicians' tweets is not informative enough for party affilia- tion prediction. However, by using abstract repre- sentations of language, the PSL model is able to achieve results closer to that which can be attained when using the actual annotations as features.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>Moral foundations and policy frames are em- ployed as political strategies by politicians to gar- ner support from the public. Politicians carefully word their statements to express their moral and social positions on issues, while maximizing their base's response to their message. In this paper we present PSL models for the classification of moral foundations expressed in political discourse on the microblog, Twitter. We show the benefits and drawbacks of traditionally used MFD unigrams and domain-specific unigrams for initialization of the models. We also provide an initial approach to the joint modeling of frames and moral foun- dations. In future works, we will exploit the in- teresting connections between moral foundations and frames for the analysis of more detailed ideo- logical leanings and stance prediction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example Tweet Highlighting Classification Difficulty.</figDesc></figure>
