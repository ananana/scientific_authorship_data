				<p>We present a novel technique for semantic frame identification using distributed representations of predicates and their syntactic context; this technique leverages automatic syntactic parses and a generic set of word embeddings. Given labeled data annotated with frame-semantic parses, we learn a model that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context around a predicate to a low dimensional representation. The latter is used for semantic frame identification; with a standard argument identification method inspired by prior work, we achieve state-of-the-art results on FrameNet-style frame-semantic analysis. Additionally, we report strong results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling in comparison to prior work.</p>

Most work on frame-semantic parsing has usually divided the task into two major subtasks: frame identification, namely the disambiguation of a given predicate to a frame, and argument iden- tification (or semantic role labeling), the analysis of words and phrases in the sentential context that satisfy the frame's semantic roles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Das et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Here, we focus on the first sub- task of frame identification for given predicates; we use our novel method ( ยง3) in conjunction with a standard argument identification model ( ยง4) to perform full frame-semantic parsing.</p><p>We present experiments on two tasks. First, we show that for frame identification on the FrameNet corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fillmore et al., 2003)</ref>, we outperform the prior state of the art ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al., 2014</ref>).

However, research has mostly focused on argument analysis, skipping the frame disambiguation step, and its interaction with argument identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Frame-Semantic Parsing</head><p>Closely related to SRL, frame-semantic parsing consists of the resolution of predicate sense into a frame, and the analysis of the frame's argu- ments. Work in this area exclusively uses the FrameNet full text annotations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Johansson and Nugues (2007)</ref> presented the best performing sys- tem at <ref type="bibr">SemEval 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker et al., 2007</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Das et al. (2010)</ref> improved performance, and later set the current state of the art on this task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al., 2014</ref>). We briefly discuss FrameNet, and subse- quently PropBank annotation conventions here.</p><p>FrameNet The FrameNet project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker et al., 1998</ref>) is a lexical database that contains informa- tion about words and phrases (represented as lem- mas conjoined with a coarse part-of-speech tag) termed as lexical units, with a set of semantic frames that they could evoke. For each frame, there is a list of associated frame elements (or roles, henceforth), that are also distinguished as core or non-core. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Sentences are annotated us- ing this universal frame inventory. For exam- ple, consider the pair of sentences in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a). COMMERCE BUY is a frame that can be evoked by morphological variants of the two example lexical units buy.V and sell.V. Buyer, Seller and Goods are some example roles for this frame.</p><p>PropBank The PropBank project <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Palmer et al., 2005</ref>) is another popular resource related to se- mantic role labeling. The PropBank corpus has verbs annotated with sense frames and their ar- guments. Like FrameNet, it also has a lexi- cal database that stores type information about verbs, in the form of sense frames and the possi- ble semantic roles each frame could take. There are modifier roles that are shared across verb frames, somewhat similar to the non-core roles in FrameNet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b) shows annotations for two verbs "bought" and "sold", with their lemmas (akin to the lexical units in FrameNet) and their verb frames buy.01 and sell.01. Generic core role labels (of which there are seven, namely A0-A5 and AA) for the verb frames are marked in the figure. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> A key difference between the two annotation sys- tems is that PropBank uses a local frame inven- tory, where frames are predicate-specific. More- over, role labels, although few in number, take spe- cific meaning for each verb frame. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> high- lights this difference: while both sell.V and buy.V are members of the same frame in FrameNet, they evoke different frames in PropBank. In spite of this difference, nearly identical statistical models could be employed for both frameworks.</p><p>Modeling In this paper, we model the frame- semantic parsing problem in two stages: frame identification and argument identification. As mentioned in ยง1, these correspond to a frame dis- ambiguation stage, 4 and a stage that finds the var- ious arguments that fulfill the frame's semantic roles within the sentence, respectively. This re- sembles the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al. (2014)</ref>, who solely focus on FrameNet corpora, unlike this pa- per. The novelty of this paper lies in the frame identification stage ( ยง3). Note that this two-stage approach is unusual for the PropBank corpora when compared to prior work, where the vast ma- jority of published papers have not focused on the verb frame disambiguation problem at all, only fo- cusing on the role labeling stage (see the overview paper of M` arquez et al. (2008) for example).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Distributed Frame Identification</head><p>We present a model that takes word embeddings as input and learns to identify semantic frames. A word embedding is a distributed representa- tion of meaning where each word is represented as a vector in R n . Such representations allow a model to share meaning between similar words, and have been used to capture semantic, syntac- tic and morphological content <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collobert and Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turian et al., 2010, inter alia)</ref>. We use word embeddings to represent the syntactic con- text of a particular predicate instance as a vector. For example, consider the sentence "He runs the company." The predicate runs has two syntac- tic dependents -a subject and direct object (but no prepositional phrases or clausal complements). We could represent the syntactic context of runs as a vector with blocks for all the possible dependents warranted by a syntactic parser; for example, we could assume that positions 0 . . . n in the vector correspond to the subject dependent, n+1 . . . 2n correspond to the clausal complement dependent, and so forth. Thus, the context is a vector in R nk with the embedding of He at the subject position, the embedding of company in direct object posi- tion and zeros everywhere else. Given input vec- tors of this form for our training data, we learn a matrix that maps this high dimensional and sparse representation into a lower dimensional space. Si- multaneously, the model learns an embedding for all the possible labels (i.e. the frames in a given lexicon). At inference time, the predicate-context is mapped to the low dimensional space, and we choose the nearest frame label as our classifica- tion. We next describe this model in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Frame Identification with Embeddings</head><p>We continue using the example sentence from ยง2.2: "He runs the company." where we want to disambiguate the frame of runs in context. First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in ยง2.2 to create an initial vector space representation. Subsequently, we learn a map- ping from this initial representation into a low- dimensional space; we also learn an embedding for each possible frame label in the same low- dimensional space. The goal of learning is to make sure that the correct frame label is as close as possible to the mapped context, while competing frame labels are farther away.</p><p>Formally, let x represent the actual sentence with a marked predicate, along with the associated syntactic parse tree; let our initial representation of the predicate context be g <ref type="bibr">(x)</ref>. Suppose that the word embeddings we start with are of dimension n. Then g is a function from a parsed sentence x to R nk , where k is the number of possible syn- tactic context types. For example g selects some important positions relative to the predicate, and reserves a block in its output space for the embed- ding of words found at that position. Suppose g considers clausal complements and direct objects. Then g : X โ R 2n and for the example sentence it has zeros in positions 0 . . . n and the embedding of the word company in positions n+1 . . . 2n.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g(x) = [0, . . . , 0, embedding of company].</formula><p>Section 3.1 describes the context positions we use in our experiments. Let the low dimensional space we map to be R m and the learned mapping be M : R nk โ R m . The mapping M is a linear trans- formation, and we learn it using the WSABIE algo- rithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Weston et al., 2011</ref>). WSABIE also learns an embedding for each frame label (y, henceforth). In our setting, this means that each frame corre- sponds to a point in R m . If we have F possi- ble frames we can store those parameters in an F ร m matrix, one m-dimensional point for each frame, which we will refer to as the linear map- ping Y . Let the lexical unit (the lemma conjoined with a coarse POS tag) for the marked predicate be . We denote the frames that associate with in the frame lexicon 5 and our training corpus as F . WSABIE performs gradient-based updates on an objective that tries to minimize the distance between M (g(x)) and the embedding of the cor- rect label Y (y), while maintaining a large distance between M (g(x)) and the other possible labels Y (ยฏ y) in the confusion set F . At disambiguation time, we use a simple dot product similarity as our distance metric, meaning that the model chooses a label by computing the argmax y s(x, y) where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s(x, y) = M (g(x)) ยท Y (y)</formula><p>, where the argmax iter- ates over the possible frames y โ F if was seen in the lexicon or the training data, or y โ F , if it was unseen. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Model learning is performed using the margin ranking loss function as described in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Context representation extraction for the embedding model. Given a dependency parse (1) the model extracts all words matching a set of paths from the frame evoking predicate and its direct de- pendents (2). The model computes a composed rep- resentation of the predicate instance by using dis- tributed vector representations for words (3) -the (red) vertical embedding vectors for each word are concatenated into a long vector. Finally, we learn a linear transformation function parametrized by the context blocks (4). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Weston et al. (2011)</ref>, and in more detail in section 3.2.</p><p>Since WSABIE learns a single mapping from g(x) to R m , parameters are shared between different words and different frames. So for example "He runs the company" could help the model disam- biguate "He owns the company." Moreover, since g(x) relies on word embeddings rather than word identities, information is shared between words. For example "He runs the company" could help us to learn about "She runs a corporation".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Context Representation Extraction</head><p>In principle g(x) could be any feature function, but we performed an initial investigation of two partic- ular variants. In both variants, our representation is a block vector where each block corresponds to a syntactic position relative to the predicate, and each block's values correspond to the embedding of the word at that position. Direct Dependents The first context function we considered corresponds to the examples in ยง3. To elaborate, the positions of interest are the labels of the direct dependents of the predicate, so k is the number of labels that the dependency parser can produce. For example, if the label on the edge be- tween runs and He is nsubj, we would put the em- bedding of He in the block corresponding to nsubj. If a label occurs multiple times, then the embed- dings of the words below this label are averaged.</p><p>Unfortunately, using only the direct dependents can miss a lot of useful information. For exam- ple, topicalization can place discriminating infor- mation farther from the predicate. Consider "He runs the company." vs. "It was the company that he runs." In the second sentence, the discrim- inating word, company dominates the predicate runs. Similarly, predicates in embedded clauses may have a distant agent which cannot be captured using direct dependents. Consider "The athlete ran the marathon." vs. "The athlete prepared him- self for three months to run the marathon." In the second example, for the predicate run, the agent The athlete is not a direct dependent, but is con- nected via a longer dependency path. Dependency Paths To capture more relevant context, we developed a second context function as follows. We scanned the training data for a given task (either the PropBank or the FrameNet domains) for the dependency paths that connected the gold predicates to the gold semantic argu- ments. This set of dependency paths were deemed as possible positions in the initial vector space rep- resentation. In addition, akin to the first context function, we also added all dependency labels to the context set. Thus for this context function, the block cardinality k was the sum of the number of scanned gold dependency path types and the num- ber of dependency labels. Given a predicate in its sentential context, we therefore extract only those context words that appear in positions warranted by the above set. See <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for an illustration of this process.</p><p>We performed initial experiments using con- text extracted from 1) direct dependents, 2) de- pendency paths, and 3) both. For all our experi- ments, setting 3) which concatenates the direct de- pendents and dependency path always dominated the other two, so we only report results for this setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Learning</head><p>We model our objective function following <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Weston et al. (2011)</ref>, using a weighted approximate- rank pairwise loss, learned with stochastic gradi- ent descent. The mapping from g(x) to the low dimensional space R m is a linear transformation, so the model parameters to be learnt are the matrix M โ R nkรm as well as the embedding of each possible frame label, represented as another ma- trix Y โ R F รm where there are F frames in total. The training objective function minimizes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x ยฏ y L rank y (x) max(0, ฮณ+s(x, y)โs(x, ยฏ y)).</formula><p>where x, y are the training inputs and their cor- responding correct frames, and ยฏ y are negative frames, ฮณ is the margin. Here, rank y (x) is the rank of the positive frame y relative to all the neg- ative frames:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">rank y (x) = ยฏ y I(s(x, y) โค ฮณ + s(x, ยฏ y)),</formula><p>and L(ฮท) converts the rank to a weight. Choos- ing L(ฮท) = Cฮท for any positive constant C opti- mizes the mean rank, whereas a weighting such as L(ฮท) = ฮท i=1 1/i (adopted here) optimizes the top of the ranked list, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Usunier et al., 2009</ref>). To train with such an objective, stochastic gradient is employed. For speed the computation of rank y (x) is then replaced with a sampled approximation: sample N items ยฏ y until a violation is found, i.e. max(0, ฮณ + s(x, ยฏ y) โ s(x, y))) &gt; 0 and then approximate the rank with (F โ 1)/N , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Weston et al. (2011)</ref> for more details on this procedure. For the choices of the stochastic gradient learning rate, margin (ฮณ) and dimensionality (m), please refer to ยง5.4- ยง5.5.</p><p>Note that an alternative approach could learn only the matrix M , and then use a k-nearest neigh- bor classifier in R m , as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Weinberger and Saul (2009)</ref>. The advantage of learning an embedding for the frame labels is that at inference time we need to consider only the set of labels for classi- fication rather than all training examples. Addi- tionally, since we use a frame lexicon that gives us the possible frames for a given predicate, we usually only consider a handful of candidate la- bels. If we used all training examples for a given predicate for finding a nearest-neighbor match at inference time, we would have to consider many more candidates, making the process very slow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Argument Identification</head><p>Here, we briefly describe the argument identifi- cation model used in our frame-semantic parsing experiments, post frame identification. Given x, the sentence with a marked predicate, the argu- ment identification model assumes that the pred- icate frame y has been disambiguated. From a frame lexicon, we look up the set of semantic roles R y that associate with y. This set also contains the null role r โ . From x, a rule-based candidate argu- ment extraction algorithm extracts a set of spans A that could potentially serve as the overt 7 argu- 7 By overtness, we mean the non-null instantiation of a semantic role in a frame-semantic parse.</p><p>โข starting word of a โข POS of the starting word of a โข ending word of a</p><p>โข POS of the ending word of a โข head word of a</p><p>โข POS of the head word of a โข bag of words in a</p><p>โข bag of POS tags in a โข a bias feature</p><p>โข voice of the predicate use โข word cluster of a's head โข word cluster of a's head conjoined with word cluster of the predicate *</p><note type="other">โข dependency path between a's head and the predicate โข the set of dependency labels of the predicate's children โข dependency path conjoined with the POS tag of a's head โข dependency path conjoined with the word cluster of a's head โข position of a with respect to the predicate (before, after, overlap or identical)</note><p>โข whether the subject of the predicate is missing (miss- ingsubj)</p><p>โข missingsubj, conjoined with the dependency path โข missingsubj, conjoined with the dependency path from the verb dominating the predicate to a's head <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Argument identification features.

We evaluate our novel frame identification approach in isolation and also con- joined with argument identification resulting in full frame-semantic structures; before presenting our model's performance we first focus on the datasets, baselines and the experimental setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data</head><p>We evaluate our models on both FrameNet-and PropBank-style structures.

This resembles the setup used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Punyakanok et al. (2008)</ref>. All the verb frame files in Ontonotes were used for creating our frame lexicon.</p></div>

The baselines use a log-linear model that models the following probability at training time:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p(y|x, ) = e ฯยทf (y,x,,) ยฏ yโF e ฯยทf (ยฏ y,x,,)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>At test time, this model chooses the best frame as argmax y ฯ ยท f (y, x, ) where argmax iterates over the possible frames y โ F if was seen in the lexicon or the training data, or y โ F , if it was un- seen, like the disambiguation scheme of ยง3. We train this model by maximizing L 2 regularized log-likelihood, using L-BFGS; the regularization constant was set to 0.1 in all experiments.</p><p>For comparison with our model from ยง3, which we call WSABIE EMBEDDING, we implemented two baselines with the log-linear model. Both the baselines use features very similar to the input rep- resentations described in ยง3.1. The first one com- putes the direct dependents and dependency paths as described in ยง3.1 but conjoins them with the word identity rather than a word embedding. Ad- ditionally, this model uses the un-conjoined words as backoff features. This would be a standard NLP approach for the frame identification problem, but is surprisingly competitive with the state of the art. We call this baseline LOG-LINEAR WORDS. The sec- ond baseline, tries to decouple the WSABIE training from the embedding input, and trains a log linear model using the embeddings. So the second base- line has the same input representation as WSABIE EMBEDDING but uses a log-linear model instead of WSABIE. We call this model LOG-LINEAR EMBED- DING.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Common Experimental Setup</head><p>We process our PropBank and FrameNet training, development and test corpora with a shift-reduce dependency parser that uses the Stanford conven- tions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">de Marneffe and Manning, 2013)</ref> and uses an arc-eager transition system with beam size of 8; the parser and its features are described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhang and Nivre (2011)</ref>. Before parsing the data, it is tagged with a POS tagger trained with a condi- tional random field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) with the following emission features: word, the word clus- ter, word suffixes of length 1, 2 and 3, capitaliza- tion, whether it has a hyphen, digit and punctua- tion. Beyond the bias transition feature, we have two cluster features for the left and right words in the transition. We use Brown clusters learned us- ing the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Uszkoreit and Brants (2008)</ref> on a large English newswire corpus for cluster fea- tures. We use the same word clusters for the argu- ment identification features in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>We learn the initial embedding representations for our frame identification model ( ยง3) using a deep neural language model similar to the one pro- posed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bengio et al. (2003)</ref>. We use 3 hidden layers each with 1024 neurons and learn a 128- dimensional embedding from a large corpus con- taining over 100 billion tokens. In order to speed up learning, we use an unnormalized output layer and a hinge-loss objective. The objective tries to ensure that the correct word scores higher than a random incorrect word, and we train with mini- batch stochastic gradient descent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Experimental Setup for FrameNet</head><p>Hyperparameters For our frame identification model with embeddings, we search for the WSA- BIE hyperparameters using the development data.   We search for the stochastic gradient learning rate in {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01}, the margin ฮณ โ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1} and the dimensionality of the final vector space m โ {256, 512}, to maximize the frame identification accuracy of ambiguous lexical units; by ambiguous, we imply lexical units that appear in the training data or the lexicon with more than one semantic frame. The underlined values are the chosen hyperparameters used to an- alyze the test data. Argument Candidates The candidate argument extraction method used for the FrameNet data, (as mentioned in ยง4) was adapted from the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xue and Palmer (2004)</ref> applied to dependency trees. Since the original algorithm was designed for verbs, we added a few extra rules to handle non-verbal predicates: we added 1) the predicate itself as a candidate argument, 2) the span ranging from the sentence position to the right of the pred- icate to the rightmost index of the subtree headed by the predicate's head; this helped capture cases like "a few months" (where few is the predicate and months is the argument), and 3) the span ranging from the leftmost index of the subtree headed by the predicate's head to the position immediately before the predicate, for cases like "your gift to Goodwill" (where to is the predicate and your gift is the argument). 10 10 Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al. (2014)</ref> describe the state of the art in FrameNet-based analysis, but their argument identifica- tion strategy considered all possible dependency subtrees in Frame Lexicon In our experimental setup, we scanned the XML files in the "frames" directory of the FrameNet 1.5 release, which lists all the frames, the corresponding roles and the associ- ated lexical units, and created a frame lexicon to be used in our frame and argument identification models. We noted that this renders every lexical unit as seen; in other words, at frame disambigua- tion time on our test set, for all instances, we only had to score the frames in F for a predicate with lexical unit (see ยง3 and ยง5.2). We call this setup FULL LEXICON. While comparing with prior state of the art on the same corpus, we noted that <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al. (2014)</ref> found several unseen predicates at test time. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> For fair comparison, we took the lexical units for the predicates that Das et al. considered as seen, and constructed a lexicon with only those; training instances, if any, for the unseen predicates under Das et al.'s setup were thrown out as well. We call this setup SEMAFOR LEXICON. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We also experimented on the set of unseen instances used by Das et al. ILP constraints For FrameNet, we used three ILP constraints during argument identification ( ยง4). 1) each span could have only one role, 2) each core role could be present only once, and 3) all overt arguments had to be non-overlapping. a parse, resulting in a much larger search space.   <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Full frame-structure prediction results for Propbank. This is a metric that takes into account frames and arguments together. See ยง5.7 for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Experimental Setup for PropBank</head><p>Hyperparameters As in ยง5.4, we made a hyper- parameter sweep in the same space. The chosen learning rate was 0.01, while the other values were ฮณ = 0.01 and m = 512. Ambiguous lexical units were used for this selection process. Argument Candidates For PropBank we use the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xue and Palmer (2004)</ref> applied to dependency trees. Frame Lexicon For the PropBank experiments we scanned the frame files for propositions in Ontonotes 4.0, and stored possible core roles for each verb frame. The lexical units were simply the verb associating with the verb frames. There were no unseen verbs at test time. ILP constraints We used the constraints of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Punyakanok et al. (2008)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> presents accuracy results on frame iden- tification. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We present results on all predicates, ambiguous predicates seen in the lexicon or the training data, and rare ambiguous predicates that appear โค 11 times in the training data. The WS- ABIE EMBEDDING model from ยง3 performs signif- icantly better than the LOG-LINEAR WORDS base- line, while LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING underperforms in every metric. For the SEMAFOR LEXICON setup, we also compare with the state of the art from Das <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We do not report partial frame accuracy that has been reported by prior work.  et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2014)</ref>, who used a semi-supervised learn- ing method to improve upon a supervised latent- variable log-linear model. For unseen predicates from the Das et al. system, we perform better as well. Finally, for the FULL LEXICON setting, the ab- solute accuracy numbers are even better for our best model. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> presents results on the full frame-semantic parsing task (measured by a reim- plementation of the SemEval 2007 shared task evaluation script) when our argument identifica- tion model ( ยง4) is used after frame identification. We notice similar trends as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, and our re- sults outperform the previously published best re- sults, setting a new state of the art. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows frame identification results on the PropBank data. On the development set, our best model performs with the highest accuracy on all and ambiguous predicates, but performs worse on rare ambiguous predicates. On the test set, the LOG-LINEAR WORDS baseline performs best by a very narrow margin. See ยง6 for a discussion. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> presents results where we measure pre- cision, recall and F 1 for frames and arguments to- gether; this strict metric penalizes arguments for mismatched frames, like in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. We see the same trend as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. Finally, <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> presents SRL results that measures argument performance only, irrespective of the frame; we use the eval- uation script from <ref type="bibr">CoNLL 2005 (Carreras and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">M` arquez, 2005</ref>). We note that with a better frame identification model, our performance on SRL im- proves in general. Here, too, the embedding model barely misses the performance of the best baseline, but we are at par and sometimes better than the sin- gle parser setting of a state-of-the-art SRL system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Punyakanok et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> For FrameNet, the WSABIE EMBEDDING model we propose strongly outperforms the baselines on all metrics, and sets a new state of the art. We be- lieve that the WSABIE EMBEDDING model performs better than the LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING baseline (that uses the same input representation) because the former setting allows examples with differ- ent labels and confusion sets to share informa- tion; this is due to the fact that all labels live in the same label space, and a single projection ma- trix is shared across the examples to map the input features to this space. Consequently, the WSABIE EMBEDDING model can share more information be- tween different examples in the training data than the LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING model. Since the LOG- LINEAR WORDS model always performs better than the LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING model, we conclude that the primary benefit does not come from the input embedding representation. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> On the PropBank data, we see that the LOG- LINEAR WORDS baseline has roughly the same per- formance as our model on most metrics: slightly better on the test data and slightly worse on the development data. This can be partially explained with the significantly larger training set size for PropBank, making features based on words more useful. Another important distinction between PropBank and FrameNet is that the latter shares frames between multiple lexical units. The ef- fect of this is clearly observable from the "Rare" column in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. WSABIE EMBEDDING performs poorly in this setting while LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING performs well. Part of the explanation has to do with the specifics of WSABIE training. Recall that the WSABIE EMBEDDING model needs to estimate the label location in R m for each frame. In other words, it must estimate 512 parameters based on at most 10 training examples. However, since the input representation is shared across all frames, every other training example from all the lexical units affects the optimal estimate, since they all modify the joint parameter matrix M . By contrast, in the log-linear models each label has its own set of parameters, and they interact only via the normalization constant. The LOG-LINEAR WORDS model does not have this entanglement, but cannot share information between words. For PropBank, combination of two syntactic parsers as input. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> One could imagine training a WSABIE model with word features, but we did not perform this experiment. these drawbacks and benefits balance out and we see similar performance for LOG-LINEAR WORDS and LOG-LINEAR EMBEDDING. For FrameNet, esti- mating the label embedding is not as much of a problem because even if a lexical unit is rare, the potential frames can be frequent. For example, we might have seen the SENDING frame many times, even though telex.V is a rare lexical unit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">FrameNet Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">PropBank Results</head><p>In comparison to prior work on FrameNet, even our baseline models outperform the previous state of the art. A particularly interesting comparison is between our LOG-LINEAR WORDS baseline and the supervised model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al. (2014)</ref>. They also use a log-linear model, but they incorporate a la- tent variable that uses WordNet <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref> to get lexical-semantic relationships and smooths over frames for ambiguous lexical units. It is possible that this reduces the model's power and causes it to over-generalize. Another difference is that when training the log-linear model, they nor- malize over all frames, while we normalize over the allowed frames for the current lexical unit. This would tend to encourage their model to ex- pend more of its modeling power to rule out pos- sibilities that will be pruned out at test time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a simple model that outper- forms the prior state of the art on FrameNet- style frame-semantic parsing, and performs at par with one of the previous-best single-parser sys- tems on PropBank SRL. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Das et al. (2014)</ref>, our model does not rely on heuristics to con- struct a similarity graph and leverage WordNet; hence, in principle it is generalizable to varying domains, and to other languages. Finally, we pre- sented results on PropBank-style semantic role la- beling with a system that included the task of au- tomatic verb frame identification, in tune with the FrameNet literature; we believe that such a sys- tem produces more interpretable output, both from the perspective of human understanding as well as downstream applications, than pipelines that are oblivious to the verb frame, only focusing on ar- gument analysis.</p></div>
