				<p>Current distributed representations of words show little resemblance to theories of lexical semantics. The former are dense and uninterpretable, the latter largely based on familiar, discrete classes (e.g., supersenses) and relations (e.g., synonymy and hypernymy). We propose methods that transform word vectors into sparse (and optionally binary) vectors. The resulting representations are more similar to the interpretable features typically used in NLP, though they are discovered automatically from raw corpora. Because the vectors are highly sparse, they are computationally easy to work with. Most importantly, we find that they out-perform the original vectors on benchmark tasks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Distributed representations of words have been shown to benefit NLP tasks like parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lazaridou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bansal et al., 2014</ref>), named en- tity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Guo et al., 2014)</ref>, and sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Socher et al., 2013)</ref>. The attraction of word vectors is that they can be derived directly from raw, unannotated corpora. Intrinsic evalua- tions on various tasks are guiding methods toward discovery of a representation that captures many facts about lexical semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Turney, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Turney and Pantel, 2010</ref>).</p><p>Yet word vectors do not look anything like the representations described in most lexical seman- tic theories, which focus on identifying classes of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Schuler, 2005</ref>) and relationships among word meanings <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Miller, 1995)</ref>. Though expensive to construct, conceptualizing word meanings symbolically is important for theoretical understanding and also when we incorporate lexical semantics into com- putational models where interpretability is de- sired. On the surface, discrete theories seem in- commensurate with the distributed approach, a problem now receiving much attention in compu- tational linguistics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lewis and Steedman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kiela and Clark, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grefenstette, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lewis and Steedman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Paperno et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our contribution to this discussion is a new, principled sparse coding method that transforms any distributed representation of words into sparse vectors, which can then be transformed into binary vectors ( §2). Unlike recent approaches of incorpo- rating semantics in distributional word vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Yu and Dredze, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Xu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Faruqui et al., 2015)</ref>, the method does not rely on any external information source. The transformation results in longer, sparser vectors, sometimes called an "over- complete" representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Olshausen and Field, 1997)</ref>. Sparse, overcomplete representations have been motivated in other domains as a way to in- crease separability and interpretability, with each instance (here, a word) having a small number of active dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Olshausen and Field, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lewicki and Sejnowski, 2000</ref>), and to increase stability in the presence of noise ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Donoho et al., 2006</ref>).</p><p>Our work builds on recent explorations of spar- sity as a useful form of inductive bias in NLP and machine learning more broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kazama and Tsujii, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Goodman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Friedman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Glorot et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yogatama and Smith, 2014, inter alia)</ref>. Introducing sparsity in word vector di- mensions has been shown to improve dimension interpretability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Murphy et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fyshe et al., 2014</ref>) and usability of word vectors as features in downstream tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guo et al., 2014</ref>). The word vectors we produce are more than 90% sparse; we also consider binarizing transformations that bring them closer to the categories and relations of lex-ical semantic theories. Using a number of state- of-the-art word vectors as input, we find consis- tent benefits of our method on a suite of standard benchmark evaluation tasks ( §3). We also evalu- ate our word vectors in a word intrusion experi- ment with humans ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chang et al., 2009)</ref> and find that our sparse vectors are more interpretable than the original vectors ( §4).</p><p>We anticipate that sparse, binary vectors can play an important role as features in statistical NLP models, which still rely predominantly on discrete, sparse features whose interpretability en- ables error analysis and continued development. We have made an implementation of our method publicly available. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Sparse Overcomplete Word Vectors</head><p>We consider methods for transforming dense word vectors to sparse, binary overcomplete word vec- tors. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows two approaches. The one on the top, method A, converts dense vectors to sparse overcomplete vectors ( §2.1). The one beneath, method B, converts dense vectors to sparse and bi- nary overcomplete vectors ( §2.2 and §2.4).</p><p>Let V be the vocabulary size. In the following, X ∈ R L×V is the matrix constructed by stack- ing V non-sparse "input" word vectors of length L (produced by an arbitrary word vector estima- tor). We will refer to these as initializing vectors. A ∈ R K×V contains V sparse overcomplete word vectors of length K. "Overcomplete" representa- tion learning implies that K &gt; L.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Sparse Coding</head><p>In sparse coding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lee et al., 2006</ref>), the goal is to represent each input vector x i as a sparse linear combination of basis vectors, a i . Our experiments consider four initializing methods for these vec- tors, discussed in Appendix A. Given X, we seek to solve arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D,A X − DA 2 2 + λΩ(A) + τ D 2 2 , (1)</formula><p>where D ∈ R L×K is the dictionary of basis vec- tors. λ is a regularization hyperparameter, and Ω is the regularizer. Here, we use the squared loss for the reconstruction error, but other loss functions could also be used ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lee et al., 2009)</ref>. To obtain sparse word representations we will impose an 1 penalty on A. Eq. 1 can be broken down into loss for each word vector which can be optimized sep- arately in parallel ( §2.3):</p><p>arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D,A V i=1 x i − Da i 2 2 + λa i 1 + τ D 2 2 (2)</formula><p>where m i denotes the ith column vector of matrix M. Note that this problem is not convex. We refer to this approach as method A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Sparse Nonnegative Vectors</head><p>Nonnegativity in the feature space has often been shown to correspond to interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lee and Seung, 1999</ref> arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D∈R L×K ≥0 ,A∈R K×V ≥0 V i=1 x i −Da i 2 2 +λa i 1 +τ D 2 2<label>(</label></formula><p>3) This problem will play a role in our second ap- proach, method B, to which we will return shortly. This nonnegativity constraint can be easily incor- porated during optimization, as explained next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Optimization</head><p>We use online adaptive gradient descent (Ada- Grad; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Duchi et al., 2010</ref>) for solving the optimiza- tion problems in Eqs. 2-3 by updating A and D. In order to speed up training we use asynchronous updates to the parameters of the model in parallel for every word vector ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Duchi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heigold et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>However, directly applying stochastic subgradi- ent descent to an 1 -regularized objective fails to produce sparse solutions in bounded time, which has motivated several specialized algorithms that target such objectives. We use the AdaGrad vari- ant of one such learning algorithm, the regular- ized dual averaging algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Xiao, 2009)</ref>, which keeps track of the online average gradient at time t: with respect to a i . We define</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">¯ g t = 1 X L V K x V D A K K x V D V K B Sparse</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">γ = −sign(¯ g t,i,j ) ηt G t,i,j (|¯ g t,i,j | − λ),</formula><p>where G t,i,j = t t =1 g 2 t ,i,j . Now, using the av- erage gradient, the 1 -regularized objective is op- timized as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">a t+1,i,j = 0, if |¯ g t,i,j | ≤ λ γ, otherwise (4)</formula><p>where, a t+1,i,j is the jth element of sparse vector a i at the tth update and ¯ g t,i,j is the correspond- ing average gradient. For obtaining nonnegative sparse vectors we take projection of the updated a i onto R K ≥0 by choosing the closest point in R K ≥0 ac- cording to Euclidean distance (which corresponds to zeroing out the negative elements):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">a t+1,i,j =      0, if |¯ g t,i,j | ≤ λ 0, if γ &lt; 0 γ, otherwise (5)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Binarizing Transformation</head><p>Our aim with method B is to obtain word rep- resentations that can emulate the binary-feature   <ref type="bibr">episodes 1975, 1976, 1968, 1970, 1977, 1969</ref> dress, shirt, ivory, shirts, pants upscale, affluent, catering, clientele </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">X L λ τ K % Sparse</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">arg min D∈R L×K B∈{0,1} K×V V i=1 x i − Db i 2 2 + λb i 1 1 + τ D 2 2</formula><p>(6) where B denotes the binary (and also sparse) rep- resentation. This is an mixed integer bilinear pro- gram, which is NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Khayyal and Falk, 1983)</ref>. Unfortunately, the number of variables in the problem is ≈ KV which reaches 100 million when V = 100, 000 and K = 1, 000, which is intractable to solve using standard techniques.</p><p>A more tractable relaxation to this hard prob- lem is to first constrain the continuous represen- tation A to be nonnegative (i.e, a i ∈ R K ≥0 ; §2.2). Then, in order to avoid an expensive computation, we take the nonnegative word vectors obtained us- ing Eq. 3 and project nonzero values to 1, preserv- ing the 0 values. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows a random set of word clusters obtained by (i) applying our method to Glove initial vectors and (ii) applying k-means clustering (k = 100). In §3 we will find that these vectors perform well quantitatively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Hyperparameter Tuning</head><p>Methods A and B have three hyperparameters: the 1 -regularization penalty λ, the 2 -regularization penalty τ , and the length of the overcomplete word vector representation K. We perform a grid search on λ ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0} and K ∈ {10L, 20L}, se- lecting values that maximizes performance on one "development" word similarity task (WS-353, dis- cussed in §B) while achieving at least 90% sparsity in overcomplete vectors. τ was tuned on one col- lection of initializing vectors (Glove, discussed in §A) so that the vectors in D are near unit norm. The four vector representations and their corre- sponding hyperparameters selected by this proce- dure are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. There hyperpa- rameters were chosen for method A and retained for method B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Using methods A and B, we constructed sparse overcomplete vector representations A, starting from four initial vector representations X; these are explained in Appendix A. We used one bench- mark evaluation (WS-353) to tune hyperparame- ters, resulting in the settings shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>; seven other tasks were used to evaluate the quality of the sparse overcomplete representations. The first of these is a word similarity task, where the score is correlation with human judgments, and the others are classification accuracies of an 2 - regularized logistic regression model trained using the word vectors. These tasks are described in de- tail in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Effects of Transforming Vectors</head><p>First, we quantify the effects of our transforma- tions by comparing their output to the initial (X) vectors. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows consistent improvements of sparsifying vectors (method A). The exceptions are on the SimLex task, where our sparse vectors are worse than the skip-gram initializer and on par with the multilingual initializer. Sparsification is beneficial across all of the text classification tasks, for all initial vector representations. On average across all vector types and all tasks, sparse over- complete vectors outperform their corresponding initializers by 4.2 points. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Binarized vectors (from method B) are also usu- ally better than the initial vectors (also shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>), and tend to outperform the sparsified variants, except when initializing with Glove. On average across all vector types and all tasks, bina- rized overcomplete vectors outperform their cor- responding initializers by 4.8 points and the con- tinuous, sparse intermediate vectors by 0.6 points.</p><p>From here on, we explore more deeply the sparse overcomplete vectors from method A (de- noted by A), leaving binarization and method B aside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Effect of Vector Length</head><p>How does the length of the overcomplete vector (K) affect performance? We focus here on the Glove vectors, where L = 300, and report av- erage performance across all tasks. We consider K = αL where α ∈ {2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20}. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> plots the average performance across tasks against α. The earlier selection of K = 3, 000 (α = 10) gives the best result; gains are monotonic in α to that point and then begin to diminish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Alternative Transformations</head><p>We consider two alternative transformations. The first preserves the original vector length but   achieves a binary, sparse vector (B) by applying:</p><note type="other">Vectors SimLex Senti. TREC Sports Comp. Relig. NP Average Corr. Acc</note><formula xml:id="formula_9">b i,j = 1 if x i,j &gt; 0 0 otherwise (7)</formula><p>The second transformation was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guo et al. (2014)</ref>. Here, the original vector length is also preserved, but sparsity is achieved through:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">a i,j =    1 if x i,j ≥ M + −1 if x i,j ≤ M − 0 otherwise<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where M + (M − ) is the mean of positive-valued (negative-valued) elements of X. These vectors are, obviously, not binary.</p><p>We find that on average, across initializing vec- tors and across all tasks that our sparse overcom- plete (A) vectors lead to better performance than either of the alternative transformations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Interpretability</head><p>Our hypothesis is that the dimensions of sparse overcomplete vectors are more interpretable than those of dense word vectors. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Murphy et al. (2012)</ref>, we use a word intrusion experiment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chang et al., 2009</ref>) to corroborate this hypothesis. In addition, we conduct qualitative analysis of in- terpretability, focusing on individual dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Word Intrusion</head><p>Word intrusion experiments seek to quantify the extent to which dimensions of a learned word rep- resentation are coherent to humans. In one in- stance of the experiment, a human judge is pre- sented with five words in random order and asked to select the "intruder." The words are selected by the experimenter by choosing one dimension j of the learned representation, then ranking the words on that dimension alone. The dimensions are cho- sen in decreasing order of the variance of their values across the vocabulary. Four of the words are the top-ranked words according to j, and the "true" intruder is a word from the bottom half of the list, chosen to be a word that appears in the top 10% of some other dimension. An example of an instance is: naval, industrial, technological, marine, identity    <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">and Fleiss, 1982)</ref>.</p><p>(The last word is the intruder.) We formed instances from initializing vectors and from our sparse overcomplete vectors (A). Each of these two combines the four different ini- tializers X. We selected the 25 dimensions d in each case. Each of the 100 instances per condition (initial vs. sparse overcomplete) was given to three judges.</p><p>Results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> confirm that the sparse over- complete vectors are more interpretable than the dense vectors. The inter-annotator agreement on the sparse vectors increases substantially, from 57% to 71%, and the Fleiss' κ increases from "fair" to "moderate" agreement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Landis and Koch, 1977)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Qualitative Evaluation of Interpretability</head><p>If a vector dimension is interpretable, the top- ranking words for that dimension should display semantic or syntactic groupings. To verify this qualitatively, we select five dimensions with the highest variance of values in initial and sparsi- fied GC vectors. We compare top-ranked words in the dimensions extracted from the two representa- tions. The words are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>, a dimension per row. Subjectively, we find the semantic group- ings better in the sparse vectors than in the initial vectors. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> visualizes the sparsified GC vectors for six words. The dimensions are sorted by the aver- age value across the three "animal" vectors. The animal-related words use many of the same di- mensions (102 common active dimensions out of 500 total); in constrast, the three city names use X combat, guard, honor, bow, trim, naval 'll, could, faced, lacking, seriously, scored see, n't, recommended, depending, part due, positive, equal, focus, respect, better sergeant, comments, critics, she, videos A fracture, breathing, wound, tissue, relief relationships, connections, identity, relations files, bills, titles, collections, poems, songs naval, industrial, technological, marine stadium, belt, championship, toll, ride, coach </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a method that converts word vectors obtained using any state-of-the-art word vector model into sparse and optionally binary word vectors. These transformed vectors appear to come closer to features used in NLP tasks and out- perform the original vectors from which they are derived on a suite of semantics and syntactic eval- uation benchmarks. We also find that the sparse vectors are more interpretable than the dense vec- tors by humans according to a word intrusion de- tection test.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Initial Vector Representations (X)</head><p>Our experiments consider four publicly available collections of pre-trained word vectors. They vary in the amount of data used and the estimation method.</p><p>Glove. Global vectors for word representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) are trained on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus. These vectors were trained on 6 billion words from Wikipedia and English Gigaword and are of length 300. 3 3 http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/ glove/ Skip-Gram (SG). The word2vec tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) is fast and widely-used. In this model, each word's Huffman code is used as an input to a log-linear classifier with a continuous projection layer and words within a given context window are predicted. These vectors were trained on 100 bil- lion words of Google news data and are of length 300. 4</p><p>Global Context (GC). These vectors are learned using a recursive neural network that incorporates both local and global (document- level) context features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Huang et al., 2012</ref>). These vectors were trained on the first 1 billion words of English Wikipedia and are of length 50. 5</p><p>Multilingual (Multi). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Faruqui and Dyer (2014)</ref> learned vectors by first performing SVD on text in different languages, then applying canonical correlation analysis on pairs of vectors for words that align in parallel corpora. These vectors were trained on WMT-2011 news corpus containing 360 million words and are of length 48. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Evaluation Benchmarks</head><p>Our comparisons of word vector quality consider five benchmark tasks. We now describe the differ- ent evaluation benchmarks for word vectors.</p><p>Word Similarity. We evaluate our word repre- sentations on two word similarity tasks. The first is the WS-353 dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Finkelstein et al., 2001</ref>), which contains 353 pairs of English words that have been assigned similarity ratings by humans. This dataset is used to tune sparse vector learning hyperparameters ( §2.5), while the remaining of the tasks discussed in this section are completely held out.</p><p>A more recent dataset, <ref type="bibr">SimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2014)</ref>, has been constructed to specifically focus on similarity (rather than relatedness). It con- tains a balanced set of noun, verb, and adjective pairs. We calculate cosine similarity between the vectors of two words forming a test item and re- port Spearman's rank correlation coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Myers and Well, 1995)</ref> between the rankings pro- duced by our model against the human rankings.</p><p>Sentiment Analysis (Senti). <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Socher et al. (2013)</ref> created a treebank of sentences anno- tated with fine-grained sentiment labels on phrases and sentences from movie review excerpts. The coarse-grained treebank of positive and negative classes has been split into training, development, and test datasets containing 6,920, 872, and 1,821 sentences, respectively. We use average of the word vectors of a given sentence as feature for classification. The classifier is tuned on the dev. set and accuracy is reported on the test set.</p><p>Question Classification (TREC). As an aid to question answering, a question may be classi- fied as belonging to one of many question types. The TREC questions dataset involves six differ- ent question types, e.g., whether the question is about a location, about a person, or about some nu- meric information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li and Roth, 2002</ref>). The train- ing dataset consists of 5,452 labeled questions, and the test dataset consists of 500 questions. An av- erage of the word vectors of the input question is used as features and accuracy is reported on the test set.</p><p>20 Newsgroup Dataset. We consider three bi- nary categorization tasks from the 20 News- groups dataset. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Each task involves categoriz- ing a document according to two related cate- gories with training/dev./test split in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Yogatama and Smith (2014)</ref>: <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(1)</ref>  length three words, where the first can be an ad- jective or a noun and the other two are nouns. The task is to predict the correct bracketing in the parse tree for a given noun phrase. For example, local (phone company) and (blood pressure) medicine exhibit right and left bracketing, respectively. We append the word vectors of the three words in the NP in order and use them as features for binary classification. The dataset contains 2,227 noun phrases split into 10 folds. The classifier is tuned on the first fold and cross-validation accuracy is reported on the remaining nine folds.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Methods for obtaining sparse overcomplete vectors (top, method A, §2.1) and sparse, binary overcomplete word vectors (bottom, method B, §2.2 and §2.4).
