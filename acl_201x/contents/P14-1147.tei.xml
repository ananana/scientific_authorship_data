				<p>Consumers&apos; purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated online reviews. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential for posting deceptive opinion spam-fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. In this paper, we explore generalized approaches for identifying online deceptive opinion spam based on a new gold standard dataset, which is comprised of data from three different domains (i.e. Hotel, Restaurant, Doctor), each of which contains three types of reviews , i.e. customer generated truthful reviews , Turker generated deceptive reviews and employee (domain-expert) generated deceptive reviews. Our approach tries to capture the general difference of language usage between deceptive and truthful reviews , which we hope will help customers when making purchase decisions and review portal operators, such as TripAdvisor or Yelp, investigate possible fraudulent activity on their sites. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Consumers increasingly rely on user-generated online reviews when making purchase deci- sion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cone, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ipsos, 2012)</ref>. Unfortunately, the ease of posting content to the Web, poten- tially anonymously, creates opportunities and in- centives for unscrupulous businesses to post de- ceptive opinion spam-fictitious reviews that are deliberately written to sound authentic, in order to deceive the reader. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Accordingly, there appears <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Dataset available by request from the first author. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Manipulating online reviews may also have legal conse- quences. For example, the Federal Trade Commission <ref type="bibr">(FTC)</ref> to be widespread and growing concern among both businesses and the public about this poten- tial abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Meyer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miller, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Streitfeld, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Topping, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ott, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Existing approaches for spam detection are usu- ally focused on developing supervised learning- based algorithms to help users identify decep- tive opinion spam, which are highly dependent upon high-quality gold-standard labeled data <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jindal and Liu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2010)</ref>. Stud- ies in the literature rely on a couple of approaches for obtaining labeled data, which usually fall into two categories. The first relies on the judge- ments of human annotators ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mukherjee et al., 2012</ref>). However, recent stud- ies show that deceptive opinion spam is not eas- ily identified by human readers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ott et al., 2011</ref>). An alternative approach, as introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ott et al. (2011)</ref>, crowdsourced deceptive reviews using Amazon Mechanical Turk. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> A couple of follow-up works have been introduced based on Ott et al.'s dataset, including estimating prevalence of decep- tion in online reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ott et al., 2012)</ref>, identifica- tion of negative deceptive opinion spam , and identifying manipulated offerings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li et al., 2013b)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the advantages of soliciting deceptive gold-standard material from Turkers (it is easy, large-scale, and affordable), it is unclear whether Turkers are representative of the general popula- tion that generate fake reviews, or in other words, Ott et al.'s data set may correspond to only one type of online deceptive opinion spam -fake re- views generated by people who have never been to offerings or experienced the entities. Specifi- cally, according to their findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ott et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> has updated their guidelines on the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising to suggest that posting deceptive reviews may be unlawful in the United States <ref type="bibr">(FTC, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>3 http://www.mturk.com <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al., 2013a</ref>), truthful hotel reviews encode more spatial details, characterized by terms such as "bathroom" and "location", while deceptive re- views talk about general concepts such as why or with whom they went to the hotel. However, a hotel can instead solicit fake reviews from their employees or customers who possess substantial domain knowledge to write fake reviews and en- code more spatial details in their lies. Indeed, cases have been reported where hotel owners bribe guests in return for good reviews on TripAdvi- sor 4 , or companies ordered employees to pretend they were satisfied customers and write glowing reviews of its face-lift procedure on Web sites. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The domain knowledge possessed by domain ex- perts enables them to craft reviews that are much more difficult for classifiers to detect, compared to the crowdsourced fake reviews. Additionally, existing supervised algorithms in the literature are usually narrowed to one spe- cific domain and heavily rely on domain-specific vocabulary. For example, classifiers assign high weights to domain-specific terms such as "hotel", "rooms", or even the name of the hotels such as "Hilton" when trained on reviews on hotels. It is unclear whether these classifiers will perform well at detecting deception in other domains, e.g., Restaurant or Doctor reviews. Even in a single do- main, e.g., Hotel, classifiers trained from reviews of one city (e.g., Chicago) may not be effective if directly applied to reviews from other cities (e.g., New York City) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li et al., 2013b</ref>). In the exam- ples in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we trained a linear SVM clas- sifier on Ott's Chicago-hotel dataset on unigram features and tested it on a couple of different do- mains (the details of data acquisition are illustrated in Section 3). Good performance is obtained on Chicago-hotel reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ott et al., 2011</ref>), but not as good on New York City ones. The performance is reasonable in Restaurant reviews due to the many shared properties among restaurants and hotels, but suffers in Doctor settings.</p><p>In this paper, we try to obtain a deeper under- standing of the general nature of deceptive opin- ion spam. One contribution of the work presented here is the creation of the cross-domain (i.e., Ho- tel, Restaurant and Doctor) gold-standard dataset. To explore the general rule of deceptive opinion spam, we extended SAGE Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Eisenstein et al., 2011</ref>), a bayesian generative approach that can capture the multiple generative facets (i.e., decep- tive vs truthful, positive vs negative, experienced vs non-experienced, hotel vs restaurant vs doctor) in the text collection. We find that more general features, such as LIWC and POS, are more robust when modeled using SAGE, compared with just bag-of-words.</p><p>We additionally make theoretical contributions that may shed light on a longstanding debate in the literature about deception. For example, in con- trast to existing findings that highlight the lack of spatial detail in deceptive reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ott et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li et al., 2013b)</ref>, we find that a lack of spatial de- tail may not be a universal cue to deception, since it does not apply to fake reviews written by domain experts. Instead, our finding suggest that other lin- guistic features may offer more robust cues to de- ceptive opinion spam, such as overly highlighted sentiment in the review or the overuse of first- person singular pronouns.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly go over related work. We describe the creation of our data set in Section 3 and present our model in Section 4. Experimental results are shown in Section 5. We present anal- ysis of general cues to deception in Section 6 and conclude this paper in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Spam has been historically studied in the contexts of Web text <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gyöngyi et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ntoulas et al., 2006</ref>) or email ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Drucker et al., 1999)</ref>. Recently there has been increasing concern about deceptive opinion spam <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jindal and Liu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ott et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mukherjee et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wang et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jindal and Liu (2008)</ref> first studied the deceptive opinion problem and trained models using features based on the review text, reviewer, and product to identify duplicate opinions, i.e., opinions that appear more than once in the corpus with simi- lar contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al. (2010)</ref> propose an alter- native strategy to detect deceptive opinion spam in the absence of a gold standard. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yoo and Gretzel (2009)</ref> gathered 40 truthful and 42 deceptive hotel reviews and manually compare the linguis- tic differences between them. Ott et al. created a gold-standard collection by employing Turkers to write fake reviews, and follow-up research was based on their data <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ott et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Feng and Hirst, 2013)</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. For example, Song et al. (2012) looked into syntactic features from Context Free Grammar parse trees</head><p>to improve the classifier performance. A step fur- ther, Feng and Hirst (2013) make use of degree of compatibility between the personal experiment and a collection of reference reviews about the same product rather than simple textual features.</p><p>In addition to exploring text or linguistic fea- tures in deception, some existing work looks into customers' behavior to identify deception ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mukherjee et al., 2013a</ref>). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mukherjee et al. (2011;</ref> delved into group behavior to identify group of reviewers who work collabo- ratively to write fake reviews. Qian and Liu (2013) identified multiple user IDs that are generated by the same author, as these authors are more likely to generate deceptive reviews.</p><p>In the psychological literature, researchers have looked into possible linguistic cues to deception <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Newman et al., 2003</ref>), such as decreased spatial detail, which is consistent with theories of reality monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johnson and Raye, 1981)</ref>, increased negative emotion terms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Newman et al., 2003)</ref>, or the writing style difference between informative (truthful) and imaginative (deceptive) writings in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rayson et al., 2001</ref>). The former typically con- sists of more nouns, adjectives, prepositions, de- terminers, and coordinating conjunctions, while the latter consists of more verbs, adverbs, pro- nouns, and pre-determiners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAGE (Sparse Additive Generative Model):</head><p>SAGE is an generative bayesian approach in- troduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Eisenstein et al. (2011)</ref>, which can be viewed as an combination of topic mod- els ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003)</ref> and generalized additive models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990)</ref>. Unlike other derivatives of topic models, SAGE drops the Dirichlet-multinomial assumption and adopts a Laplacian prior, triggering sparsity in topic-word distribution. The reason why SAGE is tailored for our task is that SAGE constructs multi-faceted la- tent variable models by simply adding together the component vectors rather than incorporating mul- tiple switching latent variables in multiple facets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dataset Construction</head><p>In this section, we report our efforts to gather gold- standard opinion spam datasets. Our datasets con- tain the following domains, namely Hotel, Restau- rant, and Doctor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Turker set, using Mechanical Turk</head><p>Crowdsourcing services such as AMT greatly fa- cilitate large-scale data annotation and collection efforts. Anyone with basic programming skills can create Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) and ac- cess a marketplace of anonymous online workers (Turkers) willing to complete the tasks. We bor- rowed some rules used by Ott et al. to create their dataset, such as restricting task to Turkers located in the United States, and who maintain an approval rating of at least 90%.</p><p>Hotel-Turker : We directly borrowed datasets from Ott 7 and Li. 8</p><p>Restaurant-Turker : We gathered 20 positive (P) deceptive reviews for each of 10 of the most popular restaurants in Chicago, for a total of 200 positive deceptive restaurant reviews.</p><p>Doctor-Turker : We gathered a total number of 200 positive reviews from Turkers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Employee set, by domain experts</head><p>We seek deceptive opinion spam written by people with expert-level domain knowledge. It is not ap- propriate to use crowdsourcing to obtain this data,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Turker</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expert Customer Hotel (P/N) 400/400 140/140 400/400 Restaurant (P/N) 200/0 120/0 200/200 Doctor (P/N)</head><p>200/0 32/0 200/0 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Statistics for our dataset.</p><p>so instead we solicit reviews written by employees in each domain.</p><p>Hotel-Employee: We asked two hotel employ- ees from each of seven hotels (14 employees to- tal) each to write 10 deceptive positive-sentiment reviews of their own hotel, and 10 deceptive negative-sentiment reviews of their biggest local competitor's hotel. In total, we obtained 280 de- ceptive reviews of 14 hotels, including a balanced mix of positive-and negative-sentiment reviews.</p><p>Restaurant-Employee: We asked employees from selected restaurants (a waiter/waitress or cook) to each write positive-sentiment reviews of their restaurant.</p><p>Doctor-Employee: We asked real doctors to write positive fake reviews about themselves. In total we obtained 32 reviews from 15 doctors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Customer set from Actual Customers</head><p>Hotel-Customer: We borrowed from Ott et al.'s dataset.</p><p>Restaurant/Doctor-Customer: We solicited data by matching a set of truthful reviews as Ott et al. did in collecting truthful hotel reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Summary for Data Creation</head><p>Statistics for our data set is presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Due to the difficulty in obtaining gold-standard data in the literature, there is no doubt that our data set is not perfect. Some parts are missing, some are unbalanced, participants in the survey may not be representative of the general population. How- ever, as far as we know, this is the most compre- hensive dataset for deceptive opinion spam so far, and may to some extent shed insights on the nature of online deception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Feature-based Additive Model</head><p>In this section, we briefly describe our model. Since mathematics are not the main theme of this paper, we omit the exact details for inference, which can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Eisenstein et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Before describing the model in detail, we note the following advantages of the SAGE model, and our reasons for using it in this paper:</p><p>1. the "additive" nature of SAGE allows a better understanding of which features contribute most to each type of deceptive review and how much each such feature contributes to the final decision jointly. If we instead use SVM, for example, we would have to train classifiers one by one (due to the distinct fea- tures from different sources) to draw con- clusions regarding the differences between Turker vs Expert vs truthful reviews, positive expert vs negative expert reviews, or reviews from different domains. This would not only become intractable, but would make the con- clusions less clear.</p><p>2. For cross-domain classification task, standard machine learning approaches may suffer due to domain-specific properties (See Section 5.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Model</head><p>In SAGE, each term w is drawn from a distribution proportional to exp(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m (w) + η (T )(w) y d + η (A)(w) zn + η (I)(w) y d ,zn )</formula><p>, where m (w) is the observed background term frequency, η y d , η zn and η y d ,zn denote the log frequency deviation representing topic z n , facet y d , and the second-order interaction part respec- tively. Superscripts T , A and I respectively denote the index of the topic, facet, and second-order in- teraction. In our task, we adapt the SAGE model as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y = {y Sentiment ∈ {positive, negative}, y Domain ∈ {hotel, restaurant, doctor}, y Source ∈ {employee, turker, customer}}</formula><p>We model three η's, one for each type of y. Let i, j, k denote the index of the different types of y, so that each term w is drawn as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (w|i, j, k) ∝ exp(m (w) + η (i)(w) y Sentiment +η (j)(w) y Domain + η (k)(w) y Scource + higher order)</formula><p>where the higher order parts denote the interac- tions between different facets.</p><p>In our approach each document-level feature f is drawn from the following distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (f |i, j, k) ∝ exp(m (f ) + η (i)(f ) y Sentiment + η (j)(f ) y Domain + η (k)(f ) y Scource + higher order)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where m (f ) can be interpreted as the background value of feature f . For each review d, the proba- bility that it is drawn from facets with index i, j, k is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P (d|i, j, k) = f ∈d P (f |i, j, k) w∈d P (w|i, j, k) (2)</formula><p>In the training process, parameters η as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y Source = argmax y Source P (d|y Source , y Sentiment , y Domain ),</formula><p>where we assume y Sentiment and y Domain are given for each document d. Note that we as- sume conditional independence between features and words given y, similar to other topic mod- els ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>. Notably, our revised SAGE model degenerates into a model similar to Gen- eralized Additive Model (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) when word features are not considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we report our experimental results. We first restrict experiments to the within-domain task and see what features most characterize the deceptive reviews, and how. We later extend it to cross domains to explore a more general classifier of deceptive opinion spam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Intra-Domain Classification</head><p>We explore the effect of both domain experts and crowdsourcing workers on intra-domain de- ception. Specifically, we reframe it as a intra- domain multi-class classification task, where given the labeled training data from one domain, we learn a classifier to classify reviews accord- ing to their source, i.e., Employee, Turker and Customer. Since the machine learning classi- fier is trained and tested within the same domain, η y Domain are not considered here. We use a One-Versus-Rest (OvR) scheme, in which we train m classifiers using SAGE, such that each classifier f i , for i ∈ <ref type="bibr">[1, m]</ref>, is trained to distinguish between class i on the one hand, and all classes except i on the other. To make an m- way decision, we then choose the class c with the most confident prediction. OvR approaches have been shown to produce state-of-art performance compared to other multi-class approaches such as Multinomial Naive Bayes or One-Versus-One clas- sification scheme. We train the OvR classifier on three sets of features, LIWC, Unigram, and POS. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Multi-class classification results are given at Ta- ble 3. We report both OvR performance and the performance of three One-versus-One binary clas- sifiers, trained to distinguish between each pair of classes. In particular, the three-class classifier is around 65% accurate at distinguishing between Employee, Customer, and Turker for each of the domains using Unigram, significantly higher than random guess. We also observe that each of the three One-versus-One binary classifications per- forms significantly better than chance, suggesting that Employee, Customer, and Turker are in fact three different classes. In particular, the two-class classifier is around 0.76 accurate in distinguish- ing between Turker and Employee reviews, de- spite both kinds of reviews being deceptive opin- ion spam.</p><p>Best performance is achieved on Unigram fea- tures, constantly outperforming LIWC and POS features in both three-class and two-class settings in the hotel domain. Similar results are observed for restaurant and doctor domains and details are excluded for brevity. This suggests that a universal set of keyword-based deception cues (e.g., LIWC) is not the best approach for Intra-Domain Classifi- cation. Similar results were also reported in previ- ous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ott et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ott, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Cross-domain Classification</head><p>In this subsection, we frame our problem as a domain adaptation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Pan and Yang, 2010)</ref>. Again, we explore 3 feature sets: LIWC, Uni- gram and POS. We train a classifier on hotel re- views, and evaluate the performance on other do- mains. For simplicity, we focus on truthful (Cus- tomer) versus deceptive (Turker) binary classifi- cation rather than a multi-class classification.</p><p>We report results from SAGE and SVM 10 in Ta- ble 4. We first observe that classifiers trained on hotel reviews apply well in the restaurant domain, which is reasonable due to the many shared prop-    In the doctor domain, we observe that models trained on Unigram features from the hotels do- main do not generalize well to doctor reviews, and the performance is a little bit better than random guess with only 0.55 accuracy. For SVM, models trained on POS and LIWC features achieve even lower accuracy than Unigram. POS and LIWC features obtain around 0.5 precision and 1.0 re- call, indicating that all doctor reviews are classi- fied as deceptive by the classifier. One plausible explanation could be doctor reviews generally en- code some type of positive-weighted (deceptive) features more than hotel reviews and these types of features dominate the decision making proce- dures, leading all reviews to be classified as de- ceptive. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 5 and 6</ref> give the top weighted LIWC and POS features. We observe that many features are indeed shared among doctor and hotel domains. Notably, POS features are more robust than LIWC as more shared features are observed. As domain specific properties will be considered in the in- teraction part (η LIW C domain and η P OS domain ) of the addi-  tive model, SAGE achieve much better results than SVM, and is around 0.65 accurate in the cross- domain task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">General Linguistic Cues of Deceptive Opinion Spam</head><p>In this section, we examine a number of general POS and LIWC features that may shed light on a general rule for identifying deceptive opinion   spam. Our modified SAGE model provides us with a tailored tool for this analysis. Specifically, each feature f is associated with a background value m f . For each facet A, η f A , presents the facet- specific preference value for feature f . Note that sentiments are separated into positive and negative dimensions, which is necessary because hotel em- ployee authors wrote positive-sentiment reviews when reviewing their own hotels, and negative- sentiment reviews when reviewing their competi- tors' hotels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">POS features</head><p>Early findings in the literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rayson et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Biber et al., 1999)</ref> found that informative (truthful) writings typically consist of more nouns, adjectives, prepo- sitions, determiners, and coordinating conjunc- tions, while imaginative (deceptive) writing con- sist of more verbs, adverbs, pronouns, and pre- determiners (with a few exceptions). Our find- ings with POS features are largely in agreement with these findings when distinguishing between Turker and Customer reviews, but are violated in the Employee set.</p><p>We present the eight types of POS features in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>, namely, N (Noun), JJ (Adjective), IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction) and DT (Determiner), V (Verb), RB (Adverb), PRP (Pro- nouns, both personal and possessive) and PDT (Pre-Determiner).</p><p>From Figures 1(a)(b)(e)(f), we observe that with the exception of PDT, the word frequency of which is too small to draw a conclusion, Turker and Customer reviews exhibit linguistic patterns in agreement with previous findings in the literature, where truthful reviews (Customer) tend to include more N, JJ, IN and DT, while deceptive writings tend to encode more V, RB and PRP.</p><p>However, in the case of the Employee-Positive dataset, which is equally deceptive, most of these rules are violated. Notably, reviews from the Employee-Positive set did not encode fewer N, JJ and DT terms, as expected (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 1(a)(c)</ref>). Instead, they encode even more N, JJ and DT vocabularies than truthful reviews from the Cus- tomer reviews. Also, fewer V and RB are found in Employee-Positive reviews compared with Cus- tomer reviews (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 1(e)(g)</ref>).</p><p>One explanation for these observations is that informative (truthful) writing tends to be more in- troductory and descriptive, encoding more con- crete details, when compared with imaginary writ- ings. As domain experts possess considerable knowledge of their own offerings, they highlight </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">LIWC features</head><p>We explore 3 LIWC categories (from left to right in subfigures of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>): sentiment (neg emo and pos emo), spatial detail (space), and first-person singular pronouns (first-person). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>(i)(j)(k)(l), we can easily see that both actual customers and domain experts encode more spatial details in their reviews (positive value of η), which is in agreement with our expectation. This further demonstrates that a lack of spatial de- tails would not be a general cue for deception. Moreover, it appears that general domain expertise does not compensate for the lack of prior experi- ence when writing deceptive negative reviews for competitors' hotels, as demonstrated by the lack of spatial details in the negative-sentiment reviews by employees shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>  -Person Singular Pronouns: The litera- ture also associates deception with decreased us- age of first-person singular pronouns, an effect at- tributed to psychological distancing, whereby de- ceivers talk less about themselves due either to a lack of personal experience, or to detach them- selves from the lie ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Newman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhou et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Knapp and Comaden, 1979)</ref>. However, according to our find- ings, we find the opposite to hold. Increased first person singular is an apparent indicator of decep- tion, when comparing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>(b) to 2(c) and 2(e). We suspect that this relates to an effect observed in previous studies of deception, where liars inad- vertently undermine their lies by overemphasizing aspects of their deception that they believe reflect credibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bond and DePaulo, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">DePaulo et al., 2003)</ref>. One interpretation for this phenomenon would be that deceivers try to overemphasize their physical presence because they believe that this in- creases their credibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Discussion</head><p>In this work, we have developed a multi-domain large-scale dataset containing gold-standard de- ceptive opinion spam. It includes reviews of Ho- tels, Restaurants and Doctors, generated through crowdsourcing and domain experts. We study this data using SAGE, which enables us to make ob- servations about the respects in which truthful and deceptive text differs. Our model includes sev- eral domain-independent features that shed light on these differences, which further allows us to formulate some general rules for recognizing de- ceptive opinion spam.</p><p>We also acknowledge several important caveats to this work. By soliciting fake reviews from par- ticipants, including crowd workers and domain experts, we have found that is possible to de- tect fake reviews with above-chance accuracy, and have used our models to explore several psycho- logical theories of deception. However, it is still very difficult to estimate the practical impact of such methods, as it is very challenging to obtain gold-standard data in the real world. Moreover, by soliciting deceptive opinion spam in an arti- ficial environment, we are endorsing the decep- tion, which may influence the cues that we ob- serve <ref type="bibr">(Feeley and others, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frank and Ekman, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Newman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ott, 2013)</ref>. Finally, it may be possible to train people to tell more con- vincing lies. Many of the characteristics regard- ing fake review generation might be overcome by well-trained fake review writers, which would re- sults in opinion spam that is harder for detect. Fu- ture work may wish to consider some of these ad- ditional challenges.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>are to be learned by maximizing the posterior distribution following the original SAGE training procedure.

			<note place="foot">tial for posting deceptive opinion spamfictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. In this paper, we explore generalized approaches for identifying online deceptive opinion spam based on a new gold standard dataset, which is comprised of data from three different domains (i.e. Hotel, Restaurant, Doctor), each of which contains three types of reviews, i.e. customer generated truthful reviews, Turker generated deceptive reviews and employee (domain-expert) generated deceptive reviews. Our approach tries to capture the general difference of language usage between deceptive and truthful reviews, which we hope will help customers when making purchase decisions and review portal operators, such as TripAdvisor or Yelp, investigate possible fraudulent activity on their sites. 1</note>
