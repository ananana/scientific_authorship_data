				<p>We examine differences in portrayal of characters in movies using psycholinguis-tic and graph theoretic measures computed directly from screenplays. Differences are examined with respect to characters&apos; gender , race, age and other metadata. Psy-cholinguistic metrics are extrapolated to dialogues in movies using a linear regression model built on a set of manually annotated seed words. Interesting patterns are revealed about relationships between genders of production team and the gender ratio of characters. Several correlations are noted between gender, race, age of characters and the linguistic metrics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Movies are often described as having the power to influence individual beliefs and values. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cape, 2003)</ref>, the authors assert movies' influence in both creating new thinking patterns in previously unex- plored social phenomena, especially in children, as well as their ability to update an individual's ex- isting social boundaries based on what is shown on screen as the "norm". Some authors claim the in- verse ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wedding and Boyd, 1999)</ref>: that movies re- flect existing cultural values of the society, adding weight to their ability in influencing individual be- liefs of what is accepted as the norm. As a result, they are studied in multiple disciplines to analyze their influence.</p><p>Movies are particularly scrutinized in aspects involving negative stereotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cape, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dimnik and Felton, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ter Bogt et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hedley, 1994)</ref> since this may introduce question- able beliefs in viewers. Negative stereotyping is believed to impact society in multiple aspects such as self-induced undermining of ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Davies et al., 2005</ref>) as well as causing forms of prej- udice that can impact leadership or employment prospects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eagly and Karau, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Niven, 2006</ref>). Studies in analyzing stereotyping in movies typi- cally rely on collecting manual annotations on a small set of movies on which hypotheses tests are conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Behm-Morawitz and Mastro, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benshoff and Griffin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hooks, 2009)</ref>. In this work, we present large scale automated analyses of movie characters using language used in dialogs to study stereotyping along factors such as gender, race and age.</p><p>Language use has been long known as a strong indicator of the speaker's psychological and emo- tional state <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gottschalk and Gleser, 1969)</ref> and is well studied in a number of applications such as automatic personality detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mairesse et al., 2007</ref>) and psychotherapy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xiao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pennebaker et al., 2003)</ref>. Computational analysis of language has been particularly popular thanks to advancements in computing and the ease of con- ducting large scale analysis of text on computers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pennebaker et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To perform our analysis, we construct a new movie screenplay corpus 1 that includes nearly 1000 movie scripts obtained from the Internet. For each movie in the corpus, we obtain additional metadata such as cast, genre, writers and directors, and also collect actor level demographic informa- tion such as gender, race and age.</p><p>We use two kinds of measures in our analy- ses: (i) linguistic metrics that capture various psy- chological constructs and behaviors, estimated us- ing dialogues from the screenplay; and (ii) graph theoretic metrics estimated from character net- work graphs, which are constructed to model inter- character interactions in the movie. The linguis- tic metrics include psycholinguistic normatives, which provide word level scores on a numeric scale which are then aggregated at the dialog level, and metrics from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts tool (LIWC) which capture usage of well studied stereotyping dimensions such as sexuality. We estimate centrality metrics from the character network graphs to measure relative importance of the different characters, which are analyzed with respect to the different factors of gender, race and age.</p><p>The main contributions of this work are as fol- lows: (i) we present a scalable analysis of differ- ences in portrayal of various character subgroups in movies using their language use, (ii) we con- struct a new corpus with detailed annotations for our analysis and (iii) we highlight several differ- ences in the portrayal of characters along factors such as race, age and gender.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe related work. We explain the data collection process in section 3 and exper- imental procedure in section 4. We explain results in section 5 and conclude in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Previous works in studying representation in movies largely focus on relative frequencies, par- ticularly on character gender. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Smith et al., 2014</ref>), the authors studied 120 movies from around the globe which were manually annotated to capture information about character gender, age, careers, writer gender and director gender. However, since the annotations are done manually, collecting information on new movies is a labori- ous process. We avoided this by estimating the metadata computationally, enabling us to scale up efficiently.</p><p>Automated analyses of movies using computa- tional techniques to analyze representation has re- cently gained some attention. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(NYFA, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Polygraph, 2016)</ref>, the authors examine differences in relative frequency of female characters and note considerable disparities in gender ratio in these movies. However, the analyses there too are lim- ited to comparing relative frequencies. Our work is closest to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ramakrishna et al., 2015)</ref> where the authors study difference in language used in movies across genders, but their analysis is one dimensional. In our work we perform fine grained comparisons of character portrayal using multiple language based metrics along factors such as gen- der, race and age on a newly created corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Raw screenplay</head><p>We fetch movie screenplay files from two primary sources: imsdb (IMSDb, 2017) and daily scripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DailyScript, 2017)</ref>. In total, we retrieved 1547 movies. After removing duplicates we retain 1434 raw screenplay files, of which 489 were corrupted or empty leaving us with 945 usable screenplays. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 1, 3</ref> and 4 list statistics about the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Script parser</head><p>The screenplay files are formatted in human read- able format and include dialogues tagged with character names along with auxiliary informa- tion of the scene such as shot location (inte- rior/exterior), character placement and scene con- text. The screenplays are from a diverse set of writers and include a significant amount of noise and inconsistencies in their structure. To ex- tract the relevant information, we developed a text parser 2 that accepts raw script files and outputs utterances along with character names. We ignore scene context information and primarily focus on spoken dialogues to study language usage in the movies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Movie and character meta-data</head><p>For each parsed movie, we fetch relevant meta- data such as year of release, directors, writers, and producers from the Internet Movie Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(IMDb, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Since most screenplays are drafts and subject to revisions such as changes in character names, matching them to an entry from IMDb is non- trivial. We first start with a list of all movies that have a close match with the screenplay name; given this list of potential matches we compute name alignment scores for each entry as the per- centage of character names from the script found online. The character names are mapped us- ing term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) to compute the name alignment score fol- lowing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cohen et al., 2003)</ref>. Finally, the entry with highest alignment score is chosen. For all actors listed in the aligned result, we collect their age, gender and race as detailed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Gender</head><p>Given the names of actors and other members of production team found in a movie, we use a name based gender classifier to predict their gender in- formation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> lists statistics on gender ratios for the production team in the corpus. Female- to-male ratios were found in close agreement with previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Smith et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, several screenplays get revised during production. In particular charac- ter names get changed, sometimes even gender. As a result, some characters may not be aligned to the correct entry from IMDb. In addition, digitized screenplays sometime include significant noise thanks to optical character recognition er- rors, leading to character names failing to align with entries from IMDb. To correct these, we perform manual cleanup of all the movie align- ments, fix incorrect gender maps, and manually force match movies if they're mapped to the wrong IMDb entry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Age</head><p>We also extract age for each actor to study possi- ble age related biases in movies. We include age in our analysis since studies report preferential biases with age in employment particularly when com- bined with gender ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lincoln and Allen, 2004</ref>). In addition, there may be biases in portrayal of spe- cific age groups when combined with gender and race.</p><p>For each actor in the mapped IMDb entry, we collect his/her birthday information. We sub- tract the movie production year obtained also from IMDb from the actor's birthday to get an estimate of the actor's age during the movie's production. We note however that the age obtained in this man- ner may be different from the portrayed age of the character. To account for this we bin the actors into fifteen year age groups before our analysis, since its generally unlikely to have actors further than fifteen years from their portrayed age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Race</head><p>We parse ethnicity information from the website (ethnicelebs.com, 2017), which includes ethnicity for approximately 8000 different actors. The in- formation obtained from this site is primarily sub- mitted by independent users, and exhibits signifi- cant amount of variation among the possible eth- nicities with about 750 different unique ethnicity types. Since we are more specifically interested in We use a modified version of the racial categories from the US census which are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> along with frequency of actors from each racial category in our corpus. The ethnicities obtained from the site above pri- marily cover major actors with a fan base with no information for several actors who play minor roles. We annotate racial information for nearly 2000 such actors using MTurk with two annota- tions for each actor, manually correcting nearly 400 cases in which the annotators disagreed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Character portrayal using language</head><p>To study differences in portrayal of characters, we use two different metrics: psycholinguistic norma- tives, which are designed to capture the underlying emotional state of the speaker; and LIWC metrics, which provide a measure of the speaker's affinity to different social and physical constructs such as religion and death. We explain these two metrics in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Psycholinguistic normatives</head><p>Psycholinguistic normatives provide a measure of various emotional and psychological constructs of the speaker, such as arousal, valence, concrete- ness, intelligibility, etc. and are computed entirely from language usage. They are relatively easy to compute, provide reliable indicators of the above constructs, and have been used in a variety of tasks in natural language processing such as information retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tanaka et al., 2013)</ref>, sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nielsen, 2011</ref>), text based personality prediction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mairesse et al., 2007</ref>) and opinion mining.</p><p>The numeric ratings are typically extrapolated from a small set of keywords which are annotated by psychologists. Manual annotations of word rat- ings is a laborious process and is hence limited to a few thousand words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Clark and Paivio, 2004</ref>). Automatic extrapolation of these ratings to words not covered by the manual annotations can be done using structured databases which provide relation- ships between words such as synonymy and hy- ponymy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al., 2014</ref>), or using context based semantic similarity.</p><p>In this work, we use the model described in  where the au- thors use linear regression to compute normative scores for an input word w based on its similarity to a set of concept words s i .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r(w) = θ 0 + i θ i · sim(w, s i )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where, r(w) is the computed normative score for word w, θ 0 and θ i are regression coefficients and sim is similarity between the given word w and concept words s i .</p><p>The concept words can either be hand crafted suitably for the domain or chosen automati- cally from data. Similar to , we create training data by pos- ing queries on the Yahoo search engine from words of the aspell spell checker of which top 500 previews are collected from each query. From this corpus, the top 10000 most frequent words with atleast 3 characters were were used as con- cept words in extrapolation of all the norms. The linear regression model is trained using normative ratings for the manually annotated words by com- puting their similarity to the concept words. The similarity function sim is the cosine of binary con- text vectors with window size 1. The computed normatives are in the range</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[−1, 1].</formula><p>The psycholinguistic normatives used in this work are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Valence is the degree of positive or negative emotion evoked by the word. Arousal is a measure of excitement in the speaker. Valence and arousal combined are common indi- cators used to map emotions. Age of Acquisition refers to the average age at which the word is learned and it denotes sophistication of language use. Gender Ladenness is a measure of mascu- line or feminine association of a word. 10 fold Cross Validation tests are performed on the nor- mative scores predicted by the regression model given by equation 1. Correlation coefficients of the selected normatives with the manual annota- tions are as follows: Arousal (0.7), Valence (0.88), Age of Acquisition (0.86) and Gender Ladenness (0.8). The high correlations render confidence in the psycholinguistic models.</p><p>In our experiments, the normative scores are computed on content words from each dialog. We filter out all words other than nouns, verbs, adjec- tives and adverbs. Word level scores are aggre- gated at the dialog level using arithmetic mean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Linguistic inquiry and word counts (LIWC)</head><p>LIWC is a text processing application that pro- cesses raw text and outputs percentage of words from the text that belong to linguistic, affective, perceptual and other dimensions. It operates by maintaining a diverse set of dictionaries of words each belonging to a unique dimension. Input texts are processed word by word; each word is searched in the internal dictionaries and the corre- sponding counter is incremented if a word is found in that dictionary. Finally, percentage of words from the input text belonging to the different di- mensions are returned.</p><p>For our experiments, we treat each utterance in the movie as a unique document and obtain values for the LIWC metrics. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> lists the metrics used in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Character network analytics</head><p>In order to study representation of the different subgroups as major characters in movies, we con- struct a network of interaction between characters using which we compute importance measures for each character. From each movie script, we con- struct an undirected and unweighted graph where nodes represent characters. We place an edge e ab if two characters A and B interact at least once in the movie. For our experiments we assume interaction between A and B if there is at least one scene in which one speaks right after another. This graph creation method based on scene co- occurrence is similar to the approach used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beveridge and Shan, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We estimate different measures of a node's im- portance within the character network and use it as proxy for the character's importance. We employ two types of centralities: betweenness centrality, the number of shortest paths that go through the node, and degree centrality, which is the number of edges incident on a node. These centrality mea- surements have been previously used in the con-Psycholinguistic norms Valence, Arousal, Age of Acquisition, Gender Ladenness LIWC metrics Achievement, Religion, Death, Sexual, Swear   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>We study differences in various subgroups along multiple facets. We first report results on dif- ferences in character ratios from each subgroup since this has implications on employment and can have social-economic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Niven, 2006</ref>). We next use psycholinguistic normatives and LIWC metrics described in the previous section to study differences in character portrayal along the pri- mary markers: age, gender and race. We finally use the graph theoretic centrality measures to es- timate characters' importance and analyze differ- ences among the different subgroups.</p><p>Since we are interested in character level an- alytics, we treat all utterances from the charac- ter as a single document to compute the aggre- gate language metrics. We perform all our exper- iments using non-parametric statistical tests since the data fails to satisfy preconditions such as nor- mality and homoscedasticity required for paramet- ric tests such as ANOVA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Difference in relative frequency of subgroups</head><p>We first filter our characters with unknown gen- der/race/age leaving us with 6907 characters in to-  f: female and m: male; each cell gives frequency of character gender for that column and production member gender for that row, numbers in braces in- dicate row wise proportion of character gender tal. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> lists the number of characters and di- alogues from each gender. As noted in previous studies, the ratio is considerably skewed with male actors having nearly twice as many roles and dia- logues compared to female actors. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> lists relative frequency among male and female mem- bers of the production team. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the per- centage of actors belonging to different racial cat- egories in the corpus.</p><p>We perform chi-squared tests between character gender and gender of production team members who are most likely to influence characters gen- der: writers, directors and casting directors. Ta- ble 5 shows contingency tables with gender fre- quencies for each of these cases along with per- centages. Note we filter out nearly 100 movies for this test in which the gender of the produc- tion team members was unknown. Of the three tests we perform, character gender distributions for writer and director genders are significantly different from the overall character gender distri- bution (p &lt; 10 −10 and p &lt; 10 −4 respectively; α = 0.05). In particular, female writers and di- rectors appear to produce movies with relatively balanced gender proportions (still slightly skewed towards the male side) compared to male writers Studies report potential biases in actor employ- ment with age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lincoln and Allen, 2004</ref>), partic- ularly in female actors. To evaluate this, we plot histograms of age for male and female characters for each of the racial categories in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The distribution of age for each category appears ap- proximately normal, except for the nativeamer- ican and pacificislander character groups which have a small sample size. For most categories of race, the mode of the distribution for female actors appears to be at least five years less than the mode for male actors. To check for significance in this difference we conduct Mann-Whitney U tests on male and female age groups for each race with the resulting p-values shown in the figure. We ignore characters belonging to the pacificislander racial group since there are no female actors from this race in our corpus. The difference in age groups is significant in most categories with large sam- ple sizes, suggesting possible preferences towards casting younger people when casting female ac- tors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Character portrayal using language</head><p>To analyze differences in portrayal of subgroups, we compute psycholinguistic normatives and LIWC metrics as described before. For each of the metrics listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we conduct non- m <ref type="formula">(4894)</ref> f <ref type="formula">(</ref>   <ref type="table">6</ref>: Median values for male and female char- acters along with p values obtained by comparing the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test; high- lighted differences are significant at α = 0.05 parametric hypothesis tests to look for differences in samples from the subgroups. We treat the dif- ferent metrics independently, performing statisti- cal tests along each separately. We avoid statistical tests combining two or more factors since some of the resulting groups would be empty due to the skewed group sizes along race. We defer such analyses to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Gender</head><p>We perform Mann-Whitney U tests between male and female characters along the nine dimensions and the results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. In all of the cases, higher values imply higher degree of the corresponding dimension, except for valence in which higher values imply positive valence (at- tractiveness) and lower values imply negative va- lence (averseness). The difference between male and female characters are statistically significant along six of the nine dimensions. The results indicate slightly higher age of acquisition scores for male characters. Regarding gender ladenness, male characters appear to be closer to the mascu- line side than female characters on average, agree- ing with previous results.</p><p>Our results also indicate that female charac- ter utterances tend to be more positive in valence compared to male characters while male charac- ters seem to have higher percentage of words re- lated to achievement. In addition, male characters appear to be more frequent in using words related to death as well as swear words compared to fe- male characters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Race</head><p>To study differences in portrayal of the racial cate- gories, we perform Kruskal-Wallis test (a general- ization of Mann-Whitney U test for more than two groups) on each of the nine metrics with race as the independent variable. We found significant differ- ences in distribution of samples for gender laden- ness, sexuality, religion and swear words. For gen- der ladenness, caucasian and mixed race charac- ters have significantly higher medians than african and nativeamerican characters. In sexuality, latino and mixed race characters were found to have higher median than at least one other racial group with significance indicating a higher degree of sexualization in these characters. Eastasian char- acters were found to be significantly lower than medians of three other races (caucasian, african and mixed) in using words with religious conno- tations. In swear word usage, the only signifi- cant difference found is between caucasian and african characters with african characters using higher percentage of swear words. In all of the above cases, significance was tested at α = 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Age</head><p>To examine the relationship between age and the different metrics, we build separate linear regres- sion models with each dimension as the dependent variable and character age as the independent vari- able. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref> reports regression coefficients for age along with p values for each dimension. The β 1 (×10 −3 ) p-value age of acq.</p><p>3.9 &lt; 10 −10 arousal -1.1 &lt; 10 −10 gender -2.5 &lt; 10 −10 valence 0.078 0.7 sex -0.25 &lt; 10 −5 achieve 0.26 &lt; 10 −10 religion 0.12 0.001 death −0.039 0.2 swear -0.34 &lt; 10 −5 Gender ladenness also has a significant negative coefficient indicating that as age increases, the av- erage gender ladenness value decreases. Similar trends are observed for sexuality and swear word usage. Usage of words related to achievement and religion however, seem to increase with age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Character network analytics</head><p>To study differences in major roles assigned to the different subgroups, we compute two central- ity metrics from the character network graph con- structed for each movie: degree centrality mea- sures the number of unique characters that inter- act with a given character, betweenness centrality measures how much would the plot be disrupted if said character was to disappear completely, i.e., how important is a character to the overall plot. Similar to the language analyses from previous section, we test differences in these metrics along the three factors of gender, race and age. All statistical tests reported below are conducted at α = 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Gender</head><p>Male characters were found to have higher val- ues in the two metrics compared to female charac- ters but the differences were not statistically sig- nificant. Motivated by studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sapolsky et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Linz et al., 1984)</ref> which report interactions between genre and gender, we performed Mann- Whitney U tests between male and female char-acters given different genres. To avoid type I er- rors we corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Bonferroni correction. Significant dif- ferences were found only in horror movies where the median degree centrality for females (0.221) was higher than the median degree centrality of males (0.166). This is in agreement with prior studies which report female characters to have a more prominent presence in horror movies, par- ticularly as victims of violent scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Welsh and Brantford, 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Race</head><p>To examine differences in major roles across the racial categories, we perform Kruskal-Wallis tests similar to previous subsection. Significant differ- ences were found with both degree and between- ness centrality measures (p &lt; 0.001; α = 0.05).</p><p>Latino characters were found to have sig- nificantly lower degree centralities compared to caucasian and southasian races suggesting non- central roles in these characters. Caucasian characters were found to have median between- ness centralities significantly higher than at least one other race. Characters from the nativeam- erican race exhibit significantly lower medians in both degree and betweenness centralities than caucasian, african and mixed characters, which agrees with (Rosenthal, 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Age</head><p>We investigate the effects of age on importance of character roles by building a linear regression model on the two centralities with age as the inde- pendent variable. In both cases, age was found to be significant (p &lt; 0.001; α = 0.05). With degree centrality, the regression coefficient β was found to be equal to 0.003. In betweenness centrality, the regression coefficient was also positive, given by β = 8.41 × 10 −4 . Both these metrics indicate a positive correlation for character importance with age, i.e. as characters age, there is an increased interaction with other characters in the movie as well as higher prominence in the movie plot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We present a scalable automated analyses of dif- ferences in character portrayal along multiple fac- tors such as gender, race and age using word us- age, psycholinguistic and graph theoretic mea- sures. Several interesting patterns are revealed in the analysis. In particular, movies with fe- male writers and directors in the production team are observed to have balanced gender ratios in characters compared to male writers/directors. Across several races, female actors are found to be younger than male actors on average.</p><p>Female characters appear to be more positive in language use with fewer references to death and fewer swear words compared to male characters. Female characters also appear to be more promi- nent in horror movies compared to male charac- ters. Latino and mixed race characters appear to have higher usage of sexual words. Eastasian char- acters seem to use significantly fewer religious words. As characters aged, their word sophistica- tion seems to increase along with usage of words related to achievement and religion; there was also a significant reduction in word activation, usage of sexual and swear words as character age increases.</p><p>Future work includes expanding the analyses to non-English movies and combining the linguis- tic metrics with character networks. Specifically, character network edges can be weighted using the psycholinguistic metrics to analyze the emotional patterns in inter-character interactions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Histogram of age for actors belonging to different gender and racial categories with p-values on top; significant values at α = 0.05 are highlighted; *: no test performed since the female group is empty</figDesc></figure>
