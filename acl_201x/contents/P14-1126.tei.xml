			<abstract>
				<p>We present a novel approach for inducing unsupervised dependency parsers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. We train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by transferring cross-lingual knowledge from resource-rich language with entropy reg-ularization. Our method can be used as a purely monolingual dependency parser, requiring no human translations for the test data, thus making it applicable to a wide range of resource-poor languages. We perform experiments on three Data sets-Version 1.0 and version 2.0 of Google Universal Dependency Treebanks and Treebanks from CoNLL shared-tasks, across ten languages. We obtain state-of-the art performance of all the three data sets when compared with previously studied unsupervised and projected parsing systems.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, dependency parsing has gained universal interest due to its usefulness in a wide range of applications such as synonym gener- ation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shinyama et al., 2002</ref>), relation extrac- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nguyen et al., 2009</ref>) and machine trans- lation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Katz-Brown et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xie et al., 2011</ref>). Several supervised dependency parsing algorithms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nivre and Scholz, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McDonald et al., 2005a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McDonald et al., 2005b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McDonald and Pereira, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carreras, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Koo and Collins, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ma and Zhao, 2012;</ref>) have been proposed and achieved high pars- ing accuracies on several treebanks, due in large part to the availability of dependency treebanks in a number of languages ( ).</p><p>However, the manually annotated treebanks that these parsers rely on are highly expensive to cre- ate, in particular when we want to build treebanks for resource-poor languages. This led to a vast amount of research on unsupervised grammar in- duction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carroll and Charniak, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Klein and Manning, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Smith and Eisner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cohen and Smith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Spitkovsky et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blunsom and Cohn, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mareček and Straka, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Spitkovsky et al., 2013</ref>), which appears to be a natural solution to this problem, as unsupervised methods require only unannotated text for training parsers. Unfortunately, the unsupervised gram- mar induction systems' parsing accuracies often significantly fall behind those of supervised sys- tems ). Furthermore, from a practical standpoint, it is rarely the case that we are completely devoid of resources for most lan- guages.</p><p>In this paper, we consider a practically moti- vated scenario, in which we want to build statisti- cal parsers for resource-poor target languages, us- ing existing resources from a resource-rich source language (like English). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We assume that there are absolutely no labeled training data for the target language, but we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language and a sufficient amount of labeled training data to build an accurate parser for the resource-rich language. This scenario ap- pears similar to the setting in bilingual text pars- ing. However, most bilingual text parsing ap- proaches require bilingual treebanks -treebanks that have manually annotated tree structures on both sides of source and target languages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Smith and Smith, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burkett and Klein, 2008)</ref>, or have tree structures on the source side and trans- lated sentences in the target languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huang et al., 2009;</ref>. Obviously, bilingual treebanks are much more difficult to acquire than the resources required in our scenario, since the la- beled training data and the parallel text in our case are completely separated. What is more impor- tant is that most studies on bilingual text parsing assumed that the parser is applied only on bilin- gual text. But our goal is to develop a parser that can be used in completely monolingual setting for each target language of interest.</p><p>This scenario is applicable to a large set of lan- guages and many research studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hwa et al., 2005</ref>) have been made on it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ganchev et al. (2009)</ref> presented a parser projection approach via paral- lel text using the posterior regularization frame- work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Graca et al., 2007)</ref>.  proposed two parser transfer approaches between two different languages -one is directly trans- ferred parser from delexicalized parsers, and the other parser is transferred using constraint driven learning algorithm where constraints are drawn from parallel corpora. In that work, they demon- strate that even the directly transferred delexi- calized parser produces significantly higher ac- curacies than unsupervised parsers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cohen et al. (2011)</ref> proposed an approach for unsupervised dependency parsing with non-parallel multilingual guidance from one or more helper languages, in which parallel data is not used.</p><p>In this work, we propose a learning frame- work for transferring dependency grammars from a resource-rich language to resource-poor lan- guages via parallel text. We train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by maximizing a combination of likelihood on par- allel data and confidence on unlabeled data. Our work is based on the learning framework used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith and Eisner (2007)</ref>, which is originally de- signed for parser bootstrapping. We extend this learning framework so that it can be used to trans- fer cross-lingual knowledge between different lan- guages.</p><p>Throughout this paper, English is used as the source language and we evaluate our approach on ten target languages -Danish (da), Dutch (nl), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Italian (it), Korean (ko), Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es) and Swedish (sv). Our approach achieves significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art unsu- pervised and projected parsing systems across all the ten languages, and considerably bridges the  gap to fully supervised dependency parsing per- formance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our Approach</head><p>Dependency trees represent syntactic relationships through labeled directed edges between heads and their dependents. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows a dependency tree for the sentence, Economic news had little effect on financial markets, with the sen- tence's root-symbol as its root. The focus of this work is on building dependency parsers for target languages, assuming that an accurate English de- pendency parser and some parallel text between the two languages are available. Central to our ap- proach is a maximizing likelihood learning frame- work, in which we use an English parser and par- allel text to estimate the "transferring distribution" of the target language parsing model (See Section 2.2 for more details). Another advantage of the learning framework is that it combines both the likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unla- beled data, so that both parallel text and unlabeled data can be utilized in our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Edge-Factored Parsing Model</head><p>In this paper, we will use the following notation: x represents a generic input sentence, and y rep- resents a generic dependency tree. T(x) is used to denote the set of possible dependency trees for sentence x. The probabilistic model for de- pendency parsing defines a family of conditional probability p λ (y|x) over all y given sentence x, with a log-linear form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p λ (y|x) = 1 Z(x) exp j λ j F j (y, x)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where F j are feature functions, λ = (λ 1 , λ 2 , . . .) are parameters of the model, and Z(x) is a nor- malization factor, which is commonly referred to as the partition function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Z(x) = y∈T(x) exp j λ j F j (y, x)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A common strategy to make this parsing model ef- ficiently computable is to factor dependency trees into sets of edges:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F j (y, x) = e∈y f j (e, x).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>That is, dependency tree y is treated as a set of edges e and each feature function F j (y, x) is equal to the sum of all the features f j (e, x).</p><p>We denote the weight function of each edge e as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">w(e, x) = exp j λ j f j (e, x)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and the conditional probability p λ (y|x) has the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p λ (y|x) = 1 Z(x) e∈y w(e, x)<label>(5)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Model Training</head><p>One of the most common model training meth- ods for supervised dependency parser is Maxi- mum conditional likelihood estimation. For a su- pervised dependency parser with a set of train- ing data {(x i , y i )}, the logarithm of the likelihood (a.k.a. the log-likelihood) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L(λ) = i log p λ (y i |x i )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Maximum likelihood training chooses parameters such that the log-likelihood L(λ) is maximized. However, in our scenario we have no labeled training data for target languages but we have some parallel and unlabeled data plus an En- glish dependency parser. For the purpose of transferring cross-lingual information from the English parser via parallel text, we explore the model training method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith and Eisner (2007)</ref>, which presented a generalization of K function <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abney, 2004)</ref>, and related it to an- other semi-supervised learning technique, entropy regularization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jiao et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mann and McCallum, 2007</ref>). The objective K function to be minimized is actually the expected negative log- likelihood:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">K = − i y i ˜ p(y i |x i ) log p λ (y i |x i ) = i D(˜ p i ||p λ,i ) + H(˜ p i )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where˜pwhere˜ where˜p i (·)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">def = ˜ p(·|x i ) and p λ,i (·) def = p λ (·|x i ). ˜ p(y|x)</formula><p>is the "transferring distribution" that re- flects our uncertainty about the true labels, and we are trying to learn a parametric model p λ (y|x) by minimizing the K function.</p><p>In our scenario, we have a set of aligned par- allel data P = {x s i , x t i , a i } where a i is the word alignment for the pair of source-target sentences (x s i , x t i ), and a set of unlabeled sentences of the target language U = {x t i }. We also have a trained English parsing model p λ E (y|x). Then the K in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref> can be divided into two cases, accord- ing to whether x i belongs to parallel data set P or unlabeled data set U . For the unlabeled examples {x i ∈ U }, some previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abney, 2004</ref>)) simply use a uniform distribution over la- bels (e.g., parses), to reflect that the label is un- known. We follow the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith and Eisner (2007)</ref> and take the transferring distributioñdistributioñ p i to be the actual current belief p λ,i . The total contribution of the unsupervised examples to K then simplifies to</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">K U = x i ∈U H(p λ,i )</formula><p>, which may be regarded as the entropy item used to constrain the model's uncertainty H to be low, as presented in the work on entropy regularization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jiao et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mann and McCallum, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>But how can we define the transferring distri- bution for the parallel examples {x t i ∈ P }? We define the transferring distribution by defining the transferring weight utilizing the English parsing model p λ E (y|x) via parallel data with word align- ments:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">˜ w(e t , x t i ) = w E (e s , x s i ), if e t align −→ e s w E (e t delex , x s i ), otherwise (8) where w E (·, ·)</formula><p>is the weight function of the En- glish parsing model p λ E (y|x), and e t delex is the delexicalized form 2 of the edge e t . From the definition of the transferring weight, we can see that, if an edge e t of the target language sentence x t i is aligned to an edge e s of the English sen- tence x s i , we transfer the weight of edge e t to the corresponding weight of edge e s in the En- glish parsing model p λ E (y|x). If the edge e t is not aligned to any edges of the English sen- tence x s i , we reduce the edge e t to the delexical- ized form and calculate the transferring weight in the English parsing model. There are two advan-tages for this definition of the transferring weight. First, by transferring the weight function to the corresponding weight in the well-developed En- glish parsing model, we can project syntactic in- formation across language boundaries. <ref type="bibr">Second, McDonald et al. (2011)</ref> demonstrates that parsers with only delexicalized features produce consid- erably high parsing performance. By reducing unaligned edges to their delexicalized forms, we can still use those delexicalized features, such as part-of-speech tags, for those unaligned edges, and can address problem that automatically generated word alignments include errors.</p><p>From the definition of transferring weight in equation <ref type="formula">(8)</ref>, the transferring distribution can be defined in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">˜ p(y|x) = 1 ˜ Z(x) e∈y˜w e∈y˜ e∈y˜w(e, x)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where˜Z where˜ where˜Z</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(x) = y e∈y˜w e∈y˜ e∈y˜w(e, x)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Due to the normalizing factor˜Zfactor˜ factor˜Z(x), the transfer- ring distribution is a valid one.</p><p>We introduce a multiplier γ as a trade-off be- tween the two contributions (parallel and unsuper- vised) of the objective function K, and the final objective function K ′ has the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">K ′ = − x i ∈P y i ˜ p(y i |x i ) log p λ (y i |x i ) + γ x i ∈U H(p λ,i ) = K P + γK U<label>(11)</label></formula><p>K P and K U are the contributions of the parallel and unsupervised data, respectively. One may re- gard γ as a Lagrange multiplier that is used to constrain the parser's uncertainty H to be low, as presented in several studies on entropy regulariza- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brand, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grandvalet and Bengio, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jiao et al., 2006</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Algorithms and Complexity for Model Training</head><p>To train our parsing model, we need to find out the parameters λ that minimize the objective function K ′ in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>. This optimization problem is typically solved using quasi-Newton numeri- cal methods such as L-BFGS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nash and Nocedal, 1991)</ref>, which requires efficient calculation of the objective function and the gradient of the objec- tive function. The first item (K P ) of the K ′ function in equa- tion (11) can be rewritten in the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K P = − x i ∈P y i ˜ p(y i |x i ) e∈y i log w(e, x i ) − log Z(x i )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>and according to equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> the gradient of K P can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∂K P ∂λ j = x i ∈P ∂ ˜ p(y i |x i ) log p λ (y i |x i ) ∂λ j = x i ∈P y i ˜ p(y i |x i ) e∈y i f j (e, x i ) − y i p λ (y i |x i ) e∈y i f j (e, x i )<label>(13)</label></formula><p>According to equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(9)</ref>, ˜ p(y|x) can also be factored into the multiplication of the weight of each edge, so both K P and its gradient can be calculated by running the O(n 3 ) inside-outside al- gorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Paskin, 2001</ref>) for projec- tive parsing. For non-projective parsing, the anal- ogy to the inside algorithm is the O(n 3 ) matrix- tree algorithm based on Kirchhoff's Matrix-Tree Theorem, which is dominated asymptotically by a matrix determinant ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Koo et al., 2007;</ref>. The gradient of a determinant may be computed by matrix inversion, so evaluating the gradient again has the same O(n 3 ) complexity as evaluating the function. The second item (K U ) of the K ′ function in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> is the Shannon entropy of the pos- terior distribution over parsing trees, and can be written into the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">K U = − x i ∈U y i p λ (y i |x i ) e∈y i log w(e, x i ) − log Z(x i )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>and the gradient of K U is in the following:  Similar with the calculation of K P , K U can also be computed by running the inside-outside algo- rithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Paskin, 2001</ref>) for projective parsing. For the gradient of K U , both the two multipliers of the second item in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> can be computed using the same inside-outside algo- rithm. For the first item in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>, an O(n 3 ) dynamic programming algorithm that is closely related to the forward-backward algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mann and McCallum, 2007)</ref> for the entropy regularized CRF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jiao et al., 2006</ref>) can be used for projective parsing.

The paral- lel corpus was preprocessed in standard ways, se- lecting sentences with the length in the range from 3 to 100. Then we run GIZA++ with the default setting to generate word alignments in both direc- tions. We then make the intersection of the word alignments of two directions to generate one-to- one alignments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Part-of-Speech Tagging</head><p>Several features in our parsing model involve part- of-speech (POS) tags of the input sentences. The set of POS tags needs to be consistent across lan- guages and treebanks. For this reason we use the universal POS tag set of . This set consists of the following 12 coarse- grained tags: NOUN (nouns), VERB (verbs), ADJ (adjectives), ADV (adverbs), PRON (pronouns), DET (determiners), ADP (prepositions or postpo- sitions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), PUNC (punctuation marks) and X (a catch-all for other categories such as abbrevi- ations or foreign words  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: UAS for two versions of our approach, to- gether with baseline and oracle systems on Google Universal Treebanks version 2.0.

In our experi- ments, we train a Stanford POS Tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>) for each language. The labeled train- ing data for each POS tagger are extracted from the training portion of each Treebanks. The aver- age tagging accuracy is around 95%.</p><p>Undoubtedly, we are primarily interested in ap- plying our approach to build statistical parsers for resource-poor target languages without any knowledge. For the purpose of evaluation of our approach and comparison with previous work, we need to exploit the gold POS tags to train the POS taggers. As part-of-speech tags are also a form of syntactic analysis, this assumption weakens the applicability of our approach. Fortunately, some recently proposed POS taggers, such as the POS tagger of , rely only on la- beled training data for English and the same kind of parallel text in our approach. In practice we can use this kind of POS taggers to predict POS tags, whose tagging accuracy is around 85%.</p></div>

We train our parsing model with different numbers of parallel sentences to analyze the influence of the amount of parallel data on the parsing performance of our ap- proach. The parallel data sets contain 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 parallel sentences, respectively. We randomly extract parallel sen- tences from each corpora, and smaller data sets are subsets of larger ones. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the number of tokens in the parallel data used in the experi- ments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">System performance and comparison on Google Universal Treebanks</head><p>For the comparison of parsing performance, we run experiments on the following systems: OR: the supervised first-order projective depen- dency parsing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(McDonald et al., 2005a</ref>), trained on the original treebanks with maximum likelihood estimation (equation 6).</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">DTP</formula><p>One may regard this system as an oracle of transfer parsing.</p><p>Parsing accuracy is measured with unlabeled at- tachment score (UAS): the percentage of words with the correct head. <ref type="table">Table 3 and Table 4</ref> shows the parsing results of our approach, together with the results of the base- line systems and the oracle, on version 1.0 and ver- sion 2.0 of Google Universal Treebanks, respec- tively. Our approaches significantly outperform all the baseline systems across all the seven target lan- guages. For the results on Google Universal Tree- banks version 1.0, the improvement on average over the projected transfer paper (PTP †) is 3.96% and up to 6.22% for Korean and 4.80% for Ger- man. For the other three languages, the improve- ments are remarkable, too -2.33% for French, 3.03% for Spanish and 3.40% for Swedish. By adding entropy regularization from unlabeled data, our full model achieves average improvement of 0.29% over the "-U" setting. Moreover, our ap- proach considerably bridges the gap to fully super- vised dependency parsers, whose average UAS is 84.67%. For the results on treebanks version 2.0, we can get similar observation and draw the same conclusion. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> illustrates the UAS of our approach trained on different amounts of parallel data, together with the results of the projected transfer parser re-implemented by us (PTP †). We run two ver- sions of our approach for each of the parallel data sets, one with unlabeled data (+U) and the other without them (-U). From table 5 we can get three observations. First, even the parsers trained with only 500 parallel sentences achieve considerably high parsing accuracies (average 70.10% for ver- sion 1.0 and 71.59% for version 2.0). This demon- strates that our approach does not rely on a large amount of parallel data. Second, when gradually increasing the amount of parallel data, the parsing performance continues improving. Third, entropy regularization with unlabeled data makes mod- est improvement on parsing performance over the parsers without unlabeled data. This proves the ef- fectiveness of the entropy regularization from un- labeled data.</p></div>

By presenting a model training framework, our approach can uti- lize parallel text to estimate transferring distribu- tion with the help of a well-developed resource- rich language dependency parser, and use unla- beled data as entropy regularization. The exper- imental results on three data sets across ten target languages show that our approach achieves signif- icant improvement over previous studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Economic news had little effect on financial markets Root</figDesc></figure>
