				<p>Distant supervision is a widely applied approach to automatic training of relation extraction systems and has the advantage that it can generate large amounts of labelled data with minimal effort. However , this data may contain errors and consequently systems trained using distant supervision tend not to perform as well as those based on manually labelled data. This work proposes a novel method for detecting potential false negative training examples using a knowledge inference method. Results show that our approach improves the performance of relation extraction systems trained using distantly supervised data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Distantly supervised relation extraction relies on automatically labelled data generated using infor- mation from a knowledge base. A sentence is annotated as a positive example if it contains a pair of entities that are related in the knowledge base. Negative training data is often generated us- ing a closed world assumption: pairs of entities not listed in the knowledge base are assumed to be un- related and sentences containing them considered to be negative training examples. However this as- sumption is violated when the knowledge base is incomplete which can lead to sentences containing instances of relations being wrongly annotated as negative examples.</p><p>We propose a method to improve the quality of distantly supervised data by identifying possible wrongly annotated negative instances. Our pro- posed method includes a version of the Path Rank- ing Algorithm (PRA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lao and Cohen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lao et al., 2011</ref>) which infers relation paths by com- bining random walks though a knowledge base.</p><p>We use this knowledge inference to detect possi- ble false negatives (or at least entity pairs closely connected to a target relation) in automatically la- belled training data and show that their removal can improve relation extraction performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Distant supervision is widely used to train relation extraction systems with Freebase and Wikipedia commonly being used as knowledge bases, e.g. ( <ref type="bibr">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Riedel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Krause et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Min et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ritter et al., 2013)</ref>. The main advantage is its ability to automatically generate large amounts of training data automatically. On the other hand, this automatically labelled data is noisy and usu- ally generates lower performance than approaches trained using manually labelled data. A range of filtering approaches have been applied to address this problem including multi-class SVM (Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011) and Multi-Instance learn- ing methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Riedel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Surdeanu et al., 2012</ref>). These approaches take into account the fact that entities might occur in different relations at the same time and may not necessarily express the target relation. Other approaches focus directly on the noise in the data. For instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Takamatsu et al. (2012)</ref> use a generative model to predict incorrect data while <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Intxaurrondo et al. (2013)</ref> use a range of heuristics including PMI to remove noise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Augenstein et al. (2014)</ref> apply techniques to detect highly ambiguous entity pairs and discard them from their labelled training set.</p><p>This work proposes a novel approach to the problem by applying an inference learning method to identify potential false negatives in distantly la- belled data. Our method makes use of a modi- fied version of PRA to learn relation paths from a knowledge base and uses this information to iden- tify false negatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>273</head><p>We chose to apply our approach to relation ex- traction tasks from the biomedical domain since this has proved to be an important problem within these documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Jensen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hahn et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cohen and Hunter, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Roller and Stevenson, 2014</ref>). In addition, the first application of dis- tant supervision was to biomedical journal articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Craven and Kumlien, 1999</ref>). In addition, the most widely used knowledge source in this domain, the UMLS Metathesaurus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bodenreider, 2004)</ref>, is an ideal resource to apply inference learning given its rich structure.</p><p>We develop classifiers to identify relations found in two subsets of UMLS: the National Drug File-Reference Terminology (ND-FRT) and the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCI). A cor- pus of approximately 1,000,000 publications is used to create the distantly supervised training data. The corpus contains abstracts published be- tween 1990 and 2001 annotated with UMLS con- cepts using MetaMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aronson and Lang, 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Distantly labelled data</head><p>Distant supervision is carried out for a target UMLS relation by identifying instance pairs and using them to create a set of positive instance pairs. Any pairs which also occur as an instance pair of another UMLS relation are removed from this set. A set of negative instance pairs is then created by forming new combinations that do not occur within the positive instance pairs. Sentences containing a positive or negative instance pair are then extracted to generate positive and negative training examples for the relation. These candi- date sentences are then stemmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Porter, 1997)</ref> and PoS tagged <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Charniak and Johnson, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The sets of positive and negative training exam- ples are then filtered to remove sentences that meet any of the following criteria: contain the same positive pair more than once; contain both a posi- tive and negative pair; more than 5 words between the two elements of the instance pair; contain very common instance pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">PRA-Reduction</head><p>PRA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lao and Cohen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lao et al., 2011</ref>) is an algorithm that infers new relation instances from knowledge bases. By considering a knowl- edge base as a graph, where nodes are connected through typed relations, it performs random walks over it and finds bounded-length relation paths that connect graph nodes. These paths are used as features in a logistic regression model, which is meant to predict new relations in the graph. Al- though initially conceived as an algorithm to dis- cover new links in the knowledge base, PRA can also be used to learn relevant relation paths for any given relation. For instance, if x and y are related via sibling relation, the model trained by PRA would learn that the relation path parent(x,a) ∧ parent(a,y) 1 is highly relevant, as siblings share the same parents.</p><p>Knowledge graphs were extracted from the ND- FRT and NCI vocabularies generating approxi- mately 200, 000 related instance pairs for ND- FRT and 400, 000 for NCI. PRA is then run on both graphs in order to learn paths for each tar- get relation. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows examples of the paths PRA generated for the relation biological-process- involves-gene-product together with their weights. We only make use of relation paths with positive weights generated by PRA.</p><p>path weight gene-encodes-gene-product(x,a) ∧ gene- plays-role-in-process(a,y)</p><p>10.53</p><p>isa(x,a) ∧ biological-process-involves-gene- product(a,y) 6.17</p><p>isa(x,a) ∧ biological-process-involves-gene- product(a,y) 2.80</p><p>gene-encodes-gene-product(x,a) ∧ gene- plays-role-in-process(a,b) ∧ isa(b,y) -0.06 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Example PRA-induced paths and weights for the NCI relation biological-process-involves- gene-product.</p><p>The paths induced by PRA are used to iden- tify potential false negatives in the negative train- ing examples (Section 3.1). Each negative training example is examined to check whether the entity pair is related in UMLS by following any of the relation paths extracted by PRA for the relevant target relation. Examples containing related en- tity pairs are assumed to be false negatives, since the relation can be inferred from the knowledge base, and removed from the set of negatives train- ing examples. For instance, using the path in the top row of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, sentences containing the enti- ties x and y would be removed if the path gene- encodes-gene-product(x,a) ∧ gene-plays-role-in- process(a,y) could be identified within UMLS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluation</head><p>Relation Extraction system: The MultiR system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoffmann et al., 2010</ref>) with features described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Surdeanu et al. (2011)</ref> was used for the experi- ments. Datasets: Three datasets were created to train MultiR and evaluate performance. The first (Un- filtered) uses the data obtained using distant su- pervision (Section 3.1) without removing any ex- amples identified by PRA. The overall ratio of positive to negative sentences in this dataset was 1:5.1. However, this changes to 1:2.3 after remov- ing examples identified by PRA. Consequently the bias in the distantly supervised data was adjusted to 1:2 to increase comparability across configura- tions. Reducing bias was also found to increase re- lation extraction performance, producing a strong baseline. The PRA-reduced dataset is created by applying PRA reduction (Section 3.2) to the Un- filtered dataset to remove a portion of the nega- tive training examples. Removing these examples produces a dataset that is smaller than Unfiltered and with a different bias. Changing the bias of the training data can influence the classification re- sults. Consequently the Random-reduced dataset was created by removing randomly selected nega- tive examples from Unfiltered to produce a dataset with the same size and bias as PRA-reduced. The Random-reduced dataset is used to show that ran- domly removing negative instances leads to lower results than removing those suggested by PRA.</p><p>Evaluation: Two approaches were used to eval- uate performance.</p><p>The Held-out datasets consist of the Unfiltered, PRA-reduced and Random-reduced data sets. The set of entity pairs obtained from the knowledge base is split into four parts and a process similar to 4-fold cross validation applied. In each fold the automatically labelled sentences obtained from the pairs in 3 of the quarters are used as training data and sentences obtained from the remaining quarter used for testing.</p><p>The Manually labelled dataset contains 400 examples of the relation may-prevent and 400 of may-treat which were manually labelled by two annotators who were medical experts. Both rela- tions are taken from the ND-FRT subset of UMLS. Each annotator was asked to label every sentence and then re-examine cases where there was dis- agreement. This process lead to inter-annotator agreement of 95.5% for may-treat and 97.3% for may-prevent. The annotated data set is publicly available 2 . Any sentences in the training data con- taining an entity pair that occurs within the man- ually labelled dataset are removed. Although this dataset is smaller than the held-out dataset, its an- notations are more reliable and it is therefore likely to be a more accurate indicator of performance ac- curacy. This dataset is more balanced than the held-out data with a ratio of 1:1.3 for may-treat and 1:1.8 for may-prevent.</p><p>Evaluation metric: Our experiments use en- tity level evaluation since this is the most appropri- ate approach to determine suitability for database population. Precision and recall are computed based on the proportion of entity pairs identified. For the held-out data the set of correct entity pairs are those which occur in sentences labeled as pos- itive examples of the relation and which are also listed as being related in UMLS. For the manually labelled data it is simply the set of entity pairs that occur in positive examples of the relation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the results obtained using the held- out data. Overall results, averaged across all re- lations with maximum recall, are shown in the top portion of the table and indicate that applying PRA improves performance. Although the highest pre- cision is obtained using the Unfiltered classifier, the PRA-reduced classifier leads to the best recall and F1. Performance of the Random-reduced clas- sifier indicates that the improvement is not simply due to a change in the bias in the data but that the examples it contains lead to an improved model. The lower part of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows results for each relation. The PRA-reduced classifier produces the best results for the majority of relations and always increases recall compared to Unfiltered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Held-out data</head><p>It is perhaps surprising that removing false neg- atives from the training data leads to an increase in recall, rather than precision. False negatives cause the classifier to generate an overly restrictive model of the relation and to predict positive ex- amples of a relation as negative. Removing them leads to a less constrained model and higher recall.</p><p>There are two relations where there is also an in- crease in precision (contraindicating-class-of and mechanism-of-action-of ) and these are also the ones for which the fewest training examples are </p><note type="other">-reduced PRA-reduced Prec.</note><p>Rec.      available. The classifier has access to such a lim- ited amount of data for these relations that remov- ing the false negatives identified by PRA allows it to learn a more accurate model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref> presents a precision/recall curve com- puted using MultiR's output probabilities. Results for the PRA-reduced and the Random-reduced classifiers show that reducing the amount of nega- tive training data increases recall. However, using PRA-reduced generally leads to higher precision, indicating that PRA is able to identify suitable in- stances for removal from the training set. The Un- filtered classifier produces good results but preci- sion and recall are lower than PRA-reduced. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows results of evaluation on the more reliable manually labelled data set. The best over- all performance is once again obtained using the PRA-reduced classifier. There is an increase in re- call for both relations and a slight increase in pre- cision for may treat. Performance of the Random- reduced classifier also improves due to an increas- ing recall but remains below PRA-reduced. Per- formance of the Random-reduced classifier is also better than Unfiltered, with the overall improve- ment largely resulting from increased recall, but below PRA-reduced. These results confirm that re- moving examples identified by PRA improves the quality of training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Manually labelled</head><p>Further analysis indicated that the PRA-reduced classifier produces the fewest false negatives in its predictions on the manually annotated dataset. It incorrectly labels 82 entity pairs (45 may-treat, 37 may-prevent) as negative while <ref type="bibr">Unfiltered predicts 120 (73, 47) and Random-reduced 114 (69, 45)</ref>. This supports our initial hypothesis that remov- ing potential false negatives from training data im- proves classifier predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This paper proposes a novel approach to identify- ing incorrectly labelled instances generated using distant supervision. Our method applies an infer- ence learning method to detect and discard pos- sible false negatives from the training data. We show that our method improves performance for a range of relations in the biomedical domain by making use of information from UMLS.</p><p>In future we would like to explore alternative methods for selecting PRA relation paths to iden- tify false negatives. Furthermore we would like to examine the PRA-reduced data in more detail. We would like to find which kind of entity pairs are detected by our proposed method and whether the reduced data can also be used to extend the positive training data. We would also like to ap- ply the approach to other domains and alternative knowledge bases. Finally it would be interesting to compare our approach to other state of the art re- lation extraction systems for distant supervision or biased-SVM approaches such as <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. (2003)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>F1</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
