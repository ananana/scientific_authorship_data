				<p>We present an approach for learning context-dependent semantic parsers to identify and interpret time expressions. We use a Combinatory Categorial Grammar to construct compositional meaning representations, while considering contex-tual cues, such as the document creation time and the tense of the governing verb, to compute the final time values. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems, with error reductions of 13% to 21% in end-to-end performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Time expressions present a number of challenges for language understanding systems. They have rich, compositional structure (e.g., "2nd Friday of July"), can be easily confused with non-temporal phrases (e.g., the word "May" can be a month name or a verb), and can vary in meaning in dif- ferent linguistic contexts (e.g., the word "Friday" refers to different dates in the sentences "We met on Friday" and "We will meet on Friday"). Recov- ering the meaning of time expressions is therefore challenging, but provides opportunities to study context-dependent language use. In this paper, we present the first context-dependent semantic pars- ing approach for learning to identify and interpret time expressions, addressing all three challenges.</p><p>Existing state-of-the-art methods use hand- engineered rules for reasoning about time expres- sions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2013)</ref>. This includes both detection, identifying a phrase as a time ex- pression, and resolution, mapping such a phrase into a standardized time value. While rule-based approaches provide a natural way to express ex- pert knowledge, it is relatively difficult to en- * Work conducted at the University of <ref type="bibr">Washington.</ref> code preferences between similar competing hy- potheses and provide prediction confidence. Re- cently, methods for learning probabilistic seman- tic parsers have been shown to address such limi- tations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angeli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angeli and Uszkoreit, 2013)</ref>. However, these approaches do not account for any surrounding linguistic context and were mainly evaluated with gold standard mentions.</p><p>We propose to use a context-dependent se- mantic parser for both detection and resolution of time expressions. For both tasks, we make use of a hand-engineered Combinatory Catego- rial Grammar (CCG) to construct a set of mean- ing representations that identify the time being described. For example, this grammar maps the phrase "2nd Friday of July" to the meaning repre- sentation intersect(nth(2 , friday), july), which encodes the set of all such days. Detection is then performed with a binary classifier to prune the set of text spans that can be parsed with the gram- mar (e.g., to tell that "born in 2000" has a time expression but "a 2000 piece puzzle" does not). For resolution, we consider mentions sequentially and use a log-linear model to select the most likely meaning for each. This choice depends on contex- tual cues such as previous time expressions and the tense of the governing verb (e.g., as required to correctly resolve cases like "We should meet on the 2nd Friday of July").</p><p>Such an approach provides a good balance be- tween hand engineering and learning. For the rel- atively closed-class time expressions, we demon- strate that it is possible to engineer a high quality CCG lexicon. We take a data-driven approach for grammar design, preferring a grammar with high coverage even if it results in parsing ambiguities.</p><p>We then learn a model to accurately select between competing parses and incorporate signals from the surrounding context, both more difficult to model with deterministic rules.</p><p>For both problems, we learn from TimeML an-notations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pustejovsky et al., 2005</ref>), which mark mentions and the specific times they reference. Training the detector is a supervised learning problem, but resolution is more challenging, re- quiring us to reason about latent parsing and context-dependent decisions. We evaluate performance in two domains: the TempEval-3 corpus of newswire text <ref type="bibr">(Uzzaman et al., 2013</ref>) and the WikiWars corpus of Wikipedia history articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mazur and Dale, 2010)</ref>. On these benchmark datasets, we present new state-of-the- art results, with error reductions of up to 28% for the detection task and 21% for the end-to-end task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Formal Overview</head><p>Time Expressions We follow the TIMEX3 stan- dard ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pustejovsky et al., 2005</ref>) for defining time expressions within documents. Let a document D = w 1 , . . . , w n be a sequence of n words w i and a mention m = (i, j) indicate start and end indices for a phrase w i , . . . , w j in D. Define a time expression e = (t, v) to include both a temporal type t and value v. 1 The temporal type t ∈ {Date, Time, Duration, Set} can take one of four possible values, indicating if the expression e is a date (e.g., "January 10, 2014"), time (e.g., "11:59 pm"), duration (e.g., "6 months"), or set (e.g., "every year"). The value v is an extension of the ISO 8601 standard, which encodes the time that mention m refers to in the context provided by document D. For example, in a document written on Tuesday, January 7, 2014, "Friday," "three days later," and "January 10th" would all resolve to the value 2014-01-10. The time values are similarly defined for a wide range of expressions, such as underspecified dates (e.g., XXXX-01-10 for "Ja- nunary 10th" when the year is not inferable from context) and durations (P2D for "two days").</p><p>Tasks Our goal is to find all time expressions in an input document. We divide the problem into two parts: detection and resolution. The detection problem is to take an input document D and output a mention set M = {m i | i = 1 . . . n} of phrases in D that describe time expressions. The resolu- tion problem (often also called normalization) is, given a document D and a set of mentions M , to <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Time expressions also have optional modifier values for non-TIMEX properties (e.g., the modifier would contain EARLY for the phrase "early march"). We do recover these modifiers but omit them from the discussion since they are not part of the official evaluation metrics. map each m ∈ M to the referred time expression e. This paper addresses both of these tasks.</p><p>Approach We learn separate, but related, mod- els for detection and resolution. For both tasks, we define the space of possible compositional mean- ing representations Z, where each z ∈ Z defines a unique time expression e. We use a log-linear CCG <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Steedman, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clark and Curran, 2007)</ref> to rank possible meanings z ∈ Z for each men- tion m in a document D, as described in Sec- tion 4. Both detection (Section 5) and resolution (Section 6) rely on the semantic parser to identify likely mentions and resolve them within context. For learning we assume access to TimeML data containing documents labeled with time expres- sions. Each document D has a set {(m i , e i )|i = 1 . . . n}, where each mention m i marks a phrase that resolves to the time expression e i .</p><p>Evaluation We evaluate performance (Sec- tion 8) for both newswire text and Wikipedia articles.</p><p>We compare to the state-of-the-art systems for end-to-end resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2013)</ref> and resolution given gold men- tions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bethard, 2013b)</ref>, both of which do not use any machine learning techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Representing Time</head><p>We use simply typed lambda calculus to represent time expressions. Our representation draws heav- ily from the representation proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angeli et al. (2012)</ref>, who introduced semantic parsing for this task. There are five primitive types: duration d, sequence s, range r, approximate reference a, and numeral n, as described below. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists the available constants for each type.</p><p>Duration A period of time. Each duration is a multiple of one of a closed set of possible base durations (e.g., hour, day, and quarter), which we refer to as its granularity. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> includes the complete set of base durations used.</p><p>Range A specific interval of time, following an interval-based theory of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen, 1981)</ref>. The interval length is one of the base durations, which is the granularity of the range. Given two ranges R and R , we say that R ⊆ R if the endpoints of R lie on or within R .</p><p>Sequence A set of ranges with identical granu- larity. The granularity of the sequence is that of its members. For example, thursday, which has a Type Primitive Constants Duration second , minute, hour , timeofday, day, month, season, quarter , weekend , week , year , decade, century , temp d Sequence monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday, january, february, march, april , may, june, july, august, september , october , november , december , winter , spring, summer , fall , night, morning, afternoon, evening Range ref time Approximate reference present, future, past, unknown <ref type="bibr">1 , 2 , 3 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001</ref> , . . . day granularity, denotes the set of all day-granular ranges enclosing specific Thursdays. Given a range R and sequence S, we say that R ∈ S if R is a member of S. Given two sequences S and S we say that S ⊆ S if R ∈ S implies R ∈ S .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numeral</head><p>Approximate Reference An approximate time relative to the reference time. For example, past and future. To handle mentions such as "a while," we add the constant unknown.</p><p>Numeral An integer, for example, 5 or 1990 . Numerals are used to denote specific ranges, such as the year 2001, or to modify a duration's length.</p><p>Functions We also allow for functional types, for example s, r is assigned to a function that maps from sequences to ranges. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> lists all supported functions with example mentions.</p><p>Context Dependent Constants To mark places where context-dependent choices will need to be made during resolution, we use two placeholder constants. First, ref time denotes the mention ref- erence time, which is later set to either the docu- ment time or a previously resolved mention. Sec- ond, temp d is used in the shift function to deter- mine its return granularity, as described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, and is later replaced with the granularity of either the first or second argument of the enclosing shift function. Section 4.3 describes how these deci- sions are made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Parsing Time Expressions</head><p>We define a three-step derivation to resolve men- tions to their TIMEX3 value. First, we use a CCG to generate an initial logical form for the mention. Next, we apply a set of operations that modify the one week ago <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: A CCG parse tree for the mention "one week ago." The tree includes forward (&gt;) and backward (&lt;) application, as well as two type-shifting operations initial logical form, as appropriate for its context. Finally, the logical form is resolved to a TIMEX3 value using a deterministic process.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C N N P \N P 1 week λx.shift(ref time, −1 × x, temp d ) N/N λx.1 × x &gt; N 1 × week N P 1 × week &lt; N P shift(ref time, −1 × 1 × week , temp d )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Combinatory Categorial Grammars</head><p>CCG is a linguistically motivated categorial for- malism for modeling a wide range of language phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Steedman, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Steedman, 2000)</ref>. A CCG is defined by a lexicon and a set of combina- tors. The lexicon pairs words with categories and the combinators define how to combine categories to create complete parse trees.</p><p>For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a CCG parse tree for the phrase "one week ago." The parse tree is read top to bottom, starting from assigning cate- gories to words using the lexicon. The lexical en- try ago N P \N P : λx.shift(ref time, −1 × x, temp d ) for the word "ago" pairs it with a cate- gory that has syntactic type N P \N P and seman- tics λx.shift(ref time, −1 × x, temp d ). Each intermediate parse node is then constructed by ap- plying one of a small set of binary or unary opera- tions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Steedman, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Steedman, 2000</ref>), which modify both the syntax and semantics. We use backward (&lt;) and forward (&gt;) application and several unary type-shifting rules to handle number combinations. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> the cate- gory of the span "one week" is combined with the category of "ago" using backward application (&lt;). Parsing concludes with a logical form representing the meaning of the complete mention.</p><p>Hand Engineered Lexicon To parse time ex- pressions, we use a CCG lexicon that includes 287 manually designed entries, along with automati- cally generated entries such as numbers and com- mon formats of dates and times. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows example entries from our lexicon.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Context-dependent Operations</head><p>To correctly resolve mentions to TIMEX3 val- ues, the system must account for contextual in- formation from various sources, including previ- ous mentions in the document, the document cre- ation time, and the sentence containing the men- tion. We consider three types of context opera- tions, each takes as input a logical form z , mod- ifies it and returns a new logical form z. Each context-dependent parse y specifies one operator of each type, which are applied to the logical form constructed by the CCG grammar, to produce the final, context-dependent logical form LF(y).</p><p>Reference Time Resolution The logical con- stant ref time is replaced by either dct, repre- senting the document creation time, or last range, the last r-typed mention resolved in the document. For example, consider the mention "the follow- ing year", which is represented using the logical form next(seq(year ), ref time). Within the sen- tence "1998 was colder than the following year", the resolution of "the following year" depends on the previous mention "1998". In contrast, in "The following year will be warmer", its resolution de- pends on the document creation time.</p><p>Directionality Resolution If z is s-typed we modify it to nearest forward (z , ref time), nearest backward (z , ref time), or z . For ex- ample, given the sentence ". . . will be launched in april", the mention "april", and its logi- cal form april , we would like to resolve it to the coming April, and therefore modify it to nearest forward (april , ref time).</p><p>Shifting Granularity Every occurrence of the logical constant temp d , which is used as an ar- gument to the function shift (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>), is re- placed with the granularity of either the first argu- ment, the origin of the shift, or the second argu- ment, the delta of the shift. This determines the final granularity of the output. For example, if the reference time is 2002-01, the mention "two years earlier" would resolve to either a month (since the reference time is of month granularity) or a year (since the delta is of year granularity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Resolving Logical Forms</head><p>For a context-dependent parse y, we compute the TIMEX3 value TM(y) from the logical form z = LF(y) with a deterministic step that performs a single traversal of z. Each primitive logical con- stant from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> contributes to setting part of the TIMEX3 value (for example, specifying the day of the week) and the functional constants in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> dictate transformations on the TIMEX3 values (for example, shifting forward or backward in time). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Detection</head><p>The detection problem is to take an input docu- ment D and output a mention set M = {m i | i = 1, . . . , n}, where each mention m i indexes a spe- cific phrase in D that delimits a time expression.</p><p>Algorithm The detection algorithm considers all phrases that our CCG grammar Λ (Section 4) can parse, uses a learned classifier to further filter this set, and finally resolves conflicts between any overlapping predictions. We use a CKY algorithm to efficiently determine which phrases the CCG grammar can parse and only allow logical forms for which there exists some context in which they would produce a valid time expression, e.g. rul- ing out intersect(monday, tuesday). Finally, we build the set M of non-overlapping mentions us- ing a step similar to non-maximum suppression: the mentions are sorted by length (longest first) and iteratively added to M , as long as they do not overlap with any mention already in M .</p><p>Filtering Model Given a mention m, its docu- ment D, a feature function φ, the CCG lexicon Λ, and feature weights θ, we use a logistic regression model to define the probability distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P (t|m, D; Λ, θ) = e θ·φ(m,D,Λ) 1 + e θ·φ(m,D,Λ)</formula><p>where t indicates whether m is a time expression.</p><p>Features We use three types of indicator fea- tures that test properties of the words in and around the potential mention m.</p><p>Context tokens Indicate the presence of a set of manually specified tokens near the mention. These include quotations around the mention, the word "old" after the mention, and prepositions of time (such as "in", "until", and "during") before.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Part of speech</head><p>Indicators that pair each word with its part of speech, as assigned by the Stanford tagger ( <ref type="bibr">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>).</p><p>Lexical group Each lexical entry belongs to one of thirteen manually defined lexical groups which cluster entries that contribute to the final time ex- pression similarly. These groups include numbers, days of the week, months, seasons, etc. For each group, we include a feature indicating whether the parse includes a lexical entry from that group.</p><p>Determiner dependency Indicates the presence of a determiner in the mention and whether its par- ent in the dependency tree (generated by the Stan- ford parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(de Marneffe et al., 2006</ref>)) also resides within the mention.</p><p>Learning Finally, we construct the training data by considering all spans that (1) the CCG tempo- ral grammar can parse and (2) are not strict sub- spans of an annotated mention. All spans that ex- actly matched the gold labels are used as positive examples and all others are negatives. Given this relaxed data, we learn the feature weights θ with L1-regularization. We set the probability thresh- old for detecting a time expression by optimizing the F1 score over the training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Resolution</head><p>The resolution problem is to, given a document D and a set of mentions M , map each m ∈ M to the correct time expression e. Section 4 defined the space of possible time expression that can be constructed for an input mention m in the context of a document D. In general, there will be many different possible derivations, and we will learn a model for selecting the best one.</p><p>Model Let y be a context-dependent CCG parse, which includes a parse tree TR(y), a set of context operations CNTX(y) applied to the logical form at the root of the tree, a final context-dependent logical form LF(y) and a TIMEX3 value TM(y). Define φ(m, D, y) ∈ R d to be a d-dimensional feature-vector representation and θ ∈ R d to be a parameter vector. The probability of a parse y for mention m and document D is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P (y|m, D; θ, Λ) = e θ·φ(m,D,y) y e θ·φ(m,D,y )</formula><p>The inference problem at test time requires find- ing the best resolution by solving y * (m, D) = arg max y P (y|m, D; θ, Λ), where the final output TIMEX3 value is TM(y * (m, D)).</p><p>Inference We find the best context-dependent parse y by enumeration, as follows. We first parse the input mention m with a CKY-style algo- rithm, following previous work <ref type="bibr">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005</ref>). Due to the short length of time expressions and the manually constructed lexicon, we can perform exact inference. Given a parse, we then enumerate all possible outcomes for the context resolution operators. In practice, there are never more than one hundred possibilities.</p><p>Features The resolution features test properties of the linguistic context surrounding the mention m, relative to the context-dependent CCG parse y.</p><p>Governor verb We define the governor verb to be the nearest ancestor verb in the dependency parse of any token in m. We include features indicat- ing the concatenation of the part-of-speech of the governor verb, its auxiliary verb if present, and the selected direction resolution operator (see Sec- tion 4.2). This feature helps to distinguish "They met on Friday" from "They will meet on Friday."</p><p>Temporal offset If the final logical form LF (y) is a range, we define t to be the time difference between TM(y) and the reference time. For ex- ample, if the reference time is 2000-01-10 and the mention resolves to 2000-01-01, then t is -9 days. This feature indicates one of eleven bucketed val- ues for t, including same day, less than a week, less than a month, etc. It allows the model to en- code the likely temporal progression of a narrative. This feature is ignored if the granularity of TM(y) or the reference time is greater than a year.</p><p>Shift granularity The logical constant shift (Ta- ble 2) takes three arguments: the origin (range), the delta (duration), and the output granularity (duration). This indicator feature is the concate- nation of each argument's granularity for every shift in LF (y). It allows the model to determine whether "a year ago" refers to a year or a day.</p><p>Reference type Let r denote whether the refer- ence time is the document creation time dct or the last range last range. Let g l and g r denote the granularities of LF (y) and the reference time, re- spectively. We include features indicating the con- catenations: r+g l , r+g r , and r+g l +g r . Addition- ally, we include features indicating the concatena- tion of r with each lexical entry used in the parse T R(y). These features allow the model to encode preferences in selecting the correct reference time.</p><p>Fine-grained type These features indicate the fine-grained type of T M (y), such as day of the month or week of the year. We also include a fea- ture indicating the concatenation of each of these features with the direction resolution operator that was used. These features allow the model to repre- sent, for example, that minutes of the year are less likely than days of the month.</p><p>Intersections These features indicate the concate- nation of the granularities of any two sequences that appear as arguments to an intersect constant.</p><p>Learning To estimate the model parameters θ we assume access to a set of training examples {(m i , d i , e i ) : i = 1, . . . , n}, where each mention m i is paired with a document d i and a TIMEX3 value e i . We use the AdaGrad algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Duchi et al., 2011</ref>) to optimize the conditional, marginal log-likelihood of the data. For each mention, we marginalize over all possible context-dependent parses, using the predictions from the model on the previous gold mentions to fill in missing context, where necessary. After parameter estimation, we set a probability threshold for retaining a resolved time expression by optimizing value F1 (see Sec- tion 8) over the training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Semantic parsers map sentences to logical repre- sentations of their underlying meaning, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Zelle and Mooney (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Wong and Mooney (2007)</ref>. Re- cently, research in this area has focused on learn- ing for various forms of relatively weak but eas- ily gathered supervision.

Recently, Angeli et al. introduced the idea of learning semantic parsers to resolve time expres- sions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angeli et al., 2012)</ref> and showed that the ap- proach can generalize to multiple languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angeli and Uszkoreit, 2013)</ref>. Similarly, Bethard demonstrated that a hand-engineered semantic parser is also effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bethard, 2013b)</ref>. How- ever, these approaches did not use the semantic parser for detection and did not model linguistic context during resolution.</p><p>We build on a number of existing algorithmic ideas, including using CCGs to build meaning representations <ref type="bibr">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kwiatkowski et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kwiatkowski et al., 2011</ref>), building derivations to transform the output of the CCG parser based on context <ref type="bibr">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2009)</ref>, and using weakly supervised parameter up- dates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013b</ref>). However, we are the first to use a semantic parsing grammar within a mention detection algorithm, thereby avoiding the need to represent the meaning of complete sentences, and the first to develop a context-dependent model for semantic parsing of time expressions.</p><p>Time expressions have been extensively stud- ied as part of the TimeEx task, including 9 teams who competed in the 2013 TempEval-3 com- petition ( <ref type="bibr">Uzzaman et al., 2013)</ref>. This line of work builds on ideas from TimeBank (Puste- jovsky et al., 2003) and a number of different formal models for temporal reasoning, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen (1983)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Moens and Steedman (1988)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">In 2013, HeidelTime (Strötgen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gertz, 2013</ref>) was the top performing system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Experimental Setup</head><p>Data We evaluate performance on the TempEval-3 (Uzzaman et al., 2013) and Wiki- Wars (Mazur and Dale, 2010) datasets. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows summary statistics for both datasets. For the TempEval-3 corpus, we use the given training and testing set splits. Since the training set has lower inter-annotator agreement than the testing set ( <ref type="bibr">Uzzaman et al., 2013)</ref>, we manually corrected all of the mistakes we found in the training data. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The original training set is denoted Dev* and the corrected Dev. We report (1) cross-validation development results on Dev*, (2) cross-validation development and ablation results for Dev, and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>   rion of 0.01. For resolution, we set the learning rate to 0.25 and ran AdaGrad for 5 iterations. All features are initialized to have zero weights.</p><p>Evaluation Metrics We use the official TempEval-3 scoring script and report the standard metrics. We report detection precision, recall and F1 with relaxed and strict metrics; a gold mention is considered detected for the relaxed metric if any of the output candidates overlap with it and is detected for the strict metric if the extent of any output candidates matches exactly. For resolution, we report value accuracy, measuring correctness of time expressions detected according to the relaxed metric. We also report value precision, recall, and F1, which score an expression as correct if it is both correctly detected (relaxed) and resolved. For end-to-end performance, value F1 is the primary metric. Finally, we report accuracy and F1 for temporal types, as defined in Section 2, for the TempEval dataset (WikiWars does not include type labels).</p><p>Comparison Systems We compare our system primarily to <ref type="bibr">HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2013)</ref>, which is state of the art in the end-to- end task. For the TempEval-3 dataset, we also compare to two other strong participants of the shared task. These include NavyTime <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chambers, 2013)</ref>, which had the top relaxed detection score, and ClearTK (Bethard, 2013a), which had the top strict detection score and type F1 score.  context free grammar (SCFG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bethard, 2013b)</ref>, which is state-of-the-art in the task of resolution with gold mention boundaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Results</head><p>End-to-end results <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows develop- ment and test results for TempEval-3. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5</ref> shows these numbers for WikiWars. In both datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art test scores. For detection, we show up to 3-point improve- ments in strict and relaxed F1 scores. These num- bers outperform all systems participating in the shared task, which used a variety of techniques in- cluding hand-engineered rules, CRF tagging mod- els, and SVMs. For resolution, we show up to 4-point improvements in the value F1 score, also outperforming participating systems, all of which used hand-engineered rules for resolution.</p><p>Gold Mentions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6</ref> reports development and test results with gold mentions. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Our approach outperforms the state of the art, SCFG <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bethard, 2013b)</ref>, which also used a hand engineered gram- mar, but did not use machine learning techniques. Precision vs. Recall Our probabilistic model of time expression resolution allows us to eas- ily tradeoff precision and recall for end-to-end performance by varying the resolution probability threshold. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref> shows the precision vs. recall of the resolved values from 10-fold cross valida- tion of TempEval-3 Dev and WikiWars Dev. We are able to achieve precision at or above 90% with reasonable recall, nearly 70% for WikiWars and over 85% for TempEval-3.</p><p>Ablation Study Figures 4-5 also show compar- isons for our system with no context. We ablate the ability to refer to the context during resolution by removing contextual information from the res- olution features and only allowing the document creation time to be the reference time.</p><p>We see an interesting asymmetry in the effect of modeling context across the two domains. We find that context is much more important in WikiWars (19 point difference) than in TempEval (2 point difference). This result reaffirms the difference in domains that Strötgen and Gertz (2012) noted dur- ing the development of HeidelTime: history arti- cles have narrative structure that moves back and forth through time while newspaper text typically describes events happening near the document cre- ation time. This difference helps us to understand why previous learning systems have been able to ignore context and perform well on newswire text.</p><p>Error Analysis To investigate the source of er- ror, we compute oracle results for resolving gold mentions over the TempEval-3 Dev dataset. We found that our system produces a correct candidate derivation for 96% of the mentions.</p><p>We also manually categorized all resolution errors for end-to-end performance with 10-fold cross validation of the TempEval-3 Dev dataset,  shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref>. The lexicon allows for effec- tive parsing, contributing to only 2% of the overall errors. However, context is more challenging. The three largest categories, responsible for 64.7% of the errors, were incorrect use of the context oper- ators. More expressive modeling will be required to fully capture the complex pragmatics involved in understanding time expressions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Conclusion</head><p>We presented the first context-dependent semantic parsing system to detect and resolve time expres- sions. Both models used a Combinatory Catego- rial Grammar (CCG) to construct a set of possible temporal meaning representations. This grammar defined the possible phrases for detection and the inputs to a context-dependent reasoning step that was used to construct the output time expression during resolution. Experiments demonstrated that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems.</p><p>In the future, we aim to develop joint models for reasoning about events and time expressions, including detection and resolution of temporal re- lations. We are also interested in testing coverage in new domains and investigating techniques for semi-supervised learning and learning with noisy data. We hypothesize that semantic parsing tech- niques could help in all of these settings, provid- ing a unified mechanism for compositional analy- sis within temporal understanding problems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Example lexical entries.</figDesc></figure>
