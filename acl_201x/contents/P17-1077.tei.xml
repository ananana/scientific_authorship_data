				<p>We model a dependency graph as a book, a particular kind of topological space, for semantic dependency parsing. The spine of the book is made up of a sequence of words, and each page contains a subset of noncrossing arcs. To build a semantic graph for a given sentence, we design new Maximum Subgraph algorithms to generate noncrossing graphs on each page, and a Lagrangian Relaxation-based algorithm to combine pages into a book. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the book embedding framework across a wide range of conditions. Our parser obtains comparable results with a state-of-the-art transition-based parser.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Dependency analysis provides a lightweight and effective way to encode syntactic and semantic information of natural language sentences. One of its branches, syntactic dependency parsing <ref type="bibr">(Kübler et al., 2009)</ref> has been an extremely ac- tive research area, with high-performance parsers being built and applied for practical use of NLP. Semantic dependency parsing, however, has only been addressed in the literature recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Oepen et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Oepen et al., , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Du et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cao et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Semantic dependency parsing employs a graph- structured semantic representation. On the one hand, it is flexible enough to provide analysis for various semantic phenomena ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ivanova et al., 2012)</ref>. This very flexibility, on the other hand, brings along new challenges for designing pars- ing algorithms. For graph-based parsing, no previ- ously defined Maximum Subgraph algorithm has simultaneously a high coverage and a polynomial complexity to low degrees. For transition-based parsing, no principled decoding algorithms, e.g. dynamic programming (DP), has been developed for existing transition systems.</p><p>In this paper, we borrow the idea of book em- bedding from graph theory, and propose a novel framework to build parsers for flexible depen- dency representations. In graph theory, a book is a kind of topological space that consists of a spine and a collection of one or more half-planes. In our "book model" of semantic dependency graph, the spine is made up of a sequence of words, and each half-plane contains a subset of dependency arcs. In particular, the arcs on each page com- pose a noncrossing dependency graph, a.k.a. pla- nar graph. Though a dependency graph in general is very flexible, its subgraph on each page is rather regular. Under the new perspective, semantic de- pendency parsing can be cast as a two-step task: Each page is first analyzed separately, and then all the pages are bound coherently.</p><p>Our work is motivated by the extant low-degree polynomial time algorithm for first-order Max- imum Subgraph parsing for noncrossing depen- dency graphs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kuhlmann and Jonsson, 2015)</ref>. We enhance existing work with new exact second-and approximate higher-order algorithms. Our algo- rithms facilitate building with high accuracy the partial semantic dependency graphs on each page. To produce a full semantic analysis, we also need to integrate partial graphs on all pages into one co- herent book. To this end, we formulate the prob- lem as a combinatorial optimization problem, and propose a Lagrangian Relaxation-based algorithm for solutions.</p><p>We implement a practical parser in the new framework with a statistical disambiguation model. We evaluate this parser on four data sets: those used in <ref type="bibr">Task 8 (Oepen et al., 2014</ref>, and the dependency graphs extracted from  CCGbank <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007)</ref>. On all data sets, we find that our higher-order pars- ing models are more accurate than the first-order baseline. Experiments also demonstrate the effec- tiveness of our page binding algorithm. Our new parser can be taken as a graph-based parser ex- tended for more general dependency graphs. It parallels the state-of-the-art transition-based sys- tem of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhang et al. (2016)</ref> in performance.</p><p>The implementation of our parser is avail- able at http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/ lcwm/grass.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Semantic Dependency Graphs</head><p>A dependency graph G = (V, A) is a labeled di- rected graph for a sentence s = w 1 , . . . , w n . The vertex set V consists of n vertices, each of which corresponds to a word and is indexed by an integer. The arc set A represents the labeled dependency relations of the particular analysis G. Specifically, an arc, viz. a (i,j,l) , represents a dependency rela- tion l from head w i to dependent w j .</p><p>Semantic dependency parsing is the task of mapping a natural language sentence into a formal meaning representation in the form of a depen- dency graph. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a graph fragment of a noun phrase. This semantic graph is grounded on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steed- man, <ref type="bibr">2000</ref>), and can be taken as a proxy for predicate-argument structure. The graph includes most semantically relevant non-anaphoric local (e.g. from "wants" to "Mark") and long-distance (e.g. from "buy" to "company") dependencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Maximum Subgraph Parsing</head><p>Usually, syntactic dependency analysis employs tree-shaped representations. Dependency parsing, thus, can be formulated as the search for a max- imum spanning tree (MST) of an arc-weighted graph. For semantic dependency parsing, where the target representations are not necessarily trees, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kuhlmann and Jonsson (2015)</ref> proposed to gener- alize the MST model to other types of subgraphs. In general, dependency parsing is formulated as the search for Maximum Subgraph for graph class G: Given a graph G = (V, A), find a subset A ′ ⊆ A with maximum total weight such that the induced subgraph G ′ = (V, A ′ ) belongs to G. For- mally, we have the following optimization prob- lem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G ′ (s) = arg max H∈G(s,G) ∑ p∈H SCOREPART(s, p)</formula><p>Here, G(s, G) is the set of all graphs that belong to G and are compatible with s and G. For parsing, G is usually a complete graph. SCOREPART(s, p) evaluates the event that a small subgraph p of a candidate graph H is good. We define the order of a part according to the number of dependencies it contains, in analogy with tree parsing in terminol- ogy. Previous work only discussed the first-order case for Maximum Subgraph parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kuhlmann and Jonsson, 2015)</ref>. In this paper, we are also in- terested in higher-order parsing, with a special fo- cus on factorizations utilizing the following parts:</p><p>. . If G is the set of projective trees or non- crossing graphs the first-order Maximum Sub- graph problem can be solved in cubic-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Eisner, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kuhlmann and Jonsson, 2015)</ref>. Un- fortunately, these two graph classes are not ex- pressive enough to encode semantic dependency graphs. Moreover, this problem for several well- motivated graph classes, including acyclic or 2- planar graphs, is NP-hard, even if one only consid- ers first-order factorization. The lack of appropri- ate decoding algorithms results in one major chal- lenge for semantic dependency parsing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Book Embedding</head><p>This section introduces the basic idea about book embedding from a graph theoretical point of view. Definition 1. A book is a kind of topological space that consists of a line, called the spine, together with a collection of one or more half- planes, called the pages, each having the spine as its boundary. Definition 2. A book embedding of a finite graph G onto a book B satisfies the following conditions.   <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Book embedding for the graph in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>. Arcs are assigned to two pages.</p><p>1. Every vertex of G is depicted as a point on the spine of B.</p><p>2. Every edge of G is depicted as a curve that lies within a single page of B.</p><p>3. Every page of B does not have any edge crossings.</p><p>A book embedding separates a graph into sev- eral subgraphs, each of which contains all vertices, but only a subset of arcs that are not crossed with each other. This kind of graph is named noncross- ing dependency graph by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kuhlmann and Jonsson (2015)</ref> and planar by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Titov et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">GómezRodríguez and Nivre (2010)</ref> and many others.</p><p>We can formalize a semantic dependency graph as a book. Take the graph in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for example. We can separate the edges into two sets and take each set as a single page, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Empirically, a semantic dependency graph is sparse enough that it can be that it can be usually embedded onto a very thin book. To measure the thickness, we can use pagenumber that is defined as follows. Definition 3. The book pagenumber of G is the minimum number of pages required for a book em- bedding of G.</p><p>We look into the pagenumber of graphs on four linguistic graph banks (as defined in Section 5). These corpora are also used for training and eval- uating our data-driven parsers. The pagenum- bers are calculated using sentences in the train- ing sets. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the percentages of com- plete graphs that can be accounted with books of different thickness. The percentages of noncross- ing graphs, i.e. graphs that have pagenumber 1, vary between 48.23% and 78.26%. The practical usefulness of the algorithms for computing max- imum noncrossing graphs will be limited by the relatively low coverage.</p><p>The class of graphs with pagenumber no more than two has a considerably satisfactory coverage.</p></div>

Unfortunately, the power of Maximum Subgraph parsing is limited given that finding the maximum acyclic subgraph when pagenumber is at most k is NP-hard for k ≥ 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kuhlmann and Jonsson, 2015)</ref>. As an alternative, we propose to model a semantic graph as a book, in which the spine is made up of a sequence of words, and each half- plane contains a subset of dependency arcs. To build a semantic graph for a given sentence, we de- sign new parsing algorithms to generate noncross- ing graphs on each page (Section 3), and a La- grangian Relaxation-based algorithm to integrate pages into a book (Section 4).</p></div>

For sake of formal concision, we introduce the algorithm of which the goal is to calculate the maximum score of a subgraph. Extracting corre- sponding optimal graphs can be done in a num- ber of ways. For example, we can maintain an auxiliary arc table which is populated parallel to the procedure of obtaining maximum scores. We define two score functions: (1) s fst (s, e, l) as- signs a score to an individual edge e (s,e,l) and (2) s scd (s, e 1 , e 2 , l 1 , l 2 ) assigns a score to a pair of neighboring edges e (s,e 1 ,l 1 ) and e (s,e 2 ,l 2 ) .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s . e .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">First-Order Factorization</head><p>Given a sentence, we define two DP tables, namely O[s, e] and C[s, e, l] which represents the value of the highest scoring noncrossing graphs that spans sequences of words of a sentence. The two ta- bles are related to two sub-problems, as graphi- cally shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. The following is their explaination. </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">• C[s, e, l](l ∈ L)</formula><p>, if there is an edge between s and e with label l.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">• C[s, k, l] + O[k, e](l ∈ L, s &lt; k &lt; e), if e (s,e)</formula><p>does not exist and there is an edge with</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">. . s . e . = . s + 1 . e − 1 . . . s . e . = . s . r s . + . r s . e − 1 . . . s . e . = . s + 1 . l e . + . l e . e . . . s . e . = . s . r s . + . r s . l e . + . l e</formula><p>. e label l between s and some node in this span. k is the farthest node linked to s.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">• O[s + 1, e], if e (s,e)</formula><p>does not exist and there is no edge to its right in this span.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C[s, e, l]</head><p>can be obtained by one of the following combinations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">• O[s + 1, e] + s fst (s, e, l)</formula><p>, if s has no edge to its right;</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">• C[s, k, l ′ ] + O[k, e] + s fst (s, e, l)(l ′ ∈ L, s &lt; k &lt; e)</formula><p>, if there is an edge from s to some node in the span.</p><p>For each edge, there are two directions for the edge, we encode the directions into the label l, and treat it as undirected edge. We need to search for a best split and a best label for every span, so the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n 3 |L|) where n is the length of the sentence and L is the set of labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Second-Order Single Side Factorization</head><p>We propose a new algorithm concerning single- side second-order factorization. The DP tables, as well as the decomposition for the open problem, are the same as in the first order factorization. The decomposition of C[s, e, l] is very different. In or- der to score second-order features from adjacent edges in the same side, which is similar to sibling features for tree parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(McDonald and Pereira, 2006</ref>), we need to find the rightmost node adja- cent to s, denoted as r s , and the leftmost node adjacent to e, denoted as l e , and here we have s &lt; r s ≤ l e &lt; e. And, sometimes, we split C[s, e, l] into three parts to capture the neighbor factors on both endpoints. In summary, C[s, e, l] can be obtained by one of the following combina- tion (as graphically shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">• O[s + 1, e − 1] + s fst (s, e, l) + s scd (s, nil, e, nil, l) + s scd (e, nil, s, nil, l), if</formula><p>there is no edge from s/e to any node in the span.</p><p>•</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C[s, r s , l ′ ] + O[r s , e − 1] + s fst (s, e, l) + s scd (s, r s , e, l ′ , l) + s scd (e, nil, s, nil, l) (s &lt; r s &lt; e)</formula><p>, if there is no edge from e to any node in the span.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">• O[s + 1, l e ] + C[l e , e, l ′ ] + s fst (s, e, l) + s scd (e, l e , s, l ′ , l) + s scd (s, nil, e, nil, l) (s &lt; l e &lt; e)</formula><p>, if there is no edge from s to any node in the span.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">• C[s, r s , l ′ ] + O[r s , l e ] + C[l e , e, l ′′ ] + s fst (s, e, l) + s scd (s, r s , e, l ′ , l) + s scd (e, l e , s, l ′′ , l) (s &lt; r s ≤ l e &lt; e), otherwise.</formula><p>For the last combination, we need to search for two best separating words, namely s r and l e , and two best labels, namely l ′ and l ′ , so the time complexity of this second-order algorithm is O(n 4 |L| 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Generalized Higher-Order Parsing</head><p>Both of the above two algorithms are exact de- coding algorithms. Solutions allow for exact de- coding with higher-order features typically at a high cost in terms of efficiency. A trade-off be- tween rich features and exact decoding benefit tree parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">McDonald and Nivre, 2011</ref>). In particu- lar, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhang and McDonald (2012)</ref> proposed a gen- eralized higher-order model that abandons exact search in graph-based parsing in favor of free- dom in feature scope. They kept intact Eisner's algorithm for first-order parsing problems, while enhanced the scoring function in an approximate way by introducing higher-order features.</p><p>We borrow Zhang and McDonald's idea and de- velop a generalized parsing model for noncrossing dependency representations.

For example, we can record the leftmost and the rightmost edges in the open structure to get the tri-neighbor features. The time complexity is thus always O(n 3 B 2 ), no matter how complicat- edly higher-order features are incorporated.</p><p>We focus on five factors introduced in Section 2.2. Still consider single-side second-order factor- ization. We keep the closed structure the same but modify the open one to O[s, e; r s , l e , l s,rs , l le,e ]. During parsing, we only record the top-B combi- nations of label concerning e (s,e) and related r s , l e , l s,rs and l le,e . The split of a structure is similar to the first-order algorithm, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Note that r s may be e and l e may be s. In this way, we know exactly whether or not there is an edge from s to e in a refined open structure. This is different from the intuition of the design of the open struc- ture when we consider first-order factorization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Finding and Binding Pages</head><p>Statistics presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> indicate that the coverage of noncrossing dependency graphs is rel- atively low. If we treat semantic dependency pars- ing as Maximum Subgraph parsing, the practical usefulness of the algorithms introduced above is rather limited accordingly. To deal with this prob- lem, we model a semantic graph as a book, and view semantic dependency parsing as finding a book with coherent optimal pages. Given the con- siderably high coverage of pagenumber at most 2, we only consider 2-page books.  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Every non-crossing arc is repeatedly assigned to every page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Finding Pages via Coloring</head><p>In general, finding the pagenumber of a graph is NP-hard ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gómez-Rodríguez and Nivre, 2010)</ref>. However, it is easy to figure out that the problem is solvable if the pagenumber is at most 2. For- tunately, a semantic dependency graph is not so dense that it can be usually embedded onto a very thin book with only 2 pages. For a structured pre- diction problem, the structural information of the output produced by a parser is very important. The density of semantic dependency graphs therefore results in a defect: The output's structural infor- mation is limited because only a half of arcs on average are included in one page. To enrich the structural information, we put into each page the arcs that do not cross with any other arcs. <ref type="figure">See Fig- ure 6</ref> for example.</p><p>We utilize an algorithm based on coloring to de- compose a graph G = (V, A) into two noncross- ing subgraphs G A = (V, A B ) and G B = (V, A B ). A detailed description is included in the supple- mentary note. The key idea of our algorithm is to color each crossing arc in two colors using depth- first search. When we color an arc e x , we exam- ine all arcs crossing with e x . If one of them, say e y , has not been examined and can be colored in the other color (no crossing arc of e y has the same color with e y ), we color e y and then recursively process e y . Otherwise, e y is marked as a bad arc and dropped from both A A and A B . After color- ing all the crossing arcs, we add every arc in dif- ferent color to different subgraphs. Specially, all noncrossing arcs are assigned to both A A and A B .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Binding Pages via Lagrangian Relaxation</head><p>Applying the above algorithm, we can obtain two corpora to train two noncrossing dependency pars- ing models. In other words, we can learn two score functions f A and f B to score noncrossing dependency graphs. Given the trained models and a sentence, we can find two optimal noncrossing graphs, i.e. find the solutions for arg max g f A (g) and arg max g f B (g), respectively.</p><p>We can put all the arcs contained in g A = arg max g f A (g) and g B = arg max g f B (g) to- gether as our parse for the sentence. This naive combination always gives a graph with a recall much higher than the precision. The problem is that a naive combination does not take the agree- ments of the graphs on the two pages into consid- eration, and thus loses some information. To com- bine the two pages in a principled way, we must do joint decoding to find two graphs g A and g B to maximize the score f A (g A ) + f B (g B ), under the following constraints.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">g A (i, j) ≤ ∑ cross((i,j),(i ′ ,j ′ )) g B (i ′ , j ′ ) + g B (i, j) g B (i, j) ≤ ∑ cross((i,j),(i ′ ,j ′ )) g A (i ′ , j ′ ) + g A (i, j) ∀i, j</formula><p>The functionality of cross is to figure out whether e (i,j) and e (i ′ ,j ′ ) cross. The meaning of the first constraint is: When there is an arc e (i,j) in the first graph, e (i,j) is also in the second graph, or there is an arc e (i ′ ,j ′ ) in the second graph which cross with e (i,j) . So is the second one. All constraints are linear and can be written in a simplified way as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Ag A + Bg B ≤ 0</formula><p>where A and B are matrices that can be con- structed by checking all possible crossing arc pairs. In summary, we have the following con- strained optimization problem,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">min. −f A (g A ) − f B (g B ) s.t. g A , g B are noncrossing graphs Ag A + Bg B ≤ 0</formula><p>The Lagrangian of the optimization problem is</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L(g A , g B ; u) = −f g (g A ) − f t (g B ) + u ⊤ (Ag A + Bg B )</formula><p>where u is the Lagrangian multiplier. Then the dual is <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: The page binding algorithm.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">L(u) = min g A ,g B L(g A , g B ; u) = max g A (f g (g A ) − u ⊤ Ag A ) + max g B (f y (g B ) − u ⊤ Bg B ) BINDTWOPAGES(g A , g B ) 1 u (0) ← 0 2 for k ← 0..T do 3 g A ← arg max g f A (g) − u (k)⊤ Ag 4 g B ← arg max g f B (g) − u (k)⊤ Bg 5 if Ag A + Bg B ≤ 0 then 6 return g A , g B 7 else 8 u (k+1) ← u (k) + α (k) (Ag A + Bg B ) 9 return g A , g B</formula><p>We instead try to find the solution for max u L(u). By using a subgradient method to cal- culate max u L(u), we have an algorithm for joint decoding (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. L(u) is divided into two optimization problems which can be decoded eas- ily. Each sub-problem is still a parsing problem for noncrossing graphs. Only the scores of factors are modified (see Line 3 and 4). Specifically, to modify the first order weights of edges, we take a subtraction of u ⊤ A in the first model and a sub- straction of u ⊤ B in the second one. In each it- eration, after obtaining two new parsing results, we check whether the constraints are satisfied. If the answer is "yes," we stop and return the merged graph. Otherwise, we update u in a way to in- crease L(u) (see Line 8).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data Sets</head><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of book embed- ding in practice, we conduct experiments on un- labeled parsing using four corpora: CCGBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007), DeepBank (Flickinger et al., 2012), Enju HPSGBank (En- juBank; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Miyao et al., 2004</ref>) and Prague Depen- dency TreeBank (PCEDT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hajic et al., 2012</ref>), We use "standard" training, validation, and test splits to facilitate comparisons. Following previous ex- perimental setup for CCG parsing, we use sec- tion 02-21 as training data, section 00 as the de- velopment data, and section 23 for testing. The other three data sets are from <ref type="bibr">Task 8 (Oepen et al., 2014</ref>, and the data splitting policy follows the shared task. All the four data sets are publicly available from LDC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Oepen et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Experiments for CCG analysis were performed using automatically assigned POS-tags generated by a symbol-refined HMM tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Huang et al., 2010</ref>). For the other three data sets we use POS- tags provided by the shared task. We also use fea- tures extracted from trees. We consider two types of trees: (1) syntactic trees provided as a com- panion analysis by the shared task and CCGBank, (2) pseudo trees ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhang et al., 2016)</ref> automatically extracted from semantic dependency annotations. We utilize the Mate parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bohnet, 2010)</ref> to gen- erate pseudo trees for all data sets and also syntac- tic trees for CCG analysis, and use the companion syntactic analysis provided by the shared task for the other three data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Statistical Disambiguation</head><p>Our parsing algorithms can be applied to scores originated from any source, but in our experiments we chose to use the framework of global linear models, deriving our scores as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">SCOREPART(s, p) = w ⊤ ϕ(s, p)</formula><p>ϕ is a feature-vector mapping and w is a param- eter vector. p may refer to a single arc, a pair of neighboring arcs, or a general tuple of arcs, ac- cording to the definition of a parsing model. For details we refer to the source code. We chose the averaged structured perceptron <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Collins, 2002</ref>) for parameter estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Results of Practical Parsing</head><p>We evaluate five decoding algorithms: M1 first-order exact algorithm, M2 second-order exact algorithm with single- side factorization, M3 second-order approximate algorithm 2 with single-side factorization, M4 second-order approximate algorithm with single-and both-side factorization, M5 third-order approximate algorithm with single-and both-side factorization.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>: Parsing accuracy evaluated on the development sets. "MS" is short for Maximum Subgraph parsing. "NC" and "LR" are short for naive combination and Lagrangian Relaxation. But due to the low coverage of the noncrossing dependency graphs, a set of dependencies can not be built. This property has a great impact on re- call. Furthermore, we can see that the introduction of higher-order features improves parsing substan- tially for all data sets, as expected. When pseudo trees are utilized, the improvement is marginal. We think the reason is that we have already in- cluded many higher-order features at the stage of pseudo tree parsing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Effectiveness of Higher-Order Features</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Effectiveness of Approximate Parsing</head><p>Perhaps surprisingly approximate parsing with single-side second order features and cube pruning is even slightly better than exact parsing. This re- sult demonstrates the effectiveness of generalized dependency parsing. Further including third-order features does not improve parsing accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Effectiveness of Page Binding</head><p>When arcs are assigned to two sets, we can sep- arately train two parsers for producing two types of noncrossing dependency graphs. These two parsers can be integrated using a naive merger or a LR-based merger. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> also shows the accuracy obtained by the second-order model M4. The ef- fectivenss of the Lagrangian Relaxation-based al- gorithm for binding pages is confirmed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> presents the termination rate with respec- tive to the number of iterations. Here we apply M4 with syntax and pseudo tree features. In practice the Lagrangian Relaxation-based algorithm finds solutions in a few iterations for a majority of sen- tences. This suggests that even though the joint decoding is an iterative procedure, satisfactory ef- ficiency is still available. <ref type="table">EnjuBank  CCGBank  PCEDT  UP  UR  UF  UP  UR  UF  UP  UR  UF  UP  UR  UF  M4-</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Parsing accuracy evaluated on the test sets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Comparison with Other Parsers</head><p>We show the parsing results on the test data to- gether with some relevant results from related work. We compare our parser with two other systems: (1) ZDSW ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhang et al., 2016</ref>) is a transition-based system that obtains state-of-the- art accuracy; we present the results of their best single parsing model; (2) Peking ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Du et al., 2014</ref>) is the best-performing system in the shared task; it is a hybrid system that integrate more than ten sub- models to achieve high accuracy. Our parser can be taken as a graph-based parser. It reaches state- of-the-art performance produced by the transition- based system. On DeepBank and EnjuBank, the accuracy of our parser is equivalent to ZDSW, while on CCGBank, our parser is significantly bet- ter.</p><p>There is still a gap between our single pars- ing model and Peking hybrid model. For a ma- jority of NLP tasks, e.g. parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Surdeanu and Manning, 2010)</ref>, semantic role labeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Koomen et al., 2005</ref>), hybrid systems that combines com- plementary strength of heterogeneous models per- form better. But good individual system is the cor- nerstone of hybrid systems. Better design of single system almost always benefits system ensemble.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We propose a new data-driven parsing frame- work, namely book embedding, for semantic de- pendency analysis, viz. mapping from natural lan- guage sentences to bilexical semantic dependency graphs. Our work includes two contributions:</p><p>1. new algorithms for maximum noncrossing dependency parsing.</p><p>2. a Lagrangian Relaxation based algorithm to combine noncrossing dependency subgraphs.</p><p>Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the book embedding framework across a wide range of conditions. Our graph-based parser obtains state-of-the-art accuracy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A fragment of a semantic dependency graph.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Maximum Subgraph for Noncrossing Graphs We introduce several DP algorithms for calculating the maximum noncrossing dependency graphs. Each algorithm visits all the spans from bottom to top, finding the best combination of smaller structures to form a new structure, according to the scores of first-or higher-order features. For sake of conciseness, we focus on undirected graphs and treat direction of linguistic dependencies as edge labels 1. We will use e (i,j,l) (i &lt; j) or simply e (i,j) to indicate an edge in either direction 1 The single-head property does not hold. We currently do not consider other constraints of directions. So prediction of the direction of one edge does not affect prediction of other edges as well as their directions. The directions can be assigned locally, and our parser builds directed rather than undirected graphs in this way. Undirected graphs are only used to conveniently illustrate our algorithms. All experimental results in Section 5 consider directed dependencies in a standard way. We use the official evaluation tool provided by SDP2014 shared task. The numberic results reported in this paper are directly comparable to results in other papers.</note>
