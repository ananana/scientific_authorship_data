				<p>Understanding how words change their meanings over time is key to models of language and cultural evolution, but historical data on meaning is scarce, making theories hard to develop and test. Word embeddings show promise as a di-achronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity-the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation-independent of frequency , words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.</p>

The rate of semantic change, for example, is higher in some words than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blank, 1999</ref>) -com- pare the stable semantic history of cat (from Proto- Germanic kattuz, "cat") to the varied meanings of English cast: "to mould", "a collection of actors', "a hardened bandage", etc. (all from Old Norse kasta, "to throw", <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Simpson et al., 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Various hypotheses have been offered about such regularities in semantic change, such as an in- creasing subjectification of meaning, or the gram- maticalization of inferences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Geeraerts, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blank, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Traugott and Dasher, 2001</ref>). But many core questions about semantic change remain unanswered. One is the role of fre- quency. Frequency plays a key role in other lin- guistic changes, associated sometimes with faster change-sound changes like lenition occur in more frequent words-and sometimes with slower change-high frequency words are more resistant to morphological regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bybee, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pagel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lieberman et al., 2007)</ref>. What is the role of word frequency in meaning change?</p><p>Another unanswered question is the relationship between semantic change and polysemy. Words gain senses over time as they semantically drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bréal, 1897;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wilkins, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hopper and Traugott, 2003)</ref>, and polysemous words 1 occur in more diverse contexts, affecting lexical access speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adelman et al., 2006</ref>) and rates of L2 learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Crossley et al., 2010</ref>). But we don't know whether the diverse contextual use of pol- ysemous words makes them more or less likely to undergo change <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Geeraerts, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Winter et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, poly- semy is strongly correlated with frequency-high frequency words have more senses <ref type="bibr">(Zipf, 1945;</ref><ref type="bibr">˙ Ilgen and Karaoglan, 2007)</ref>-so understanding how polysemy relates to semantic change requires controling for word frequency.</p><p>Answering these questions requires new meth- ods that can go beyond the case-studies of a few words (often followed over widely different time- periods) that are our most common diachronic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bréal, 1897;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ullmann, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blank, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hopper and Traugott, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Traugott and Dasher, 2001)</ref>. One promising avenue is the use of distri- butional semantics, in which words are embedded in vector spaces according to their co-occurrence relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bullinaria and Levy, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Turney and Pantel, 2010)</ref>, and the embeddings of words <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>: Two-dimensional visualization of semantic change in English using SGNS vectors. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> a, The word gay shifted from meaning "cheerful" or "frolicsome" to referring to homosexuality. b, In the early 20th century broadcast referred to "casting out seeds"; with the rise of television and radio its meaning shifted to "transmitting signals". c, Awful underwent a process of pejoration, as it shifted from meaning "full of awe" to meaning "terrible or appalling" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Simpson et al., 1989).</ref> are then compared across time-periods.

However, these works employ widely dif- ferent embedding approaches and test their ap- proaches only on English.</p><p>In this work, we develop a robust methodol- ogy for quantifying semantic change using embed- dings by comparing state-of-the-art approaches (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) on novel benchmarks.</p><p>We then apply this methodology in a large-scale cross-linguistic analysis using 6 corpora spanning 200 years and 4 languages <ref type="bibr">(English, German, French, and Chinese)</ref>. Based on this analysis, we propose two statistical laws relating frequency and polysemy to semantic change:</p><p>• The law of conformity: Rates of semantic change scale with a negative power of word frequency.</p><p>• The law of innovation: After controlling for frequency, polysemous words have signifi- cantly higher rates of semantic change.</p></div>

The Google N-Gram datasets are extremely large (comprising ≈6% of all books ever published), but they also contain many corpus artifacts due, e.g., to shifting sampling biases over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Pechenick et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, the COHA corpus was carefully selected to be genre-balanced and rep- resentative of American English over the last 200 years, though as a result it is two orders of mag- nitude smaller. The COHA corpus also contains pre-extracted word lemmas, which we used to val- idate that our results hold at both the lemma and raw token levels. All the datasets were aggregated to the granularity of decades. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We follow the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levy et al. (2015)</ref> in setting the hyperparameters for the em- bedding methods, though preliminary experiments were used to tune key settings. For all methods, we used symmetric context windows of size 4 (on each side). For SGNS and SVD, we use embed- dings of size 300. See Appendix A for further im- plementation and pre-processing details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Aligning historical embeddings</head><p>In order to compare word vectors from differ- ent time-periods we must ensure that the vectors are aligned to the same coordinate axes. Ex- plicit PPMI vectors are naturally aligned, as each column simply corresponds to a context word. Low-dimensional embeddings will not be natu- rally aligned due to the non-unique nature of the SVD and the stochastic nature of SGNS. In par- ticular, both these methods may result in arbi- trary orthogonal transformations, which do not af- fect pairwise cosine-similarities within-years but will preclude comparison of the same word across time. Previous work circumvented this problem by either avoiding low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gulordava and Baroni, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jatowt and Duh, 2014</ref>) or by performing heuristic local align- ments per word ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kulkarni et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>We use orthogonal Procrustes to align the learned low-dimensional embeddings. Defining W (t) ∈ R d×|V| as the matrix of word embeddings learned at year t, we align across time-periods while preserving cosine similarities by optimizing: <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> with R (t) ∈ R d×d .

We then measure the Spearman correlation (ρ) of this series against time, which allows us to assess the magnitude and signifi- cance of pairwise similarity shifts; since the Spear- man correlation is non-parametric, this measure essentially detects whether the similarity series in- creased/decreased over time in a significant man- ner, regardless of the 'shape' of this curve. 6</p><p>Measuring semantic displacement After aligning the embeddings for individual time- periods, we can use the aligned word vectors to compute the semantic displacement that a word has undergone during a certain time-period. In particular, we can directly compute the cosine- distance between a word's representation for different time-periods, i.e. cos-dist(w t , w t+∆ ), as a measure of semantic change. We can also use this measure to quantify 'rates' of semantic change for different words by looking at the displacement between consecutive time-points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Comparison of different approaches</head><p>We compare the different distributional ap- proaches on a set of benchmarks designed to test their scientific utility. We evaluate both their syn- chronic accuracy (i.e., ability to capture word sim- ilarity within individual time-periods) and their di- achronic validity (i.e., ability to quantify semantic changes over time).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Synchronic Accuracy</head><p>We evaluated the synchronic (within-time-period) accuracy of the methods using a standard modern benchmark and the 1990s portion of the ENGALL data. On Bruni et al. (2012)'s MEN similarity task of matching human judgments of word similari- ties, SVD performed best (ρ = 0.739), followed by PPMI (ρ = 0.687) and SGNS (ρ = 0.649).</p><p>These results echo the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levy et al. (2015)</ref>, who found SVD to perform best on sim- ilarity tasks while SGNS performed best on anal- ogy tasks (which are not the focus of this work).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Diachronic Validity</head><p>We evaluate the diachronic validity of the methods on two historical semantic tasks: detecting known shifts and discovering shifts from data. For both these tasks, we performed detailed evaluations on a small set of examples (28 known shifts and the top-10 "discovered" shifts by each method). Us- ing these reasonably-sized evaluation sets allowed the authors to evaluate each case rigorously using existing literature and historical corpora.     <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. SGNS and SVD capture the correct directionality of the shifts in all cases (%Correct), e.g., gay becomes more similar to homosexual, but there are differences in whether the methods deem the shifts to be sta- tistically significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level (%Sig).</p><p>Detecting known shifts. First, we tested whether the methods capture known historical shifts in meaning. The goal in this task is for the methods to correctly capture whether pairs of words moved closer or further apart in semantic space during a pre-determined time-period. We use a set of independently attested shifts as an evaluation set <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>). For comparison, we eval- uated the methods on both the large (but messy) ENGALL data and the smaller (but clean) COHA data. On this task, all the methods performed almost perfectly in terms of capturing the correct directionality of the shifts (i.e., the pairwise similarity series have the correct sign on their Spearman correlation with time), but there were some differences in whether the methods deemed the shifts statistically significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Overall, SGNS performed the best on the full English data, but its performance dropped significantly on the smaller COHA dataset, where SVD performed best. PPMI was noticeably worse than the other two approaches <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>.</p><p>Discovering shifts from data. We tested whether the methods discover reasonable shifts <ref type="bibr">7</ref> All subsequent significance tests are at p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>by examining the top-10 words that changed the most from the 1900s to the 1990s according to the semantic displacement metric introduced in Section 2.4 (limiting our analysis to words with relative frequencies above 10 −5 in both decades).</p><p>We used the ENGFIC data as the most-changed list for ENGALL was dominated by scientific terms due to changes in the corpus sample. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the top-10 words discovered by each method. These shifts were judged by the au- thors as being either clearly genuine, borderline, or clearly corpus artifacts. SGNS performed by far the best on this task, with 70% of its top-10 list corresponding to genuine semantic shifts, fol- lowed by 40% for SVD, and 10% for PPMI. How- ever, a large portion of the discovered words for PPMI (and less so SVD) correspond to borderline cases, e.g. know, that have not necessarily shifted significantly in meaning but that occur in differ- ent contexts due to global genre/discourse shifts. The poor quality of the nearest neighbors gener- ated by the PPMI algorithm-which are skewed by PPMI's sensitivity to rare events-also made it difficult to assess the quality of its discovered shifts. SVD was the most sensitive to corpus arti- facts (e.g., co-occurrences due to cover pages and advertisements), but it still captured a number of genuine semantic shifts.</p><p>We opted for this small evaluation set and re- lied on detailed expert judgments to minimize am- biguity; each potential shift was analyzed in detail by consulting consulting existing literature (espe- cially the OED; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Simpson et al., 1989</ref>) and all dis- agreements were discussed. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> details representative example shifts in English, French, and German. Chinese lacks suf- ficient historical data for this task, as only years 1950-1999 are usable; however, we do still see Method Top-10 words that changed from 1900s to 1990s PPMI know, got, would, decided, think, stop, remember, started, must, wanted SVD harry, headed, calls, gay, wherever, male, actually, special, cover, naturally SGNS wanting, gay, check, starting, major, actually, touching, harry, headed, romance <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Top-10 English words with the highest semantic displacement values between the 1900s and 1990s. Bolded entries correspond to real semantic shifts, as deemed by examining the literature and their nearest neighbors; for example, headed shifted from primarily referring to the "top of a body/entity" to referring to "a direction of travel." Underlined entries are borderline cases that are largely due to global genre/discourse shifts; for example, male has not changed in meaning, but its usage in discussions of "gender equality" is relatively new. Finally, unmarked entries are clear corpus artifacts; for example, special, cover, and romance are artifacts from the covers of fiction books occasionally including advertisements etc.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Methodological recommendations</head><p>PPMI is clearly worse than the other two meth- ods; it performs poorly on all the benchmark tasks, is extremely sensitive to rare events, and is prone to false discoveries from global genre shifts. Be- tween SVD and SGNS the results are somewhat equivocal, as both perform best on two out of the four tasks (synchronic accuracy, ENGALL detec- tion, COHA detection, discovery). Overall, SVD performs best on the synchronic accuracy task and has higher average accuracy on the 'detection' task, while SGNS performs best on the 'discov- ery' task. These results suggest that both these methods are reasonable choices for studies of se- mantic change but that they each have their own tradeoffs: SVD is more sensitive, as it performs well on detection tasks even when using a small dataset, but this sensitivity also results in false dis- coveries due to corpus artifacts. In contrast, SGNS is robust to corpus artifacts in the discovery task, but it is not sensitive enough to perform well on the detection task with a small dataset. Qualitatively, we found SGNS to be most useful for discovering new shifts and visualizing changes (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>), while SVD was most effective for detecting subtle shifts in usage.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Setup</head><p>We present results using SVD embeddings (though analogous results were found to hold with SGNS). Using all four languages and all four conditions for English (ENGALL, ENGFIC, and COHA with and without lemmatization), we per- formed regression analysis on rates of seman- tic change, ∆ (t) (w i ); thus, we examined one data-point per word for each pair of consecutive decades and analyzed how a word's frequency and polysemy at time t correlate with its degree of semantic displacement over the next decade.</p><p>To ensure the robustness of our results, we ana- lyzed only the top-10000 non-stop words by aver-Top-10 most polysemous yet, always, even, little, called, also, sometimes, great, still, quite Top-10 least polysemous photocopying, retrieval, thirties, mom, sweater, forties, seventeenth, fifteenth, holster, postage <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: The top-10 most and least polysemous words in the ENGFIC data. Words like yet, even, and still are used in many diverse ways and are highly polysemous. In contrast, words like photocopying, postage, and holster tend to be used in very specific well-clustered contexts, corresponding to a single sense; for example, mail and letter are both very likely to occur in the context of postage and are also likely to co-occur with each other, independent of postage.</p></div>

We also log-transformed the semantic displacement scores and normalized the scores to have zero mean and unit variance; we denote these normalized scores by˜∆by˜ by˜∆ (t) (w i ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Law of innovation: Polysemous words change at faster rates</head><p>There is a common hypothesis in the linguistic lit- erature that "words become semantically extended by being used in diverse contexts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Winter et al., 2014</ref>), an idea that dates back to the writings of Bréal (1897). We tested this notion by examining the relationship between polysemy and semantic change in our data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantifying polysemy</head><p>Measuring word polysemy is a difficult and fraught task, as even "ground truth" dictionaries differ in the number of senses they assign to words <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Simpson et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fellbaum, 1998)</ref>. We cir- cumvent this issue by measuring a word's contex- tual diversity as a proxy for its polysemousness. The intuition behind our measure is that words that occur in many distinct, unrelated contexts will tend to be highly polysemous. This view of pol- ysemy also fits with previous work on semantic change, which emphasizes the role of contextual diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bréal, 1897;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Winter et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>We measure a word's contextual diversity, and thus polysemy, by examining its neighborhood in an empirical co-occurrence network. We con- struct empirical co-occurrence networks using the PPMI measure defined in Section 2. In these net- works words are connected to each other if they co-occur more than one would expect by chance (after smoothing). The polysemy of a word is then measured as its local clustering coefficient within this network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Watts and Strogatz, 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d(w i ) = − c i ,c j ∈N PPMI (w i ) I {PPMI(c i , c j ) &gt; 0} |N PPMI (w i )|(|N PPMI (w i )| − 1) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where N PPMI (w i ) = {w j : PPMI(w i , w j ) &gt; 0}. This measure counts the proportion of w i 's neigh- bors that are also neighbors of each other. Accord- ing to this measure, a word will have a high clus- tering coefficient (and thus a low polysemy score) if the words that it co-occurs with also tend to co- occur with each other. Polysemous words that are contextually diverse will have low clustering co- efficients, since they appear in disjointed or unre- lated contexts.</p><p>Variants of this measure are often used in word- sense discrimination and correlate with, e.g., num- ber of senses in WordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dorow and Widdows, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ferret, 2004</ref>). However, we found that it was slightly biased towards rating contextually diverse discourse function words (e.g., also) as highly polysemous, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting our results. We opted to use this measure, despite this bias, because it has the strong benefit of being clearly interpretable: it simply measures the extent to which a word ap- pears in diverse textual contexts. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> gives ex- amples of the least and most polysemous words in the ENGFIC data, according to this score.</p><p>As expected, this measure has significant intrin- sic positive correlation with frequency. Across datasets, we found Pearson correlations in the range 0.45 &lt; r &lt; 0.8 (all p &lt; 0.05), confirm- ing frequent words tend to be used in a greater di- versity of contexts. As a consequence of this high correlation, we interpret the effect of this measure only after controlling for frequency (this control is naturally captured in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polysemy and semantic change</head><p>After fitting the model in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>, we found that the logarithm of the polysemy score exhibits a strong positive effect on rates of semantic change, throughout all four languages <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3b)</ref>. As with frequency, the relation takes the form of a power law</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∆(w i ) ∝ d(w i ) β d ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>with a language/corpus dependent scaling constant in β d ∈ [0.37, 0.77]. Note that this relation- ship is a complete reversal from what one would expect according to d(w i )'s positive correlation with frequency; i.e., since frequency and poly- semy are highly positively correlated, one would expect them to have similar effects on seman- tic change, but we found that the effect of poly- semy completely reversed after controlling for fre- quency. <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref> shows the relationship of pol- ysemy with rates of semantic change in the EN- GALL data after regressing out effect of frequency (using the method of Graham, 2003).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>We show how distributional methods can reveal statistical laws of semantic change and offer a ro- bust methodology for future work in this area.</p><p>Our work builds upon a wealth of previous research on quantitative approaches to semantic change, including prior work with distributional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sagi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gulordava and Baroni, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jatowt and Duh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kulkarni et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xu and Kemp, 2015)</ref>, as well as recent work on detecting the emergence of novel word senses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lau et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mitra et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cook et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mitra et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Frermann and Lapata, 2016)</ref>. We extend these lines of work by rigorously comparing dif- ferent approaches to quantifying semantic change and by using these methods to propose new statis- tical laws of semantic change.</p><p>The two statistical laws we propose have strong implications for future work in historical seman- tics. The law of conformity-frequent words change more slowly-clarifies frequency's role in semantic change. Future studies of semantic change must account for frequency's conforming effect: when examining the interaction between some linguistic process and semantic change, the law of conformity should serve as a null model in which the interaction is driven primarily by under- lying frequency effects.</p><p>The law of innovation-polysemous words change more quickly-quantifies the central role polysemy plays in semantic change, an issue that has concerned linguists for more than 100 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bréal, 1897)</ref>. Previous works argued that seman- tic change leads to polysemy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilkins, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hopper and Traugott, 2003)</ref>. However, our results show that polysemous words change faster, which suggests that polysemy may actually lead to se- mantic change.</p><p>Overall, these two factors-frequency and polysemy-explain between 48% and 88% of the variance 10 in rates of semantic change (across con- ditions). This remarkable degree of explanatory power indicates that frequency and polysemy are perhaps the two most crucial linguistic factors that explain rates of semantic change over time.</p><p>These empirical statistical laws also lend them- selves to various causal mechanisms. The law of conformity might be a consequence of learn- ing: perhaps people are more likely to use rare words mistakenly in novel ways, a mechanism for- malizable by Bayesian models of word learning and corresponding to the biological notion of ge- netic drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Reali and Griffiths, 2010)</ref>. Or per- haps a sociocultural conformity bias makes people less likely to accept novel innovations of common words, a mechanism analogous to the biological process of purifying selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boyd and Richerson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pagel et al., 2007)</ref>. Moreover, such mechanisms may also be partially responsible for the law of innovation. Highly polysemous words tend to have more rare senses <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kilgarriff, 2004)</ref>, and rare senses may be unstable by the law of con- formity. While our results cannot confirm such causal links, they nonetheless highlight a new role for frequency and polysemy in language change and the importance of distributional models in his- torical research.</p><p>Yang <ref type="bibr">Xu and Charles Kemp. 2015</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Hyperparameter and pre-processing details</head><p>For all datasets, words were lowercased and stripped of punctuation. For the Google datasets we built models using the top-100000 words by their average frequency over the entire histori- cal time-periods, and we used the top-50000 for COHA. During model learning we also discarded all words within a year that occurred below a cer- tain threshold (500 for the Google data, 100 for the COHA data). For all methods, we used the hyperparameters recommended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levy et al. (2015)</ref>. For the con- text word distributions in all methods, we used context distribution smoothing with a smoothing parameter of 0.75. Note that for SGNS this cor- responds to smoothing the unigram negative sam- pling distribution. For both, SGNS and PPMI, we set the negative sample prior α = log(5), while we set this value to α = 0 for SVD, as this improved results. When using SGNS on the Google data, we also subsampled, with words being random re- moved with probability p r (w i ) = 1 − 10 −5 f (w i ) , as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levy et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mikolov et al. (2013)</ref>. Furthermore, to improve the com- putational efficiency of SGNS (which works with text streams and not co-occurrence counts), we downsampled the larger years in the Google N- Gram data to have at most 10 9 tokens. No such subsampling was performed on the COHA data.</p><p>For all methods, we defined the context set to simply be the same vocabulary as the target words, as is standard in most word vector applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Levy et al., 2015)</ref>. However, we found that the PPMI method benefited substantially from larger contexts (similar results were found in Bullinaria and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Levy, 2007)</ref>, so we did not remove any low- frequency words per year from the context for that method. The other embedding approaches did not appear to benefit from the inclusion of these low- frequency terms, so they were dropped for compu- tational efficiency.</p><p>For SGNS, we used the implementation pro- vided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levy et al. (2015)</ref>. The implementations for PPMI and SVD are released with the code package associated with this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Visualization algorithm</head><p>To visualize semantic change for a word w i in two dimensions we employed the following procedure, which relies on the t-SNE embedding method (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) as a subrou- tine:</p><p>1. Find the union of the word w i 's k nearest neighbors over all necessary time-points.</p><p>2. Compute the t-SNE embedding of these words on the most recent (i.e., the modern) time-point.</p><p>3. For each of the previous time-points, hold all embeddings fixed, except for the target word's (i.e., the embedding for w i ), and op- timize a new t-SNE embedding only for the target word. We found that initializing the embedding for the target word to be the cen- troid of its k -nearest neighbors in a time- point was highly effective.</p><p>Thus, in this procedure the background words are always shown in their "modern" positions, which makes sense given that these are the current mean- ings of these words. This approximation is neces- sary, since in reality all words are moving.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Regression analysis details</head><p>In addition to the pre-processing mentioned in the main text, we also normalized the contextual di- versity scores d(w i ) within years by subtracting the yearly median. This was necessary because there was substantial changes in the median con- textual diversity scores over years due to changes in corpus sample sizes etc. Data points corre- sponding to words that occurred less than 500 times during a time-period were also discarded, as these points lack sufficient data to robustly esti- mate change rates (this threshold only came into effect on the COHA data, however). We removed stop words and proper nouns by (i) removing all stop-words from the available lists in Python's NLTK package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bird et al., 2009)</ref> and (ii) re- stricting our analysis to words with part-of-speech (POS) tags corresponding to four main linguistic categories (common nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives), using the POS sources in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. When analyzing the effects of frequency and contextual diversity, the model contained fixed ef- fects for these features and for time along with random effects for word identity. We opted not to control for POS tags in the presented results, as contextual diversity is co-linear with these tags (e.g., adverbs are more contextual diverse than nouns), and the goal was to demonstrate the main effect of contextual diversity across all word types. That said, the effect of contextual diversity re- mained strong and significantly positive in all datasets even after controlling for POS tags.</p><p>To fit the linear mixed models, we used the Python statsmodels package with re- stricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Seabold and Perktold, 2010)</ref>.
