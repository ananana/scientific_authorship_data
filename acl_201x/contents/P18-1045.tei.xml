				<p>This paper proposes a novel approach for event coreference resolution that models correlations between event coreference chains and document topical structures through an Integer Linear Programming formulation. We explicitly model correlations between the main event chains of a document with topic transition sentences , inter-coreference chain correlations , event mention distributional characteristics and sub-event structure, and use them with scores obtained from a local coreference relation classifier for jointly resolving multiple event chains in a document. Our experiments across KBP 2016 and 2017 datasets suggest that each of the structures contribute to improving event coreference resolution performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Event coreference resolution aims to identify and link event mentions in a document that refer to the same real-world event, which is vital for identify- ing the skeleton of a story and text understanding and is beneficial to numerous other NLP applica- tions such as question answering and summariza- tion. In spite of its importance, compared to con- siderable research for resolving coreferential en- tity mentions, far less attention has been devoted to event coreference resolution. Event coreference resolution thus remained a challenging task and the best performance remained low.</p><p>Event coreference resolution presents unique challenges. Compared to entities, coreferential event mentions are fewer in a document and much more sparsely scattered across sentences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a typical news article. Here, the main en- tity, "President Chen", appears frequently in ev- ery sentence, while the main event "hearing" and its accompanying event "detention" are mentioned much less frequently. If we look more closely, referring back to the same entity serves a differ- ent purpose than referring to the same event. The protagonist entity of a story is involved in many events and relations; thus, the entity is referred back each time such an event or relation is de- scribed. In this example, the entity was mentioned when describing various events he participated or was involved in, including "detention", "said", "pointed out", "remitted", "have a chance", "re- lease", "cheating", "asked" and "returned", as well as when describing several relations involv- ing him, including "former president", "his fam- ily" and "his wife". In contrast, most events only appear once in a text, and there is less motivation to repeat them: a story is mainly formed by a se-  ries of related but different events. Essentially, (1) the same event is referred back only when a new aspect or further information of the event has to be described, and (2) repetitions of the same events are mainly used for content organization purposes and, consequently, correlate well with topic struc- tures. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> further shows the comparisons of po- sitional patterns between event coreference and entity coreference chains, based on two bench- mark datasets, ERE ( ) and ACE05 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Walker et al., 2006</ref>), where we paired each event (entity) mention with its nearest antecedent event (entity) mention and calculated the percentage of (event vs. entity) coreferent mention pairs based on the number of sentences between two mentions. Indeed, for entity coreference resolu- tion, centering and nearness are striking properties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grosz et al., 1995)</ref>, and the nearest antecedent of an entity mention is mostly in the same sentence or in the immediately preceding sentence ( 70%). This is especially true for nominals and pronouns, two common types of entity mentions, where the nearest preceding mention that is also compatible in basic properties (e.g., gender, person and num- ber) is likely to co-refer with the current mention. In contrast, coreferential event mentions are rarely from the same sentence ( 10%) and are often sen- tences apart. The sparse distribution of coreferent event mentions also applies to the three KBP cor- pora used in this work.</p><p>To address severe sparsity of event coreference relations in a document, we propose a holistic ap- proach to identify coreference relations between event mentions by considering their correlations with document topic structures. Our key observa- tion is that event mentions make the backbone of a document and coreferent mentions of the same event play a key role in achieving a coherent con- tent structure. For example, in figure 1, the events "hearing" and "detention" were mentioned in the headline (H), in the first sentence (S1) as a story overview, in the second sentence (S2) for transi- tioning to the body section of the story describ- ing what happened during the hearing, and then in the fifth sentence (S5) for transitioning to the end- ing section of the story describing what happened after the hearing. By attaching individual event mentions to a coherent story and its topic struc- tures, our approach recognizes event coreference relations that are otherwise not easily seen due to a mismatch of two event mentions' local contexts or long distances between event mentions.</p><p>We model several aspects of correlations be- tween event coreference chains and document level topic structures, in an Integer Linear Pro- gramming (ILP) joint inference framework. Ex- perimental results on the benchmark event coref- erence resolution dataset <ref type="bibr">KBP-2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellis et al., 2016</ref> and <ref type="bibr">KBP 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Getman et al., 2017</ref> show that the ILP system greatly improves event coref- erence resolution performance by modeling differ- ent aspects of correlations between event corefer- ences and document topic structures, which out- performs the previous best system on the same dataset consistently across several event corefer- ence evaluation metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Correlations between Event Coreference Chains and Document Topic Structures</head><p>We model four aspects of correlations.</p><p>Correlations between Main Event Chains and Topic Transition Sentences: the main events of a document, e.g., "hearing" and "detention" in this example 1, usually have multiple corefer- ent event mentions that span over a large portion of the document and align well with the docu- ment topic layout structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Choubey et al., 2018)</ref>. While fine-grained topic segmentation is a diffi- cult task in its own right, we find that topic tran- sition sentences often overlap in content (for re- minding purposes) and can be identified by cal- culating sentence similarities. For example, sen- tences S1, S2 and S5 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> all mentioned the two main events and the main entity "Presi- dent Chen". We, therefore, encourage coreference links between event mentions that appear in topic transition sentences by designing constraints in ILP and modifying the objective function. In addi- tion, to avoid fragmented partial event chains and recover complete chains for the main events, we also encourage associating more coreferent event mentions to a chain that has a large stretch (the number of sentences between the first and the last event mention based on their textual positions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations across Semantically Associated Event Chains:</head><p>semantically associated events often co-occur in the same sentence. For exam- ple, mentions of the two main events "hearing" and "detention" co-occur across the document in sentences H, S1, S2 and S5. The correlation across event chains is not specific to global main events, for example, the local events "remitted" and "re- lease" have their mentions co-occur in sentences S3 and S4 as well. In ILP, we leverage this ob- servation and encourage creating coreference links between event mentions in sentences that contain other already known coreferent event mentions.</p><p>Genre-specific Distributional Patterns: we model document level distributional patterns of coreferent event mentions that may be specific to a genre in ILP. Specifically, news article often be- gins with a summary of the overall story and then introduces the main events and their closely as- sociated events. In subsequent paragraphs, de- tailed information of events may be introduced to provide supportive evidence to the main story. Thereby, a majority of event coreference chains tend to be initiated in the early sections of the document. Event mentions in the later paragraphs may exist as coreferent mentions of an established coreference chain or as singleton event mentions which, however, are less likely to initiate a new coreference chain. Inspired by this observation, we simply modify the objective function of ILP to encourage more event coreference links in early sections of a document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subevents:</head><p>subevents exist mainly to provide details and evidence for the parent event, there- fore, the relation between subevents and their par- ent event presents another aspect of correlations between event relations and hierarchical document topic structures. Subevents may share the same lexical form as the parent event and cause spurious event coreference links ( ). We observe that subevents referring to specific actions were seldomly referred back in a document and are often singleton events. Following the approach proposed by <ref type="bibr">(Badgett and Huang, 2016)</ref>, we iden- tify such specific action events and improve event coreference resolution by specifying constraints in ILP to discourage coreference links between a spe- cific action event and other event mentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Compared to entity coreference resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clark and Manning, 2016a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Martschat and Strube, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lee et al., 2013)</ref>, far less research was conducted for event coref- erence resolution. Most existing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cybulska and Vossen, 2015a,b)</ref> heavily rely on surface features, mainly event arguments (i.e., entities such as event par- ticipants, time, location, etc.) that were extracted from local contexts of two events, and determine that two events are coreferential if their arguments match. Often, a clustering algorithm, hierarchi- cal Bayesian <ref type="bibr">(Bejan and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harabagiu, 2010, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yang et al., 2015)</ref> or spectral clustering algorithms <ref type="bibr">(Chen and Ji, 2009)</ref>, is applied on top of a pair- wise surface feature based classifier for inducing event clusters. However, identifying potential ar- guments, linking arguments to a proper event men- tion, and recognizing compatibilities between ar- guments are all error-prone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lu et al., 2016)</ref>. Joint event and entity coreference resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee et al., 2012)</ref>, joint inferences of event detection and event coreference resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lu and Ng, 2017)</ref>, and iterative information propagation ( <ref type="bibr">Choubey and Huang, 2017a</ref>) have been pro- posed to mitigate argument mismatch issues.</p><p>However, such methods are incapable of han- dling more complex and subtle cases, such as partial event coreference with incompatible argu- ments (Choubey and Huang, 2017a) and cases lacking informative local contexts. Consequently, many event coreference links were missing and the resulted event chains are fragmented. The low per- formance of event coreference resolution limited its uses in downstream applications. (?) shows that instead of human annotated event coreference relations, using system predicted relations resulted in a significant performance reduction in identify- ing the central event of a document. Moreover, the recent research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Moosavi and Strube (2017)</ref> found that the extensive use of lexical and sur- face features biases entity coreference resolvers towards seen mentions and do not generalize to unseen domains, and the finding can perfectly ap- ply to event coreference resolution. Therefore, we propose to improve event coreference resolution by modeling correlations between event corefer-ences and the overall topic structures of a docu- ment, which is more likely to yield robust and gen- eralizable event coreference resolvers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The Local Pairwise Coreference Resolution Classifier</head><p>Our local pairwise coreference classifier uses a neural network model based on features defined for an event mention pair. It includes a common layer with 347 neurons shared between two event mentions to generate embeddings corresponding to word lemmas (300) and parts-of-speech (POS) tags (47). The common layer aims to enrich event word embeddings with the POS tags using the shared weight parameters. It also includes a sec- ond layer with 380 neurons to embed suffix 1 and prefix 2 of event words, distances (euclidean, abso- lute and cosine) between word embeddings of two event lemmas and common arguments between two event mentions. The output from the second layer is concatenated and fed into the third neu- ral layer with 10 neurons. The output embedding from the third layer is finally fed into an output layer with 1 neuron that generates a score indi- cating the confidence of assigning the given event pair to the same coreference cluster. All three lay- ers and the output layer use the sigmoid activation function.</p></div>

Further we add constraints (equation 2) over each triplets of mentions to en- force transitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Denis et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Finkel and Manning, 2008)</ref>.

They are described in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Modeling the Correlation between Main Event Chains and Topic</head><p>Transition Sentences As shown in the example <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, main events are likely to have mentions appear in topic transi- tion sentences. Therefore, We add the following objective function (equation 3) to the basic objec- tive function and add the new constraint 4 in order to encourage coreferent event mentions to occur in topic transition sentences.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ΘT = m,n∈Ω −log(smn)wmn − log(1 − smn)(¬wmn) s.t. wmn ∈ {0, 1} (n − m) ≥ |S|/θs<label>(3)</label></formula><p>i ∈ξm,j ∈ξn</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x i j ≥ wmn<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Specifically, let ω represents the set of sentences in a document and Ω denotes the set of sentence pairs i.e. Ω = {&lt; m, n &gt; | &lt; m, n &gt; ∈ ω × ω and m &lt; n}. Then, let s ij = p sim (simscore|m, n), which represents the similarity score between sen- tences m and n and |S| equals to the number of sentences in a given document. Here, the indicator variable w mn indicates if the two sentences m and n are topic transition sentences. Essentially, when two sentences have a high similarity score (&gt; 0.5) and are not near (with |S|/θ s or more sentences apart, in our experiments we set θ s to 5), this ob- jective function Θ T tries to set the corresponding indicator variable w mn to 1. Then, we add con- straint 4 to encourage coreferent event mentions to occur in topic transition sentences. Note that ξ m refers to all the event mentions in sentence m, and x ij is the indicator variable which is set to 1 if event mentions defined by index i and j are coreferent. Thus, the above constraint ensures that two topic transition sentences contain at least one coreferent event pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying Topic Transition Sentences Using</head><p>Sentence Similarities: First, we use the unsuper- vised method based on weighted word embedding average proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arora et al. (2016)</ref> to ob- tain sentence embeddings. We first compute the weighted average of words' embeddings in a sen- tence, where the weight of a word w is given by a/(a + p(w)). Here, p(w) represents the estimated word frequency obtained from English Wikipedia and a is a small constant (1e-5). We then compute the first principal component of averaged word embeddings corresponding to sentences in a docu- ment and remove the projection on the first princi- pal component from each averaged word embed- ding for each sentence.</p><p>Then using the resulted averaged word embed- ding as the sentence embedding, we compute the similarity between two sentences as cosine simi- larity between their embeddings. We particularly choose this simple unsupervised model to reduce the reliance on any additional corpus for training a new model for calculating sentence similarities. This model was found to perform comparably to supervised RNN-LSTM based models for the se- mantic textual similarity task.</p><p>Constraints for Avoiding Fragmented Partial Event Chains: The above equations (3-4) con- sider a pair of sentences and encourage two coref- erent event mentions to appear in a pair of topic transition sentences. But the local nature of these constraints can lead to fragmented main event chains. Therefore, we further model the dis- tributional characteristics of global event chains and encourage the main event chains to have a large number of coreferential mentions and a long stretch (the number of sentences that are present in between the first and last event mention of a chain), to avoid creating partial chains. Specif- ically, we add the following objective function (equation 5) and the new constraints (equation 6 and 7):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ΘG = − i,j∈µ γij (5) σij = k&lt;i ¬x ki ∧ j&lt;l ¬x jl ∧ xij σij ∈ {0, 1}<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">Γi = k,i∈Λ x ki + i,j∈Λ xij M (1 − yij) ≥ (ϕ[j] − ϕ[i]).σij − 0.75 (|S|) γij − Γi − Γj ≥ M.yij Γi, Γj, γij ∈ Z; Γi, Γj, γij ≥ 0; yij ∈ {0, 1}<label>(7)</label></formula><p>First, we define an indicator variable σ ij by equation 6 3 , corresponding to each event men- tion pair, that takes value 1 if (1) the event men- tions at index i and j are coreferent; (2) the event mention at index i doesn't corefer to any of the mentions preceding it; and (3) mention at index j doesn't corefer to any event mention following it. Essentially, setting σ ij to 1 defines an event chain that starts from the event mention i and ends at the event mention j.</p><p>Then with equation 7, variable σ ij is used to identify main event chains as those chains which are extended to at least 75% of the document. When a chain is identified as a global chain, we encourage it to have more coreferential mentions. Here, Γ i (Γ j ) equals the sum of indicator vari- ables x corresponding to event pairs that include the event mention at index i (j) i.e. the number of mentions that are coreferent to i (j), ϕ[i] (ϕ <ref type="bibr">[j]</ref>) represents the sentence number of event mention i (j), M is a large positive number and y ij repre- sents a slack variable that takes the value 0 if the event chain represented by σ ij is a global chain. Given σ i,j is identified as a global chain, variable γ ij equals the sum of variables Γ i and Γ j and is used in the objective function Θ G (equation 5) to encourage more coreferential mentions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Cross-chain Inferences</head><p>As illustrated through <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, semantically re- lated events tend to have their mentions co-occur within the same sentence. So, we define the ob- jective function (equation 8) and constraints (9) to favor a sentence with a mention from one event chain to also contain a mention from another event chain, if the two event chains are known to have event mentions co-occur in several other sen- tences.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ΘC = − m,n∈Ω Φmn (8) Φmn = i∈ξm,j∈ξn xij |ξm| &gt; 1; |ξn| &gt; 1; Φmn ∈ Z; Φmn ≥ 0<label>(9)</label></formula><p>To do so, we first define a variable φ mn that equals the number of coreferent event pairs in a sentence pair, with each sentence having more than one event mention. We then define Θ C to minimize the negative sum of φ mn . Following the previous notations, ξ m in the above equation represents the event mentions in sentence m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Modeling Segment-wise Distributional Patterns</head><p>The position of an event mention in a document has a direct influence on event coreference chains. Event mentions that occur in the first few para- graphs are more likely to initiate an event chain. On the other hand, event mentions in later parts of a document may be coreferential with a previously seen event mention but are extremely unlikely to begin a new coreference chain. This distributional association is even stronger in the journalistic style of writing. We model this through a simple objec- tive function and constraints (equation 10).</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ΘD = − i∈ξm,j∈ξn xij + k∈ξp,l∈ξq x kl s.t. m, n &lt; α|S||; p, q &gt; β|S|| α ∈ [0, 1]; β ∈ [0, 1]<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Specifically, for the event pairs that belong to the first α (or the last β) sentences in a document, we add the negative (positive) sum of their indicator variables (x) in objective function Θ D . The equation 10 is meant to inhibit coreference links between event mentions that exist within the latter half of document. They do not influence the links within event chains that start early and extend till the later segments of the document.</p><p>It is also important to understand that position- based features used in entity coreference resolu- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Haghighi and Klein, 2007)</ref> are usually de- fined for an entity pair. However, we model the distributional patterns of an event chain in a docu- ment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Restraining Subevents from Being</head><p>Included in Coreference Chains Subevents are known to be a major source of false coreference links due to their high surface similar- ity with their parent events. Therefore, we discour- age subevents from being included in coreference chains in our model and modify the global opti- mization goal by adding a new objective function (equation 11).</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ΘS = s∈S Γs (11)</formula><p>where S represents the set of subevents in a docu- ment. We define the objective function Θ S as the sum of Γ s , where Γ s equals the number of men- tions that are coreferent to s. Then our goal is to minimize Θ S and restrict the subevents from being included in coreference chains. We identify probable subevents by using sur- face syntactic cues corresponding to identifying a sequence of events in a sentence <ref type="bibr">(Badgett and Huang, 2016)</ref>. In particular, a sequence of two or more verb event mentions in a conjunction struc- ture are extracted as subevents.</p></div>

But we determined that this corpus is not appropriate for evaluating our ILP model that explicitly focuses on using discourse level topic structures for event coreference resolution. Particularly, the ECB+ cor- pus was created to facilitate both cross-document and in- document event coreference resolution research. Thus, the documents in the corpus were grouped based on several com- mon topics and in each document, event mentions and coref- erence relations were only annotated selectively in sentences that are on a common topic. When the annotated sentences in each document are stitched together, they do not well reveal the original document structure, which makes the ECB+ cor- pus a bad choice for evaluating our approach. In addition, due to the selective annotation issue, in-document event coref- erence resolution with the ECB+ corpus is somewhat easier than with the KBP corpus, which partly explained the signif- icant differences of published in-document event coreference resolution results on the two corpora. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Each discussion forum document consists of a series of posts in an online discussion thread, which lacks coherent discourse structures as a regular document. Therefore, only news articles in the KBP corpora are appropriate for evaluat- ing our approach.</p><p>6 KBP 2015 dataset consists of 181 and 179 documents from discussion forum and news articles respectively. We randomly picked 50 documents from news articles for tun- ing ILP hyper-parameters and remaining 310 documents for training classifiers. news articles from the official KBP 2016 and 2017 evaluation corpora 7 respectively. For direct com- parisons, the results reported for the baselines, in- cluding the previous state-of-the-art model, were based on news articles in the test datasets as well.</p><p>We report the event coreference resolution re- sults based on the version 1.8 of the official KBP 2017 scorer. The scorer employs four coreference scoring measures, namely B 3 (Bagga and Bald- win, 1998), CEAF e (Luo, 2005), MUC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Vilain et al., 1995)</ref> and BLANC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Recasens and Hovy, 2011</ref>) and the unweighted average of their F1 scores (AV G F 1 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Event Mention Identification</head><p>Lu and Ng <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2017)</ref>   We use an ensemble of multi-layer feed forward neural network classifiers to identify event men- tions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Choubey and Huang, 2017b</ref>). All basic clas- sifiers are trained on features derived from the lo- cal context of words. The features include the em- bedding of word lemma, absolute difference be- tween embeddings of word and its lemma, prefix and suffix of word and pos-tag and dependency re- lation of its context words, modifiers and governor.</p><p>We trained 10 classifiers on same feature sets with slightly different neural network architec- tures and different training parameters including dropout rate, optimizer, learning rate, epochs and network initialization. All the classifiers use relu, tanh and softmax activations in the input, hidden and output layers respectively. We use GloVe vec- tors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) for word embed- dings and one-hot vectors for pos-tag and depen- dency relations in each individual model. Pos- tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recog- nition and entity coreference resolution are per- formed using Stanford CoreNLP ( ) <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows the event mention identification results. We report the F1 score for event mention identification based on the KBP scorer, which con- siders a mention correct if its span, type and sub-  type are the same as the gold mention and assigns a partial score if span partially overlaps with the gold mention. We also report the event mention identification F1 score that only considers men- tion spans and ignores mention types. We can see that compared to the recent system by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lu and Ng, 2017</ref>) which conducts joint inferences of both event mention detection and event coreference res- olution, detecting types for event mentions is a major bottleneck to our event extraction system. Note that the official KBP 2017 event coref- erence resolution scorer considers a mention pair coreferent if they strictly match on the event type and subtype, which has been discussed recently to be too conservative ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mitamura et al., 2017)</ref>. But since improving event mention type detection is not our main goal, we therefore relax the con- straints and do not consider event mention type match while evaluating event coreference resolu- tion systems. This allows us to directly inter- pret the influences of document structures in the event coreference resolution task by overlooking any bias from upstream tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Baseline Systems</head><p>We compare our document-structure guided event coreference resolution model with three baselines. Local classifier performs greedy merging of event mentions using scores predicted by the local pair- wise coreference resolution classifier. An event mention is merged to its best matching antecedent event mention if the predicted score between the two event mentions is highest and greater than 0.5. Clustering performs spectral graph clustering (Pe- dregosa et al., 2011), which represents commonly used clustering algorithms for event coreference resolution. We used the relation between the size of event mentions and the number of coref- erence clusters in training data for pre-specifying the number of clusters. Its low performance is par- tially accounted to the difficulty of determining the number of coreference clusters. Joint learning uses a structured conditional ran- dom field model that operates at the document level to jointly model event mention extraction, event coreference resolution and an auxiliary task of event anaphoricity determination. This model has achieved the best event coreference resolution performance to date on the KBP 2016 corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lu and Ng, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Our Systems</head><p>We gradually augment the ILP baseline with ad- ditional objective functions and constraints de- scribed in sub-sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.4. In all the systems below, we combine ob- jective functions with their corresponding coeffi- cients (as described in sub-section 4.3). The Basic ILP System formulates event corefer- ence resolution as an ILP optimization task. It uses scores produced by the local pairwise classi- fier as weights on variables that represent ILP as- signments for event coreference relations. (Equa- tions 1, 2). +Topic structure incorporates the topical structure and the characteristics of main event chains in baseline ILP system (Equations 1-5). +Cross-chain adds constraints and objective func- tion defined for cross-chain inference to the Topi- cal structure system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Equations 1-8)</ref>. +Distribution further adds distributional patterns to the Cross-chain system (Equations 1-10). +Subevent (Full) optimizes the objective function defined in equation 12 by considering all the con- straints defined in 1-11, including constraints for modeling subevent structures. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows performance comparisons of our ILP systems with other event coreference resolu-tion approaches including the recent joint learning approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lu and Ng, 2017)</ref> which is the best per- forming model on the KBP 2016 corpus. For both datasets, the full discourse structure augmented model achieved superior performance compared to the local classifier based system. The improve- ment is observed across all metrics with average F1 gain of 3.1 for KBP 2016 and 2.17 for KBP 2017. Most interestingly, we see over 28% im- provement in MUC F1 score which directly eval- uates the pairwise coreference link predictions. This implies that the document level structures, in- deed, helps in linking more coreferent event men- tions, which otherwise are difficult with the local classifier trained on lexical and surface features. Our ILP based system also outperforms the pre- vious best model on the KBP 2016 corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lu and Ng, 2017)</ref> consistently using all the evalua- tion metrics, with an overall improvement of 1.21 based on the average F1 scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Results and Analysis</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>, we also report the F1 scores when we increasingly add each type of structure in the ILP baseline. Among different scoring metrics, all structures positively contributed to the MUC and BLANC scores for KBP 2016 corpus. However, subevent based constraints slightly reduced the F1 scores on KBP 2017 corpus. Based on our prelim- inary analysis, this can be accounted to the simple method applied for subevent extraction. We only extracted 31 subevents in KBP 2017 corpus com- pared to 211 in KBP 2016 corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Discussions on Generalizability</head><p>The correlations between event coreference chains and document topic structures are not specific to news articles and widely exist. Several main dis- tributional characteristics of coreferent event men- tions, including 1) main event coreference chains often have extended presence and have mentions scattered across segments, and 2) semantically correlated events often have their respective event mentions co-occur in a sentence, directly apply to other sources of texts such as clinical notes. But certain distributional characteristics are genre spe- cific. For instance, while it is common to observe more coreferent event mentions early on in a news article, coreference chains in a clinical note of- ten align well with pre-defined segments like the history of present illness, description of a visit and treatment plan. Thus, the objective functions and constraints defined in equations 1-8 can be directly applied for other domains as well, while other structures like segment-wise distributional patterns may require alteration based on domain- specific knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and the Future Work</head><p>We have presented an ILP based joint inference system for event coreference resolution that uti- lizes scores predicted by a pairwise event corefer- ence resolution classifier, and models several as- pects of correlations between event coreference chains and document level topic structures, includ- ing the correlation between the main event chains and topic transition sentences, interdependencies among event coreference chains, genre-specific coreferent mention distributions and subevents. We have shown that these structures are generaliz- able by conducting experiments on both the KBP 2016 and KBP 2017 datasets. Our model outper- formed the previous state-of-the-art model across all coreference scoring metrics. In the future, we will explore the use of additional discourse struc- tures that correlate highly with event coreference chains. Moreover, we will extend this work to other domains such as biomedical domains.</p><p>Allison <ref type="bibr">Badgett and Ruihong Huang. 2016.
