			<abstract>
				<p>In the proposed doctoral work we will design an end-to-end approach for the challenging NLP task of text-level discourse parsing. Instead of depending on mostly hand-engineered sparse features and independent components for each subtask, we propose a unified approach completely based on deep learning architectures. To train more expressive representations that capture communicative functions and semantic roles of discourse units and relations between them, we will jointly learn all discourse parsing subtasks at different layers of our architecture and share their intermediate representations. By combining unsupervised training of word embed-dings with our layer-wise multi-task learning of higher representations we hope to reach or even surpass performance of current state-of-the-art methods on annotated English corpora.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Modern algorithms for natural language process- ing (NLP) are based on statistical machine learn- ing and require a computationally convenient rep- resentation of input data. Unfortunately real-world plain text is usually represented as an unstruc- tured sequence of words with complex relations between them. Therefore it is extremely impor- tant to discover good representations in the form of informative text features.</p><p>In NLP such features are almost always hand- engineered sparse features and require expensive human labor and expert knowledge to construct. They are usually based on lexicons or features extracted by other NLP subtasks and have the form of hand-engineered extraction rules, regular expressions, lemmatization, part-of-speech (POS) tags, positions or lengths of arguments, tense forms, syntactic parse trees, and similar. Although such features are specific for a given language, do- main, and task, they work well enough for sim- ple NLP tasks, like named entity recognition or POS tagging. Nevertheless, the ability to learn text features and representations automatically would have a lot of potential to improve state-of-the-art performance on more challenging NLP tasks, such as text-level discourse parsing. This may even be more important for languages where progress in NLP is still lacking.</p><p>Variants of deep learning architectures have been shown to provide a different approach to learning in which latent features are automatically learned as distributed dense vectors. They man- aged to represent meaningful relations with word <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Collobert, 2011</ref>), POS and dependency tag <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen and Manning, 2014</ref>), sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Guo and Diab, 2012)</ref>, and document <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Socher et al., 2012</ref>) embed- dings and achieved surprising results for a number of NLP tasks. It has been shown that both unsuper- vised pre-training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hinton et al., 2006</ref>) and multi- task learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collobert and Weston, 2008</ref>) signif- icantly improve their performance in the absence of hand-engineered features. This makes them es- pecially interesting for the problem of text-level discourse parsing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Text-level discourse parsing</head><p>In natural language, a piece of text meant to com- municate specific information, function, or knowl- edge (clauses, sentences, or even paragraphs) is called a discourse. They are often understood only in relation to other discourse units (at any level of grouping) and their combination creates a joint meaning larger than individual unit's mean- ing alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref>. Discourse parsing is the task of determining how these units are related to each other (like in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) and plays a central role in a num-ber of high-impact natural language processing (NLP) applications, including text summarization, sentence compression, sentiment analysis, and question-answering. For analyzing different per- spectives of discourse analysis researchers pro- posed a number of theoretical frameworks and re- leased annotated corpora, such as RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Carlson et al., 2003)</ref> and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Prasad et al., 2008)</ref>. Both of these decompose discourse pars- ing into a few subtasks and, like in most of NLP, their success depends on expert knowledge of each subtask and hand-engineering of more powerful features <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Feng and Hirst, 2012;</ref>), representations, and heuristics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Joty et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prasad et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Despite recent progress in automatic discourse segmentation and sentence-level parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fisher and Roark, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Joty et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Soricut and Marcu, 2003</ref>), text-level discourse parsing re- mains a significant challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Feng and Hirst, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014;</ref>). Traditional hand-engineering approaches unfortu- nately seem to be insufficient, as discourses and relations between them do not follow any strict grammar or obvious rules.</p><p>Two main theoretical frameworks with English corpus have been proposed to capture different rhetorical characteristics, and serve different ap- plications.</p><p>The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Prasad et al., 2008</ref>) is currently the largest discourse- annotated corpus, consisting of 2159 articles from Wall Street Journal. It strives to maintain a theory-neutral approach by adopting the predicate- argument view and independence of discourse re- lations. In it either explicitly or implicitly given discourse connectives, such as coordinating con- junction (e.g. "and", "but"), subordinating con- junction (e.g. "if", "because"), or discourse ad- verbial (e.g. "however", "also"), combine pairs of discourse arguments into relations. For PDTB- style discourse parsing, extracting argument spans seems to be the most difficult subtask ( ), resulting in the best overall performance of only 34.80% in F 1 -measure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kong et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>The RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Carlson et al., 2003</ref>) follows the theoretical frame- work of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref>. It contains 385 annotated documents from the Wall Street Journal with 18 high-level categories and 110 fine-grained rela- tions. Any coherent text can be represented as a RST discourse tree structure (like in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) whose leaves are minimal non-overlapping text spans called elementary discourse units. Adja- cent nodes are joined depending on their discourse relations to form a tree. In a mono-nuclear dis- course relation one of the text spans is the nucleus, which is more salient than the satellite, while in a multi-nuclear relation all text spans are equally important for interpretation. Performance of RST- style discourse parsing is evaluated based on their ability to locate spans of text that serve as argu- ments (best 85.7% in F 1 -measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Feng and Hirst, 2012)</ref>), identify which of the arguments is the nu- cleus (best 71.1% in F 1 -measure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014)</ref>), and tag the sense and location of dis- course relations (best 61.6% in F 1 -measure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related work</head><p>Early work on linguistic and computational discourse analysis produced several theoretical frameworks and one of the most influential is Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref>. In order to automatically build a hierarchical structure of a text, first approaches (Marcu, 2000) relied mainly on discourse markers, hand-engineered rules, and heuristics. Learning- based approaches were first applied to identify within-sentence discourse relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Soricut and Marcu, 2003)</ref>, and only later to cross-sentence text-level relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005</ref>). They largely focused on lexical, syntac- tic, and structural features, but the close rela- tionship between discourse structure and seman- tic meaning suggests that this may not be suf- ficient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Prasad et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Subba and Di Eugenio, 2009</ref>). Further work on discourse pars- ing focused first on having a binary classifier for determining whether two adjacent discourse units should be merged, followed by a multi-class classifier for determining which discourse rela- tion should be assigned to the new subtree <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(DuVerle and Prendinger, 2009)</ref>. Improved results <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Feng and Hirst, 2012)</ref> have been achieved by incorporating rich linguistic features <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hernault et al., 2010)</ref>, including lexical semantics, and spe- cific discourse production rules ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lin et al., 2009</ref>). An alternative approach is based on jointly per- forming detection and classification in a bottom-</p></div>

It has been shown that constituent-and dependency-based syntax and features based on coreference links improve performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Surdeanu et al., 2015</ref>). The first PDTB-style end-to-end dis- course parser ( ) uses a connec- tive list to identify explicit candidates, followed by simple features and parse trees to extract ar- guments and identify discourse relations. Classi- fying implicit discourse relations can be improved by combining distributed representations of parse trees with coreferent entity mentions (Ji and Eisen- stein, 2015). Extracting discourse arguments has been attempted by using classic linear word tag- ging with conditional random fields and global features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ghosh et al., 2012</ref>), identifying nodes in constituent subtrees ( ), and hybrid merging and pruning of parse trees with integer linear programming ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kong et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Deep learning architectures consist of multiple layers of simple learning blocks stacked on each other and, when well trained, tend to do a bet- ter job at disentangling the underlying factors of variation. Beginning with raw data, its represen- tation is transformed into increasingly higher and more abstract forms in each layer, until the final low-dimensional features or representation useful for a given task is reached. Their success is possi- ble with breakthroughs and improvements in train- ing techniques (like AdaGrad or Adam optimiza- tion, rectifier function, dropout regularization) and with initialization using unsupervised pre-training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hinton et al., 2006</ref>; Collobert, 2011) on massive datasets (such as Wikipedia or Wall Street Jour- nal). Pre-training helps deep networks to develop natural abstractions and combined with multi-task learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collobert and Weston, 2008</ref>) it can sig- nificantly improve their performance in the ab- sence of hand-engineered features.</p><p>Classic feed-forward architectures are inappro- priate for processing text documents, because of their variable length and natural representation as a sequence of words. One approach to solve this is to specify a transition-based processing mech- anism <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen and Manning, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014</ref>) and train a neural network classifier to make parsing decisions. Recurrent neural net- works (RNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Elman, 1990)</ref> or their generaliza- tion, recursive neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Goller and Küchler, 1996)</ref>, represent a more direct approach by re- cursively applying the same set of weights over the sequence (temporal dimension) or structure (tree- based). <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Li et al. (Li et al., 2015)</ref> have recently showed that only some NLP tasks benefit from recursive models applied on syntactic parse trees and recurrent models seem to be sufficient for dis- course parsing. By stacking multiple hidden lay- ers into a deep RNN makes them represent a tem- poral hierarchy with multiple layers operating at different time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013)</ref>. Learning to store information over ex- tended time intervals has been achieved with long short-term memory (Hochreiter and Schmidhu- ber, 1997), time delay neural network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Waibel et al., 1989)</ref>, or neural Turing machines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Graves et al., 2014</ref>). Bidirectional variants of these mod- els can incorporate information from preceding as well as following tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Schuster and Paliwal, 1997</ref>). Recursive neural networks have also been shown to support different task-specific rep- resentations, such as matrix-vector representation of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Socher et al., 2012</ref>) or recurrent neu- ral tensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Socher et al., 2013</ref>). For our discourse parsing task such deeper models, that can learn abstract representations on different time scales, might better model the discourse re- lations between input vectors and (hopefully) cap- ture their communicative functions and semantic meaning.</p><p>A few initial attempts of applying representa- tion learning to our task have already shown sub- stantial performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji and Eisenstein (Ji and Eisenstein, 2014</ref>) implement a shift-reduce discourse parser on top of given RST-style discourse units to simultaneously learn parsing and a discourse- driven projection of features using support vector machines with gradient-based updates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al. (Li, 2014</ref>) produce a distributed representation of RST-style discourse units using recursive convolu- tion on sentence parse trees and apply a classifier to determine relations between them. Ji and Eisen- stein ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014</ref>) also improved clas- sification of PDTB-style implicit discourse rela- tions by combining distributed representations of parse trees with coreferent entity mentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Contribution to science</head><p>Because text-level discourse parsing is an impor- tant, yet still challenging NLP task, it is the focus of our doctoral dissertation.</p><p>Method for text-level discourse parsing. Instead of depending on mostly hand-engineered sparse features and independent separately- developed components for each subtask, we propose a unified end-to-end approach for text- level discourse parsing completely based on deep learning architectures. First each of the discourse parsing subtasks, such as argument boundary detection, labeling, discourse relation identification and sense classification, need to be formulated in terms of RNNs and similar derivable learning architectures. To benefit from their ability to learn intermediate representations they will be partially stacked on top of each order, such that the last but one layer (i.e. output layer) for each subtask is shared with other subtasks. By placing increasingly more difficult subtasks at different layers in one deep architecture, they can benefit from each others intermediate representations, improve robustness and training speed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> further combines unsupervised training of word embeddings with our layer-wise multi-task learning of higher representations and illustrates our goal of a unified end-to-end approach for text-level discourse parsing utilizing different layers of representations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Work plan</head><p>To accomplish this we will, on one hand, need to find the best deep learning models for each of the discourse parsing subtasks, suitable architecture, activation functions, and figure out how to adapt them to operate on sequential data and with each other. This includes analyzing deep learning archi- tectures, identifying their strengths, useful compo- nents, and their suitability for our NLP task.</p><p>Afterwards combine them into one unified deep learning architecture with shared intermediate rep-resentations and unsupervised training of word embeddings. Developing a prototype for shal- low discourse parsing will open the door for find the best initialization procedures, training func- tions, learning rates, and similar. Shallow PDTB- style discourse parsing is also a challenge on this years CoNLL 2015 conference, where adjacent text spans are not necessarily connected with dis- course relations to form a tree.</p><p>Additionally we will experiment with new and more expressive representations and structures (like neural tensor networks) that could capture communicative functions and semantic roles of discourse units and relations between them.</p><p>Even though our method could be applied to any plain text, we plan on evaluating it on stan- dard annotated English corpora. After applying our approach on at lest one of the corpora, we intend to qualitatively analyze the identified dis- course units and relations between them to gain in- sights about its strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, the dataset will allow us to also quan- titatively compare its performance to current state- of-the-art methods. The procedure for our method will begin by pre-training the weights in our deep architecture on external unlabeled datasets (like Wikipedia), than jointly train on all discourse pars- ing subtasks on the training set, use a separate val- idation set to optimize hyper-parameters, and es- timate its performance on the test set. For eval- uation purposes standard evaluation measures for subtasks based on F 1 -scores will be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>To increase the generality of our unified end-to- end approach for text-level discourse parsing, we will try to depend as little as possible on back- ground knowledge in the form of hand-engineered features for a specific language, domain, or task. By incorporating various improvements in auto- matic learning of features and representations we hope to reach or even surpass performance of cur- rent state-of-the-art methods on annotated English corpora.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Illustration of our unified end-to-end approach for text-level discourse parsing with layerwise multi-task learning of higher representations.</figDesc></figure>
