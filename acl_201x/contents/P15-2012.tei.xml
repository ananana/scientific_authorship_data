				<p>This paper describes an experiment to elicit referring expressions from human subjects for research in natural language generation and related fields, and preliminary results of a computational model for the generation of these expressions. Unlike existing resources of this kind, the resulting data set-the Zoom corpus of natural language descriptions of map locations-takes into account a domain that is significantly closer to real-world applications than what has been considered in previous work, and addresses more complex situations of reference, including contexts with different levels of detail, and instances of singular and plural reference produced by speakers of Spanish and Portuguese.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the computational task of producing adequate natural language descriptions (e.g., pronouns, definite de- scriptions, proper names, etc.) of domain entities. In particular, the issue of how to determine the se- mantic contents of definite descriptions (e.g., 'the Indian restaurant on 5th street', 'the restaurant we went to last night', etc.) has received significant attention in the field, and it is also the focus of the present work.</p><p>The input to a REG algorithm is a context set C containing an intended referent r and a number of distractor objects. All objects are represented as attribute-value pairs representing either atomic (type-restaurant) or relational (on-5thstreet) prop- erties ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Krahmer and Theune, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krahmer et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Viethen et al., 2013)</ref>. The expected output is a uniquely identi- fying list L of properties known to be true of r so that L distinguishes r from all distractors in C ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dale and Reiter, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Properties are selected for inclusion in L ac- cording to multiple -and often conflicting -cri- teria, including discriminatory power (i.e., the ability to rule out distractors) as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dale, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gardent, 2002</ref>), domain preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pechmann, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gatt et al., 2013</ref>) and many others. A de- scription that conveys more information than what is strictly required for disambiguation is said to be overspecified ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arts et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koolen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">van Gompel et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Engelhardt and Ferreira, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Engelhardt et al., 2011</ref>). For a review of the research challenges in REG, see .</p><p>Existing approaches to REG largely consist of algorithmic solutions, many of which have been influenced by, or adapted from, the Dale &amp; Reiter Incremental algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dale and Reiter, 1995)</ref>. The use of machine learning (ML) techniques, by contrast, seems to be less frequent than in other NLG tasks, although a number of exceptions do exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jordan and Walker, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Viethen and Dale, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Viethen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Garoufi and Koller, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014)</ref>).</p><p>A possible explanation for the small interest in ML for REG may be the relatively low availabil- ity of data. While research in many fields may benefit from the wide availability of text corpora (e.g., obtainable from the web), research in REG usually requires highly specialised data -hereby called REG corpora -conveying not only refer- ring expressions produced by human speakers, but also a fully-annotated representation of the con- text (i.e., all objects and their semantic properties) within which the expressions have been produced.</p><p>REG corpora such as TUNA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gatt et al., 2007</ref>) and GRE3D3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dale and Viethen, 2009</ref>) are useful both to gain general insights on human language production, and to benefit from data-intensive computational techniques such as ML. However, being usually the final product of controlled ex- periments involving human subjects, REG cor-pora tend to address highly specific research ques- tions. For instance, GRE3D3 is largely devoted to the investigation of relational referring expres- sions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006</ref>) in simple visual scenes involving geometric shapes, as in 'the large ball next to the red cube'. As a result, and despite the usefulness of these resources to a large body of work in REG, further research questions will usu- ally require the collection of new data.</p><p>In this paper we introduce the Zoom corpus of referring expressions. Zoom addresses a domain that is considerably closer to real-world applica- tions (namely, city maps in different degrees of detail represented by zoom levels) than what has been considered in previous work, involving both singular and plural reference, and making exten- sive use of relational properties. Moreover, Zoom descriptions were produced by both Spanish and Portuguese speakers, which will allow (to the best of our knowledge, for the first time) a comprehen- sive study of the REG surface realisation subtask in these languages, and enable research on the is- sues of human variation in REG ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fabbrizio et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altamirano et al., 2012;</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>TUNA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gatt et al., 2007</ref>) was the first promi- nent REG corpus to be made publicly available for research purposes. The corpus was developed in a series of controlled experiments, containing 2280 atomic descriptions produced by 60 speakers of English in two domains (1200 descriptions of furniture items and 1080 descriptions of people's photographs). TUNA has been used in a series of REG shared tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gatt et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>GRE3D3 and its extension GRE3D7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dale and Viethen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Viethen and Dale, 2011</ref>) were de- veloped in a series of web-based experiments pri- marily focussed on the study of relational descrip- tions. GRE3D3 contains 630 descriptions pro- duced by 63 speakers, and GRE3D7 contains 4480 descriptions produced by 287 speakers. In both cases, the language of the experiment was English. The domain consists of simple visual scenes con- veying boxes and spheres.</p><p>Stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Teixeira et al., 2014</ref>) and its extension Stars2 were collected for the study of referential overspecification. Stars contains 704 descriptions produced by 64 speakers in a web-based exper- iment. Stars2 was produced in dialogue situa- tions involving subject pairs, and it contains 884 descriptions produced by 56 speakers. Both do- mains make use of simple visual scenes containing up to four object types (e.g., stars, boxes, cones and spheres) and include atomic and relational de- scriptions alike. The language of both experiments was Brazilian Portuguese.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiment</head><p>We designed a web-based experiment to collect natural language descriptions of map locations in both Spanish and Portuguese. The collected data set comprises a corpus of referring expressions for research in REG and related fields. The situations of reference under consideration make use of map scenes in two degrees of detail (represented by low and high zoom levels), and address instances of singular and plural reference. A fragment of the experiment interface is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Subjects</head><p>Volunteers were recruited upon invitation sent by email. The Portuguese data had 93 participants, being 66 (71.0%) male and 27 (29.0%) female. The Spanish data had 80 participants, being 59 male (69.4%) and 26 female (30.6%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Procedure</head><p>Subjects received a web link to the on-line experi- ment interface (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) with self-contained in- structions. Age and gender details were collected for statistical purposes. The experiment consisted of a series of map images presented in random or- der, one by one. Each map scene showed a partic- ular location (e.g., a restaurant, pub, theatre etc.) pointed by an arrow. For each scene, subjects were required to imagine that they were giving travel advice to a friend, and to complete the sentence 'It would be interesting to visit...' with a description of the location pointed by the arrow. After press- ing a 'Next' button, another stimulus was selected, until the end of the experiment. The first two im- ages were fillers solely intended to make subjects familiar with the experiment setting, and the cor- responding responses were not recorded. Incom- plete trials, and ill-formed descriptions, were also discarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Materials</head><p>The experiment made use of the purpose-built in- terface illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, and a set of map im- ages obtained from OpenStreetMap 1 , which con- sisted of selected portions of maps of Madrid and Lisbon to be presented to Spanish and Portuguese speakers, respectively. For each city, 10 map lo- cations were used. Each location was shown in low and high zoom levels, making 20 images in total. In both cases, the intended target was kept the same, but the more detailed version would dis- play a larger number of distractors and additional details in general. In addition to that, certain street and landmark names might not be depicted at dif- ferent zoom levels. Half images showed a single arrow pointing to one map location (i.e., requir- ing a single description as 'the restaurant on Baker street'), whereas the other half showed two arrows pointed to two different locations (and hence re- quiring a reference to a set, as in 'the two restau- rants near the museum').</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Data collection</head><p>Upon manual verification, 602 ill-formed Por- tuguese descriptions and 366 Spanish descriptions were discarded. Thus, the Portuguese subcor- pus consists of 1358 descriptions, and the Span- ish subcorpus consists of 1234 descriptions. In the Portuguese subcorpus, 78.6% of the descrip- tions include relational properties. In addition to that, 36.4% were minimally distinguishing, 44.3% were overspecified, and 19.3% were underspeci- fied. In the Spanish subcorpus, 70% of the de- scriptions include relational properties, 35% were minimally distinguishing, 40% were overspeci- fied, and 25% were underspecified. Underspeci- fied descriptions are not common in existing REG corpora (i.e., certainly not in this proportion), which may reflect the complexity of the domain and/or limitations of the web-based setting.</p><p>1 openstreetmap.org</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Annotation</head><p>Each referring expression was modelled as con- veying a description of the main target object and, optionally, up to four descriptions of related land- marks. The annotation scheme consisted of three target attributes, four landmark attributes for each of the four possible landmark objects, and seven relational properties. This makes 26 possible at- tributes for each referring expression. In the case of plural descriptions (i.e., those involving two tar- get objects), this attribute set is doubled.</p><p>Every object was annotated with the atomic at- tributes type, name and others and, in the case of landmark objects, also with their id. In addition to that, seven relational properties were consid- ered: in/on/at 2 , next-to, right-of, left-of, in-front- of, behind-of, and the multivalue relation between intended to represent 'corner' relations.</p><p>Possible values for the type and name attributes are predefined by each referential context. The others attribute may be assigned any string value, and it is intended to represent any non-standard piece of information conveyed by the expression. For the spatial relations, possible values are the object identifiers available from each scene.</p><p>The collected descriptions were fully annotated by two independent annotators. After completion, a third annotator assumed the role of judge and provided the final annotation. Since the annotation scheme was fairly straightforward (i.e., largely be- cause all non-standard responses were simply as- signed to the others attribute), agreement between judges as measured by <ref type="bibr">Kappa (Cohen, 1960</ref>) was 84% at the attribute level. Both referential con- texts and referring expressions were represented in XML format using a relational version of the format adopted in TUNA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gatt et al., 2007</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> presents a comparison between the col- lected data and existing REG corpora 3 : the num- ber of referring expressions (REs), the number of subjects in each experiment, the number of possi- ble atomic attributes (Attrib.) and possible land- marks (LMs) in a description, the average descrip- tion size (in number of annotated properties), and the proportion of property usage, which is taken to be the proportion of properties that appear in the description over the total number of possible at- tributes and landmarks. From a REG perspective, larger description sizes and lower usage rates may suggest more complex situations of reference. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">REG evaluation</head><p>In what follows we illustrate the use of the Zoom corpus as training and test data for a simple ma- chine learning approach to REG adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014</ref>). The goal of this evaluation is to provide reference results for future comparison with purpose-built REG algorithms, and not to present a complete REG solution for the Zoom domain or others.</p><p>The present model consists of 12 binary clas- sifiers representing whether individual referential attributes should be selected for inclusion in an output description. The classifiers correspond to atomic attributes of the target and first landmark object (type, name and others), and relations. Ref- erential attributes of other landmark objects were not modelled due to data sparsity and also to re- duce computational costs. For similar reasons, the multivalue between relation is also presently disre- garded, and 'corner' relations involving two land- marks (e.g., two streets) will be modelled as two independent classification tasks.</p><p>Only two learning features are considered by each classifier: landmarkCount, which represents the number of landmark objects near the main target, and distractorCount, which represents the number of objects of the same type as the target within the relevant context in the map. For other possible features applicable to this task, see, for instance, (dos Santos <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Silva and Paraboni, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>From the outcome of the 12 binary classifiers, a description is built by considering atomic target attributes in the first place. All attributes that cor- respond to a positive prediction are selected for in- clusion in the output description. Next, relations are considered. If no relation is predicted, the algorithm terminates by returning an atomic de- scription of the main target object. If the descrip- tion includes a relation, the corresponding land- mark object is selected, and the algorithm is called recursively to describe it as well. Since every at- tribute that corresponds to a positive prediction is always selected, the algorithm does not regard uniqueness as a stop condition. As a result, the output description may convey a certain amount of overspecification.</p><p>For evaluation purposes, we used the subset of singular descriptions from the Portuguese portion of the corpus, comprising 821 descriptions. Evalu- ation was carried out by comparing the corpus de- scription with the system output to measure over- all accuracy (i.e., the number of exact matches be- tween the two descriptions), Dice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dice, 1945)</ref> and MASI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Passonneau, 2006</ref>) coefficients.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014</ref>), we built a REG model using support vector machines with radial basis function kernel. The classifiers were trained and tested using 6-fold cross valida- tion. Optimal parameters were selected using grid search as follows: for each step in the main k-fold validation, one fold was reserved for testing, and the remaining k − 1 folds were subject to a sec- ondary cross-validation procedure in which differ- ent parameter combinations were attempted. The C parameter was assigned the values 1, 10, 100 and 1000, and γ was assigned 1, 0.1, 0.001 and 0.0001. The best-performing parameter set was selected to build a classifier trained from the k − 1 fold, and tested on the test data. This was repeated for every iteration of the main cross-validation procedure. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarises the results obtained by the REG algorithm built from SVM classifiers, those obtained by a baseline system representing a rela- tional extension of the Dale &amp; Reiter Incremental Algorithm, and by a Random selection strategy. We compare accuracy scores obtained by ev- ery algorithm pair using the chi-square test, and we compare Dice scores using Wilcoxon's signed- rank test. In terms of overall accuracy, the SVM approach outperforms both alternatives. The dif- ference from the second best-performing algo- rithm (i.e., the Incremental approach) is significant (χ 2 = 79.87, df=1, p&lt;0.0001). Only in terms of Dice scores a small effect in the opposite direction is observed (T=137570.5, p= 0.01413).</p><p>We also assessed the performance of the indi- vidual classifiers. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows these results as measured by precision (P), recall (R), F1-measure (F1) and area under the ROC curve (AUC).  From these results we notice that highly fre- quent attributes (e.g., target type and landmark name) were classified with high accuracy, whereas others (e.g., multivalue attributes and relations) were not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>This paper has introduced the Zoom corpus of nat- ural language descriptions of map locations, a re- source intended to support future research in REG and related fields. Preliminary results of a SVM- based approach to REG -which were solely pre- sented for the future assessment of REG algo- rithms based on Zoom data -hint at the actual complexity of the REG task in this domain in a number of ways. First, we notice that a simi- lar approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014</ref>) on GRE3D3 and GRE3D7 data has obtained consid- erably higher mean accuracy. This is partially ex- plained by the increased complexity of the Zoom domain, but also by the currently simple annota- tion scheme.</p><p>Second, we notice that Zoom descriptions are prone to convey relations between a single target and multiple landmark objects, as in 'the restau- rant between the 5th and 6th streets'. Although common in language use, the use of multiple rela- tional properties in this way has been little investi- gated in the REG field.</p><p>Finally, we notice that the Zoom domain con- tains two descriptions for every target object, which are based on different -but related -mod- els corresponding to the same map location seen at different zoom levels. Interestingly, the refer- ring expression in a 1X situation may or may not be the same as in a 2X situation. Consider a map with higher zoom level (2X) as illustrated in the previous <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, and the same map location as seen with lower zoom level in the previous <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: Map with a more detailed zoom level</head><p>The underlying models for these two maps are certainly different, but not unrelated. The map with 2X zoom contains fewer objects but may in- clude more properties due to the added level of de- tail. The referring expression for the target in the 1X map may or may not be the same as in the 2X map. For instance, the referring expression "the pub at Cowgate" is underspecified on the 1X map, but it is minimally distinguishing on the 2X map.</p><p>Differences of this kind are common in inter- active applications (e.g., in which the context of reference may change in structure or in the num- ber of objects and referable properties), and the challenge for REG algorithms would be to pro- duced an appropriate description for the modified context without starting from scratch. REG algo- rithms based on local context partitioning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Areces et al., 2008)</ref> may have an advantage in this respect, but further investigation is still required.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experiment interface</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,308.69,320.50,215.44,148.10" type="bitmap" /></figure>
