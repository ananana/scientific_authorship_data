				<p>Annotation corpus for discourse relations benefits NLP tasks such as machine translation and question answering. In this paper, we present SciDTB, a domain-specific discourse treebank annotated on scientific articles. Different from widely-used RST-DT and PDTB, SciDTB uses dependency trees to represent discourse structure, which is flexible and simplified to some extent but do not sacrifice structural integrity. We discuss the labeling framework, annotation workflow and some statistics about SciDTB. Furthermore , our treebank is made as a benchmark for evaluating discourse dependency parsers, on which we provide several base-lines as fundamental work.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Discourse relation depicts how the text spans in a text relate to each other. These relations can be categorized into different types according to semantics, logic or writer's intention. Annota- tions of such discourse relations can benefit many down-stream NLP tasks including machine trans- lation ) and automatic summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gerani et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Several discourse corpora have been proposed in previous work, grounded with various discourse theories. Among them Rhetorical Structure The- ory TreeBank (RST-DT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carlson et al., 2003)</ref> and Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Prasad et al., 2007)</ref> are the most widely-used resources. PDTB focuses on shallow discourse relations between two arguments and ignores the whole organiza- tion. RST-DT based on Rhetorical Structure The- ory (RST) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref> represents a text into a hierarchical discourse tree. Though RST-DT provides more comprehensive discourse information, its limitations including the introduc- tion of intermediate nodes and absence of non- projective structures bring the annotation and pars- ing complexity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yoshida et al. (2014)</ref> both realized the problems of RST-DT and introduced dependency structures into discourse representa- tion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Stede et al. (2016)</ref> adopted dependency tree format to compare RST structure and Seg- mented Discourse Representation Theory(SDRT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lascarides and Asher, 2008</ref>) structure for a cor- pus of short texts. Their discourse dependency framework is adapted from syntactic dependency structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hudson, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Böhmová et al., 2003)</ref>, with words replaced by elementary discourse units (EDUs). Binary discourse relations are repre- sented from dominant EDU (called "head") to sub- ordinate EDU (called "dependent"), which makes non-projective structure possible. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yoshida et al. (2014)</ref> mainly fo- cused on the definition of discourse dependency structure and directly transformed constituency trees in RST-DT into dependency trees. On the one hand, they only simply treated the transforma- tion ambiguity, while constituency structures and dependency structures did not correspond one-to- one. On the other hand, the transformed corpus still did not contain non-projective dependency trees, though "crossed dependencies" actually ex- ist in the real flexible discourse structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Wolf and Gibson, 2005</ref>). In such case, it is essential to construct a discourse dependency treebank from scratch instead of through automatically convert- ing from the constituency structures.</p><p>In this paper, we construct the discourse de- pendency corpus SciDTB <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . based on scientific ab- stracts, with the reference to the discourse de-pendency representation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al. (2014)</ref>. We choose scientific abstracts as the corpus for two reasons. First, we observe that when long news ar- ticles in RST-DT have several paragraphs, the dis- course relations between paragraphs are very loose and their annotations are not so meaningful. Thus, short texts with obvious logics become our pref- erence. Here, we choose scientific abstracts from ACL Anthology 2 which are usually composed of one passage and have strong logics. Second, we prefer to conduct domain-specific discourse anno- tation. RST-DT and PDTB are both constructed on news articles, which are unspecific in domain coverage. We choose the scientific domain that is more specific and can benefit further academic applications such as automatic summarization and translation. Furthermore, our treebank SciDTB can be made as a benchmark for evaluating dis- course parsers. Three baselines are provided as fundamental work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Annotation Framework</head><p>In this section, we describe two key aspects of our annotation framework, including elementary dis- course units (EDU) and discourse relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Elementary Discourse Units</head><p>We first need to divide a passage into non- overlapping text spans, which are named elemen- tary discourse units (EDUs). We follow the cri- terion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Polanyi (1988)</ref> and Irmer (2011) which treats clauses as EDUs.</p><p>However, since a discourse unit is a semantic concept but a clause is defined syntactically, in some cases segmentation by clauses is still not the most proper strategy. In practice, we refer to the guidelines defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carlson and Marcu, 2001</ref>). For example, subjective clauses, objective clauses of non-attributive verbs and verb comple- ment clauses are not segmented. Nominal post- modifiers with predicates are treated as EDUs. Strong discourse cues such as "despite" and "be- cause of " starts a new EDU no matter they are fol- lowed by a clause or a phrase. We give an EDU segmentation example as follows.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Discourse relation category of SciDTB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">[Despite bilingual embeddings success,][the contextual information][which is of critical</head><p>importance to translation quality,][was ig- nored in previous work.]</p><p>It is noted, as in Example 1, there are EDUs which are broken into two parts (in bold) by rel- ative clauses or nominal postmodifiers. Like RST, we connect the two parts by a pseudo-relation type Same-unit to represent their integrity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Discourse Relations</head><p>A discourse relation is defined as tri-tuple (h, d, r), where h means the head EDU, d is the dependent EDU, and r defines the relation cat- egory between h and d. For a discourse rela- tion, head EDU is defined as the unit with essen- tial information and dependent EDU with support- ive content. Here, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carlson and Marcu (2001)</ref> to adopt deletion test in the determination of head and dependent. If one unit in a binary re- lation pair is deleted but the whole meaning can still be almost understood from the other unit, the deleted unit is treated as dependent and the other one as the head.</p><p>For the relation categories, we mainly refer to the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carlson and Marcu, 2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bunt and Prasad, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the dis- course relation set of SciDTB, which are not ex- plained detailedly one by one due to space limita- tion. Through investigation of scientific abstracts, we define 17 coarse-grained relation types and 26 fine-grained relations for SciDTB.</p><p>It is noted that we make some modifications to adapt to the scientific domain. For example, In SciDTB, Background relation is divided into three For example, entity tags in Wikipedia data define some word boundaries.</p><p>In this paper we adopt partial-label learning with conditional random fields to make use of this knowledge for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation.</p><p>The basic idea of partial-label learning is to optimize a cost function that marginalizes the probability mass in the constrained space that encodes this knowledge.</p><p>By integrating some domain adaptation techniques, such as EasyAdapt, our result reaches an F-measure of 95.98 % on the CTB-6 corpus. subtypes: Related, Goal and General, because the background description in scientific abstracts usu- ally has more different intents. Meanwhile, for at- tribution relation we treat the attributive content rather than act as head, which is contrary to that defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carlson and Marcu, 2001</ref>), because sci- entific facts or research arguments mentioned in attributive content are more important in abstracts. For some symmetric discourse relations such as joint and comparison, where two connected EDUs are equally important and have interchangeable se- mantic roles, we follow the strategy as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al., 2014</ref>) and treat the preceding EDU as the head.</p><p>Another issue on coherence relations is about polynary relations which involve more than two EDUs. The first scenario is that one EDU dom- inates a set of posterior EDUs as its member. In this case, we annotate binary relations from head EDU to each member EDU with the same rela- tion. The second scenario is that several EDUs are of equal importance in a polynary relation. For this case, we link each former EDU to its neigh- boring EDU with the same relation, forming a re- lation chain similar to "right-heavy" binarization transformation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Morey et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>By assuring that each EDU has one and only one head EDU, we can obtain a dependency tree for each scientific abstract. An example of depen- dency annotation is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Corpus Construction</head><p>Following the annotation framework, we col- lected 798 abstracts from ACL anthology and con- structed the SciDTB corpus. The construction de- tails are introduced as follows.</p><p>Annotator Recruitment To select annotators, we put forward two requirements to ensure the an- notation quality. First, we required the candidates to have linguistic knowledge. Second, each can- didate was asked to join a test annotation of 20 abstracts, whose quality was evaluated by experts. After the judgement, 5 annotators were qualified to participate in our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDU Segmentation</head><p>We performed EDU seg- mentation in a semi-automatic way. First, we did sentence tokenization on raw texts using NLTK 3.2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bird and Loper, 2004</ref>). Then we used SPADE (Soricut and Marcu, 2003), a pre-trained EDU segmenter relying on Charniak's syntactic parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Charniak, 2000)</ref>, to automatically cut sentences into EDUs. Then, we manually checked each seg- mented abstract to ensure the segmentation qual- ity. Two annotators conducted the checking task, with one proofreading the output of SPADE, and the other reviewing the proofreading. The check- ing process was recorded for statistical analysis.</p><p>Tree Annotation Labeling dependency trees was the most labor-intensive work in the corpus construction. 798 segmented abstracts were la- beled by 5 annotators in 6 months. 506 abstracts were annotated more than twice separately by dif- ferent annotators, with the purpose of analysing annotation consistency and providing human per- formance as an upper bound. The annotated trees were stored in JSON format. For convenience, we developed an online tool 3 for annotating and visu- alising discourse dependency trees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Corpus Statistics</head><p>SciDTB contains 798 unique abstracts with 63% labeled more than once and 18,978 discourse rela- tions in total. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> compares the size of SciDTB with RST-DT and another PDTB-style domain- specific corpus <ref type="bibr">BioDRB (Prasad et al., 2011</ref>), we can see SciDTB has a comparable size with RST- DT. Moreover, it is relatively easy for SciDTB to augment its size since the dependency structure simplifies the annotation to some extent. Com- pared with BioDRB, SciDTB has larger size and passage-level representations.    <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Distribution of dependency distance.</p><p>LAS) are employed to measure the labeling cor- respondence. UAS calculates the proportion of EDUs which are assigned the same head in two annotations, while LAS considers the uniformity of both head and relation label. Cohen's Kappa score evaluates the agreement of labeling relation types under the premise of knowing the correct heads. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows the agreement results between two annotators. We can see that most of the LAS values between annotators exceed 0.60. The agreement on tree structure reflected by UAS all reaches 0.75. The Kappa values for relation types agreement keep equal to or greater than 0.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Structural Characteristics</head><p>Non-projection in Treebank One advantage of dependency trees is that they can represent non- projective structures. In SciDTB, we annotated 39 non-projective dependency trees, which account for about 3% of the whole corpus. This phe- nomenon in our treebank is not so frequent as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Wolf and Gibson, 2005</ref>). We think this may be because scientific abstracts are much shorter and scientific expressions are relatively restricted.</p><p>Dependency Distance Here we investigate the distance of two EDUs involved in a discourse re- lation. The distance is defined as the number of EDUs between head and dependent. We present the distance distribution of all the relations in SciDTB, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. It should be noted that ROOT and Same-unit relations are omitted in this analysis. From <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, we find most relations connect near EDUs. Most relations (61.6%) occur between neighboring EDUs and about 75% rela- tions occur with at most one intermediate EDU.</p><p>Although most dependency relations function intra-sentence, there exist long-range dependency relations in the treebank. On average, the dis- tance of 8.8% relations is greater than 5. We sum- marize that the most frequent 5 fine-grained rela-tion types of these long-distance relations belong to Evaluation, Aspect, Addition, Process-step and Goal, which tend to appear on higher level in de- pendency trees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Benchmark for Discourse Parsers</head><p>We further apply SciDTB as a benchmark for comparing and evaluating discourse dependency parsers. For the 798 unique abstracts in SciDTB, 154 are used for development set and 152 for test set. The remaining 492 abstracts are used for train- ing. We implement two transition-based parsers and a graph-based parser as baselines.</p><p>Vanilla Transition-based Parser We adopt the transition-based method for dependency parsing by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Nivre (2003)</ref>. The action set of arc-standard system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nivre et al., 2004</ref>) is employed. We build an SVM classifier to predict most possible transi- tion action for given configuration. We adopt the N-gram features, positional features, length fea- tures and dependency features for top-2 EDUs in the stack and top EDU in the buffer, which can be referred from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wang et al., 2017)</ref> Two-stage Transition-based Parser We imple- ment a two-stage transition-based dependency parser following ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. First, an un- labeled tree is produced by vanilla transition-based approach. Then we train a separate SVM classifier to predict relation types on the tree in pre-order. For the 2nd-stage, apart from features in the 1st- stage, two kinds of features are added, including depth of head and dependent in the tree and the predicted relation between the head and its head.</p><p>Graph-based Parser We implement a graph- based parser as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al., 2014</ref>). For simplic- ity, we use averaged perceptron rather than MIRA to train weights. N-gram, positional, length and dependency features between head and dependent labeled with relation type are considered.</p><p>Hyper-parameters During training, the hyper- parameters of these models are tuned using de- velopment set. For vanilla transition-based parser, we take linear kernel for the SVM classifier. The penalty parameter C is set to 1.5. For two-stage parser, the 1st-stage classifier follows the same setting as the vanilla parser. For 2nd-stage, we use the linear kernel and set C to 0.5. The averaged perceptron in graph-based parser is trained for 10 epochs on the training set. Weights of features are</p></div>

We also measure parsing accuracy with UAS and LAS. The human agreement is presented for compar- ison. With the addition of tree structural fea- tures in relation type prediction, the two-stage de- pendency parser gets better performance on LAS than vanilla system on both development and test set. Compared with graph-based model, the two transition-based baselines achieve higher accuracy with regard to UAS and LAS. Using more effec- tive training strategies like MIRA may improve graph-based models. We can also see that human performance is still much higher than the three parsers, meaning there is large space for improve- ment in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we propose to construct a discourse dependency treebank SciDTB for scientific ab- stracts. It represents passages with dependency tree structure, which is simpler and more flexible for analysis. We have presented our annotation framework, construction workflow and statistics of SciDTB, which can provide annotation experi- ence for extending to other domains. Moreover, this treebank can serve as an evaluating bench- mark of discourse parsers.</p><p>In the future, we will enlarge our annotation scale to cover more domains and longer passages, and explore how to use SciDTB in some down- streaming applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example discourse dependency tree for an abstract in SciDTB.</figDesc></figure>

4.1 Annotation Consistency 

EDU Segmentation We use 214 abstracts for 
analysis. After the proofreading of the first anno-
tator, the abstracts are composed of totally 2,772 
EDUs. Among these EDUs, only 28 (1.01%) 
EDUs are disagreed and revised by the second an-
notator, which means a very high consensus be-
tween annotators on EDU segmentation.
