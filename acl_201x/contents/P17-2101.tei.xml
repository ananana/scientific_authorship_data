				<p>This paper describes an approach to determine whether people participate in the events they tweet about. Specifically, we determine whether people are participants in events with respect to the tweet times-tamp. We target all events expressed by verbs in tweets, including past, present and events that may occur in the future. We present new annotations using 1,096 event mentions, and experimental results showing that the task is challenging.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Twitter has quickly become one of the most popu- lar social media sites: it has 313 million monthly active users, and 500 million tweets are published daily. People tweet about breaking news, world and local events (e.g., eclipses, road closures), and personal events ranging from important life events (e.g., graduating from college) to mundane events such as commuting and attending a party.</p><p>People tweet not only about events in which they participate, but also events in which they do not participate but are somehow relevant (e.g., John Doe may tweet about his nephew graduating from college). More specifically, people can par- ticipate in the events they tweet about (underlining indicates events of interest below) prior to tweet- ing (e.g., When I come back to London, I realise how much I miss living here), while tweeting (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Nope</ref>. Not yet. Still in my car, enjoying traffic), or after tweeting (e.g., Can't wait to fly home this summer). In the third example, it is not guaran- teed that fly will occur, so one can only say that the author will probably participate in fly.</p><p>In this paper, we determine whether people par- ticipate in the events they tweet about. More specifically, we determine whether they are par- ticipants before tweeting, while tweeting and after tweeting, and define event participants as people directly involved in an event, regardless of whether they are the agent, recipient or play another role. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) an- notations using 1,096 events from 826 tweets; (b) analysis showing that authors of tweets are often not participants in the events they tweet about be- fore or after tweeting; and (c) experimental results showing that the task can be automated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Previous Work</head><p>Most previous efforts on detecting events from Twitter focus on events of general importance (e.g., death of a celebrity, natural disasters) or ma- jor life events of individuals (e.g. John Doe getting married, having a baby, being promoted).</p><p>Extracting events of general importance often includes extracting the entities involved, date and location, and classifying events into classes such as trial, product launch or death ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ritter et al., 2012)</ref>. Exploiting redundancy in tweets to ex- tract events is common ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Zhou et al., 2014)</ref>, as well as spatio-temporal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Cheng and Wicks, 2014)</ref>, i.e., when and where tweets originate from.</p><p>Extracting major life events consists on pin- pointing significant events from mundane events (e.g., having lunch, exercising) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Di Eugenio et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dickinson et al., 2015)</ref>, and determining whether significant events are rele- vant to Twitter users (e.g., Why doesn't John marry Mary already? [not relevant to the author]).</p><p>Unlike these previous efforts, the work pro- posed here determines whether people participate in the events they tweet about, and specifies when with respect to tweet timestamps. As a result, we target past events, ongoing events, and events likely to occur in the future. Additionally, we tar- get all events regardless of importance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Corpus Creation</head><p>We created a corpus of tweets, events and annota- tions indicating whether and when the authors of tweets participate in the events as follows. Selecting Tweets and Events. First, we collected 5,017 tweets from corpora released by previous projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Owoputi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ritter et al., 2011</ref>). Second, we run an event de- tector to tag tokens that are events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ritter et al., 2012)</ref>. Third, we selected as events all tokens tagged as events that are verbs. Fourth, we filtered out tweets that did not contain pronouns I, me or we in order to target tweets that are likely to dis- cuss events that involve the author. Finally, we run a dependency parser for tweets ( <ref type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014</ref>). We decided to work with an automated event de- tector and parser to experiment with a system that could be deployed in the real world, and discarded events that are nouns because manual inspection revealed that the event detector makes many more mistakes with nouns than with verbs.</p><p>The steps above resulted in 1,096 events from 826 tweets. The part-of-speech tags of events are as follows: VBP: 553 (verb, non-3rd person sin- gular present), VBG: 345 (verb, gerund or present participle), VBN: 198 (verb, past participle). Annotation Process and Quality. For each event in each tweet, we asked annotators "Is the author of the tweet a participant in the event?" Dur- ing pilot annotations with two graduate students, it became clear that a major source of disagree- ments was due to annotators answering the ques- tion for different times with respect to the tweet timestamp. After discussing errors, we decided to ask for five answers: over 24 hours and within 24 hours before tweeting, when tweeting (tweet timestamp), and within 24 hours and over 24 hours after tweeting. Additionally, we allow for six an- swers partially inspired by previous work on fac- tuality (Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2009):</p><p>• cYes, cNo: I am certain that the author is (or is not) a participant in the event.</p><p>• pYes, pNo: It is probably the case that the author is (or is not) a participant in the event.</p><p>• unk: the question is intelligible, but none of the four labels above would be correct.</p><p>• inv: the event at hand is not an event.</p><p>The temporal spans and labels were tuned until the two annotators obtained 0.70 Kappa agreement with 10% of selected events. Kappa agreement between 0.60 and 0.80 is considered substantial agreement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Landis and Koch, 1977)</ref>. After tuning, the remaining events were annotated once. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Corpus Analysis</head><p>In this section, we present a corpus analysis con- sisting of label distribution per temporal span, la- bel distribution for the top 5 most frequent events, and label distribution per part-of-speech tag. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> plots percentages of each label per temporal span. Overall (bottom bar), 28.1% of answers are cYes, and 46.7% are cNo, i.e., an- notators are certain that the author of the tweet is or is not a participant in the event. Percent- ages for pYes and pNo are much lower: 11.4% and 2.9%. Regarding time spans, people do not usually tweet about events in which they partic- ipate while tweeting (cYes: 33.4% vs. cNo: 54.5%). People are more likely to tweet about  events in which they participated within the last 24 hours (39.1%) than longer before (26.6%), and after tweeting (24.9% and 16.8%). Finally, the percentages of pYes and pNo are below 2% for tweet timestamp. Intuitively, it is easier to deter- mine whether somebody participates in the event he tweets about when tweeting rather than before or after. Percentages for labels that do not indicate event participation (unk and inv) are low: unk ranges from 0.91% to 1.91%, and inv is 9.5% for all spans. inv is often used for automatically de- tected events that are actually states, e.g., been.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, we portray the label distribution for the top 5 frequent events and all temporal spans. The top 3 most frequent events (love, hate and miss) have the highest percentages of cYes and pYes labels (&gt; 80% combined), and the fourth most frequent verb (see) a lower percent- age (cYes: 42.4%, pYes: 22.4%). Need has a high percentage of inv (47.1%). This is due to the fact the need is often a state (e.g., Look, I need less friends more bread, less talk, more head), and asking whether the author is a participant in the event before, during or after the tweet timestamp is nonsensical. 28.8% and 31.5%), in- dicating that the author is likely to participate in such events. VBG (gerund or present participle) has highest percentage of cNo + pNo (61.1%), in- dicating that the author is not likely to participate in those events.</p><p>Annotation Examples. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> presents real an- notation examples. In Tweet (1), annotators under- stood that the author has certainly been addicted to Twitter for 24 hours before and after tweet- ing, and probably longer. The author of Tweet <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> was clearly talking about YOU before but not af- ter tweeting; annotators indicated that talking most likely occurred within 24 hours before tweeting. The annotations in Tweet (3) indicate that the au- thor was certainly a participant of selling when he tweeted and within 24 hours after tweeting, and probably also within 24 hours before and over 24 hours after. Event seeing in Tweet (4) may occur next week, and annotations capture this informa- tion (all cNo except 24h after, which is pYes). Finally, the author of Tweet (5) was never a partic- ipant in scrapbooking despite she witnessed it.</p><p>Note that the annotations also provide informa- tion regarding event durations, e.g., addicted in Tweet (1) is likely ongoing a day after, but talk- ing in Tweet (2) has ended and was a short event.</p><p>Tweet before tweet after ≥24h &lt;24h ts. &lt;24h ≥24h 1 I'm so addicted to Twitter now that I can tweet all the time. Not good.</p><p>pYes cYes cYes cYes pYes 2 I wonder if you realize we were talking about YOU. pNo cYes cNo cNo cNo 3 I'm selling my snorkle, text me for details. cNo pYes cYes cYes pYes 4 @Genuine Will I be seeing you at #typeamom next week? cNo cNo cNo cNo pYes 5 Today the mall was full of moms who love scrapbooking. kill me. cNo cNo cNo cNo cNo  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>We follow a standard supervised machine learning approach. We divided the 826 tweets into train- ing and test splits (80% / 20%), and created an in- stance for each event and temporal span (1,096 × 5 = 5,480 instances). We trained a Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel per temporal span us- ing scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and tuned SVM parameters (C and γ) using 5-fold cross- validation with the training set. We report results when evaluating with the test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Feature Selection</head><p>The feature set is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Most features are fairly simple and well-known, but we borrow some features from previous work on identifying situation entity types ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Friedrich et al., 2016)</ref> and include features especially designed to capture context around the event we work with. Event features include the actual event (word form and part-of-speech tag) and number of to- kens to left of the event. Situation Entities fea- tures further characterize the event at hand. To extract them, we first retrieve the clause contain- ing the event by collecting all tokens to the left of the event until we reach a token that is not a verb (including auxiliaries), a modal, or adverb. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Friedrich et al. (2016)</ref> propose many more fea- tures for identifying situation entities, but we se- lected those that are useful for our task: fine event tense, flag indicating whether the event is in per- fect tense (past perfect, present perfect, etc.), the type of modals present in the verb clause (if any), whether the event is in a list of 88 reporting verbs, and the WordNet lexical file containing the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Miller, 1995)</ref>. Finally, Context features mostly indicate the presence of pronouns in the tweet. Specifically, we include the position of any pro- noun with respect to the event, and a specializa- tion of this feature for pronouns I, me, and we. We also extract the number of outgoing dependencies from the event, and whether one of those depen- dencies is between the event and a pronoun I, me or we. Note that the dependency parser for tweets extracts untyped dependencies ( <ref type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014</ref>), thus we have available information about syntac- tic dependents but not about specific syntactic re- lationships (nsubj, dobj, auxpass, etc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experimental Results</head><p>Results obtained in the test split with several com- binations of features are depicted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The baseline always predicts the majority label (cNo for all temporal spans), and is outperformed by all feature combinations.</p><p>Feature ablation experiments show (a) little im- provement with respect to only training with Event features, i.e., the simplest features, and (b) that the optimal combination of features depends on the temporal span for which author participation is being predicted. More specifically, including Sit- uation Entities features yields the same results for</p><note type="other">Label ≥24h Before &lt;24h Before tweet timestamp &lt;24h After ≥24h After</note><formula xml:id="formula_0">P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F</formula><p>Baseline cNo 0.45 1.00 0.62 0.38 1.00 0.55 0.50 1.00 0.67 0.33 1.00 0.49 0.39 1.00 0.56 others 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Avg.</p><p>0.20 0.45 0.28 0.15 0.38 0.21 0.25 0.50 0.34 0.11 0.33 0.16 0.15 0.   Note that while the results with Event features are only outperformed for some temporal spans when training with all features, information be- yond the event at hand is needed to solve this task. For example, the correct labels for I love living in NYC and I miss living in NYC are different (living is an ongoing and past event respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented a corpus and machine learning models to predict whether people participate in the events they tweet about. More specifically, we de- termine whether people participate in events when they tweet about them, and also before and after.</p><p>Unlike most previous work, we target any event in a tweet regardless of its importance. While ma- jor life events (e.g., graduating from college) are arguably more important, we believe that mundane events (e.g., studying for an exam) provide key in- formation to retrieve major life events and predict future events, e.g., studying for an exam is (most probably) more likely to lead to graduating from college than going to parties on a regular basis.</p><p>Experimental results show that the task can be automated but is challenging. We believe that fea- tures derived from subsequent tweets by the same author and tweet replies would yield better results, and plan to incorporate them in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Label distribution per temporal span.
