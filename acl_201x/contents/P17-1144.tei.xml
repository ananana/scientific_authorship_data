				<p>This paper presents ArgRewrite, a corpus of between-draft revisions of argumentative essays. Drafts are manually aligned at the sentence level, and the writer&apos;s purpose for each revision is annotated with categories analogous to those used in argument mining and discourse analysis. The corpus should enable advanced research in writing comparison and revision analysis, as demonstrated via our own studies of student revision behavior and of automatic revision purpose prediction.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Most writing-related natural language process- ing (NLP) research focuses on the analysis of single drafts. Examples include document-level quality assessment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Attali and Burstein, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burstein and Chodorow, 1999)</ref>, discourse-level analysis and mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burstein et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Falakmasir et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Persing and Ng, 2016)</ref>, and fine-grained error detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Leacock et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Grammarly, 2016)</ref>. Less studied is the analysis of changes between drafts -a comparison of re- visions and the properties of the differences. Re- search on this topic can support applications invol- ing revision analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman, 2015)</ref>, paraphrase (Malakasiotis and Androutsopoulos, 2011) and correction detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Swanson and Yamangil, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Xue and Hwa, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Although there are some corpora resources for NLP research on writing comparisons, most tend to be between individual sentences/phrases for tasks such as paraphrase comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dolan and Brockett, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tan and Lee, 2014</ref>) or gram- mar error correction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dahlmeier et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yannakoudakis et al., 2011</ref>). In terms of revi- sion analysis, the most relevant work analyzes Wikipedia revisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bronner and Monz, 2012)</ref>; however, the do- main of Wikipedia is so specialized that the prop- erties of Wikipedia revisions do not correspond well with other kinds of texts.</p><p>This work presents the ArgRewrite corpus 1 to facilitate revision analysis research for argumen- tative essays. The corpus consists of a collec- tion of three drafts of essays written by univer- sity students and employees; the drafts are man- ually aligned at the sentence level, then the pur- pose of each revision is manually coded using a revision schema closely related to argument min- ing/discourse analysis. Within the domain of argu- mentative essays, the corpus will be useful for sup- porting research in argumentative revision analy- sis and the application of argument mining tech- niques. The corpus may also be useful for re- search on paraphrase comparisons, grammar error correction, and computational stylistics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Popescu and Dinu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Flekova et al., 2016)</ref>. In this pa- per, we present two example uses of our corpus: 1) rewriting behavior data analysis, and 2) automatic revision purpose classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Corpus Design Decisions</head><p>Consider this scenario: Alice begins her social sci- ence argumentative essay with the sentence "Elec- tronic communication allows people to make con- nections beyond physical limits."</p><p>An analytical system might (rightly) identify the sentence as the thesis of her essay, and an eval- uative system might give the essay a low score due to this sentence's vagueness and a later lack of ev- idence (though Alice may not know why she re- ceived that score). Now suppose in a revised draft, Alice expanded the sentence: "Electronic communication allows people to make connections beyond physical lim- its location and enriches connections that would have been impossible to make otherwise." An analytical system would still identify the sentence as the thesis, and an evaluative system might raise the overall score a little higher. Alice may become satisfied with the increase and move on. However, there is an opportunity lost -neither the analytical nor the evaluative system addressed the quality of her revision.</p><p>A revision analysis system might be helpful for Alice because it would link "limits" to "location and ..." and identify the reason why she made the change -perhaps adding precision. If Alice had intended her change as a way to add evidential support for her thesis, she would see that her at- tempt was not as successful as she hoped.</p><p>The above scenario highlights the application of a revision analysis system. This paper is about cre- ating a corpus to enable the development of such systems. Because this is a relatively new problem, there are many possible ways for us to design the corpus. Here we discuss some of our decisions.</p><p>First, we need to define the unit of revision. The example above illustrates a phrase-aligned revi- sion. While this offers a fairly precise definition of the scope of a revision, it may be difficult to achieve consistent annotations. For example, the changes may not adhere to any syntactic linguistic unit. For this first corpus, we define our unit of re- vision to be at the sentence level. In other words, even if a pair of sentences contains multiple edits, the entire sentence pair will be annotated as one sentence revision.</p><p>Second, we need to define the quality we want to observe about the revision sentence pair. For this first corpus, we focus on recognizing the pur- pose of the revision, as in the example above. It is a useful property, and it has previously been stud- ied by others in the literature. People have consid- ered both binary purpose categories such as Con- tent vs. Surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Faigley and Witte, 1981)</ref> or Fac- tual vs. Fluency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bronner and Monz, 2012)</ref> as well as more fine-grained categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pfeil et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jones, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Liu and Ram, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman, 2015)</ref>. Our corpus follows the two-tiered schema used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Zhang and Litman, 2015</ref>) (see Section 3.2).</p><p>Third, we not only have to decide on the annota- tion format, we also need to decide how to obtain Write Draft1 @home</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Annotated</head><p>Revisions II (Rev23) <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Our collected corpus contains five com- ponents: three drafts of an essay and two anno- tated revisions between drafts.</p><p>the raw text: argumentative essays with multiple drafts. We decided to sample from a population of predominantly college students, inclusive of both native and proficient non-native (aka L2) speakers.</p><p>Comparing to high school students, college stu- dents are expected to produce essays having a bet- ter organization of the argument elements. Includ- ing native and L2 speakers allows for the explo- ration of possible rewriting differences between writers of varying backgrounds. We decided to give all subjects the same writing prompt and col- lect three drafts. The identical prompt minimizes the impact of topic difference for argumentation- related study. The collection of three drafts allows for a comparison of revision differences at differ- ent stages of rewriting.</p><p>Finally, we need a method for eliciting two re- vised drafts from each writer. Ideally, an instructor would give formative feedback after each draft for each student, but we do not have the resources to carry out such an expensive project. We simulate instructor feedback by asking students to add more examples after the first draft. To elicit a second re- vised draft, we use two different systems. First, we utilize an idealized 2 version of the ArgRewrite revision analysis system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zhang et al., 2016)</ref>. Ar- gRewrite highlights the locations of revisions at the sentence level and colors the revisions dif- ferently according to the revision purpose types. Our second system shows a character-based com- parison between subsequent essay drafts 3 . This system is designed to have a similar look as Ar- gRewrite by highlighting the location of revisions. However, the type of revisions are not provided.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The ArgRewrite Corpus</head><p>Based on the above design decisions, we have developed a corpus of argumentative essays with three drafts and detailed annotations for sentence- aligned revisions between each consecutive pair of drafts. The main corpus has five elements, with the relationships between them shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>; Section 3.1 describes the procedure for obtaining them. Section 3.2 briefly describes the revision schema we used and reports the inter-annotator agreement. Additionally, we have collected meta- data from the participants who contributed to the corpus (discussed in Section 3.3); these data may be useful for user behavior analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Corpus Development Procedure</head><p>We have recruited 60 participants aged 18 years and older, among whom 40 were English native speakers and 20 were non-native speakers with sufficient English proficiency. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The study to col- lect the corpus is carried out in three 40-60 minute sessions over the duration of two weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Draft1</head><p>Each participant begins by completing a pre-study questionnaire (Section 3.3) and writing a short essay online. Participants are instructed to keep the essay around 400 words, making a single main point with two supporting examples. They are given the following prompt:</p><p>"Suppose you've been asked to contribute a short op-ed piece for The New York Times. Argue whether the proliferation of electronic 4 i.e., with a TOEFL score higher than 100.</p><p>communications (e.g., email, text or other so- cial media) enriches or hinders the develop- ment of interpersonal relationships."</p><p>Draft2 A few days later, participants are asked to revise their first draft online based on the fol- lowing feedback: Strengthen the essay by adding one more example or reasoning for the claim; then add a rebuttal to an opposing idea; keep the essay at 400 words. With this feedback we try to push participants to make revisions for later processing by the two interfaces used to create Draft3.</p><p>Annotated Revisions I (Rev12) The two drafts are semi-manually aligned at the sentence level. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Then, the purpose of each pair of sentence revision is manually coded by a trained annotator, follow- ing the annotation guideline (see Section 3.2).</p><p>Draft3 Participants write their third draft in a lab environment. This time, they are not given addi- tional instructional feedback. Instead, participants are shown a computer interface that highlights the differences between their first and second drafts. They are asked to revise and create a third draft to improve the general quality of their essay. We experimented with two variations of revision elic- itation. Chosen at random, half of the participants (10 L2 participants and 20 Native participants) are shown Interface A, the interface based on the Ar- gRewrite system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zhang et al., 2016)</ref>, which high- lights the annotated differences between the drafts <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>(a)); half of the participants are shown In-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Draft1 Revision Purpose Draft2 Revision Purpose Draft3</formula><p>This world has no restriction on who one can talk to.</p></div>

Both interface groups are asked to read a tutorial about their respective in- terfaces before beginning to revise. Participants in group A are also asked to verify the manually an- notated revision purposes between their first and second drafts. This information is collected to in- vestigate the impact of the difference between the system's recognized and the participant's intended purpose. After completing the final revision, all participants are given a post-study survey about their experiences (Section 3.3). Additionally, par- ticipants in group A are asked to verify the au- tomatically predicted revision purposes between their second and third drafts (Section 4.2).</p><p>Annotated Revisions II (Rev23) Regardless of which interface the participants used, the second and third draft are compared and annotated by the trained annotator in the same process as before. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Figure 2(a) has two additional categories. Precision was intended to represent revisions that make a sentence more precise. Unknown was intended to represent revisions that cannot be categorized to existing categories. These two cate- gories were not used during annotation as they were reported to be confusing in our pilot studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Revision Annotation Guidelines</head><p>Following our prior corpus annotations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman, 2015)</ref>, sentence revisions are first coarsely categorized as Surface or Con- tent changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Faigley and Witte, 1981)</ref>, de- pending on whether any informational con- tent was modified; within each coarse cate- gory, we distinguish between several finer cat- egories based on the argumentative and dis- course writing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kneupper, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Faigley and Witte, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burstein et al., 2003)</ref>. Our adapted schema has three Surface categories (Or- ganization, Word Usage/Clarity, and Conven- tions/Grammar/Spelling) and five Content cate- gories (Claim/Ideas, Warrant/Reasoning/Backing, Rebuttal/Reservation, Evidence, and General Content Development). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows example aligned sentences in three collected drafts and their annotated revision categories. The edit types of revisions (Add, Delete and Modify) are decided according to the alignment of sentences.</p><p>Two annotators (one is experienced, and the other is newly trained) participated in data anno- tation. The annotators first went through a "train- ing" phase where both annotators annotated 5 files and discussed their disagreements to resolve mis- understandings. Then, both annotators separately annotated 10 new files and Kappa was calculated   on the annotation of these 10 new files. The Kappa on this held-out data is 0.84 on the two coarse cate- gories of Surface vs. Content and 0.71 on the eight fine-grained categories that appear in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The disagreements between annotators were removed after discussion and the final labels were used as the gold standard annotation.</p><note type="other">revisions that switched the order of sentences Word Usage/Clarity Fluency revisions that aimed to make the essay more fluent Conventions/Grammar/Spelling Errors revisions that aimed to fix the spelling/grammar mistakes</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Meta-Data</head><p>In addition to the raw text and annotations, the corpus release includes participant meta-data from both a pre-study and a post-study survey.</p><p>Pre-Study Survey The pre-study survey asks for participants' demographic information as well as their self-reported writing background, such as participants' confidence in their writing ability, the number of drafts they typically make, etc. The questions are listed in Appendix A.</p><p>Post-Study Survey The post-study survey con- tains questions about the participants' in-lab revi- sion experience, such as whether they found the computer interface helpful. All questions are an- swered on a scale of 1 to 5, ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". Details of questions are shown in Appendix B. The corpus includes 180 essays: 120 (Draft1 and Draft2) with an average of about 400 words and 60 (Draft3) with an average of around 500 words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Among the 40 native speakers, there were 29 (72.5%) undergraduates, 6 (15%) graduate stu- dents, and 5 (12.5%) non-students (post-docs and lecturers). Among the 20 L2 speakers, there were 4 (20%) undergraduates, and 16 (80%) gradu- ate students; there were 9 Chinese, 2 Bengali, 2 Marathi, 2 Persian, 1 Arabic, 1 Korean, 1 Por- tuguese, 1 Spanish, and 1 Tamil. In terms of disci- pline, 33 participants (55%) were from the natural sciences, 24 (40%) from the social sciences, and 2 (3.3%) from the humanities. 1 participant (1.7%) did not reveal his/her discipline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Public Release</head><p>The corpus is freely available for research usage <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . The first release includes the raw text plus the re- vision annotations and the meta-data. The revi- sion annotations are stored as .xlsx files. There are 60 spreadsheet files for revisions from Draft1 to Draft2 and 60 more spreadsheet files for revi- sions from Draft2 to Draft3. Each spreadsheet file contains two sheets: Old Draft and New Draft. Each row in the sheet represents one sentence in the corresponding draft. The index of the aligned sentence row in the other draft and the type of the revision on the sentence are recorded. The meta- data are in .log text files. Information in the text files are stored using the JSON data format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Example Uses of the Corpus</head><p>While the development of a full fledged revision analysis system is outside the scope of this work, we demonstrate potential uses of our corpus with two examples. We first perform statistical anal- yses on the collected revision data and meta-data  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Rev12 Rev23 Rev12 Rev23  L2 (20)  172  78  163  176  Interface A  91  37  71  85  Interface B  81  41  92  91  Native (40)  334  285  303  246  Interface A  177  154  149  111  Interface B  157  131  154  135   Table 4</ref>: Number of revisions, by participant groups (language, interface), coarse-grain pur- poses, and revision drafts (Rev12 is between Draft1-Draft2; Rev23 is between Draft2-Draft3).</p><p>to understand aspects of participant behavior. We also use the corpus to train a supervised classifier to automatically predict revision purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Student Revision Behavior Analysis</head><p>While it is well-established that thoughtful re- visions improve one's writing, and while many college-level courses require students to submit multiple drafts of writing assignments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addison and McGee, 2010)</ref>, instructors rarely monitor and provide feedback to students while they revise. This is partly due to instructors' time constraints and partly due to their uncertainty about how to support students' revisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cole, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Melzer, 2014)</ref>. There is much we do not know about how to stimulate students to self-reflect and revise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Hypotheses</head><p>Using the ArgRewrite Corpus, we can begin to ask and address some questions about revision habits and behaviors. Our first question is: How do dif- ferent types of revision feedback impact student revision? And relatedly: Does student background (e.g., native vs. L2) make a difference? We thus mine the corpus to test the following hypotheses: H1. There is a difference in participants' re- vising behaviors depending on which interface is used to elicit the third draft.</p><p>H2. For participants who used Interface A, if the recognized revision purpose differs from the participants' intended revision purpose, partici- pants will further modify their revision.</p><p>H3. L2 and native speakers have different be- haviors in making revisions.</p><p>H1 and H2 address the first question; H3 ad- dresses the second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Methodology</head><p>To test the hypotheses, we will use both subjective and objective measures. Subjective measures are based on participant post-study survey answers. Ideally, objective measures should be based on an assessment of improvements in the revised drafts; since we do not have evaluative data at this time, we approximate the degree of improvement using the number of revisions, since these two quanti- ties were demonstrated to be positively correlated ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman, 2015)</ref>. The objective mea- sures are computed from <ref type="table">Tables 4 and 5</ref>.</p><p>To compare differences between specific sub- groups on the subjective and objective measures, we conduct ANOVA tests with two factors. There are multiple factors that can influence the users' rewriting behaviors such as the user's native lan- guage, education level and previous revision be- haviors, etc. In our study, we try to explore the dif- ference between interface groups considering one of the most salient confounding factors: language. We use one factor as the participant's native lan- guage (whether the participant is native or L2) and the other factor as the interface used. To deter- mine correlation between quantitative measures, we conduct Spearman (ρ) and Pearson (r) corre- lation tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>Testing for H1 Comparing Group A and Group B participants, we observe some differences. First, we detect that Group A agrees with the statement "The system helps me to recognize the weakness of my essay" more so than Group B (Group A has a mean rating of 3.97 ("Agree") while Group B's is 3.17 ("Neutral"), p &lt; .003). Second, in Group A, there is a trending positive correlation between the number of revisions 8 from Draft2 to Draft3 and the ratings for the statement "The system en- courages me to make more revisions than I usu- ally make" (ρ=.33 and p &lt; .07); whereas there is no such correlation for Group B. Additional information about revision purposes may elicit a stronger self-reflection response in Group A par- ticipants. In contrast, in Group B, there is a signif- icant negative correlation between the number of Rev12 and ratings for the statement "it is conve- nient to view my previous revisions with the sys- tem" (ρ=-.36 and p &lt; .05). This suggests that the character-based interface is ineffective when par- ticipants have to reflect on many changes. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The results reported are the normalized numbers #revisions #sentences , where #sentences represents the number of sen- tences in the draft before revision.

Another possible explanation is that the system might only motivate the users to make more revisions when the feedback is different from the user's intention. To further verify the correctness of H1, we plan to have the essays graded by experts. The graded scores could allow us to analyze whether essays improved more when Interface A was used.</p><p>Testing for H2 Focusing on the 30 participants from Group A, we check the impact of the feed- back regarding Rev12 on how they subsequently revise (Rev23). We counted the Add and Mod- ify revisions where the participant disagrees with the revision purpose assigned by the annotator in Rev12. Of those, we then count the number of times the corresponding sentences were further re- vised <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . Of the 53 sentences where the participants disagreed with the annotator, 45 were further re- vised in the third draft. The ratio is 0.849, much higher than the overall ratio of general Rev12 re- visions being further revised in Rev23 (161/394 = 0.409) and the ratio of the agreed Rev12 revi- sions being revised in <ref type="bibr">Rev23 (67/341 = 0.196)</ref>. In further analysis, a Pearson correlation test is con- ducted to check the correlation between the num- ber of Rev23 and the number of disagreements for different types of agreement/disagreements, con- trolling for the number of Rev12. We find a nega- 9 Delete revisions were ignored as the deleted sentences are not traceable in Draft3 tive correlation between Rev23 and the number of cases (r=-0.41, p &lt; .03) in which the revisions an- notated as Content are verified by the participants; we also find a positive correlation between Rev23 and the number of cases (r=0.36, p &lt;= .05) in which the revisions annotated as Surface are in- tended to be Content revisions by the participants. Both findings are consistent with H2, suggesting that participants will revise further if they perceive that their intended revisions were not recognized.</p><p>Testing for H3 We observe that native and L2 speakers exhibit different behaviors. First, we tested the difference in Content23 and Surface23 10 between these speaker groups with ANOVA. We observe significant difference in the number of content (p &lt; .02) and surface (p &lt; .03) re- visions made by L2 and native speakers. More specifically, our native speakers make more Con- tent changes while the L2 speakers make more Surface changes. Second, with ANOVA we found a significant interaction effect of the two factors (Group and users' L2 or native status) (p &lt; .021) on their ratings for the statement "the system helps me to recognize the weakness of my essay" with L2 speakers having a stronger Interface A pref- erence. Third, we observe a significant positive correlation in the native group between the num- ber of content revisions in Rev23 and the ratings of the statement "the system encourages me to make more revisions than I usually make" (ρ=.4 and p &lt; .009). This suggests that giving feedback (from either interface) encourages native speakers to make more content revisions. Finally, in the L2 group, there is a significant negative correla- tion between the number of surface revisions in Rev12 and the ratings for the statement "the sys- tem helps me to recognize the weakness of my es-say" (ρ=-.57 and p &lt; .008). This shows that giv- ing feedback to L2 speakers is less helpful when they make more surface revisions. These results are consistent with H3.</p><p>Summary Our findings suggest that feedback on revisions do impact how students review and rewrite their drafts. However, there are many fac- tors at play, including the interface design and the students' linguistic backgrounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Automatic Revision Identification</head><p>Another use of the corpus is to serve as a gold standard for training and testing a revision purpose prediction component for use in an automatic revi- sion analysis system. In the version of ArgRewrite evaluated earlier (Interface A), the manual anno- tation of revision purposes enabled the system to provide revision feedback to users, which moti- vated them to improve their writing (H2). Auto- matic argumentative revision purpose prediction has been previously investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman (2015)</ref>. They developed and reported the performance of a binary classifier for each individ- ual revision category (1 for revisions of the cate- gory and 0 for the rest of all revisions) using fea- tures from prior research. The availability of our corpus makes it possible for researchers to repli- cate such methods and conduct further studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Hypotheses</head><p>In this paper, we repeat the experiment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman (2015)</ref> under different settings to in- vestigate three new hypotheses that can now be investigated given the features of our corpus:</p><p>H4. The method used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman (2015)</ref> for high school writings is also useful for the writings of college students.</p><p>H5. The same revision classification method works differently for first revision attempts and second revision attempts.</p><p>H6. The revision classification model trained on L2 essays has a different preference from the model trained on native essays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Methodology</head><p>We followed the work of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman, 2015)</ref>, where unigram features (words) were used as the baseline and the SVM classifier was used. Besides unigrams, three groups of features used in revision analysis, argument mining and discourse analysis research were extracted (Location, Tex- tual and Language) as in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bronner and Monz, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burstein et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Falakmasir et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>For H4, 10-fold (participant) cross-validation is conducted on all the essays in the corpus. Un- weighted average F-score for each revision cat- egory is reported, using unigram features versus using all features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman (2015)</ref> ob- served a significant improvement over the unigram baseline using all the features. If H4 is true, we should expect a similar improvement over the un- igram baseline using our corpus.</p><p>For H5, 10-fold cross-validation was conducted for the revisions from Draft1 to Draft2 and revi- sions from Draft2 to Draft3 separately. We com- pared the improvement ratio brought by the ad- vanced features over the unigram baseline.</p><p>For H6, we trained two classifiers separately with L2 and native essays with all the features. 20 native participants were first randomly selected as the test data. Afterwards classifiers were trained separately using the 20 L2 participants' essays and the remaining 20 native participants' essays. We would expect that the performance of the two trained classifiers is different on the same test data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>The first two rows of <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> support H4. We ob- serve that the method (SVM + all features) used in Zhang and Litman (2015) significantly improves performance (compared to a unigram baseline) for half of the classification tasks, which is similar to Zhang and Litman's results on high school (pri- marily L1) writing. In our corpus, performance on Claim, Evidence, Rebuttal and Organization was not significantly better than the baseline, possibly due to the limited number of positive training sam- ples for these categories <ref type="table">(Table 5)</ref>. For example, one reason that the performance in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> for Ev- idence might be low is that there are less than 100 Evidence instances in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>For H5, the four rows in the middle of <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> show the difference of the cross-validation results on first attempt revisions and second attempt revi- sions. The earlier results using all the revisions, versus now just using only Rev12 or Rev23 re- visions are similar, which provides little support for H5. With one exception, the features proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang and Litman (2015)</ref> could again signifi- cantly improve the performance over the unigram baseline, for the same set of categories as when using all the revisions. However, for the Conven- tions/Grammar/Spelling category, we did not ob-</p></div>

A possible explanation is that there is a bigger difference in the writers' rewriting behavior from Draft2 to Draft3, which increases the difficulty of prediction. The last two rows of <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> support H6. Inter- estingly, we observe a better performance on War- rant, General and Word Usage/Clarity with a clas- sifier trained and tested using native essays. Per- haps essays of native speakers are more similar to each other when revised along these dimensions. For Conventions/Grammar/Spelling, in contrast, the classifier trained on L2 data yields a better per- formance on the same native test set. This may be because the L2 revisions usually include more spelling/grammar corrections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have presented a new corpus for writing com- parison research. Currently the corpus focuses on essay revisions made by both native and L2 col- lege students. In addition to three drafts of essays, we have analyzed the drafts to align semantically similar sentences and to assign revision purposes for each revised aligned sentence pair. We have also conducted two studies to demonstrate the use of the corpus for revision behavior analysis and for automatic revision purpose classification.</p><p>While in this paper we explored language as one factor influencing rewriting behavior, our cor- pus also contains information about other potential factors such as gender and education level which we plan to investigate in the future. We also plan to augment the corpus to support additional types of research on revision analysis. Some potential augmentations include more fine-grained revision categories, revision properties such as statement strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tan and Lee, 2014</ref>) and quality evalua- tions, and sub-sentential revision scopes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Screenshot of the interfaces.
