				<p>Extra-linguistic factors influence language use, and are accounted for by speakers and listeners. Most natural language processing (NLP) tasks to date, however, treat language as uniform. This assumption can harm performance. We investigate the effect of including demographic information on performance in a variety of text-classification tasks. We find that by including age or gender information, we consistently and significantly improve performance over demographic-agnostic models. These results hold across three text-classification tasks in five languages.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>When we use language, we take demographic factors of the speakers into account. In other words, we do have certain expectations as to who uses "super cute," "rather satisfying," or "rad, dude." Sociolinguistics has long since studied the interplay between demographic factors and lan- guage use <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Labov, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Milroy and Milroy, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Holmes, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Macaulay, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Macaulay, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barbieri, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wieling et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rickford and Price, 2013</ref>, inter alia). 1 These factors greatly in- fluence word choice, syntax, and even semantics.</p><p>In natural language processing (NLP), however, we have largely ignored demographic factors, and treated language as a uniform medium. It was ir- relevant, (and thus not modeled) whether a text was produced by a middle-aged man, an elderly lady, or a teenager. These three groups, how- ever, differ along a whole host of demographic axes, and these differences are reflected in their language use.</p><p>A model that is agnostic to demographic dif- ferences will lose these distinctions, and perfor- mance suffers whenever the model is applied to a new demographic. Historically, the demograph- ics of training and test data (newswire) were rela- tively homogenous, language was relatively uni- form, and information the main objective. Un- der these uniform conditions, the impact of demo- graphics on performance was small.</p><p>Lately, however, NLP is increasingly applied to other domains, such as social media, where language is less canonical, demographic informa- tion about the author is available, and the authors' goals are no longer purely informational. The in- fluence of demographic factors in this medium is thus much stronger than on the data we have tra- ditionally used to induce models. The resulting performance drops have often been addressed via various domain adaptation approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blitzer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Daume III and Marcu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reichart and Rappoport, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Daumé et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Plank and Moschitti, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hovy et al., 2015b</ref>, inter alia). However, the authors and target demograph- ics of social media differ radically from those in newswire text, and domain might in some case be a secondary effect to demographics. In this paper, we thus ask whether we also need demographic adaptation. Concretely, we investigate 1. how we can encode demographic factors, and 2. what effect they have on the performance of text-classification tasks</p><p>We focus on age and gender, and similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bamman et al. (2014a)</ref>, we use distributed word representations (embeddings) conditioned on these demographic factors (see Section 2.1) to incorporate the information.</p><p>We evaluate the effect of demographic informa- tion on classification performance in three NLP tasks: sentiment analysis (Section 2.2), topic de- tection (Section 2.3), and author attribute classifi- cation (Section 2.4). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We compare F 1 -performance of classifiers a) trained with access to demographic information, or b) under agnostic conditions. We find that demographic-aware models consistently outper- form their agnostic counterparts in all tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our contributions</head><p>We investigate the effect of demographic fac- tors on classification performance. We show that NLP systems benefit from demographic aware- ness, i.e., that information about age and gender can lead to significant performance improvements in three different NLP tasks across five different languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>We use data from an international user review website, Trustpilot. It contains information both about the review (text and star rating), as well as the reviewer, in form of a profile. The profile in- cluded a screen name, and potentially information about gender and birth year.</p><p>Since demographic factors are extra-linguistic, we assume that the same effects hold irrespective of language. To investigate this hypothesis, we use data from several languages (Danish, French, and German) and varieties (American English, British English).</p><p>We use data from the countries with most users, i.e., Great Britain, Denmark, Germany, France, and the US. The selection was made based on the availability of sufficient amounts of training data (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for more details). The high number of users in Denmark (one tenth of the country's pop- ulation) might be due to the fact that Trustpilot is a Danish company and thus existed there longer than in other countries. Danish users also provide (in relative terms) more information about them- selves than users of any other country, so that even in absolute numbers, there is oftentimes more in- formation available than for larger countries like France or Germany, where users are more reluc- tant to disclose information. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">While most of this profile information is vol- untary, we have good coverage for both age and USERS AGE GENDER PLACE ALL   UK  1,424k  7%  62%  5%  4%  France  741k  3%  53%  2%  1%  Denmark  671k 23%  87%  17% 16%  US  648k  8%  59%  7%  4%  Germany  329k  8%  47%  6%  4%   Table 1</ref>: Number of users and % per variable per country (after applying augmentations).</p><p>gender. In case of missing gender values, we base a guess on the first name (if given), by choosing the gender most frequently associated with that name in the particular language. We do require that one gender is prevalent (accounting for 95% of all mentions), and that there is enough support (at least 3 attributed instances), though. For age, coverage is less dense, so the resulting data sets are smaller, but still sufficient.</p><p>For more information on Trustpilot as a re- source, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hovy et al. (2015a)</ref>.</p><p>We split each review into sentences, tokenize, replace numbers with a 0, lowercase the data, and join frequent bigrams with an underscore to form a single token.</p><p>For each language, we collect four sub-corpora, namely two for gender (male and female) and two for age (under 35 and over 45). The sub- corpora for the discrete variable gender are rela- tively straightforward (although see ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bamman et al., 2014b)</ref>), but the split for the continuous age variable are less clear. While the effect of age on language use is undisputed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barke, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barbieri, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rickford and Price, 2013)</ref>, providing a clear cut-off is hard. We therefore use age ranges that result in roughly equally sized data sets for both groups, and that are not contiguous.</p><p>For each independent variable (age and gender), we induce embeddings for the two sub-groups (see section 2.1), as well as a "mixed" setting. We also extract labeled data for each task (see sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4). Each of these data sets is ran- domly split into training and test data, 60:40. Note that we do not set any parameters on development data, but instead use off-the-shelf software with default parameters for classification. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> gives an overview of the number of training and test in- stances for each task and both variables (gender and age).</p><p>Note that this setup is somewhat artificial: the vocabulary of the embeddings can subsume the  vocabulary of the tasks (there is some loss due to frequency cut-offs in word2vec). The out-of- vocabulary rate on the tasks is thus artificially low and can inflate results. In a standard "improve- ment over baseline"-setup, this would be problem- atic. However, the results should not be interpreted with respect to their absolute value on the respec- tive tasks, but with respect to the relative differ- ences.  Embeddings are distributed representations of words in a vector space, capturing syntactic and semantic regularities among the words. We learn our word embeddings by using word2vec 3 (Mikolov et al., 2013) on unlabeled review data. Our corpora are relatively small, compared to the language modeling tasks the tool was developed for (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> for the number of instances used for each language and variable). We thus follow the suggestions in the word2vec documentation and use the skip-gram model and hierarchical soft- max rather than the standard continuous-bag-of- words model. This setting penalizes low-frequent words less. All out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are replaced with an "unknown" token, which is represented as the averaged vector over all other words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Conditional Embeddings</head><p>In this paper, we want to use embeddings to capture group-specific differences. We therefore train embeddings on each of the sub-corpora (e.g., male, female, and U35, O45) separately. As comparison, we create a mixed setting. For each variable, we combine half of both sub-corpora (say, men and women) to form a third corpus with no demographic distinction. We also train embeddings on this data. This setting assumes that there are no demographic differences, which is the common approach in NLP to date.</p><p>Since embeddings depend crucially on the 3 https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ size of the available training data, and since we want to avoid modeling size effects, we balance the three corpora we use to induce embeddings such that all three contain the same number of instances. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Note that while we condition the embeddings on demographic variables, they are not task-specific. While general-purpose embeddings are widely used in the NLP community, task-specific embed- dings are known to lead to better results for var- ious tasks, including sentiment analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tang et al., 2014</ref>). Inducing task-specific embeddings car- ries the risk of overfitting to a task and data set, though, and would make it harder to attribute per- formance differences to demographic factors.</p><p>Since we are only interested in the relative dif- ference between demographic-aware and unaware systems, not in the absolute performance on the tasks, we do not use task-specific embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Sentiment Analysis</head><p>Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the polarity of a document. In our experiments, we use three polarity values: positive, negative, and neutral. To collect data for the sentiment analysis task, we select all reviews that contain the target variable (gender or age), and a star-rating. Fol- lowing previous work on similar data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blitzer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hardt and Wulff, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Elming et al., 2014</ref>), we use one, three, or five star ratings, cor- responding to negative, neutral, and positive senti- ment, respectively.</p><p>We balance the data sets so that both training and test set contain equal amounts of all three la- bels. We do this in order to avoid demographic- specific label distributions (women and people over 45 tend to give more positive ratings than men and people under 35, see Section 3.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Topic Identification</head><p>Topic identification is the task of assigning a high- level concept to a document that captures its con- tent. In our case, the topic labels are taken from the Trustpilot taxonomy for companies (e.g., Elec- tronics, Pets, etc.). Again, there is a strong gender bias: the most common topic for men is Computer &amp; Accessories, the most common topic among women is Pets. There is thus considerably less overlap between the groups than for the other tasks. In order not to model gender-specific topic bias and to eliminate topic frequency as a con- founding factor, we restrict ourselves to the five most frequent labels that occur in both groups. We also ensure that we have the same number of ex- amples for each label in both groups. However, in the interest of data size, we do not enforce a uniform distribution over the five labels (i.e., the classes are not balanced).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Author Attribute Identification</head><p>Author attribute identification is the task of infer- ring demographic factors from linguistic features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alowibdi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ciot et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liu and Ruths, 2013)</ref>. It is often used in author profiling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Koppel et al., 2002</ref>) and stylometrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goswami et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sarawgi et al., 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rosenthal and McKeown (2011)</ref> have shown that these attributes are correlated.</p><p>In this paper, we restrict ourselves to using gen- der to predict age, and age to predict gender. This serves as an additional test case. Again, we bal- ance the class labels to minimize the effect of any confounding factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Analysis</head><p>Before we analyze the effect of demographic differences on NLP performance, we investigate whether there is an effect on the non-linguistic cor- relates, i.e., ratings and topics. To measure the in- fluence of demographic factors on these values, we quantify the distributions over the three sentiment labels and the five topic labels. We analyze both gender and age groups separately, but in the inter- est of space average across all languages.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> show the distributions over sentiment labels. We note that men give more negative and fewer positive ratings than women. The same holds for people in the younger group, who are more skewed towards negative ratings than people in the older group. While the differ- ences are small, they suggest that demographics correlate with rating behavior have a measurable effect on model performance.</p><p>The gender distributions over categories ex- hibit a very different tendency. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows that the review categories (averaged over all languages) are highly gender-specific. With the exception of Hotels and Fashion Accessories, the two distributions are almost bimodal opposites. However, they are still significantly correlated (Spearman ρ is 0.49 at p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>The difference in the two distributions illus- trates why we need to control for topic frequency in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Models</head><p>Classifiers For all tasks, we use logistic regres- sion models <ref type="bibr">5</ref> with standard parameter settings. In order to isolate the effect of demographic dif- ferences on performance in all text classification tasks, we need to represent variable length doc- uments based only upon the embeddings of the words they contain.</p><p>We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tang et al. (2014)</ref> in using convo- lutional layers over word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Collobert et al., 2011</ref>) to generate fixed-length input repre- sentations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> schematically shows the pro- cedure for the minimum of a 4-dimensional toy example. For each instance, we collect five N - dimensional statistics over the t by N input ma- trix, where N is the dimensionality of the embed- dings (here: 100), and t is the sentence length in words.</p><p>From the matrix representation, we compute the dimension-wise minimum, maximum, and mean representation, as well as one standard deviation above and below the mean. We then concate- nate those five 100-dimensional vectors to a 500- dimensional vector thats represents each instance (i.e., review) as input to the logistic regression classifier.</p><p>Taking the maximum and minimum across all embedding dimensions is equivalent to represent- ing the exterior surface of the "instance manifold" (the volume in embedding space within which all words in the instance reside). Adding the mean and standard deviation summarizes the density per-dimension within the manifold. This way, we can represent any input sentence solely based on the embeddings, and with the same feature vector dimensionality.</p><p>that was cool  The approach is the same for all three tasks, and we did not tune any parameters to maximize per- formance. The results are thus maximally compa- rable to each other, albeit far from state-of-the-art. Overall performance could be improved with task- specific features and more sophisticated models, but it would make the results less comparable, and complicate identifying the source of performance differences. We leave this for future research.</p><p>Comparison In order to compare demographic- aware and agnostic models, we use the following setup for each task and language:</p><p>1. In the "agnostic" setting, we train a logistic- regression model using the joint embeddings (i.e., embeddings induced on the corpus con- taining both sub-groups, e.g. male and fe-  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Distribution of the 30 most frequent categories per gender over all languages male) and group-agnostic training data (i.e., data that contains an equal amount of in- stances from either sub-group).</p><p>2. In the demographic-aware setting, we train a logistic-regression model for each of the two sub-groups (e.g., male and female). For each sub-group, we use the group-specific embed- dings (i.e., embeddings induced on, say, male data) and group-specific training data (i.e., instances collected from male data).</p><p>We measure F 1 -performance for both settings (agnostic and demographic-aware) on the test set. The test data contains an equal amount of in- stances from both sub-groups (say, male and fe- male). We use the demographic-aware classifier appropriate for each instance (e.g., male classi- fier for male instances), i.e., we assume that the model has access to this information. For many user-generated content settings, this is realistic, since demographic information is available. How- ever, we only predict the target variable (senti- ment, topic, or author attribute). We do not require the model to predict the sub-group (age or gender group).</p><p>We assume that demographic factors hold irrespective of language. We thus compute a macro-F 1 over all languages. Micro-F 1 would favor languages for which there is more data available, i.e., performance on those languages would dominate the average performance. Since we do not want to ascribe more importance to any particular language, macro-F 1 is more appropriate.</p><p>Even if there is a difference in performance between the agnostic and aware settings, this dif- ference could still be due to the specific data set. In order to test whether the difference is also sta- tistically significant, we use a bootstrap-sampling test. In a bootstrap-sampling test, we sample subsets of the predictions of both settings (with replacement) 10,000 times. For each sample, we measure F 1 of both systems, and compare the winning system of the sample to the winning system on the entire data set.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: F 1 for gender-aware and agnostic models on tasks. Averages are macro average. * : p &lt; 0.05 the sample winner differs from the entire data set, divided by 10, 000, is the reported p-value. Bootstrap-sampling essentially simulates runs of the two systems on different data sets. If one system outperforms the other under most of these conditions (i.e., the test returns a low p-value), we can be reasonably sure that the difference is not due to chance. As discussed in Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2012) and <ref type="bibr">Søgaard et al. (2014)</ref>, this test is the most ap- propriate for NLP data, since it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distributions, and directly takes performance into account. Note that the test still depends on data size, though, so that small differences in performance on larger data sets can be significant, while larger differ- ences on small sets might not.</p><p>We test for significance with the standard cutoff of p &lt; 0.05. However, even under a bootstrap- sampling test, we can only limit the number of likely false positives. If we run enough tests, we increase the chance of reporting a type-I error. In order to account for this effect, we use Bonferroni corrections for each of the tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>For each task, we compare the demographic-aware setting to an agnostic setting. The latter is equiva- lent to the currently common approach in NLP. For each task and language, the setting with the higher performance is marked in bold. Statistically sig- nificant differences (at p &lt; 0.05) are marked with a star ( * ). Note that for the macro-averaged scores, we cannot perform bootstrap significance testing. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the F 1 scores for the different tasks. In the left column of each task (labeled AGNOS- TIC), the system is trained on embeddings and data from both genders, in the same ratios as in the test data. This column is similar to the configuration normally used in NLP to date, where -at least in theory -data comes from a uniformly distributed sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Gender</head><p>In the right column (labeled AWARE), the classification is based on the classifier trained on embeddings and data from the respective gender.</p><p>While the improvements are small, they are consistent. We do note some variance in consis- tency across tasks.</p><p>The largest average improvement among the three tasks is on topic classification. This improve- ment is interesting, since we have seen stark dif- ferences for the topic distribution between gen- ders. Note, however that we controlled for this factor in our experiments (cf. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). The re- sults thus show that taking gender into account improves topic classification performance even af- ter controlling for prior topic distribution as a con- founding factor.</p><p>The improvements in age classification are the most consistent. This consistency is likely due to the fact that author attributes are often corre- lated. The fact that the attributes are related can be exploited in stacking approaches, where the at- tributes are predicted together.</p><p>Analyzing the errors, the misclassifications for sentiment analysis (the weakest task) seem to be system-independent. Mistakes are mainly due to the simplicity of the system. Since we do not ex- plicitly model negation, we incur errors such as "I will never order anywhere else again" classified as negative, even though it is in fact rather positive.   show the difference between the agnostic and age-aware setting in parallel columns for each task.</p><p>The improvements are similar to the ones for gender. The smaller magnitude across tasks indicates that knowledge of age offers less dis- criminative power than knowledge of gender. This in itself is an interesting result, suggesting that the age gap is much smaller than the gender gap when it comes to language variation (i.e., older people's language is more similar to younger people than the language of men is to women). The difference between groups could be a domain-effect, though, caused by the fact that all subjects are using a form of "reviewese" when leaving their feedback. Why this effect would be more prevalent across ages than across genders is not obvious from the data. When averaged over all languages, the age- aware setup again consistently outperforms the ag- nostic setup, as it did for gender. While the final numbers are lower than in the gender setting, av- erage improvements tend to be just as decisive.</p></div>

We also use embeddings conditioned on de- mographic factors (age and gender instead of loca- tion), but evaluate their effect on performance ex- trinsically, when used as input to an NLP system, rather than intrinsically (i.e., for discovering cor- relations between language use and demographic statistics). <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tang et al. (2014)</ref> learn embeddings for senti- ment analysis by splitting up their data by rating.</p><p>We follow their methodology in using embeddings to represent variable length inputs for classifica- tion.</p><p>The experiments on author attribute identifi- cation are inspired by a host of previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nguyen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alowibdi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ciot et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liu and Ruths, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Volkova et al., 2015</ref>, in- ter alia). The main difference is that we use em- beddings trained on another demographic variable rather than n-gram based features, and that our goal is not to build a state-of-the-art system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>The results in Section 4 have shown that incor- porating information on age and gender improves performance across a host of text-classification tasks. Even though the improvements are small and vary from task to task, they hold consistently across three tasks and languages. The magnitude of the improvements could be improved by using task-specific embeddings, additional features, and more sophisticated models. This would obscure the influence of the individual factors, though.</p><p>The observed improvements are solely due to the fact that different demographic groups use lan- guage quite differently. Sociolinguistic research suggests that younger people and women tend to be more creative in their language use than men and older groups. The former are thus of- ten the drivers of language change <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Holmes, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nguyen et al., 2014</ref>). Modeling language as uni- form loses these distinctions, and thus causes per- formance drops.</p><p>As NLP systems are increasingly used for busi- ness intelligence and decision making, systematic performance differences carry the danger of dis- advantaging minority groups whose language use differs from the norm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we investigate the influence of age and gender on topic identification, sentiment anal- ysis, and author attribute identification. We induce embeddings conditioned on the respective demo- graphic variable and use those embeddings as sole input to classifiers to build both demographic- agnostic and aware models. We evaluate our mod- els on five languages.</p><p>Our results show that the models using de- mographic information perform on average better than the agnostic models. The improvements are small, but consistent, and in 8/30 cases, also statis- tically significant at p &lt; 0.05, according to boot- strap sampling tests.</p><p>The results indicate that NLP systems can im- prove classification performance by incorporat- ing demographic information, where available. In most of situated texts (social media, etc.), this is the case. While the improvements vary among tasks, the results suggest that similar to domain adaptation, we should start addressing the problem of demographic adaptation in NLP.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Label distribution for gender</figDesc></figure>
