				<p>We present and evaluate a method for automatically detecting sentence fragments in English texts written by non-native speakers. Our method combines syntactic parse tree patterns and parts-of-speech information produced by a tagger to detect this phenomenon. When evaluated on a corpus of authentic learner texts, our best model achieved a precision of 0.84 and a recall of 0.62, a statistically significant improvement over baselines using non-parse features, as well as a popular grammar checker.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>It is challenging to detect and correct sentence- level grammatical errors because it involves au- tomatic syntactic analysis on noisy, learner sen- tences. Indeed, none of the teams achieved any re- call for comma splices in the most recent CoNLL shared task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ng et al., 2014</ref>). Sentence fragments fared hardly better: of the thirteen teams, two scored a recall of 0.25 for correction and another scored 0.2; the rest did not achieve any recall.</p><p>Although parser performance degrades on learner text <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Foster, 2007)</ref>, parsers can still be use- ful for identifying grammatical errors if they pro- duce consistent patterns that indicate these errors. We show that parse tree patterns, automatically de- rived from training data, significantly improve sys- tem performance on detecting sentence fragments.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section defines the types of sentence frag- ments treated in this paper. Section 3 reviews re- lated work. Section 4 describes the features used in our model. Section 5 discusses the datasets and section 6 analyzes the experiment results. Our best model significantly outperforms baselines that do not consider syntactic information and a widely used grammar checker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Sentence Fragment</head><p>Every English sentence must have a main or in- dependent clause. Most linguists require a clause to contain a subject and a finite verb <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hunt, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Polio, 1997)</ref>; otherwise, it is considered a sentence fragment. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bram (1995)</ref>, we classify sentence fragments into the following four cate- gories:</p><p>No Subject. Fragments that lack a subject, 1 such as "According to the board, is $100."</p><p>No finite verb. Fragments that lack a finite verb. These may be a nonfinite verb phrase, or a noun phrase, such as "Mrs. Kern in a show."</p><p>No subject and finite verb. Fragments lacking both a subject and a finite verb; a typical example is a prepositional phrase, such as "Up through the ranks."</p><p>Subordinate clause. These fragments consist of a stand-alone subordinate clause; the clause typically begins with a relative pronoun or a sub- ordinating conjunction, such as "While they take pains to hide their assets."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Using parse tree patterns to judge the grammati- cality of a sentence is not new. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wong and Dras (2011)</ref> exploited probabilistic context-free gram- mar (PCFG) rules as features for native language identification. In addition to production rules, Post (2011) incorporated parse fragment features com- puted from derivations of tree substitution gram- mars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Heilman et al. (2014)</ref> used the parse scores and syntactic features to classify the comprehensi- bility of learner text, though they made no attempt to correct the errors.</p><p>In current grammatical error correction sys- tems, parser output is used mainly to locate relevant information involved in long-distance grammatical constructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Tetreault et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Yoshimoto et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhang and Wang, 2014)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the only previous work that used distinctive parse patterns to detect specific grammatical errors was concerned with comma splices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al. (2014)</ref> manually identi- fied distinctive production rules which, when used as features in a CRF, significantly improved the precision and recall in locating comma splices in learner text. Our method will similarly leverage parse tree patterns, but with the goal of detecting sentence fragment errors. More importantly, our approach is fully automatic, and can thus poten- tially be broadly applied on other syntax-related learner errors.</p><p>Many commercial systems, such as the Cri- terion Online Writing Service ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burstein et al., 2004</ref>), Grammarly 2 , and WhiteSmoke 3 , give feed- back about sentence fragments. To the best of our knowledge, these systems do not explicitly con- sider parse tree patterns. The grammar checker embedded in Microsoft Word also gives feedback about sentence fragments, and will serve as one of our baselines.</p><p>Aside from the CoNLL-2014 shared task (see Section 1), the only other reported evaluation on detecting or correcting sentence fragments has been performed on Microsoft ESL Assistant and the NTNU Grammar Checker <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen, 2009)</ref>. Nei- ther tool detected any of the sentence fragments in the test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Fragment Detection</head><p>We cast the problem of sentence fragment detec- tion as a multiclass classification task. Given a sentence, the system would mark it either as false, if it is not a fragment, or as one of the four frag- ment categories described in Section 2. Rather than a binary decision on whether a sentence is a fragment, this categorisation provides more useful feedback to the learner, since each of the four frag- ment categories requires its own correction strat- egy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Models</head><p>Baseline Models. We trained three baseline mod- els with features that incorporate an increasing amount of information about sentence structure. The first baseline model was trained on the word trigrams of the sentences, the second model on part-of-speech unigrams, and the third on part-of- speech trigrams. All of these features can be ob- tained without syntactic parsing. To reduce the number of features, we filtered out the word tri- grams that occur less than twenty times and the POS trigrams that occur less than a hundred times in the training data.</p><p>Parse Models. Our approach uses parse tree patterns as features. Although any arbitrary sub- tree structure can potentially serve as a feature, the children of the root of the tree tend to be most salient. These nodes usually denote the syntac- tic constituents of the sentence, and so often re- veal differences between well-formed sentences and fragments. Consider the sentence "While Pe- ter was a good boy.", shown in the parse tree in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The child of the root of the tree is SBAR. When the subordinating conjunction "while" is re- moved to yield a well-formed sentence, the chil- dren nodes change accordingly into the expected NP and VP. In contrast, the POS tags, used in the baseline models, tend to remain the same.</p><p>We use the label of the root and the trigrams of its children nodes as features, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Sjöbergh (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lin et al. (2011)</ref>. We also extend our patterns to grandchildren in some cases. When analyzing an ill-formed sentence, the parser can sometimes group words into constituents to which they do not belong, such as forming a VP that does not contain a verb. For example, the phrase "up the hill" was analyzed as a VP in the fragment "A new challenger up the hill" when in fact the sentence is missing a verb. To take into account such misanal- yses, we also include the POS tag of the first child of all NP, VP, PP, ADVP, and ADJP as features. The first child is chosen because it often exposes the parsing error, as is the case with the preposi- tion "up" in the purported VP "up the hill" in the above example.</p><p>We trained two models for experiments: the "Parse" model used the parser's POS tags and the "Parse + Tag" model used the tags produced by the POS tagger, which was trained on local fea- tures and tends to be less affected by ill-formed sentence structures. For example, in the sentence "Certainly was not true.", the word "certainly" was tagged as a plural noun by the parser while the tag- ger correctly identified it as an adverb. The NP construction in the fragment was encoded as "NP-NNP" in the "Parse" model and "NP-RB" in the "Parse + Tag" model. To reduce the number of features, we filtered out the node trigrams that oc- cur less than ten times in the training data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Training Data</head><p>We automatically produced training data from the New York Times portion of the AQUAINT Cor- pus of English News Text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Graff, 2002</ref>). Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Foster and Andersen (2009)</ref>, we artificially gen- erate fragments that correspond to the four cate- gories (Section 2) by removing different compo- nents from well-formed English sentences. For the "no subject" category, the NP immediately un- der the topmost S was removed. For the "no finite verb" category, we removed the finite verb in the VP immediately under the topmost S. For the "no subject and finite verb" category, we removed both the NP and the finite verb in the VP immediately under the topmost S. For the "subordinate clause" category, we looked for any SBAR in the sentence that is preceded by a comma and consists of an IN child followed by an S. The words under the SBAR are extracted as the fragment. Using this method, we created a total of 60,000 fragments, with 15,000 sentences in each category. Together with the original sentences, our training data con- sists of 120,000 sentences, half of which are frag- ments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluation Data</head><p>Fragment was among the 28 error types introduced in the CoNLL-2014 shared task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ng et al., 2014</ref>), but the test set used in the task only contained 16 such errors and is too small for our purpose. In- stead, we evaluated our system on the NUCLE corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dahlmeier et al., 2013)</ref>, which was used as the training data in the shared task. The error label "SFrag" in the NUCLE corpus was used for sentence fragments in a wider sense than the four categories defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bram (1995)</ref> (see Section 2). For example, "SFrag" also labels sentences with stylistic issues, such as those beginning with "therefore" or "hence", and sentences that, though well-formed, should be merged with its neighbor, such as "In Singapore, we can see that this prob- lem is occurring. This is so as there is a huge dis- crepancy in the education levels.". We asked two human annotators to classify the fragments into the different categories described in Section 2. The kappa was 0.84. Most of the disagreements involved sentences that con- tain a semi-colon which, when replaced with a comma, would become well-formed. One anno- tator flagged these cases as fragments while the other did not, considering them to be punctua- tion errors. Another source of disagreements was whether a sentence should be considered an im- perative.</p><p>Among the 249 sentences marked as fragments, 86 were classified as one of the Bram (1995) cat- egories by at least one of the annotators. Most of the fragments belong to categories "no finite verb" and "subordinate clause", accounting for 43.0% and 31.4% of the cases respectively. The cate- gories "no subject and finite verb" and "no sub- ject" both account for 12.8% of the cases. We left all errors in the sentences in place so as to re- flect our models' performance on authentic learner data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>We obtained the POS tags and parse trees of the sentences in our datasets with the Stanford POS tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>) and the Stanford parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Manning et al., 2014</ref>). We used the logis- tic regression implementation in scikit-learn (Pe- dregosa et al., 2011) for the maximum entropy models in our experiments. In addition to the three baseline models described in Section 4.1, we computed a fourth baseline using the grammar checker in Microsoft Word 2013 by configuring the checker to capture "Fragments and Run-ons" and "Fragment -stylistic suggestions".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Fragment detection</head><p>We first evaluated the systems' ability to detect fragments. The fragment categories are disre- garded in this evaluation and the system's result is considered correct even if its output category does not match the one marked by the annota- tors. We adopted the metric used in the CoNLL- 2014 shared task, F 0.5 , which emphasizes preci- sion twice as much as recall because it is important to minimize false alarms for language learners <ref type="bibr">4</ref> .</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The "Parse" model achieved a precision of 0.82, a recall of 0.57 and an F 0.5 of 0.75. Using the POS tags produced by the POS tagger instead of the ones produced by the parser, the "Parse + Tag" model achieved a precision of 0.84, a recall of 0.62 and an F 0.5 of 0.78, improving upon the results of the "Parse" model and significantly outperforming all four baselines 5 .</p><p>Most of the false negatives are in the "no fi- nite verb" category and many of them involve fragments with subordinate clauses, such as "The increased of longevity as the elderly are leading longer lives.". In order to create parse trees that fit those of complete sentences, the parser tended to interpret the verbs in the subordinate clauses (e.g., "are" in the above example) as the fragments' main verbs, causing the errors. For false positives, the errors were caused mostly by the presence of introductory phrases. The parse trees of these sen- tences usually contain a PP or an ADVP immedi- ately under the root, which is a pattern shared by fragments. The system also flagged some impera- tive sentences as fragments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Fragment classification</head><p>For the fragments that the system has correctly identified, we evaluated their classification accu- racy <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the confusion matrix of the system's results.</p><p>The largest source of error is the system wrongly classifying 'no finite verb" and "subor-  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: System precision, recall and F-measure for fragment detection.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">System P/R/F 0</formula><p>dinate clause" fragments as "no subject and finite verb". Most of these involve fragments that begin with a prepositional phrase, such as "for example", followed by a comma. The annotators treated the prepositional phrase as introductory phrase and fo- cused on the segment after the comma. In con- trast, based on the parser output, the system often treated the entire fragment as a PP, which should then belong to "no subject and finite verb". It can be argued that both interpretations are valid. For instance, the fragment "For example, apples and oranges" can be corrected as "For example, apples and oranges are fruits" or, alternatively, "I love fruits, for example, apples and oranges". <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: The confusion matrix of the system for classifying the detected sentence fragments into the categories no subject (S), no finite verb (V), no subject and finite verb (SV) and subordinate clause (C).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">→ Expected S V SV C ↓ System S [6] 4 1 1 V 0 [12] 2 0 SV 0 5 [2] 11 C 0 0 0 [9]</formula></div>
