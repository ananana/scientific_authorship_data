			<abstract>
				<p>In the age of social news, it is important to understand the types of reactions that are evoked from news sources with various levels of credibility. In the present work we seek to better understand how users react to trusted and deceptive news sources across two popular, and very different, social media platforms. To that end, (1) we develop a model to classify user reactions into one of nine types, such as answer, elaboration, and question, etc, and (2) we measure the speed and the type of reaction for trusted and deceptive news sources for 10.8M Twitter posts and 6.2M Reddit comments. We show that there are significant differences in the speed and the type of reactions between trusted and deceptive news sources on Twitter, but far smaller differences on Reddit.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As the reliance on social media as a source of news increases and the reliability of sources is increas- ingly debated, it is important to understand how users react to various sources of news. Most stud- ies that investigate misinformation spread in so- cial media focus on individual events and the role of the network structure in the spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Qazvinian et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kwon et al., 2017</ref>) or detection of false information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Rath et al., 2017)</ref>. These studies have found that the size and shape of misinformation cascades within a social net- work depends heavily on the initial reactions of the users. Other work has focused on the language of misinformation in social media ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rubin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Rashkin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Mitra et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Karadzhov et al., 2017;</ref> to detect types of deceptive news.</p><p>As an alternative to studying newsworthy events one at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Starbird, 2017)</ref>, the current work ap- plies linguistically-infused models to predict user reactions to deceptive and trusted news sources. Our analysis reveals differences in reaction types and speed across two social media platforms - Twitter and Reddit.</p><p>The first metric we report is the reaction type. Recent studies have found that 59% of bitly-URLs on Twitter are shared without ever being read ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gabielkov et al., 2016)</ref>, and 73% of Reddit posts were voted on without reading the linked article <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Glenski et al., 2017)</ref>. Instead, users tend to rely on the commentary added to retweets or the com- ments section of Reddit-posts for information on the content and its credibility. Faced with this reality, we ask: what kind of reactions do users find when they browse sources of varying credi- bility? Discourse acts, or speech acts, can be used to identify the use of language within a conversa- tion, e.g., agreement, question, or answer. Recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref> classified Reddit com- ments by their primary discourse act (e.g., ques- tion, agreement, humor), and further analyzed pat- terns from these discussions.</p><p>The second metric we report is reaction speed. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Jin et al. (2013)</ref> found that trusted news stories spread faster than misinformation or ru- mor; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zeng et al. (2016)</ref> found that tweets which deny rumors had shorter delays than tweets of sup- port. Our second goal is to determine if these trends are maintained for various types of news sources on Twitter and Reddit.</p><p>Hence, the contributions of this work are two- fold: (1) we develop a linguistically-infused neu- ral network model to classify reactions in social media posts, and (2) we apply our model to label 10.8M Twitter posts and 6.2M Reddit comments in order to evaluate the speed and type of user re- actions to various news sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Reaction Type Classification</head><p>In this section, we describe our approach to clas- sify user reactions into one of eight types of discourse: agreement, answer, appreciation, dis- agreement, elaboration, humor, negative reaction, or question, or as none of the given labels, which we call "other", using linguistically-infused neural network models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Reddit Data</head><p>We use a manually annotated Reddit dataset from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref> to train our reaction classifica- tion model. Annotations from 25 crowd-workers labelled the primary discourse act for 101,525 comments within 9,131 comment threads on Red- dit. The Reddit IDs, but not the text content of the comments themselves, were released with the annotations. So we collected the content of Red- dit posts and comments from a public archive of Reddit posts and comments. 1 Some content was deleted prior to archival, so the dataset shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> is a subset of the original content. Despite the inability to capture all of the original dataset, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows a similar distribution between our dataset and the original. <ref type="bibr">Zhang</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Model</head><p>We develop a neural network architecture that re- lies on content and other linguistic signals ex- tracted from reactions and parent posts, and takes advantage of a "late fusion" approach previ- ously used effectively in vision tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Karpathy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Park et al., 2016</ref>). More specifi- cally, we combine a text sequence sub-network with a vector representation sub-network as shown </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIWC Features</head><p>Vector Sub-Network Text Sub-Network in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The text sequence sub-network consists of an embedding layer initialized with 200-dimensional GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) followed by two 1-dimensional con- volution layers, then a max-pooling layer followed by a dense layer. The vector representation sub- network consists of two dense layers. We incorpo- rate information from both sub-networks through concatenated padded text sequences and vector representations of normalized Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Pennebaker et al., 2001</ref>) for the text of each post and its parent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Reaction Type Classification Results</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, our linguistically-infused neural network model that relies solely on the content of the reaction and its parent has com- parable performance to the more-complex CRF model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref>, which relies on con- tent as well as additional metadata like the author, thread (e.g., the size of the the thread, the number of branches), structure (e.g., the position within the thread), and community (i.e., the subreddit in which the comment is posted). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Measuring Reactions to Trusted and Deceptive News Sources</head><p>In this section, we present key results of our anal- ysis of how often and how quickly users react to content from sources of varying credibility using the reaction types predicted by our linguistically- infused neural network model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Twitter and Reddit News Data</head><p>We focus on trusted news sources that provide factual information with no intent to deceive and deceptive news sources. Deceptive sources are ranked by their intent to deceive as fol- lows: clickbait (attention-grabbing, misleading, or vague headlines to attract an audience), conspir- acy theory (uncorroborated or unreliable informa- tion to explain events or circumstances), propa- ganda (intentionally misleading information to ad- vance a social or political agenda), and disinfor- mation (fabricated or factually incorrect informa- tion meant to intentionally deceive readers). Trusted, clickbait, conspiracy, and propaganda sources were previously compiled by  through a combination of crowd- sourcing and public resources. Trusted news sources with Twitter-verified accounts were man- ually labeled and clickbait, conspiracy, and pro- paganda news sources were collected from several public resources that annotate suspicious news ac- counts 2 . We collected news sources identified as spreading disinformation by the European Union's East Strategic Communications Task Force from euvsdisinfo.eu. In total, there were 467 news sources: 251 trusted and 216 deceptive.</p><p>We collected reaction data for two popular plat- forms, Reddit and Twitter, using public APIs over the 13 month period from January 2016 through January 2017. For our Reddit dataset, we col- lected all Reddit posts submitted during the 13 month period that linked to domains associated with one of our labelled news sources. Then we collected all comments that directly responded to those posts. For our Twitter dataset, we collected all tweets posted in the 13 month period that ex- plicitly @mentioned or directly retweeted content from a source and then assigned a label to each tweet based on the class of the source @mentioned 2 Example resources used by  to compile deceptive news sources: http://www. fakenewswatch.com/, http://www.propornot. com/p/the-list.html and others.   or retweeted. A breakdown of each dataset by source type is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> illus- trates the distribution of deceptive news sources and reactions across the four sub-categories of de- ceptive news sources. In our analysis, we consider the set of all deceptive sources and the set exclud- ing the most extreme (disinformation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reddit Dataset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Methodology</head><p>We use the linguistically-infused neural network model from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> to label the reaction type of each tweet or comment. Using these labels, we ex- amine how often response types occur when users react to each type of news source. For clarity, we report the five most frequently occurring reaction types (expressed in at least 5% of reactions within each source type) and compare the distributions of reaction types for each type of news source.</p><p>To examine whether users react to content from trusted sources differently than from deceptive sources, we measure the reaction delay, which we define as the time elapsed between the moment the link or content was posted/tweeted and the mo- ment that the reaction comment or tweet occurred. We report the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for each source type and use Mann Whit- ney U (MWU) tests to compare whether users re- spond with a given reaction type with significantly different delays to news sources of different levels of credibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>For both Twitter and Reddit datasets, we found that the primary reaction types were answer, ap- preciation, elaboration, question, or "other" (no la- bel was predicted). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the distri- bution of reaction types among Reddit comments (top plot) or tweets (bottom plot) responding to each type of source, as a percentage of all com- ments/tweets reacting to sources of the given type (i.e., trusted, all deceptive, and deceptive exclud- ing disinformation sources). For Twitter, we report clear differences in user reactions to trusted vs. deceptive sources. De- ceptive (including disinformation) sources have a much higher rate of appreciation reactions and a lower rate of elaboration responses, compared to trusted news sources. Differences are still signifi- cant (p &lt; 0.01) but the trends reverse if we do not include disinformation sources. We also see an in- crease in the rate of question-reactions compared to trusted news sources if we exclude disinforma- tion sources.</p><p>For Reddit, there appears to be a very simi- lar distribution across reaction types for trusted and deceptive sources. However, MWU tests still found that the differences between trusted and de- : CDF plots of the volumes of reactions by reac- tion delays for the frequently occurring reactions (i.e., , re- actions that occur in at least 5% of comments) for each source-type, using a step size of one hour.

This figure is best viewed in color.</p><p>ceptive news sources were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) -regardless of whether we include or exclude disinformation sources. Posts that link to deceptive sources have higher rates of ques- tion, appreciation, and answering reactions, while posts that link to trusted sources have higher rates of elaboration, agreement, and disagreement. Next, we compared the speed with which users reacted to posts of sources of varying credibil- ity. Our original hypothesis was that users re- act to posts of trusted sources faster than posts of deceptive sources. The CDFs for each source type and platform (solid and dashed lines repre- sent Reddit and Twitter respectively) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. We observe that the lifetime of di- rect reactions to news sources on Twitter is often more extended than for sources on Reddit. One exception is answer reactions which almost al- ways occur within the first hour after the Twitter new source originally posted the tweet being an- swered. This may be due to the different ways that users consume content on the two platforms. Users follow accounts on Twitter, whereas on Red- dit users "follow" topics through their subscrip- tions to various subreddits. Users can view the news feeds of individual sources on Twitter and view all of the sources' posts. Reddit, on the other hand, is not designed to highlight individual users or news sources; instead new posts (regardless of the source) are viewed based on their hotness score within each subreddit.</p><p>In addition, we observe that reactions to posts linked to trusted sources are less heavily concen- trated within the first 12 to 15 hours of the post's lifetime on Reddit. The opposite is found on Twit- ter. Twitter sources may have a larger range of reaction delays, but they are also more heav- ily concentrated in the lower end of that range (p &lt; 0.01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>As we noted above, most studies that examine misinformation spread focus on individual events such as natural disasters <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Takahashi et al., 2015)</ref>, political elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ferrara, 2017)</ref>, or crises <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Starbird et al., 2014</ref>) and examine the response to the event on social media. A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vosoughi et al. (2018)</ref> found that news stories that were fact- checked and found to be false spread faster and to more people than news items found to be true. In contrast, our methodology considers immediate reactions to news sources of varying credibility, so we can determine whether certain reactions or re- actions to trusted or deceptive news sources evoke more or faster responses from social media users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In the current work, we have presented a content- based model that classifies user reactions into one of nine types, such as answer, elaboration, and question, etc., and a large-scale analysis of Twitter posts and Reddit comments in response to content from news sources of varying credibility.</p><p>Our analysis of user reactions to trusted and de- ceptive sources on Twitter and Reddit shows sig- nificant differences in the distribution of reaction types for trusted versus deceptive news. However, due to differences in the user interface, algorith- mic design, or user-base, we find that Twitter users react to trusted and deceptive sources very differ- ently than Reddit users. For instance, Twitter users questioned disinformation sources less often and more slowly than they did trusted news sources; Twitter users also expressed appreciation towards disinformation sources more often and faster than towards trusted sources. Results from Reddit show similar, but far less pronounced, reaction results.</p><p>Future work may focus on analysis of reaction behavior from automated (i.e., 'bot'), individual, or organization accounts; on additional social me- dia platforms and languages; or between more fine-grained categories of news source credibility.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Architecture of neural network model used to predict reaction types.</figDesc></figure>
