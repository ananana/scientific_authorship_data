				<p>Standard named entity recognizers can effectively recognize entity mentions that consist of contiguous tokens and do not overlap with each other. However, in practice , there are many domains, such as the biomedical domain, in which there are nested, overlapping, and discontinuous entity mentions. These complex mentions cannot be directly recognized by conventional sequence tagging models because they may break the assumptions based on which sequence tagging techniques are built. We review the existing methods which are revised to tackle complex entity mentions and categorize them as token-level and sentence-level approaches. We then identify the research gap, and discuss some directions that we are exploring.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Named entity recognition (NER), the task of iden- tifying and classifying named entities (NE) within text, has received substantial attention. This is largely due to its crucial role in conducting several downstream tasks, such as entity linking <ref type="bibr">(Limsopatham and Collier, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pan et al., 2017)</ref>, re- lation extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zeng et al., 2014)</ref>, question an- swering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mollá et al., 2007)</ref> and knowledge base construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Zhang, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Traditionally, the NER problem can be defined as: given a sequence of tokens, output a list of tu- ples &lt; I s , I e , t &gt;, each of which is a NE mention in text. Here, I s and I e are the starting and end- ing index of the NE mention, respectively, and t is the type of the entity from a pre-defined cate- gory scheme. There are two assumptions associ- ated with this perspective:</p><p>1. An NE mention consists of contiguous to- kens, where all the tokens indexed between I s and I e are part of the mention; and, 2. These linear spans do not overlap with each other. In other words, no token in the text can belong to more than one NE mention.</p><p>Based on these two assumptions, the most com- mon approach to NER is to use sequence tagging techniques with a BIO or BIOLU label set. Each token is assigned with a tag which is usually com- posed of a position indicator and an entity type. The position indicator is used to represent the to- ken's role in a NE mention. In the BIOLU schema, B stands for the beginning of a mention, I for the intermediate of a mention, O for outside a men- tion, L for the last token of a mention, and U for a mention having only one token <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Sequential tagging models, such as linear-chain CRFs and BiLSTM-CRF, have achieved start-of- the-art effectiveness in many NER data sets <ref type="bibr">(Lample et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ma and Hovy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chiu and Nichols, 2016)</ref>, since most training data sets are also annotated based on these two assumptions.</p><p>However, in practice, there are many domains, such as the biomedical domain, which involve nested, overlapping, discontinuous NE mentions that break the two assumptions mentioned above. We categorize these mentions as complex entity mentions, and note that standard tagging tech- niques cannot be applied directly to recognize these mentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Muis and Lu, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dai et al., 2017</ref>). In the following paragraphs, we explain these complex entity mentions in details.</p><p>Nested NE mentions One NE mention is com- pletely contained by the other. We call both of the mentions involved as nested entity mentions. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1a</ref> is an example taken from the GENIA cor- <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Examples involving overlapping, discontinuous and nested NE mentions. In (a), 'HIV-1 en- hancer' and 'HIV-1' are nested NE mentions. In (b), 'intense pelvic pain' and 'back pain' overlap, meanwhile, 'intense pelvic pain' is a discontinuous mention. pus ( <ref type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003)</ref>. Here, 'HIV-1 enhancer' is a DNA mention, and it contains another mention 'HIV-1', which is a virus.</p><p>Multi-type NE mentions An extreme case of nested NE mentions is one on which an NE men- tion has multiple entity types. For example, in the EPPI corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alex et al., 2007)</ref>, proteins can also be annotated as drug/compound, indicating that the protein is used as a drug to affect the function of a cell. Such a mention should be classified as both protein and drug/compound. In this case, we consider this mention as two mentions of different types, and these two mentions contain each other.</p><p>Overlapping NE mentions Two NE mentions overlap, but no one is completely contained by the other. <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref> is an example taken from the CADEC corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Karimi et al., 2015)</ref>, which is an- notated for adverse drug events (ADE) and rele- vant concepts. In this example, two ADEs: 'in- tense pelvic pain' and 'back pain', share a com- mon token 'pain', and neither is contained by the other.</p><p>Discontinuous NE mentions The mention consists of discontiguous tokens. In other words, the mention contains at least one gap. In <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1b, '</ref>intense pelvic pain' is a discontinuous NE mention since it is interrupted by 'and back'.</p><p>These complex NE mentions can hold very use- ful information for downstream tasks. Some- times, the nested and overlapping structure itself are already good indicators of the relationship be- tween different entities involved. For example, an ORG mention 'University of Sydney' contains a LOC mention 'Sydney'. This structure has im- plied the location of the organization, and recog- nition of these mentions can potentially speed up the construction of a knowledge base. In addi- tion, such entities often have fixed representations in different languages. Therefore, recognizing NE mentions, especially these discontinuous NE men- tions, can improve the performance of a machine translation system ( <ref type="bibr">Klementiev and Roth, 2006</ref>). Furthermore, we notice that similar complex struc- tures also exist in other NLP tasks, such as multi- word expressions recognition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baldwin and Kim, 2010)</ref>. The ideas proposed for a NER task can thus be applied to tackle similar difficulties in other tasks.</p><p>Below, we briefly review existing methods to recognize complex mentions and discuss their strengths and limitations. We also discuss the re- search directions we are exploring to address the research gaps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Token-level Approach</head><p>Sequence tagging techniques take the representa- tion of each token as input and output a label for each token. These local decisions are chained to- gether to perform joint inference. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> is an illustration of a linear-chain CRF model where the tag of one token depends on both the features of that token in context and the tag of the previous token. The tag sequence predicted by the tagger is finally decoded into NE mentions using explicit rules. Here, the intermediate outputs for each to- ken are usually BIO tags in standard NER tasks. However, since the BIO tags cannot effectively represent complex NE mentions, a natural direc- tion is to expand the BIO tag set so that different kinds of complex entity mentions can be captured. We categorize the methods based on conventional sequence tagging as token-level approach.</p><p>Metke-Jimenez and Karimi (2015) introduced a BIO variant schema to represent discontinuous and overlapping NE mentions. Concretely, in addition to the BIO tags, four new position in- dicators, BD, ID, BH, and IH are proposed to denote Beginning of Discontinuous body, Inside   of Discontinuous body, Beginning of Head, and Inside of Head. Here, the word sequences which are shared by multiple mentions are called head, and the remaining parts of the discontinuous men- tion are called body. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> is an encoding ex- ample using this schema. 'pain' is the beginning of the head that is shared by two mentions, and therefore tagged as BH. 'intense pelvic' is the body of a discontinuous mention, while 'back' is the be- ginning of a continuous mention. We note that, even in this simple example, it is still impossible to represent several discontinuous mentions unam- biguously. For example, this encoding can also be decoded as having three mentions: 'intense pelvic pain', 'back pain' and 'pain'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Muis and Lu (2016)</ref> introduced the notion of model ambiguity and the- oretically demonstrated that the models based on BIO variants usually have high ambiguity level, and therefore low precision in practice. Another limitation of this schema is that it supports only overlapping mentions of the same entity type. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Schneider et al. (2014)</ref> also proposed several BIO schema variants to encode multiword expres- sions with gaps and nested structure. They include two strict restrictions which are motivated linguis- tically in their work:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">xt-2 xt-1 xt xt+1 xt+2 yt-2 yt-1 yt yt+1 yt+2 ...</formula><p>1. An expression can be completely contained within another expression, but no overlap- ping is allowed; and, 2. A contained expression cannot contain other expressions. In other words, the nested struc- ture has maximum two levels.</p><p>We note that these strict restrictions cannot be ap- plied directly on our NER tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alex et al. (2007)</ref> proposed three approaches based on a maximum entropy model <ref type="bibr">(Curran and Clark, 2003)</ref> to deal with nested NE mentions:</p><p>Layering The tagger first identifies the innermost (or outermost) mentions, then the following taggers are used to identify increasingly next level mentions. Finally, the output of the tag- gers on different layers is combined by taking the union.</p><p>Joined labeling Each word is assigned a tag by concatenating the tags of all levels of nesting. Then a tagger is trained on the data contain- ing the joined labels. During inference, the joined labels are decoded into their original BIO format for each entity type.</p><p>Cascade Separate models are trained for each en- tity type or by grouping several entity types without nested structures. Similar to the lay- ering approach, the latter models can utilize the outputs from previous models as input features. Despite the difficulty of ordering and grouping entity models and the fact that this approach cannot deal with nested men- tions of the same entity type, the cascade ap- proach still achieves the best results among these three approaches.</p><p>Byrne (2007) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xu et al. (2017)</ref> used a sim- ilar approach to deal with nested NE mentions. They concatenated adjacent tokens (up to a certain length) into potential mention spans. Then these spans, together with their left and right contexts, are fed into a classifier (a maximum entropy tag- ger in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Byrne, 2007)</ref> and a feedforward neural net- work in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Xu et al., 2017)</ref>). The classifier is trained to first predict whether the span is a valid NE men- tion, and then its entity type if it is a NE mention.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> is an example of this representation, with each to- ken tagged using an I/O schema. This representa- tion is very flexible as it allows NE mentions con- sisting of discontiguous tokens and does not re- quire mentions to exclude each other. Using this representation, the NER problem is converted into the multi-label classification problem of finding up to k correct labels among all possible labels, where k is a hyper-parameter of the model. Labels can be decoded to all possible NE mentions in the sen- tence. They do not come from a pre-defined cate- gory but depend on the sentence being processed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">McDonald et al. (2005)</ref> used large-margin online learning algorithms to train the model, so that the scores of correct labels (NE mentions) are higher than those of all other possible incorrect mentions. Another advantage of this method is that the out- puts of the model are unambiguous for all kinds of complex entity mentions and easy to be decoded, although the method suffers from a O(n 3 T ) infer- ence algorithm, where n is the length of the sen- tence and T is the number of entity types.</p><p>Finkel and Manning (2009) used a discrimina- tive constituency parser to recognize nested NE mentions. They represent each sentence as a con- stituency tree, where each mention corresponds to a phrase in the tree. In addition, each node needs to be annotated with its parent and grandparent la- bels, so that the CRF-CFG parser can learn how NE mentions nest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ringland (2016)</ref> also explored a joint model using the Berkeley parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Petrov et al., 2006</ref>), and showed that it performed well even without specialized NER features. However, one disadvantage of their models, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(McDonald et al., 2005</ref>), is that their time complexity is cubic in the number of tokens in the sentence. Further- more, the high quality parse training data, which is not always available, plays a crucial role in the success of the joint model ( <ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lu and Roth (2015)</ref>, extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Muis and Lu (2016)</ref>, proposed a novel hypergraph to compactly represent exponentially many possible nested mentions in one sentence, and one sub- hypergraph of the complete hypergraph can there- fore be used to represent a combination of men- tions in the sentence. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> is an example of such a sub-hypergraph, which represents two nested NE mentions.</p><p>The training objectives of these models are to maximize the log-likelihood of training instances consisting of the sentence and mention-encoded hypergraph. During inference, the model will first predict a sub-hypergraph among all possible sub- hypergraph of the complete hypergraph, and pre- dicted mentions can be decoded from the output sub-hypergraph.</p><p>This hypergraph representation still suffers from some degree of ambiguity during decod- ing stage. For example, when one mention is contained by another mention with the same en- tity type and their boundaries are all different, the hypergraph can be decoded in different ways. This ambiguity comes from the fact that, if one node has multiple parent nodes and multiple child nodes, there is no mechanism to decide which of the parent node is paired with which child node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Research Plan</head><p>We note that the drawbacks of existing meth- ods can be broadly categorized into: (1) lack of expressivity; and (2) computational complexity. Most of token-level approaches were proposed for some specific scenarios or data sets, therefore usu- ally with strict restrictions. For example, the BIO variant schema in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Schneider et al., 2014</ref>) was de- signed for nested structure with maximum depth of two. Therefore, it is difficult to be applied on GENIA corpus ( <ref type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003)</ref>, which contains nested entities up to four layers of embedding. In addition, these token-level methods are usually de- vised to deal with only either nested or discontinu- ous mentions, and seldom can be used to tackle all kinds of complex entity mentions simultaneously.</p><p>In contrast, sentence-level approaches are over- all more flexible and less ambiguous, however with higher computational cost. For example, both <ref type="bibr">Finkel and Manning (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">McDonald et al. (2005)</ref> methods suffer from a high time complex- ity which is cubic in the number of tokens in the sentence. Our aim is to propose a model that rec- ognizes all kinds of complex entity mentions, with low ambiguity level and low computational com- plexity. Some specific directions include:</p><p>• The representation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(McDonald et al., 2005</ref>), introduced in Section 3, is most flex- ible and straightforward among all schemes designed for representing complex entity mentions. It can be used to represent all nested, overlapping and discontinuous entity mentions with unbounded length and depth. We are exploring recent advances in multi- label classification methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Shi et al., 2017</ref>) to reduce the computational complexity of this approach.</p><p>• Sequence-to-sequence models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cho et al., 2014)</ref> had achieved great success in machine translation and text generation tasks, especially after enhanced by attention mechanisms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Luong et al., 2015</ref>). We are exploring extending the encoder-decoder architecture to recognize complex entity mentions. During inference stage, instead of one tag sequence capturing all mentions in the sentence, the decoder can produce multiple sequences, each of which corresponds to one possible mention combination, analogous to several possible target sentences in machine translation tasks.</p><p>• Supervised learning NER methods are af- fected by the quantity and quality of the available annotated corpora. However, since annotating mentions with complex structure requires more human efforts than annotat- ing only the outermost or longest continu- ous spans, training data for complex entity mention recognition is rare. Furthermore, the medical domain is where complex mentions widely exist, such as disorder mentions and adverse drug events. The cost of producing gold standard corpus in such a domain is very high, due to the expertise required and the limited access to some medical text, such as electronic health records.</p><p>Active learning aims to reduce the cost of constructing a labeled dataset by allowing a human-in-the-loop ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Settles and Craven, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Stanovsky et al., 2017)</ref>. The model selects one or several most informative in- stances and presents these instances to the an- notators. Since only these most informative instances need to be manually annotated by human experts, it can reduce the need for hu- man effort and therefore the cost of construct- ing large labeled dataset. We are exploring this method to relieve the pain of lacking training data.</p><p>• Finally, we are going to utilize recent ad- vances in NER domain to improve the ef- fectiveness of complex entity mentions rec- ognizers, such as character-level embedding ( <ref type="bibr">Kuru et al., 2016</ref>) and joint models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Luo et al., 2015</ref>).</p><p>Besides employing active learning to create spe- cific data set with nested, overlapping, discontinu- ous entity mentions, we notice that there are some off-the-shelf corpora in biomedical domain that we can use to evaluate our proposed methods, al- though, to our knowledge, none of these data sets contains all three kinds of complex mentions, e.g., GENIA ( <ref type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</ref>) only contains nested en- tity mentions, and CADEC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Karimi et al., 2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">SemEval2014 (Pradhan et al., 2014</ref>) contain overlapping and discontinuous mentions. In ad- dition, ACE 1 and NNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ringland, 2016)</ref> are newswire corpora with nested entity mentions.</p><p>On these data sets, we will use standard evalua- tion metrics for NER tasks, namely micro-average precision, recall and f1-score, to evaluate the ef- fectiveness of proposed methods in recognizing both complex and simple mentions. However, due to the complexity of complex NE mentions, we will include different boundary matching re- laxation, such as partial match and approximate match <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Tsai et al., 2006</ref>), to measure the proposed methods in identifying these complex mentions.</p></div>
