				<p>Adverse drug events (ADEs) are medical complications co-occurring with a period of drug usage. Identification of ADEs is a primary way of evaluating available quality of care. As more social media users begin discussing their drug experiences online, public data becomes available for researchers to expand existing electronic ADE reporting systems, though non-standard language inhibits ease of analysis. In this study, portions of a new corpus of approximately 160,000 tweets were used to create a lexicon-driven ADE detection system using semi-supervised, pattern-based bootstrapping. This method was able to identify misspellings, slang terms, and other non-standard language features of social media data to drive a competitive ADE detection system.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Background</head><p>Pharmacovigilance is tasked with detecting, as- sessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects or other drug-related medical problems <ref type="bibr">(Organization, 2002</ref>). Adverse effects in post- approval drugs constitute a major public health issue, representing the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and an overall treat- ment cost higher than those of cardiovascular and diabetes care combined <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chee et al., 2011</ref>). In the United States alone, over 700,000 yearly hospital admissions-between 2 and 5% of total admissions-result from moderate to severe ad- verse effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Honigman et al., 2001</ref>), underscor- ing the need to identify and prevent these serious medical complications.</p><p>Adverse effects from drug usage are bro- ken down further into two categories-adverse drug events (ADEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs are a subset of ADEs, where causality between a drug treatment program and negative medical reaction has been established such that the negative reactions occur in within standard dosages <ref type="bibr">(Organization, 1972)</ref>. ADEs more loosely define any overlapping period of drug treatment and adverse medical effects. Im- portantly, ADEs do not imply causation between the drug use and co-occurring negative event ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Eriksson et al., 2013)</ref>. Timely, accurate identifi- cation of these medical complications therefore fa- cilitates improvements in patient health and helps decrease both manpower and monetary costs to a healthcare system and is considered a key quality of medical care <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Honigman et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Existing systems of ADE documentation typi- cally rely on automatic reporting systems hosted by national or international public health organi- zations, electronic health records, or data from other high-quality resources. Social media was an untapped resource until recently, despite evi- dence that suggests nearly 31% of patients suffer- ing from chronic illness and 38% of medical care- givers consult drug reviews posted online to vari- ous social media sites ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Harpaz et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Twitter has recently been used as an ADR detection resource in numerous research studies within the last five years, with methodologies ranging from lexicon matching to supervised ma- chine learning . Tweets can be used to supplement existing electronic ADE/ADR monitoring systems by providing real-world, real- time clinical narratives from users posted in the public domain. Because many electronic monitor- ing systems underreport the prevalence of minor ADEs/ADRs, typically due to their absence from medical records and clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Eriksson et al., 2013</ref>), Twitter presents a valuable resource for providing data on a wide range of negative medi-cal events.</p><p>Social media data presents unique challenges to clinical NLP studies in ways analogous to electronic medical records-non-standard syntax, jargon, and misspellings handicap many exist- ing NLP systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Eriksson et al., 2013)</ref>. Han- dling these areas of non-standard language usage complicates lexicon-based attempts at retrieving Tweets containing potential ADEs/ADRs. Many recently published systems handle this by map- ping annotated ADEs/ADRs to entries in med- ical ontologies . Annota- tion is a time-consuming process and limits the size of training data sets. Many problems with non-standard language usage can be addressed with semi-supervised, pattern-based bootstrapping which, after sufficient analysis, yields high-quality lexicons with competitive ADE/ADR detection capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>The largest existing publicly available dataset for this domain is Arizona State University's DIEGO Lab data, containing over 7,500 tweets annotated for presence or absence of an ADR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ginn et al., 2014;</ref>. Roughly 2,000 of the tweets contain annotated ADR relations. This data set has been used in both machine learning and lexicon-based approaches to ADR detection in social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(O'Connor et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In order to take advantage of semi-supervised learning methods and real-time data, Twitter- Drugs, a new corpus of 166,551 tweets, was gener- ated from public tweets mined from mid-January to mid-February 2016 using 334 different drugs. Drugs were compiled from those used in the DIEGO data and supplemented with the New York State Department of Health's 150 Most Frequently Prescribed Drugs 1 , and those listed in Chemical and Engineering News' Top 50 Drugs of 2014 2 .</p><p>After collecting approximately 700K query re- sults, each tweet was heuristically screened for relevance. Tweets were considered irrelevant if they contained an external URL, any of a set of 16 salesmanship terms such as promo or free shipping, and whether the tweet text itself con- tained the queried drug string. Screening removed roughly 76.1% of mined tweets. The corpus is 1 apps.health.ny.gov/pdpw /DrugInfo/DrugInfo.action 2 CEN-supplement092014.pdf </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>Identifying potential ADEs required extraction of both drug mentions and negative medical events, for instance oxycontin and made me dizzy. Novel mentions were identified using a set of extraction patterns and a lexicon. Extrac- tion patterns are flexible regular expressions capa- ble of identifying both known and novel mentions. For instance, the pattern took three &lt;DRUG&gt; might identify oxycontin, ibuprofen, or benzos. made me &lt;REACTION&gt;, similarly, might identify dizzy, hungry, or throw up. Newly identified items are added to lexicons which are in turn used to identify new items.</p><p>Two separate lexicons for drugs and med- ical events were generated using the meta- bootstrapping algorithm detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Riloff and Jones (1999)</ref>, which uses a pre-defined set of pat- terns to identify novel lexicon items occurring in similar environments as known lexicon items. To identify novel mentions, the algorithm relies on an initial set of extraction patterns and a small num- ber of seed words to define the semantic category of interest, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Though boot- strapped lexicons contain noise, manually screen- ing for relevant items results in robust, automat- ically generated lexicons well suited to the task of identifying potential ADEs. Importantly, this method does not require expensive manual anno- tation and is capable of handling the colloquial terms and misspellings commonly found in social media data even though it is not specifically tai- lored for non-standard usage.</p><p>Meta-bootstrapping first identifies relevant ex- traction contexts from an input corpus and lists of known category items. This, in turn, results in a list of context patterns. Contexts were gener- ated by taking combinations of one to three words preceding or following the known category item. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows how known drug names and med- ical events present in each context pattern were anonymized with regular expressions capable of extracting one or many words. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">score(pattern) = R * log 2 F (1)</formula><p>where F is the number of unique entities gener- ated by the pattern which are already present in the semantic lexicon and R = F N , where N is the total number of words the pattern extracted. R is high when patterns extract numerous items that are already contained in the semantic lexicon, as this reflects a high likelihood that all entities produced by this pattern are semantic category items.</p><p>This scoring function, however, is incapable of appropriately addressing the robustness of multi- word medical events. In some cases, an extracted entity contains multiple unique reactions, such as gave me vertigo and really bad nausea where vertigo and nausea should be consid- ered independently. Judging the above example based on the whole string as an indivisible entity will score it too low to be considered semantically relevant. This is because the string as an indi- visible whole is unlikely to ever occur again or bear strong semblance to the provided seed words or existing lexicon items. Only portions of this string are important potential category items and are likely to be included in seed words or easily identified by patterns extracting single words. Reranking this pattern to favor extractions con- taining these two substrings can allow the the en- tire extraction to enter the medical event lexicon where each relevant bit can be manually identified in post-processing. To do this, the scoring function was modified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">score(pattern) = λ(R * log 2 F )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where F is re-evaluated as the number of rele- vant substrings, and λ is a penalty term where λ = c log 2 (avg words) , where c is a constant and avg words is the average number of tokens per extraction per pattern. All other terms remain the same between both scoring functions.</p><p>Because the F values grow increasingly large as the semantic lexicons grow, the λ penalty is intro- duced to control the balance of single and multiple word entities. Shorter strings containing more rel- evant entities are penalized less than longer ones potentially containing lots of noise. The c constant must grow in proportion to the number of data in- stances being used in the training set. Too small a c value will result in lexicons comprised mostly of single-word extractions. Too large a c value will result in lexicons comprised mostly of multi-word extractions.</p><p>Following the scoring of each pattern, each en- tity is evaluated with the scoring function</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">score(entity) = N k=1 1 + (0.1 * score(pattern k )) (3)</formula><p>where N is the number of different patterns which found the entity being scored. This function scores each entity on the basis of how many patterns were able to identify it, as words extracted by numerous patterns are more likely to be true members of the semantic lexicon. The five highest scoring patterns are added to the semantic lexicon, serving as ad- ditional seed words for subsequent bootstrapping iterations. This process continues until end condi- tions are reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>Six different training sets were used in the boot- strapping tasks to explore the influence of unanno- tated data during lexicon generation. Each train- ing set contained the full DIEGO Lab training corpus and an increasingly large amount of non- overlapping TwitterDrugs data. The bootstrapping procedure outlined above continued until lexicons contained maximally 5000+i items, where i is the number of seed words. Bootstrapping terminated early if new items were not added for five consec- utive iterations.</p><p>The resulting lexicons were used to flag tweets in held-out test sets where an extracted drug co- occurred with an extracted reaction. The DIEGO test set was used to compare flagged tweets using this methodology to O' <ref type="bibr">Connor et al. (2014)</ref>, which utilized a different lexicon-based ADR detection algorithm on the same DIEGO data set. Tweets flagged using bootstrapped lexicons increased pre- cision, recall, and F 1 in most cases, suggesting the viability of this method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Generating Drug Lexicons</head><p>Drug lexicons were generated using 10-20 seed words. As the number of training instances in- creased, additional seed words were required to spur the bootstrapping algorithm to add lexicon items in early iterations. Seed words were taken from the most frequently occurring drugs in the DIEGO training corpus.</p><p>Using only the DIEGO training data resulted in 1907 candidate patterns, 1312 extracted entities, and 113 relevant identified drugs. The best per- forming training set added 5K tweets from Twit- terDrugs to those in the DIEGO training set, re- sulting in 355 relevant extracted entities of which nearly 60% were neither in the DIEGO data nor the list of drugs used to generate the TwitterDrugs corpus. Included in these lexicons are numerous misspellings, slang terms, and hashtags. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Generating Medical Event Lexicons</head><p>Due to the challenges associated with multi-word extractions, only three training sets were explored for reaction extraction. 30 seed word were used for all bootstrapping procedures, taken from the most frequent annotated ADRs in the DIEGO dataset provided they were less than five words long.</p><p>Using only the DIEGO training data resulted in 32,879 candidate patterns, producing a lexicon with 1321 items. To balance single and multi- word expressions, where c = 0.25 for this small dataset. Manual analysis of each lexicon item yielded 500 medical events after complex, multi- word entities were broken down. The largest lexicon contained 783 medical events extracted from 177,494 patterns generated by appending 5K tweets from TwitterDrugs to the DIEGO training set. c = 0.75 in this case. Over 87% of this lexi- con contained novel entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Identifying Potential ADEs</head><p>Tweets were flagged as 'potentially containing an ADE' by identifying those in which a term from a drug lexicon co-occurred with one from a medical event lexicon. The effects of increas- ing the amount of training data can be seen in Ta- ble 2, which shows that an increasing proportion of tweets are flagged as the amount of training data increases. This suggests that the composition of the resulting lexicons contains drugs and reactions that more frequently co-occur.</p><p>The low proportion of flagged tweets is unsur- prising, as most Twitter users rarely discuss the physical effects of their drug use. It is important to emphasize that the proportion of true ADEs is not identical to the proportion flagged. Discussion of drug indications-why a drug was taken-and beneficial effects are much more common than ADEs or ADRs. Of the proportion of flagged tweets, roughly 25.2% contained obvious ADEs. This is roughly 16% more than the 9.3% captured in the O' <ref type="bibr">Connor et al. (2014)</ref> study which used only the DIEGO data.</p><p>In order to better evaluate the composition of flagged tweets using the bootstrapped lexicons, re- sults were directly compared to the O' <ref type="bibr">Connor et al. (2014)</ref> study using the 317 tweets distributed in the DIEGO Lab test set. O' <ref type="bibr">Connor et al. (2014)</ref> reported precision, recall, and F 1 scores of 0.62, 0.54, and 0.58, respectively. In nearly all cases, bootstrapped lexicons have higher precision and F 1 score as <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows.</p><p>Adding small amounts of data helped increase performance mostly through increases in preci- sion. Larger datasets hurt performance because the bootstrapped lexicons were tuned more ap- propriately to the composition of drugs and reac- tions present in the TwitterDrugs corpus which are not guaranteed to overlap exactly with the DIEGO data despite the shared source (Twitter).</p><p>Flagged tweets must be manually reviewed for potential ADE/ADR relations. Because flagged tweets were simply captured by mere co-  occurrence of terms, numerous captured tweets contain discussions of beneficial effects or why a drug was taken. For instance, no obvious ADE/ADR exists in the flagged tweet</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>That ibuprofen 800 knocked my headache right out</head><p>Contrast this with took this vicodin and it is seriously hard to breathe all of a sudden which clearly documents a potentially dangerous co-occurrence of Vicodin R and breathing difficul- ties. Untangling beneficial effects and drug in- dications remains a problem area for automatic ADE/ADR detection especially given that similar language is used for both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Though social media represents a rich source of data, ADE detection with lexicon-based methods remains vulnerable to data sparsity-a low per- centage of tweets containing drug names actu- ally include ADEs. However, the results dis- cussed above show that bootstrapping can in- crease the proportion of true ADEs in returned datasets. Meta-bootstrapped lexicons do not re- quire extensive manual annotation unlike other re- cent lexicon-based systems. Because of the scor- ing function, bootstrapped lexicons are able to eas- ily capture variations in spelling and slang phrases provided they occur in contexts similar to the words present in the growing semantic lexicon.</p><p>In the drug lexicon, several misspellings or slang variations of numerous drugs were iden- tified, such as bendaryl (Benadryl R ) or xannies (Xanax R ), addressing a problem area for social media data. If one were to simply ap- ply existing drug lexicons against this dataset, any slang terms or misspellings would be missed with- out additional processing. Meta-bootstrapping can easily retrieve this data, with the only post- processing being quick manual sifting of gener- ated lexicons for relevant category items.</p><p>Medical event lexicons tended to robustly in- clude slang descriptions for medical issues rang- ing from intoxication (tweakin, turnt up, smashed) to mental states (got me up like zombies), to descriptions of body processes and fluids (barf, urine contains blood). These cannot be identified with existing medical ontologies and several are liable to change dramat-ically as drug users modify the ways they describe their experiences. Importantly, manual analysis can easily capture these potential ADE indications without robust medical training.</p><p>Taken together, misspellings and common slang descriptions can be used to identify potentially se- vere ADEs, such as</p><p>The ER gave me percs and flexeril, I'm high af lmao where percs is a slang term for Percocet R , and high a common generic description for any num- ber of abnormal sensory events. Percocet R and Flexeril R have a high potential for drug interac- tion causing drowsiness, lightheadedness, confu- sion, dizziness, and vision problems 5 -all poten- tial adverse events contained within the generic slang term. Within slang-driven social media data, this drug interaction and its associated side ef- fect would be difficult to capture without the flex- ible lexicons generated by the bootstrapping pro- cedure.</p><p>Because the bootstrapped lexicons require manual pruning of irrelevant results, meta- bootstrapping is unlikely to save large amounts of time compared to existing research methods. However, the ease at which novel, relevant, non- standard lexicon items are identified and added to the lexicon and the competitive abilities of known- ADE identification in a small test set emphasizes the applicability of this approach for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Future Work</head><p>The lexicons generated by meta-bootstrapping provide numerous opportunities for research ex- tension. For instance, lexicons may be easily ap- plied across a drug class, allowing for fast identi- fication of ADE discussion in social media across a particular class of interest, such as the ongoing crisis surrounding the abuse of prescription-only narcotic painkillers. After flagging a tweet con- taining an ADE/ADR resulting from opioid use, researchers could utilize tweet metadata to help crisis managers identify demographic areas of in- terest for more targeted care.</p><p>Outside pharmacovigilance, the lexicons can also be used to 'bootstrap' corpus generation. Be- cause novel extractions represented roughly 60% of the generated drug lexicon, these new entries can be used to expand the search query set, return- ing a more diverse set of tweets than the original 334 drug names. This, in turn, is likely to lead to identification of more novel items, allowing the process to be repeated. Doing so allows for easy identification of slang terms as they are created and enter common use.</p><p>Lastly, the TwitterDrugs corpus represents a rich resource for subsequent research. It may be easily annotated for supervised techniques, or can be explored with different semi-and unsuper- vised methods for lexicon generation, relation ex- traction, or ADE/ADR classification. The boot- strapping procedure itself can be modified to in- clude additional standardization techniques which may diminish the number of patterns by simplify- ing linguistic complexities. Lemmatization would be highly effective here, allowing patterns differ- entiated by only inflectional morphology to be combined. However, many of these standardiza- tion techniques still perform poorly on the non- standard language found in social media data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Riloff and Jones (1999)'s metabootstrapping algorithm</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,307.28,62.81,218.26,104.73" type="bitmap" /></figure>
