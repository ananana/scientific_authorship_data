			<abstract>
				<p>Comparisons in text, such as in online reviews , serve as useful decision aids. In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying whether a comparison exists between a specific pair of entity mentions in a sentence. This formulation is trans-formative, as previous work only seeks to determine whether a sentence is comparative , which is presumptuous in the event the sentence mentions multiple entities and is comparing only some, not all, of them. Our approach leverages not only lexical features such as salient words, but also structural features expressing the relationships among words and entity mentions. To model these features seamlessly, we rely on a dependency tree representation , and investigate the applicability of a series of tree kernels. This leads to the development of a new context-sensitive tree kernel: Skip-node Kernel (SNK). We further describe both its exact and approximate computations. Through experiments on real-life datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of our kernel-based approach for comparison identification, as well as the utility of SNK and its approximations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>When weighing various alternatives, users in- creasingly turn to the social media, by scouring online reviews, discussion forums, etc. Our goal is to extract from such corpora those text snip- pets where users make direct comparisons of en- tities. While sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pang and Lee, 2008</ref>) may be helpful in evaluating individual en- tities, comparison by the same author within a sen- tence provides an unambiguous and more equi- table basis for the relative positions of two enti- ties on some aspect. For example, the sentence s 1 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, taken from an Amazon review about a digital camera, makes two distinct comparisons: #1) between "A630" and "A-series cameras" and #2) between "A630" and "its competition", with a clear sense of which entity mention is the greater on some aspect ("larger"). Moreover, comparisons may be objective (e.g., larger) or subjective (e.g., better), while sentiments are primarily subjective.</p><p>Problem Given a sentence and a specific pair of entity mentions, we seek to determine if a com- parison exists between those two mentions. In pre- vious work, the problem was formulated as identi- fying comparative sentences, i.e., those containing at least one comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jindal and Liu, 2006a</ref>). This is not ideal because a sentence may contain more than two entity mentions, and may be com- paring only some of them. For instance, s 1 is com- parative with respect to the pair (A630, A-series cameras) and the pair (A630, its competition), but not the pair (A-series cameras, its competition).</p><p>We therefore postulate that the more appropri- ate formulation is comparisons within sentences. If a sentence compares two entities (A, B) with re- spect to some aspect Z, it should be possible to reformulate it into another sentence such as: "A is better than B with respect to Z" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kessler and Kuhn, 2014a</ref>). Based on this definition, there is no comparison between (A-series cameras, its com- petition) in s 1 . Here, we adopt this apt definition with a slight restriction to make it more practical, and seek to identify such comparisons automati- cally. We consider only sentences with at least two entity mentions involved in gradable compar- isons, i.e., a clear sense of scaling in the compar- ison (e.g., A is better than B.). Such comparisons are more useful in investigating the pros and cons of entities, as opposed to equative comparisons ex- pressing parity between two mentions (e.g., A is as good as B.), or superlative comparisons expressing the primacy of an entity with respect to unknown reference entities (e.g., A is the best.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID Sentence</head><p>Remarks s 1 The A630 is slightly larger than previous generation A- series cameras, and also larger than much of its competition. Contains two comparisons: (A630, A-series cam- eras) and (A630, its competition). s 2 I got 30D for my wife because she wanted a better camera. Includes comparative predicate "better", but con- tains no comparison. s 3 I had D3100 and it was nice but the D5100 is truly amazing. No comparative predicate, but has a comparison: (D3100, D5100). s 4 D7000 and D7100 do better at high ISO than D300s.</p><p>Contains two comparisons: (D7000, D300s) and (D7100, D300s). Approach For English, there usually is a com- parative predicate that anchors a comparison, such as "better" or "worse". However, many sentences with such predicate words are not comparisons. The sentence s 2 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> has the word "better", but does not contain any comparison between the entity mentions. Yet, other words (e.g., "amaz- ing"), though not a comparative predicate, could signify a comparison, e.g., in s 3 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>(Jindal and Liu, 2006a) considered the "con- text" around a predicate. A sentence is trans- formed into a sequence involving the predicate and the part of speech (POS) within a text window around the predicate (usually three words before and after). For instance, s 2 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> would be transformed into the sequence PRP VBD DT bet- ter NN. Such sequences are labeled comparative or non-comparative, upon which (Jindal and Liu, 2006a) applies sequential pattern mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal and Srikant, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ayres et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pei et al., 2001</ref>) to learn class sequential rule (CSR). These CSRs are then used as features in classifying com- parative sentences.</p><p>While (Jindal and Liu, 2006a) makes some progress by considering context, its performance may be affected by several factors. First, CSRs are not sensitive to entity mentions. It may classify s 1 as comparative generally, missing the nuance that s 1 is not comparing the pair (A-series cam- eras, its competition). Second, as CSRs requires a list of comparative predicates, the quality and the completeness of the list are crucial. For instance, "amazing" is not in their list, and thus the compar- ison in s 3 may not be identifiable. Third, due to the windowing effect, CSRs has a limited ability to model long-range dependencies. For s 4 , a window of three words around the predicate "better" ex- cludes the word "than" that would have been very informative. Yet, enlarging the window might then bring in irrelevant associations.</p><p>What is important then is not so much whether a sentence is comparative as whether two entity mentions are related by a comparative relation. One insight we draw is how comparison identifi- cation is effectively a form of relation extraction. While there are diverse relation extraction formu- lations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Culotta and Sorensen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bunescu and Mooney, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nguyen et al., 2009)</ref>, our distinct relation type is comparison of two entity mentions.</p><p>Armed with this insight, we propose a kernel- based approach based on a dependency tree rep- resentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nivre, 2005)</ref>, with significant innova- tions motivated by the comparative identification task. This proposed approach has several advan- tages over CSR. Most importantly, it models de- pendencies between any pair of words (including entity mentions), whereas CSR only relates a com- parative predicate to nearby POS tags. For other advantages, unlike CSR, this approach is contin- gent on neither a pre-specified list of comparative predicates, nor a specific window length.</p><p>Contributions In this paper, we make the fol- lowing contributions. First, we re-formulate the problem of automatic identification of compara- tive sentences into the more general task of iden- tifying comparisons within sentences. Second, we propose to frame comparison identification as a re- lation extraction problem. This entails: #1) deriv- ing an appropriate dependency tree representation of sentences to enable discrimination of compari- son vs. non-comparison within the same sentence (see Section 2), and #2) a systematic exploration of the applicability of various tree kernel spaces to our task (see Section 3). Third, due to the lim- itation of the existing tree kernels, we propose a new tree kernel: Skip-node Kernel that is context- sensitive, and discuss both its exact and approx- imate computations (see Section 4). Fourth, we validate its effectiveness and efficiency through experiments on real-life datasets (see Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview</head><p>Task The input is a corpus of sentences S con- cerning a set of entities within a certain domain (e.g., digital cameras). Every sentence s ∈ S con- tains at least two entity mentions. The set of entity mentions in s is denoted M s . For instance, the sentence s 4 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> contains three entity men- tions: D7000, D7100, and D300s. The same entity may be mentioned more than once in a sentence, in which case every mention is a distinct instance.</p><p>As output, we seek to determine, for each pair of entity mentions (m i &lt; m j ) ∈ M s in a sen- tence s ∈ S, a binary class label of whether s con- tains a comparison between m i and m j . For the pair (D7000, D7100) in s 4 , the correct class is 0 (no comparison). For the other two pairs (D7000, D300s) and (D7100, D300s), the correct class is 1 (comparisons). We do not seek to identify the as- pect of comparison, which is a different problem of independent research interest (see Section 6).</p><p>Dependency Tree In order to represent both the lexical units (words) as well their structural dependencies seamlessly, we represent each sentence s as a dependency tree T . For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(a)</ref> shows the dependency tree of s 4 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The tree is rooted at the main verb ("do"), and each dependency relation associates a head word and a dependent word. To describe a tree or any of its substructures, we use the bracket notation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a) in this notation is [do [D7000 <ref type="bibr">[and]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[D7100]] [better [at [ISO [high]]] [than [D300s]]]].</formula><p>Here, we make two observations. First, there is one tree even for a sentence with multiple pairs of entity mentions. Second, the information sig- nalling a comparison is borne by the structures around the mentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[better [than]</ref>], rather than the actual mentions (e.g., "D7000"). These lead us to introduce a modified dependency tree that is distinct for every pair of mentions, achieved by replacing each entity mention of in- terest by a placeholder token. Here, we use the to- ken "#camera" for illustration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(b)</ref> shows the modified tree for the pair (D7000, D7100). This enables learning in an entity-agnostic way, because the token ensures that sentences about dif- ferent cameras are interpreted similarly.</p><p>Convolution Kernel Observe how the trees of the pair (D7000, D300s) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(c) and the pair (D7100, D300s) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(d), which are both comparisons, share certain substructures, such D7000 and D7100 do better at high ISO than D300s</p><p>(a) original dependency tree #camera and #camera do better at high ISO than D300s</p><p>(b) modified dependency tree for (D7000, D7100) #camera and D7100 do better at high ISO than #camera (c) modified dependency tree for (D7000, D300s) D7000 and #camera do better at high ISO than #camera as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[do [better [than [#camera]]].</formula><p>In contrast, the tree in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b) for the pair (D7000, D7100), which is not a comparison, does not contain this substructure. What we need is a way to systematically examine tree substructures to determine the similarity between two trees.</p><p>Kernel methods offer a way to measure the sim- ilarity by exploring an implicit feature space with- out enumerating all substructures explicitly. Sup- pose that T denotes the space of all possible in- stances. A kernel function K is a symmetric and positive semidefinite function that maps the in- stance space T × T to a real value in the range of [0, ∞) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Haussler, 1999)</ref>. A tree kernel func- tion can be reformulated into a convolution kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins and Duffy, 2001</ref>), shown in Equation 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">K(T 1 , T 2 ) = n i ∈T 1 n j ∈T 2 D(n i , n j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, n i and n j denote each node in their re- spective tree instances T 1 and T 2 . D(n i , n j ) is the number of common substructure instances be- tween the two sub-trees rooted in n i and n j re- spectively. The exact form of D(n i , n j ) depends on the specific definition of the tree kernel space.</p><p>In Section 3, we systematically explore the appli- cability of various tree kernel spaces, leading to the introduction of the new Skip-node Kernel.</p><p>The appropriate kernel function can be embed- ded seamlessly in kernel methods for classifica- tion. In this work, we use the Support Vector Ma- chines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Steinwart and Christmann, 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tree Kernel Spaces</head><p>Tree kernels count substructures of a tree in some high-dimensional feature space. Different tree kernel spaces vary in the amount and the type of information they can capture, and thus may suit different purposes. To find a suitable tree kernel for the comparison identification task, we first sys- tematically explore a progression of known tree kernel spaces, including Sub-tree, Subset Tree, and Partial Tree. Through the use of appropriate examples, we show how these existing tree ker- nel spaces may not be appropriate for certain in- stances. This section culminates in the introduc- tion of a new feature space that we call Skip-node.</p><p>Sub-tree (ST) Space In this space, the ba- sic substructure is a subgraph formed by a node along with all its descendants. Applying this ker- nel to two dependency trees of similar sentences may not be appropriate due to, for example, mod- ifier words that change the dependency structure. To illustrate this, let us examine the two depen- dency parses in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Both support compar- isons, and ideally we can detect some level of sim- ilarity. However, if we consider only sub-trees, the two dependency trees share in common only two fragments: <ref type="bibr">[#camera]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[is]</ref>. Neither of these fragments is indicative of a comparison. Subset Tree (SST) Space We next consider the SST kernel, which computes similarity in a more general space of substructures than ST. Any subgraph of a tree that preserves produc- tion rules is counted. This definition suggests SST is intended more for a constituency parse <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Moschitti, 2006a)</ref>. In this feature space, the parses in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> now have in common the fol- lowing fragments: <ref type="bibr">[#camera]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[is]</ref>, [than <ref type="bibr">[#camera]</ref>]. This representation is better than ST's, e.g., the fragment [than <ref type="bibr">[#camera]</ref>] is informative. However, as a whole, the set of fea- tures are still insufficient to identify a comparison.</p><p>#camera is twice as expensive as #camera</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a)</head><p>Previously I had D60 and D7100 and #camera is twice as good as #camera</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b)</head><p>Previously I had D60 and #camera and this camera is twice as good as #camera Partial Tree (PT) Space In turn, the PT space allows breaking of production rules, making it a better choice than SST for dependency parses. PT kernel would find that the parse in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(a) with all its subgraphs can be matched as a whole within the parse in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(b), identifying a close match.</p><p>However, PT kernel is prone to two drawbacks. By generating an exponential feature space, it may overfit and degrade generalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cumby and Roth, 2003)</ref>. More importantly, PT considers tree fragments independently from their contexts, re- sulting in features involving non-related parts of a sentence. This is particularly apparent when we consider multiple entities within a sentence.</p><p>Suppose that <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(a) is in our training set, and we have the sentence below in the testing set:</p><p>Previously, I had D60 and D7100, and this camera is twice as good as D60.  would allow some degree of relaxation in deter- mining the structural similarity between trees.</p><p>We therefore propose the Skip-node (SN) space, which represents a generalized space of tree frag- ments, where some nodes can be "skipped" or re- labeled to a special symbol ' * ' that would match nodes of any label. A restriction on this space is that each skip symbol must connect two non-skip (regular) nodes. The implication is that skips code for some notion of connecting distance between non-skip nodes. Moreover, the space would not include features such as [ * [ * <ref type="bibr">[#camera]</ref>]] that serve only to indicate the presence of ances- tors, and not any relationship of non-skip nodes. Thus, SN space effectively generalizes over the PT space, and enriches it with context-sensitive features. To avoid overfitting, in addition to decay parameter λ used in PT kernel, we associate SN kernel with two other parameters. The SN space consists of rooted ordered trees where some nodes are labeled with a special skip symbol ' * ', such that the number of regular nodes (not marked with ' * ') is at most S, and each skip node is within a distance of L from a non-skip node. This engen- ders a graceful gradation of similarity as the num- ber of skip nodes in a substructure grows, yet im- poses a limit to the extent of relaxation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Skip-node Kernel Computation</head><p>We now discuss the computation of Skip-node Kernel, first exactly, and thereafter approximately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Exact Computation</head><p>We define the alignment of common fragments be- tween two trees in the Skip-node space. When S = 1, only singleton nodes with the same labels contribute to the kernel, and alignment is straight- forward. When aligning fragments with two reg- ular nodes (S &gt; 1), we consider their connection structure and the order of the child nodes to pre- vent over-counting substructures with the same la- bels (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[ * [as]</ref>[as]] in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>). To pre- serve the natural order of words in a sentence, we enumerate the tree nodes according to preorder, left-to-right depth-first search (DFS) traversal.</p><p>In turn, the connection structure is defined by the skip-node path connecting two regular nodes. This can be expressed as a sequence of upward (towards the root) and downward (towards the leaves) steps we need to perform to get from the leftmost to the rightmost regular node. Due to the natural ordering of regular nodes, upward steps are followed by downward steps. The se- quence can be expressed as a pair of numbers: ρ(n l , u), ρ(n r , u), where n l is the leftmost reg- ular node of a fragment, n r is the rightmost one, u = σ(n l , n r ) is the lowest common ancestor of nodes n l , n r , and ρ returns the number of edges in the shortest path connecting two nodes.</p><p>Suppose a rooted tree T = (N, E) has pre- order DFS enumeration N = (n 1 , n 2 , ..., n |N | ). For i &lt; j, we define a function π(n i , n j ), which canonically represents the way two nodes are con- nected in a tree, as follows: π(n i , n j ) = ρ(n i , σ(n i , n j )), ρ(n j , σ(n i , n j )).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEFINITION 1 (STRUCTURAL ISOMOR- PHISM): Given two trees</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">T 1 = (N 1 , E 1 ), T 2 = (N 2 , E 2 )</formula><p>, we say that pairs of nodes</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(v i , u i ), (v j , u j ) ∈ N 1 × N 2 are structurally isomorphic and write (v i , u i ) (v j , u j ) when π(v i , v j ) = π(u i , u j ) on the valid domain.</formula><p>It can be shown that structural isomorphism is a transitive relation. This property allows us to grow aligned fragments by adding one node at a time:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(v i , u i ) (v j , u j ) ∧ (v j , v j ) (v k , u k ) ⇒ (v i , u i ) (v k , u k ).</formula><p>To compute the kernel, we use a graph-based approach to enumerate all the common substruc- tures in the Skip-node space. Given two trees T 1 and T 2 , we begin by aligning their nodes. The sets of nodes in T 1 and T 2 are N 1 and N 2 respectively. Let N G be a set of pairs (n i , n j ) ∈ N 1 ×N 2 , where n i and n j have the same label. On top of N G , we build a graph G = (N G , E G ). We draw an edge between two vertices</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(v i , v k ), (u j , u l ) ∈ N G , if (v i , u j ) (v k , u l ) and ρ(v i , v k ) ≤ L.</formula><p>Any connected subgraph of G represents a fea- ture in the Skip-node space common to both T 1 and T 2 . The kernel then needs to count the num- ber of connected subgraphs of sizes not more than S. To see that this procedure is correct, we sim- ply need to trace back the construction of graph G, and build an bijection from a subgraph of G to the corresponding fragments of T 1 and T 2 .</p><p>Enumerating all the connected subgraphs of a given graph requires exponential time. The al- gorithm described above requires</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">O(|N 1 ||N 2 | + S i=1 |N G | i</formula><p>) time, assuming that the distance be- tween two nodes in a tree can be computed in O(1) with appropriate linear preprocessing. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bender and Farach-Colton, 2000</ref>) for insight. The ex- act computation is still tractable on the condition that S and L are not very large. This condition would probably hold in most realistic scenarios. Yet, to improve the practicality of the kernel, we propose a couple of approximations as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Approximate Computation</head><p>One reason for the complexity of the Skip-node kernel is that although the graph G is formed by aligning two trees, by allowing connections through skips, G itself may not necessarily be in the form of a tree. In deriving an approximation, our strategy is to form G through alignment of lin- ear substructures of the original two trees. A Skip- node space over linear structures can be computed in polynomial time using dynamic programming. Linear Skip-node One approximation is to consider linear substructures in the form of root- paths. A root-path is a path from the root of a tree to a leaf. Given two trees T 1 and T 2 , with DFS enumerated nodes N 1 = (v 1 , v 2 , ..., v m 1 ) and N 2 = (u 1 , u 2 , ..., u m 2 ) respectively. Here, v 1 and u 1 are roots, and v m 1 and u m 2 are the leaves. Starting with common fragments at the leaves, we grow them into larger common fragments towards the root. We call this approximation Linear Skip- node. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5(a)</ref> shows examples of features con- sidered by Linear Skip-node for the illustrated tree T in skip-node space (S = 3, L = 2).</p><p>The kernel function can be decomposed into:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">K(T 1 , T 2 ) = v i ∈N 1 u j ∈N 2 S s=1 λ s D(v i , u j , s),</formula><p>where D(v i , u j , s) is the number of common sub- structures of size s with the leftmost regular nodes v i and u j . λ is a decay factor for substructure size. The recursive definition of the kernel is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D(v i , u j , s) = i&lt;k≤m 1 j&lt;l≤m 2 I(v i , v k , u j , u l )D(v k , u l , s − 1), D(v i , u j , 1) = 1 if label(v i ) = label(u j ), 0 otherwise; I(v i , v k , u j , u l ) = 1 (v i ,u j )(v k ,u l ) 1 ρ(v i ,v k )≤L · 1 (v i is an ancestor of v k ) ,</formula><p>where 1 c equals 1 when constraint c is satisfied and 0 otherwise. Note that the first two factors of indicator function I just represent the general Skip-node space constraints, the last factor ensures that features are computed along the root-paths. Lookahead Skip-node The second approxi- mation, Lookahead Skip-node, is related to the ob- servation that when growing a substructure, we do not have to confine the growth only towards an- cestors, as DFS traversal already ensures iterative manner of computation. In other words, the con- straint v i is an ancestor of v k can be dropped:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">I(v i , v k , u j , u l ) = 1 (v i ,u j )(v k ,u l ) · 1 ρ(v i ,v k )≤L .</formula><p>In addition to those features generated by Linear Skip-node in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5(a)</ref>, Lookahead Skip-node can generate additional tree substructures, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5(b)</ref>. The approximation can be com- puted using different DFS enumerations, which may result in different feature sets. In our exper- iments, we used pre-order left-to-right enumera- tion. Given the enumeration of tree T as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig- ure 5</ref>, we start to grow feature fragments from node n 4 . According to the Skip-node space con- straints, the growth can only proceed to nodes n 1 or n 2 . Once any of these nodes is attached to n 4 , we lose tree fragments containing n 3 , as the pro- cedure allows us to grow substructures only to- wards nodes with smaller (earlier) DFS enumer-   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>Data For experiments, we compiled two anno- tated datasets in two domains: Digital Camera and Cell Phone from online review sentences. The re- views were collected from Amazon and Epinions 2 .</p><p>We identified the entity mentions through dic- tionary matching, followed by manual annotation to weed out false positives. Each dictionary entry is a product name (e.g., Canon PowerShot D20, D7100) or a common product reference (e.g., this camera, that phone). The dataset includes only sentences that contain at least two entity mentions. Every pair of entities within a sentence was an- notated with a comparative label according to the definition given in Section 2. A sentence is com- parative if at least one pair of entities within it is in a comparative relation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the dataset properties, in terms of the number sentences and the percentage that are comparative sentences, as well as the number of pairs of entity mentions and the percentage that are comparative relations. There are more pairs than sentences, i.e., many sentences mention more than two entities.</p><p>This dataset subsumes the annotated gradable <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In this particular case, all features could have been com- puted by Lookahead Skip-node using preorder right-to-left DFS enumeration, although it may not be true in general. <ref type="bibr">2</ref>    <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Joachims, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Moschitti, 2006b</ref>), into which we built Skip-node Kernel.

The sentences were parsed and lemmatized with the use of the Stanford NLP software <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen and Manning, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The experiments were done on 10 random data splits in 80:20 proportion of training vs. testing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Comparison Identification</head><p>Our first and primary objective is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the task of identifying comparisons between a pair of en-   <ref type="bibr">, 2006a</ref>). Another is BoW, classification using bag-of-words as fea- tures. For the baselines, if a comparative sentence contains more than one pair of entities, we assume that every pair is in comparative relation. The third baseline, BoW † , considers only the words in be- tween of the two target entities. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows the performance on the compar- ison identification task (best results are in bold). In terms of F 1 , it is evident that SNK outperforms the baselines. This is achieved through significant gains in precision. It is expected that the base- lines tend to have a high recall. CSR benefits from the human-constructed predefined list of compara- tive keywords and key phrases that a kernel-based method is unable to learn from a training split. BoW † tends to have a higher precision than the other baselines, as it is able to distinguish between different pairs of entities within one sentence.</p><p>While SNK may have an inherent advantage over CSR or BoW due to its entity orientation, to investigate the effectiveness of the method it- self, we now compare them on the previous task of comparative sentence identification. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> shows that even in this task, SNK still performs better than the baselines. Comparing <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3 and  Table 4</ref>, the results also concur with the intuition: once we fold up multiple entity pairs in a sentence into a comparative sentence, we observe a drop in recall and an increase in precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Tree Kernel Spaces</head><p>Our second objective is to explore the progres- sion of feature spaces discussed in Section 3. Ta- ble 5 reports the results on comparison identifi- cation task. The F 1 columns show that the per- formance gradually increases from STK to SNK along with the increase in the complexity of fea- ture space. PTK and SNK can be considered high-   <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Tree kernels combined with bag-of-words variance estimators due to the power of their fea- ture spaces. The data is such that these kernels may not have fully modeled the feature space com- pletely enough to show even sharper differences. SNK's parameters were optimized to non-trivial cases (S &gt; 1 and L &gt; 1) by the grid-search, i.e., S = 3 and L = 2 for Digital Camera and S = 2 and L = 3 for Cell Phone. The trivial case S = 1 represents a standard bag-of-words feature space, i.e., this space is embedded into Skip-node space whenever S &gt; 1. To show that SNK does not merely take advantage of this simple space to com- pete with structural kernels, we carried out another experiment where we combined STK, SSTK, and PTK with bag-of-word representation of a sen- tence. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows that surprisingly this combi- nation harms the quality of PTK. STK and SSTK gain more from bag-of-words features. Neverthe- less, the overall outperformance by SNK remains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Skip-node Kernel Approximations</head><p>Our third objective is to study the utility of the ap- proximations of SNK described in Section 4. Ta- ble 7 reports the performance of the approxima- tions. For Camera, the performance of Lookahead    To study the running time, we randomly select 500 sentences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref> shows the time for ap- plying a kernel function to 250k pairs of sentences when we vary two parameters: S and L. When S varies, SNK running time has exponential be- haviour, whereas the approximations show fairly linear curves. L seems to influence the computa- tion time linearly for SNK and and its approxima- tions. The experiments were carried out on a PC with Intel Core i5 CPU 3.2 GHz and 4Gb RAM.</p><p>This experiment shows that the original SNK is still tractable for small S and L, which turn out to be the case for optimal effectiveness. If efficiency is of paramount importance, the two approxima- tions are significantly faster, without much degra- dation (none in some cases) of effectiveness.</p></div>

			<note place="foot">tifying whether a comparison exists between a specific pair of entity mentions in a sentence. This formulation is transformative, as previous work only seeks to determine whether a sentence is comparative, which is presumptuous in the event the sentence mentions multiple entities and is comparing only some, not all, of them. Our approach leverages not only lexical features such as salient words, but also structural features expressing the relationships among words and entity mentions. To model these features seamlessly, we rely on a dependency tree representation, and investigate the applicability of a series of tree kernels. This leads to the development of a new context-sensitive tree kernel: Skip-node Kernel (SNK). We further describe both its exact and approximate computations. Through experiments on real-life datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of our kernel-based approach for comparison identification, as well as the utility of SNK and its approximations.</note>
