				<p>In recent years, the number of texts has grown rapidly. For example, most review-based portals, like Yelp or Amazon, contain thousands of user-generated reviews. It is impossible for any human reader to process even the most relevant of these documents. The most promising tool to solve this task is a text summarization. Most existing approaches, however, work on small, homogeneous, English datasets, and do not account to multi-linguality, opinion shift, and domain effects. In this paper, we introduce our research plan to use neural networks on user-generated travel reviews to generate summaries that take into account shifting opinions over time. We outline future directions in sum-marization to address all of these issues. By resolving the existing problems, we will make it easier for users of review-sites to make more informed decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, amount of available text corpora has been growing rapidly with increasing popular- ity of web. Users produce a huge amount of text every day. With a larger amount of text and infor- mation included within it, it becomes impossible for people to read all the texts and it leads to in- formation overload. For a common human, it is not possible to read all the available text even if he reads only all the most relevant ones. The task of text summarization is known for a very long period. In late 50s Luhn <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Luhn, 1958)</ref> tried to create abstract of documents automatically. Over decades there have been many summarization sys- tems dealing with different forms of summariza- tion. This task belongs to one of the most chal- lenging tasks in natural language processing. The task of text summarization can be particularly im- portant for decision making or relevance judg- ments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nenkova and McKeown, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Automatic text summarization became very useful and also important tool to help the user ob- tain as much information as possible without the necessity to read all the original documents. Many definitions of text summarization exist. Text sum- mary can be defined as a text produced from one or more texts that contains the same information as the original text and is no longer than half of the original text <ref type="bibr">(Hovy and Lin, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mani (Mani, 2001</ref>) defined the goal of summarization as a pro- cess of finding the source of information, extract- ing content from it and presenting the most impor- tant content to the user in a concise form and in a manner sensitive to needs of user's application.</p><p>We can divide techniques of summarization into two categories: abstractive and extractive summa- rization ( <ref type="bibr">Gambhir and Gupta, 2017)</ref>. Extractive summarization aims to choose parts of the original document such as sentence part, whole sentence or paragraph. Abstractive summarization wants to get paraphrase content of the original docu- ment with respect to cohesion and concise of out- put summary. Selection of the text section in ex- tractive summarization leads to a partial loss of an output cohesion, which abstractive summarization tries to accomplish.</p><p>In last few years, approaches based on neural networks became very popular for summarization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rush et al., 2015)</ref>. A specific branch of text summarization is a summarization of opinions from the human-generated text. We can summa- rize opinions from customer reviews or comments on social networks. This problem differs from a standard summarization task due to a number of repetitive and redundant information. There can be also a problem with polarity of opinions be-tween different users. This types of summary can be very useful for both a customer of products and a product owner. Opinion summarization can be particularly important for decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Yuan et al., 2015)</ref>. This summarization type can also show trends in opinions collected from comments on social networks, especially when a number of text entries grows very fast.</p><p>In this work, we also discuss analysis of spe- cific aspect of opinion summarization: sentiment analysis of customer reviews. In summarization task, sentiment information can be viewed as one of the inputs along with text corpora itself. A dif- ference between sentiment of text fragments and sentiment of whole summarization is a very inter- esting aspect to consider.</p><p>The expected contributions of our research are: (1) overview of a recent development in opin- ion summarization, (2) assembly of a reason- ably big dataset for opinion summarization (from travel based portals), (3) a novel method for opin- ion summarization based on state-of-the-art neural network architectures.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains recent advances in text summa- rization. In Section 3, we focus on possibilities in the area of opinion mining and summarization of opinions. Future directions in summarization are drawn in Section 4. The research proposal includ- ing opinion summarization along with a possible dataset and a planned experiment are described in Section 5. Final observations and conclusions are mentioned in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Text Summarization</head><p>In recent years, text summarization has been fo- cusing on the abstractive summarization with a use of neural models. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rush et al., 2015)</ref>, the au- thors showed a way to use a neural network based on encoder-decoder architecture for creating ab- stractive summarization on the sentence level. Us- ing this type of model originates from a task of machine translation where these models were used before. The approach presented in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chopra et al., 2016)</ref> can be considered as a follower of the pre- vious work. Instead of a feed-forward neural net- work a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used. RNN emphasizes the order of input words. The authors presented conditional RNN with convolu- tional attention-based encoder.</p><p>Ferreira et al. presented a sentence clustering algorithm to deal with the redundancy and infor- mation diversity problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ferreira et al., 2014</ref>). The algorithm uses the text representation to con- vert input text into graph model along with four types of relations between sentences.</p><p>A specific yet not very widely used technique is Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). For text summarization, a framework for abstractive sum- marization based on the recent development of a treebank for AMR (  can be em- ployed. This framework parses source text into a set of AMR graphs, then the graph is transformed into a summary graph from which the output sum- mary is generated.</p><p>The use of neural architecture from machine translation became widely popular and many au- thors made research in this area. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nallapati et al. (Nallapati et al., 2016</ref>) presented a neural model for abstractive summarization along with the in- troduction of a whole new dataset for evaluation of summarization.</p><p>The use of attention mechanism in neural net- works became widely spread and very popular. Many works showed usefulness of this mechanism in other tasks. In summarization task, a work proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">See et al. (See et al., 2017</ref>) intro- duced a method based on the principle of encoder- decoder along with attention distribution of input text. They used hybrid pointer-generator architec- ture with a use of the coverage. The pointer mech- anism tries to solve problem of choosing words ei- ther to use original word or generate a new one. The coverage part ensures minimizing repetition during the text generation in the later parts of the output. Interesting modification was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Paulus et al. (Paulus et al., 2017)</ref>. Their mechanism modifies standard attention mecha- nism and also objective function with a combi- nation of maximum likelihood and cross-entropy loss. This mechanism is used in a phase of rein- forcement learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tan et al. (Tan et al., 2017)</ref> proposed another modification of attention mech- anism and their graph-based attention mechanism was used in a sequence-to-sequence framework. The goal of the encoder is mapping the input doc- uments to the vector representation. Then decoder is used to generate the output sentences. Novelty of their method lies in using graph-based atten- tion mechanism in a hierarchical encoder-decoder framework.</p><p>Neural models are widely used for both abstrac-tive and extractive summarization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nallapati et al. (Nallapati et al., 2017</ref>) presented a neural sequen- tial model for the extractive summarization of doc- uments. Visualizing impact of a particular parts of the input text to output summarization we can con- sider as other contribution of this paper.</p><p>Similarly to other tasks of natural language processing, convolutional neural networks can be used for summarization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yasunaga et al. (Yasunaga et al., 2017)</ref> incorporates sentence rela- tions using Graph Convolutional Network on re- lation graphs along with the sentence embeddings obtained from RNN, which were taken as input node features. This system tries to exploit a repre- sentational power of neural networks and sentence relation information which can be encoded in the graph representation of document clusters.</p><p>Much research has been conducted in this field in recent years. Other interesting modification can employ latent structure modeling presented in a framework based on sequence-to-sequence ori- ented encoder-decoder model which incorporates a latent structure modeling component ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Li et al., 2017)</ref>. This model generates abstractive summary of the latent variables but also of the the discrimi- native deterministic states.</p><p>All aforementioned summarization works were primarily aimed at summarization of news arti- cles. There can be also other summarization types like a summarization of emails ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Carenini et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yousefi-Azar and Hamey, 2017)</ref>, event- based summarization ( <ref type="bibr">Glava≈° and ≈†najder, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kedzie et al., 2015)</ref>, personalized summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">D√≠az and Gerv√°s, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Moro and Bielikova, 2012)</ref> and also sentiment-based or opinion sum- marization described in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Opinion Mining and Summarization</head><p>Summarization of opinions is a special type of summarization. Product and services along with comments on social networks could consist of hundreds of entries and could lead to information overload. Repetition of opinions is one of the ma- jor differences that contrasts with the summariza- tion of news. User-generated text often remark- ably differentiate from news text which is com- monly widely revised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Summarization of Customer Opinions</head><p>Summarization of opinions from product reviews is the most common example of opinion summa- rization. These reviews often come from stores of electronics like Amazon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yuan et al. (Yuan et al., 2015</ref>) presented user study how opinion summa- rization can help in decision making before con- sumer purchase.</p><p>One of the first works in opinion summarization could be considered the work of Hu and Liu ( <ref type="bibr">Hu and Liu, 2004</ref>). They proposed a set of techniques for mining and summarizing product reviews. The main goal of their opinion summarization system is to provide a feature-based summary.</p><p>Tadano et al. proposed method based on evalu- ative sentence extraction where aspects are judged by their ratings, tf-idf value and number of men- tions with similar topic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tadano et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Summarization approach based on the topical structure was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhan et al. (Zhan et al., 2009</ref>). They presented a topical structure as a list of significant topics related from a docu- ment set. To reduce redundancy of sentences they implemented a method of maximal marginal rele- vance.</p><p>The Opinosis project presented a graph-based summarization framework ( <ref type="bibr">Ganesan et al., 2010)</ref>. This framework tries to generate abstractive sum- marization of highly redundant opinions. Authors showed that their summaries have better agree- ment with human summaries compared to the baseline extractive methods.</p><p>Dalal and Zaveri presented application of a multi-step approach for automatic opinion min- ing consisting of various phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Dalal and Zaveri, 2013)</ref>. Authors showed that this multi-step feature-based semi-supervised opinion mining ap- proach can be successful in identification of opin- ionated sentences from user reviews.</p><p>Aspect-based sentiment analysis can help to produce a structured summary based on positive and negative opinion about features of the prod- uct ( <ref type="bibr">Kansal and Toshniwal, 2014</ref>). The system takes into consideration not only sentence infor- mation, but also pieces of information from other sentences or reviews called contextual informa- tion. The authors also showed that polarity of words can be different even within one domain.</p><p>Kurian and Asokan presented a method with the cross-domain sentiment classification along with the distributional similarity of opinion words ( <ref type="bibr">Kurian and Asokan, 2015)</ref>. This method helps to classify and summarize product reviews and, in contrast with other methods, it does not require la-beled data from the target domain or other lexical resources.</p><p>Unlike other opinion summarization systems dealing with sentiment polarity, another study for- mulated opinion summarization as a community leader detection problem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhu et al., 2015)</ref>. Au- thors proposed a graph-based method to identify informative sentences and evaluated method on product reviews. The study proposed algorithms for leaders detection in the sentence graph.</p><p>A system named Gist ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lovinger et al., 2017</ref>) in- tends to deal with a large amount of text and au- tomatically summarizes it into informative and ac- tionable key sentences. Gist tries to summarize original reviews into the short text consisting of a few key sentences that will capture the overall sentiment about the product.</p><p>A kind of opinion summarization could be a summarization of travel reviews to give feedback for quality of hotels, restaurants or other services. A clustering based method for summarization of hotel reviews was proposed by <ref type="bibr">Hu et al. (Hu et al., 2017)</ref>. They also showed additional information as author's reputation or creation date could have a huge impact on relevant summary creation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Raut et al. (Raut and Londhe, 2014</ref>) presented machine learning and Senti-WordNet method for mining opinions from hotel reviews and also a method for sentence relevant scoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Summarization of Community Answers</head><p>Along with the summarization of customer re- views, a very important summarization type con- siders comments on social networks or answers in question answering (QA) systems as input entries. Investigation in this forms of text entries can lead to easier decision making.</p><p>A sub-modular function-based framework was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2014</ref>). This framework can be used for query-focused opinion summarization. Authors evaluated this framework in QA and blog dataset. Statistically learned sen- tence relevance along with information coverage with respect to diverse topics are encoded as sub- modular functions.</p><p>Work of Lloret et al. (Lloret et al., 2015) deals both with the summarization of opinions in social networks and opinions in product reviews. Their method can be characterized with an integration of sentence simplification, but also regeneration of sentence and also internal concept representation in the summarization task. The method tries to be able to generate abstractive summaries.</p><p>There are many topics in this area which can lead to very interesting observations. Guo et al. ( <ref type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015)</ref> proposed a model for opin- ion summarization of highly contrastive opinions particularly for controversial issues. They inte- grated expert opinions with ordinary opinions to create an output of contrastive sentence pairs. The study also presented this method as a unified way for users to better summarize opinions concerning controversial issues.</p><p>Another study explores opinion summarization of the spontaneous conversation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wang and Liu, 2015)</ref>. Phone conversation corpus was annotated in this study and authors investigated two methods of extractive summarization, graph-based with in- corporating topic and sentiment information and supervised method which cast this problem as a classification problem.</p><p>A study from Li et al. deals also with opinion summarization in blogging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2016</ref>). They proposed a convolutional neural network for opin- ion summarization based on recent deep-learning research. Maximal marginal relevance is used for extraction of representative opinion sentences.</p><p>A very important problem of the volume and volatility of opinionated data published in social media was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tsirakis et al. (Tsirakis et al., 2016)</ref>. They discussed that most of methods deal only with a small volume of data, where they are quite effective, but usually do not scale up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Future Directions</head><p>As presented in the previous sections, many chal- lenges are still present in summarization. Stan- dard text summarization usually applied to news articles deals still with the problem of abstractive summarization. Text summarization techniques can be on a different level of abstraction and usu- ally are not fully abstractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(See et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Another big challenge lies in summarization of text in languages other than English. Most of methods were evaluated only on English and inter- esting could be an evaluation in other ones along with their specifics. Another aspect could be sum- marization over multiple languages where input text does not need to be in only one language.</p><p>Summarization of user-generated content has to deal with a problem of the noisy and ungram- matical documents but also with very diverse and conflicting opinions included within these docu- ments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Murray et al., 2017)</ref>. This problem is even more protuberant in minor languages where opin- ion mining and sentiment analysis is not well <ref type="bibr">developed (Krchnavy and Simko, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In opinion summarization with thousands of in- put entries a researcher should deal with a change of opinions during the time. When summarizing customer reviews for services like hotels or restau- rants, change of quality should be considered. It can lead to a specific time-based summary which considers progress of opinions over the time. This problem is also relevant in summarization of text in social networks, especially with controversial topics reports to the specific mood in society or can be effected by community leaders. Lack of available large datasets for this task is other cru- cial subject of research in next years, since most of research was evaluated only on small ones.</p><p>A significant problem is present in the evalu- ation phase. Automatic evaluation can be quite controversial as there exist not only one correct summarization. Automatic evaluation measures like ROUGE and its modifications <ref type="bibr">(Lin, 2004</ref>) can partially deal with these problems using n-grams, but still do not handle a use of synonyms. Same problems based on multiple formulation of ground truth can cause problems with human evaluation as well. Experiments evaluated with more human participants have to deal with an agreement be- tween users which can be quite low.</p><p>In next few years, we expect the opinion sum- marization to deal with the domain specifics and also with the user satisfaction. The growth of user- generated content in the future can lead to focus on reduction of information overload and also to text summarization itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Research Proposal</head><p>As we described earlier, we would like to focus on a specific type of summarization: creation of opinion summaries. Nowadays, travel sites in- clude thousands of reviews from users which vis- ited one of reviewed places. These reviews are very important in decision making of future pos- sible customers but also for owners of services. With tens of new reviews every day it is impossible to read all the reviews and it is often very difficult to choose only the relevant ones. For owners, it is not possible to manually read all the reviews that could be very helpful in service improvement.</p><p>Recent advances in neural networks and also in the text summarization showed that employing encoder-decoder architecture can be very useful. The problem of summarization of customer re- views differs from standard single document sum- marization where the models were applied before. In this task, we should consider multi-modular framework.</p><p>The main idea of this proposal lies in getting better user satisfaction with review summary and also in examining of time aspect on opinion sum- marization. Opinion summarization should pro- cess in several phases:</p><p>1. aspect detection, 2. clustering opinionated features, 3. sentence generation.</p><p>The first step of our proposal lies in the detec- tion of aspects. Before creation of any summary, we need to identify aspects discussed in these re- views. Another mechanism would be needed to distinguish similarity of aspects. A taxonomy of aspects could be a very useful tool to avoid a sepa- ration of similar aspects but other approaches uti- lizing a distributional and vector space should be also examined. We plan to use a bidirectional LSTM neural network with convolutional atten- tion mechanism to identify aspects within text and also to determine polarity of each aspect.</p><p>In the second step, we have to cluster opinion- ated sentences by aspects they talk about. In each cluster, a sentiment and polarity of opinions need to be determined. Whereas in the task of senti- ment analysis only overall or average sentiment is typically provided, in the summarization all polar- ity opinions should be included in the output sum- mary. To reach this goal, all the opinionated sen- tences and opinions should be identified.</p><p>In the final phase, we would like to employ neu- ral network architecture to generate output sen- tences from collected aspect-oriented information. In this phase, we need to generate sentence to out- put summary based on clustered aspects and also use the polarity of aspects. We plan to use LSTM network for this stage and generate sentence from extracted aspects and their polarity.</p><p>There is also another important point of inter- est in task of summarization that has not been dis- cussed yet. The time horizon is often a neglected feature which should be considered in opinion summarization of customer reviews, as opinions of customers can develop over the time in a posi- tive, but also a negative way. We plan to include information about created time to process of clus- tering opinions along with other information about the reviewer, what can lead to better accuracy of summarization as well as resulting user satisfac- tion with an output summary.</p><p>Another significant point to discuss is employ- ing end-to-end deep learning in the task of opinion summarization. The major problem is lack of large dataset which is necessary for such learning. Cre- ation of this kind of dataset is expensive and could take hundreds of hours, if performed manually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Dataset</head><p>To create an appropriate dataset, we plan to gather customer reviews from large travel portals (e.g., TripAdvisor, Booking.com). All reviews come along with other useful information such as score ranking, which should be included too. However any public information about reviewers could be very useful too as it shows reviewer relevance and also importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experiments</head><p>To evaluate the quality of generated summaries a few experiments are required. We will have to cre- ate our ground truth or reference summaries to au- tomatically evaluate quality of summary. As we mentioned before, it is not a sufficient way for evaluation and other experiments including human evaluation would be needed. As this type of eval- uation is very time consuming and difficult for resources, a posteriori evaluation is more feasi- ble way to assess the quality of generated sum- maries. Very interesting view for opinion sum- maries is comparison of the sentiment of gener- ated summaries and the sentiment of original input reviews. In human evaluation, we would like to provide users a list of original reviews, generated summary and ask about their satisfaction. We also plan to use some other automatic measures like ROUGE <ref type="bibr">(Lin, 2004</ref>) and compare generated sum- mary with summary created by humans. Another important measure is aspect coverage and ratio of included aspect in generated summaries from orig- inal reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we described the background for summarization task. More importantly, we de- scribed recent contributions and development in this area with many problems the research deals with. We emphasized the main problems and fu- ture research directions in process of summariza- tion and also particularly for opinion summariza- tion. We also introduced our future research inten- tions along with a design of the first experiments and possible model and dataset. We demonstrated that summarization task and especially opinion summarization still have big open issues will be researched in the next few years.</p><p>Mahak <ref type="bibr">Gambhir and Vishal Gupta. 2017</ref> </p></div>		</body>
