			<abstract>
				<p>Framing is a sophisticated form of discourse in which the speaker tries to induce a cognitive bias through consistent linkage between a topic and a specific context (frame). We build on political science and communication theory and use probabilistic topic models combined with time series regression analysis (autoregressive distributed-lag models) to gain insights about the language dynamics in the political processes. Processing four years of public statements issued by members of the U.S. Congress, our results provide a glimpse into the complex dynamic processes of framing, attention shifts and agenda setting, commonly known as &apos;spin&apos;. We further provide new evidence for the divergence in party discipline in U.S. politics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language is one of the main tools used by politi- cians to promote their agenda, gain popularity, win elections and drive societal change <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Luntz, 2007)</ref>. The growing availability of online archives of po- litical data such as public statements, bill pro- posals, floor speeches, interviews or social me- dia streams allows computational analysis of many aspects of the political process. The analysis performed can increase transparency, facilitate a better educated constituency and improve under- standing of the political process.</p><p>In this paper we propose a framework for au- tomatic analysis of a large collection of political texts. Specifically, we demonstrate how the use of Bayesian methods and time series analysis cap- tures the different ways in which political parties control the political discourse. We show that topic ownership and framing strategies can be inferred using topic models. Moreover, we demonstrate how the models learned are used to construct time series of expressed agendas. These time series are fitted using autoregressive distributive-lag models in order to learn the partisan temporal relations be- tween topics and expressed agendas.</p><p>This framework could also be applied in other domains such as ideology divergence in online forums of radical groups or for measuring the changes in public sentiment toward commercial brands. Contribution (i) To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to analyze framing strategies on large scale in an unsupervised manner <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . (ii) we combine topic models with regression analy- sis in recovering longitudinal trends. (iii) We fur- ther provide evidence for the dynamics of framing campaigns, commonly known as 'political spin 2 '. Finally, (iv) we show how this framework can shed new light on the broad scholarship on the diver- gence of party discipline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Political Communication Theory</head><p>Some of the theoretical constructs employed by Political Science scholars to describe features of the political communication mechanism include: topic ownership, framing, and agenda setting. Un- derstanding these theoretical concepts is necessary in laying the ground for our computational ap- proach. This subsection provides the key defini- tions and a brief survey of the relevant literature.</p><p>Topic/Issue Ownership We say that a candi- date, a representative or a party owns a topic if this topic, set of ideas or the competence in handling specific issues are strongly associated with her/the party <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Petrocik, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Petrocik, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Damore, 2004</ref>). For example, environmental issues are tra- ditionally associated with specific parties and not others (e.g. in U.S. politics, environmental issues are mostly associated with the Democratic party ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunlap et al., 2001)</ref>).</p><p>Framing Framing is the psychological schema we use in order to organize and process our ex- periences. Politicians can use different contextual frames when referring to a specific topic, giving the public very different views on the topic at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Goffman, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gamson, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Entman, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chong and Druckman, 2007)</ref>. A notable example is the divisive partisan rhetoric used by U.S. politi- cians when referring to the legality of abortion. Democratic and Republican positions, framed as 'pro choice' and 'pro life', respectively, spin the abortion discourse as an issue of values of individ- ual freedom (pro-choice) or validating the sanctity of life (pro-life). Similarly, Republicans refer to the inheritance tax by the overwhelmingly nega- tive coinage 'death tax', while Democrats use 'es- tate tax'.</p><p>Framing strategies, however, go beyond the use of fixed phrases such as 'death tax' and 'pro- choice'. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the debate over raising the minimum wage can be framed as an issue of social justice or in the con- text of the economic burden it incurs on tax payers and by potential job loss.</p><p>Agenda Setting and shifting Agenda setting is achieved by framing and by increased or decreased attention (attention shifts) in order to set or change the political, media or public agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(McCombs and Shaw, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Scheufele and Tewksbury, 2007)</ref>. Some examples of agenda setting campaigns are the repeated comments about the importance of child vaccination, highlighting the need for equal pay in the 2015 State of the Union Presidential Ad- dress, or, more broadly, repeatedly addressing the need for affordable healthcare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Computational Analysis of Political Data</head><p>The availability of archives and streams of polit- ical data is driving a growing number of compu- tational works that address a wide array of Polit- ical Science questions.

Hidden Markov Models are used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sim et al., 2013</ref>) in order to measure ideological proportions in polit- ical speech, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Iyyer et al., 2014</ref>) use recursive neural networks for a similar task.</p><p>Topic models have been used to detect connec- tions between contributions and political agendas as expressed in microblogging platforms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yano et al., 2013</ref>) and for reconstructing voting patterns based on the language in congressional bills <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gerrish and Blei, 2012)</ref>. The flow of policy ideas has been modeled via measuring text reuse in different versions of bill proposals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wilkerson et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nguyen et al. (2013)</ref> use supervised hierarchi- cal topic regression to improve prediction of polit- ical affiliation and sentiment.</p><p>Expressed agendas in press releases issued by U.S. Senators have been modeled by Grimmer us- ing author topic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Grimmer, 2010)</ref>. It is important to point to some key differences be- tween our work and Grimmer's work. While the model used by Grimmer allows attribution of a single topic per document, we are interested in a mixed membership model as we hypothesize pos- sible correspondence between topics and frames. Moreover, while we are interested in partisan dy- namics, Grimmer is interested in the expressed agendas of individuals thus focusing on an au- thorship model. Finally, unlike Grimmer, we also introduce autoregressive distributed-lag models in order to capture temporal dynamics between top- ics and parties as reflected in the data.</p><p>Another line of work can be found in the more traditional Political Science scholarship. The suc- cess of framing strategies is studied by the analysis of real time reactions to political debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boydstun et al., 2014</ref>). Autoregressive models are used for analyzing adjustment of issue positions with respect to news items during the Dutch national election campaign of 2006 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kleinnijenhuis and de Nooy, 2013)</ref>. This approach is based on manual annotation of data.</p><p>Logistic regression on manually coded cam- paign advertisements is used in order to learn the dynamics of issue ownership by individual candi- dates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Damore, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>While some of the works above address related research questions (agenda setting, topic own- ership) or use similar computational approaches (topic models, regression models), our work is the first to offer a complete framework for automatic detection of topic ownership and attention shifting on a large scale. Additionally, our partisan analy- sis provides a model for longitudinal partisan com- munication strategies without the need for encod- ing of external events and specific campaigns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>A brief overview of the U.S. Congress The American political system is a bicameral legisla- ture composed of the Senate (100 senators, two from each state) and the House of Representatives (435 voting members plus 6 non-voting represen- tatives, number depends on the population of each state). Election is held every two years, in which one third of the Senators and all members of the House face reelection. Members are typically af- filiated with either the Democratic Party or the Re- publican Party. Congressional election and Presi- dential election coincide every four years.</p><p>The Corpus We use a corpus of public state- ments released by members of Congress in both the Senate and The House of Representatives, col- lected by Project Vote Smart 3 . An example of a public statement is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>In this work we use all individual statements and press releases in a span of four years <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref>, a total of 134000 statements made by 641 representatives. This time span encompasses two Congressional elections (November 2010 and 2012). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gives the number of Demo- cratic and Republican representatives in the three Congress terms <ref type="bibr">(111)</ref><ref type="bibr">(112)</ref><ref type="bibr">(113)</ref>   It is interesting to note that while the total num- ber of statements per month reflects the change of majority in the November 2010 and 2012 elec- tions <ref type="table">(Table 1 and</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), accounting for the number of seats per party it appears that the av- erage Democrat is consistently more 'productive' with µ = 6.24 , σ 2 = 2.1 (Dem) and µ = 5.5 , σ 2 = 1.5 (Rep) statements per month. We hence report all results after normalization by the num- ber of seats each party posses at each timestamp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Computational Framework</head><p>In order to automatically discover the correlated dynamics of attention shifts, we take a layered ap- proach, consisting of the stages described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Topic Inference</head><p>In the first stage, we use topic models in order to learn topic distribution over words and identify the set of topics addressed in the corpus. Topic Modeling describes a general algorithmic frame- work for unsupervised discovery of a set of top- ics expressed in a collection of documents. The framework is based on the assumption that doc- uments are generated by mixtures of k topics. It is therefore assumed that documents are gener- ated by the following process: for each word in a document, we choose a topic from a given topic distribution, then choose a word from the distri- bution over words that the chosen topic specifies. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the framework employed here, assumes that the distribution over topics has a Dirichlet prior. In practice, we as- sume a Dirichlet prior on topics and use varia- tional Bayes (VB) optimization to infer topic dis- tributions over words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003)</ref>. In order to considerably improve efficiency, we use an on- line variational Bayes inference algorithm, shown to perform similarly to batch LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hoffman et al., 2010)</ref>. It is important to note that our goals and assumptions about the data do not lend them- selvse to the use of dynamic or correlated topic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Blei and Lafferty, 2006a</ref>; Blei and Laf- ferty, 2006b) 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Topic Assignment and Unification</head><p>The distribution of ranked topics over documents presents a "long tailed" distribution in which a few topics achieve a significant coverage of a docu- ment. This is a result of the mixed membership "generative" approach and the bag-of-words as- sumption. In a more realistic setting the number of topics per document is restricted. We wish to re- strict the number of topics per document while still conforming to the mixture model assumption. We therefore reassign topics to each document (state- ment) d in the following manner:</p><p>1. Assign a topic to each word based on distri- bution of topics over words infferred in the previous stage. 2. Find a set T of k topics (k &lt; k) that cover q% of the document in a greedy way. The topic assingment for document d will then be d → T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Data Slicing</head><p>We slice the data according to four parameters: topic (or topical cluster), time, party and document (statement). These slicing parameters allow us the flexibility required to thoroughly analyze the data.</p><p>In the time parameter, we have four settings: no slicing (all data is treated as if it were produced simultaneously), monthly slicing, weekly slicing and daily slicing, each gives different granularity of ownership patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Autoregressive-Distributed-Lag Models</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">A linear function b + w T X = b + j w T j X j is</formula><p>a simple yet robust method for testing dependency between X and Y . Ordinary least square regres- sion finds the coefficients that minimize the mean square error of Y = b + j w T j X j given (X, Y ). In our case (X, Y ) are time series. We argue that a lagged dependency between two time series sug- gests a framing or attention shifting campaign.</p><p>Regression analysis of time series assumes in- dependence between error terms. This key statis- tical property is often violated in real world data as y t often depends on y t−1 thus the time series residuals tend to correlate. The consequences of violating the independence of errors are threefold: i) Statistical tests of significance are uninforma- tive and cannot be used to prove dependency be- tween the model parameters, ii) The coefficients learned lose accuracy, and iii) error terms are cor- related, and hence contain information that is lost in analysis instead of used to leverage the predic- tion power of the model. The importance of con- trolling for autoregressive properties and for sea- sonality effects was recently demonstrated in the error analysis of the Google Flu Trends algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lazer et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>In order to control for error dependency we add the auto regressing component γ T Y n to the ordi- nary regression, as shown in Equation 1: <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Health  30  health care law will obamacare insurance repeal affordable americans costs new re- form people president healthcare act coverage mandate american obama   51  medicare seniors program social medicaid benefits fraud payments security programs  cost services costs billion payment beneficiaries waste year savings</ref>   where, β T X m indicates the distributed-lag terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y t = α + β T X m + γ T Y n + t<label>(1)</label></formula><note type="other">Cluster Topic ID Top Words</note><formula xml:id="formula_2">β T X m = m i=0 β i x t−i<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and γ T Y n indicates the autoregressive component described by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">γ T Y n = n j=1 γ j y t−j<label>(3)</label></formula><p>for some n t (notice that i ranges from 0 while j ranges from 1).</p><p>In order to control for seasonality (such as holi- days and recess') we add a set of categorical vari- ables indicating the weekday and the week-in-year of a statement, so the autoregressive model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y t = α + β T X m + γ T Y n + l W T l I l (t) + t (4)</formula><p>Where l ∈ {day, week} thus I l (t) is the identity matrix with the dimension of the seasonal granu- larity, in our case I day = I 7×7 for each day of the week and I week = I 52×52 for the week of the year. I l i,i = 1 iff t timestamp falls in the i-th day- of-week/week-in-year.</p><p>Finally, in practice it is usually sufficient re- strict the autoregressive term to one parameter with j = 1 (accounting to the y value at the pre- vious time stamp), this is consistent with the 24 hours news cycle reported by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Leskovec et al., 2009</ref>) among others. Since our goal is to find correlated attention shifts we can substitute the summation distributed-lag term by a single lagged term. Thus, we aim to minimize the MSE in the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y t = α + βx t + γy n t−1 + l W T l I l (t) + t (5)</formula><p>Where t = t−i and i ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., 28} indicating no lag, one day lag, 2 days lag, a week's lag, etc.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Inferred Topics</head><p>As an input for the topic modeling module (stage 1 of the system) we use a lexicon of the 10000 most frequent words in the corpus. We use k = 100 as the number of topics. Experiments with k ∈ {30, 50, 500, 1000} produced topics that were ei- ther too general or too incoherent. Once the topic- word distributions were inferred, topics were val- idated by two annotators examining the top 50 words for each topic. Annotators used hierarchi- cal labels -an energy related topic t i could be an- notated energy / clean-tech, while another topic t j could be annotated energy / economy / keystone- xl. Annotations were consolidated to unify the coding <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . After consolidation annotators agreed on all topic annotations. Some examples of topics labels are 'health', 'energy', 'economy', 'boiler- plate', 'political process', 'local' and a few 'ran- dom' topics. After topic assignment as described in Section 4.2 each document is associated with only 2-6 top- ics. In this work we focus on the 14 most salient (concise, general and frequent) topics in the cor- pus. These 14 topics fall under four topical clus- ters -Health, Energy, Army/Security and Econ- omy/Budget. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> contains examples of top words and labels for some of the topics from four topical clusters.     <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">51  151  22  34  1  80  157  27  37  2  38  47  43  2  6  Energy  69  114  56  18  5  71  144  52  43  5  34  141  63  52  9  Security  74  144  46  34  8  89  80  113  10  22  68  32  174  7  127  23  151  49  60  9  Economy  8  205  2  165  0  88  137  68  63  17  52  190  12  123  0   Table 4</ref>: Number of weeks each party "owned" a topic by issuing more statements (DEM, REP) and number of weeks the party owned the topic with statistical significance p &lt; 0.05 (DEM*, REP*).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Partisan Topic Ownership</head><p>counts in the Economy cluster are quite balanced <ref type="bibr">(31604 vs. 31706)</ref>, the counts of the individual topics in the cluster are polarized. Remember that these topical classes were all inferred by the LDA in an unsupervised way. These partisan ownership patterns were also confirmed by domain experts.</p><p>Longevity is a crucial factor in topic ownership. A weekly ownership of a topic is achieved by a party Q if it issued more statements on the topic than party R in that particular week. We compute the significance of the ownership assuming a null hypothesis that statements are issued by the parties by two Bernoulli processes with the same param- eters. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> provides the number of weeks each party owned each topic and the number of weeks it had a significant ownership (p &lt; 0.05) 6 .</p><p>Topic 30 illustrates the different perspectives. The total statement count (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>) reveals a clear ownership by the Republican party, is- suing 73% of the statements. While turning to weekly ownership <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref> we get similar num- ber (Republicans control 77% of the weeks); as- suming only significance ownership, Republicans significantly own the discourse for 79 weeks while Democrats have significant ownership in only 2 weeks which means the Republicans own 97% of the significantly owned weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Topic Cooccurrence</head><p>Topic cooccurrence could approximate the way topics are framed. A heatmap of within state- ment topic cooccurrence based on Pointwise Mu- tual Information (PMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Church and Hanks, 1990</ref>) is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The topical clusters are characterized by blocks along the diagonal. The blocks structure is to be expected due to the inher- ent topical similarity within clusters. It is inter- esting to see the inter-cluster differences in PMI between the two parties. At the cluster level, Re- publicans tend to use the Budget &amp; Economy top- ics with topics in all other topical clusters, evident by the stronger colors in the five bottom (left) rows (columns) in 4b comparing to 4c.</p><p>A notable example is the way Republicans frame the controversial Keystone XL project (En- ergy, topic 38) with the impact on the job market and small businesses <ref type="bibr">(Budget &amp; Economy, topic 88)</ref>, a topic traditionally owned by Democrats (see top topical words in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> and topic ownership at <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Partisan Discipline</head><p>Party discipline is of great interest for political sci- entists <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Crook and Hibbing, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bowler et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Krehbiel, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McCarty, 2001</ref>) . Typically, party discipline is examined by analysis of roll call votes on bills. Discipline, however can be also measured by adherence to party lines in talking points and agenda setting campaigns. Discipline, therefore, can be captured by conformity of lan- guage in public statements. While it is "common knowledge" among political scientists that Repub- licans are more adherent to "talking points" -to the best of our knowledge there are no large scale studies that support (or refute) that.</p><p>In the absence of official lists of "talking points", repeated use of similar phrases (n-grams) can provide an indication for the level of party dis- cipline. In each topic, we looked at all n-grams (n ∈ {2, ..., 14}) that were used by more than five members of the Congress. For example, the tri- gram "the American people" (topic 38) appears in 81 statements made by 54 members of congress, only two of them were Democrats. Similarly, the tri-gram "social security benefits" (topic 51) ap- pears in 123 statements, issued by 89 members, 71 of which were Democrats. Examining "own- ership" of n-grams (per n-gram, per topic) reveals that that Republicans do tend to stick to talking points more than Democrats do. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> provides the average number of n- grams owned by each party over all topics (top), over Republican owned topics (middle) and over Democratic owned topics (bottom). While on av- erage Democrats own more n-grams than Repub- licans ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5, top)</ref>, the difference is marginal and is attributed to the fact that Democrats own more topics than the Republicans (10 vs. 4, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Ta- ble 3</ref>). Comparison between n-gram ownership in Democratic owned topics and Republican owned topics ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, middle and bottom) shows that while each party owns more n-grams in the top- ics it owns, Republicans present stronger owner- ship over the n-grams in their owned topics than Democrats in their respective owned topics. More- over, Republicans present relative discipline even in Democratic owned topics.</p><p>Manually looking at some sampled n-grams it appears that mid-length n-grams are shared "talk- ing points" and longer n-grams are full citations from bill proposals and committee reports. These findings are in line with textual sharing semantics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lin et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Time Series Analysis</head><p>To this end we create two time series for each topic c ∈ T : S C D c -daily normalized counts for Democrats and S C R c -daily normalized counts for Republicans. Normalization of counts is needed in order to account for the bias introduced by the dif- ference in the number of seats each party holds and the changes in that number in the different terms as apparent from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Our data exhibit two strong seasonality effects: a weekly cycle with the lowest point on the week- end and peaking on Thursday <ref type="figure">(Figure 3a)</ref>, and a yearly cycle with low points at the weeks of 4th of July, Thanksgiving, August recess and Christmas <ref type="figure">(Figure 3b</ref>). These seasonality effects are captured by the added terms in Equation 4.</p><p>After time series are constructed we apply first- difference detrending <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Enders, 2008</ref>) in order to transform the time series to stationary series and avoid trend-incurred correlations.</p><p>We fit autoregressive-distributed-lag models for all pairs in {X = S c,l , Y = S c }, where c, c ∈ T (topics), l ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 7, 14, ..., 28}.</p><p>In this setting we fit 5153 pairs of time series of which 718 pairs had a significant coefficient for X (p &lt; 0.05). Artificial significance due to abun- dance of fitted models was accounted to by apply- ing the strict Bonferroni correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dunn, 1961)</ref> on the significance level. The correction resulted in 103 significant correlations, most of them with lag of up to 3 days. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> gives the number of in- tra/inter significant correlation for lags l ∈ 0, 1, 2.</p><p>One example for such correlation is the Repub- licans "responding" to Democratic topic 88 with with topic 8 (intra-cluster) in one and two days lag. We interpret this as a different spin on the budget issue. Another example is the Democratic party corresponds to Republican topic 30 with topic 88 (inter-cluster) on the same day (no lag). We in- terpret this as a way to place the Acordable Care Act in a specific economic frame. We note that while the lagged correlated time series do not im- ply a responsive pattern, a significance of lagged <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Intra-cluster  DEM  28  1  1  REP  26  4  5</ref> Inter-cluster DEM 15 2 0 REP 17 0 0 correlation may suggest such a pattern. We pro- vide some evidence in the qualitative analysis in the next section.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Cluster Dependent Significant Correlations l = 0 l = 1 l = 2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Discussion and Qualitative Analysis</head><p>Inter and intra-cluster correlations can be inter- preted as manifestations of different types of fram- ing strategies and campaigns for attention shifts. A detailed analysis of the interplay between the dif- ferent frames is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for political scientists. The majority of the significant correlations were found with no lag. It is important to note that these correlations are found significant even after ac- counting to autoregressive patterns. Zero-lag cor- relations could be interpreted in a number of ways. Two probable interpretations are (i) daily time se- ries are too crude to model lag patterns, and (ii) the parties respond to some external event at the same time. While we cannot address (i) due to sparseness and noise 7 , we can sample statements and examine them manually. Manual examina- tion reveals a strong responsive pattern in peak- ing trends. One typical example is the Republican spike in topic 30 on March 10. The statement at <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is very illustrative as it explicitly refers to a statement by President Obama. Explicit ref- erences to statements made by the other side are found more frequently in Republican statements and reveal a clear responsive pattern that also sug- gest a strong party discipline, in line with the re- sults in Section 5.2. This small scale qualitative analysis complements the quantitative results re- ported in Section 5.3 and provide evidence for a responsive pattern even in zero lag series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a statistical framework for the anal- ysis of framing strategies and agenda setting cam- paigns in the political sphere. Combining topic models and time series analysis, we modeled topic ownership and party discipline and analyzed re- sponsive patterns in an unsupervised way and with no prior knowledge of the political system. Our work draws from political science theory, validat- ing some theoretical constructs and shedding new light on others. The proposed framework and the results could be further used and interpreted by po- litical scientists and communication scholars.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Examples of a public statement released on March 10, 2010 by Republican minority leader-Congressman John Boehner (now speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives).

			<note place="foot" n="1"> We do use some meta data such as the speaker&apos;s party and its timestamp for the time series analysis. 2 &apos;Political spin&apos; may also refer to fact twisting and factual distractions promoted using various media outlets. We do not refer to these types of spin in this work.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We are interested in the change of the proportions of topics over time and not in the change of the word distribution within topics and we don&apos;t assume inherent correlation of topics.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> For example, if topic ti was labeled energy, cleantech by one annotator and energy, green by the other, the annotators would agree to use either cleantech or green consistently.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="6"> The numbers do not necessarily add up to 208 (the number of weeks in four years) due to weeks with no significant ownership , e.g. the parties issued a similar number of statements (usually zero) on that topic.</note>
