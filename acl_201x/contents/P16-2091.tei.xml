				<p>Most previous work on annotation projection has been limited to a subset of Indo-European languages, using only a single source language, and projecting annotation for one task at a time. In contrast, we present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) algorithm that simultaneously projects annotation for multiple tasks from multiple source languages, relying on parallel corpora available for hundreds of languages. When training POS taggers and dependency parsers on jointly projected POS tags and syntactic dependencies using our algorithm, we obtain better performance than a standard approach on 20/23 languages using one parallel corpus; and 18/27 languages using another.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Cross-language annotation projection for unsuper- vised POS tagging and syntactic parsing was in- troduced fifteen years ago ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yarowsky et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hwa et al., 2005)</ref>, and the best unsupervised de- pendency parsers today rely on annotation projec- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rasooli and Collins, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the maturity of the field, there is an in- herent language bias in previous work on cross- language annotation projection. Cross-language annotation projection experiments require training data in m source languages, a parallel corpus of translations from the m source languages into the target language of interest, as well as evaluation data for the target language. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Since the canonical resource for parallel text is the Europarl Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koehn, 2005)</ref>, which covers languages spoken in the European parliament, annotation projection is typically limited to the subset of Indo-European languages that have treebanks.</p><p>Previous work is also limited in another respect. While treebanks typically contain multiple layers of annotation, previous work has focused on pro- jecting data for a single task.</p><p>We go significantly beyond previous work in two ways: 1) by considering multi-source pro- jection across languages in parallel corpora that are available for hundreds of languages, includ- ing many non-Indo-European languages; and 2) by jointly projecting annotation for two mutually dependent tasks, namely POS tagging and depen- dency parsing. Using multiple source languages makes our projections denser. In single source projection, the source language may not contain all syntactic phenomena of the target language; we combat this by transferring syntactic information from multiple source languages. Our work also differs from previous work on annotation projec- tion in projecting soft rather than hard constraints, i.e., scores rather than labels and edges.</p><p>Contributions We present a novel ILP-based al- gorithm for jointly projecting POS labels and de- pendency annotations across word-aligned parallel corpora. The performance of our algorithm com- pares favorably to that of a state-of-the-art projec- tion algorithm, as well as to multi-source delex- icalized transfer. Our experiments include be- tween 23 and 27 languages using two parallel cor- pora that are available for hundreds of languages, namely a collection of Bibles and Watchtower pe- riodicals. Finally, we make both the parallel cor- pora and the code publicly available. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Projection algorithm</head><p>The projection algorithm is divided into two dis- tinct steps. First, we project potential syntactic edges and POS tags from all source languages into an intermediate target graph, which is left deliber- ately ambiguous. In the second step, we decode the target graph by solving a constrained optimi- sation problem, which simultaneously resolves all ambiguities and produces a single dependency tree with a fixed set of POS tags. Below we describe both steps in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Cross-language sentence</head><p>The input to our projection algorithm is a cross- language sentence, a data structure that ties to- gether a collection of aligned sentences from a par- allel corpus, i.e., sentences in many different lan- guages that are determined to be translation equiv- alents. One sentence of the set is designated as the target while the rest are sources. We project syn- tactic information from the sources to the target.</p><p>All source sentences are automatically parsed with a graph-based dependency parser and labeled with parts of speech. Instead of using the sin- gle best dependency tree output by the parser, we extract its scoring matrix, an ambiguous structure that assigns a numeric score to each potential de- pendency edge. The target sentence is not parsed or POS-tagged. In fact, our approach is explicitly designed to work for target languages where no such resources are available. Only unsupervised word alignments couple the target sentence with each source sentence.</p><p>More formally, a cross-language sentence may be represented as a graph G = (V, E), where each vertex is a POS-tagged token of a sentence in some language. With one target and n source languages, the total set of tagged word vertices V can be written as the union of sentence vertices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = V 0 ∪ . . . ∪ V n . The target sentence is V t = V 0 , while source sentences are V s = V 1 ∪ . . . ∪ V n .</formula><p>Two kinds of weighted edges connect the graph. Edges that go between tagged tokens of a sentence V i represent potential dependency edges. Thus, for the sentence i, the induced subgraph G <ref type="bibr">[V i</ref> ] is the (ambiguous) dependency graph. Edges con- necting a source vertex to target vertex represent word alignments. The set of alignment edges is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A ⊆ V s × V t .</formula><p>To account for POS we introduce a vertex label- ing function l : V → Σ, where Σ is the POS vo- cabulary. The source sentences are automatically tagged, and for any source vertex the label func- tion simply returns this tag. For the target sentence the POS labels are unknown, which is to say that every target token is ambiguous between |Σ| POS tags. We represent this ambiguity in the graph by creating a vertex for each possible combination of target word and POS. Concretely, if a source sen- tence i has n tokens, and the target sentence has m tokens, then |V i | = n, and |V s | = m|Σ|.</p><p>Alignments are constrained such that an align- ment (u, v) ∈ V s × V t only exists if the source and target token were linked by the automatic aligner and l(u) = l(v), i.e., the POS tags match. This fil- ters out potential source relations with dissimilar syntax, a luxury that we are allowed in a multiple source language setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Projecting to ambiguous target graph</head><p>The target graph G[V t ] starts out empty and is pop- ulated with edges in the following way. We go through the source sentences, looking for poten- tial dependency edges where both endpoints are aligned to the target sentence, and transferring the edge whenever we find one. Technically, for every source sentence i and for each edge in the source graph</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(u s , v s ) ∈ G[V i ], we create an edge (u t , v t ) in the target iff both (u s , u t ) and (v s , v t ) ∈ A.</formula><p>The edge weight is the source edge score (as de- termined by an automatic parser) weighted by the joint alignment probability of (u s , u t ) and (v s , v t ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d(u t , v t ) = max us,vs a(u s , v s ) a(u s , u t ) d(v s , v t ).</formula><p>For clarity, d refers to weights of dependency edges, and a to alignment edge weights. Multi- ple source sentences may project the same edge to the target graph. When this happens we update the target edge weight only if the new weight is larger than the existing. The weight then reflects the strongest evidence found for a given syntactic relation across all source languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Decoding the target graph</head><p>We are now ready to decode the target graph. The result of decoding is a dependency tree as well as a labeling of the target sentences with POS tags. Labeling with POS corresponds to selecting a sub- set of the vertices˜Vvertices˜ vertices˜V ⊂ V t , such that exactly one vertex is chosen for each token. Similarly the de- coded dependency tree is a subset of the projected target edges with the constraint that it must form a tree over the vertices of˜Vof˜ of˜V . The joint optimiza- tion objective is to simultaneously select a set of vertices˜Vvertices˜ vertices˜V and edges˜Eedges˜ edges˜E to maximize the score of the decoded tree. We solve this constrained opti- mization problem by casting it as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.</p><p>The full specification of the ILP model is dis- played as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The model is optimized over two types of binary decision variables mapping di- rectly to the target graph representation discussed in the previous section, plus additional flow vari- ables that enforce tree structure. An edge vari- able e i,k,j,l represents a target edge (i, j) where the POS of i is k and the POS of j is l. For in- stance, the variable e 2,V,1,N represents a directed edge from the second token (a verb) to the first (a noun). An active vertex variable v i,k indicates that the POS of token i is chosen as k.</p><p>Following Martins (2012), we constrain the search space to spanning trees by using a single- commodity-flow construction. In the commodity- flow analogy, we imagine the root as a factory that produces n commodities (for an n token sentence) which are distributed along the edges of the tree. Each token is a consumer that must receive and pass on all except one commodity to its depen- dents, i.e., the difference between incoming and outgoing flow should be 1. Since all commodities must be consumed, the outgoing flow for a leaf node will be zero. Together with the requirement that each token must have exactly one head, this ensures all tokens are connected to the root in the tree structure.</p><p>The last two constraint groups enforce edge and POS consistency, and the selection of single POS per token. Both are new to this work.</p></div>

IBM1 has been shown to lead to more robust alignments across typologically dis- tant language pairs ( ¨ Ostling, 2015). We modify the aligner to output alignment probabilities. All the source-side texts are POS-tagged and depen- dency parsed using TnT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brants, 2000</ref>) and Tur- boParser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Martins et al., 2013</ref>). We use our own fork of the arc-factored TurboParser to output the edge weight matrices. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Setup</head><p>In our experiments, as in the preprocessing, we use the TnT tagger and the arc-factored TurboParser, which we train on the EBC and WTC texts with projected and decoded annotations. We randomly sample up to 20k sentences per training file in both tagging and parsing. This 20k sampling limit ap- plies to all systems. We compare two cross-lingual projection-based parsing systems, and one baseline system.</p><p>ILP The ILP-based joint projection algorithm we presented in Section 2.</p><p>DCA Our implementation of the de facto stan- dard annotation projection algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hwa et al. (2005)</ref>, as refined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tiedemann (2014)</ref>. In contrast to our ILP approach, it uses heuristics to ensure dependency tree constraints on a source- target sentence pair basis. We gather all the pair- wise projections into a target sentence graph and then perform maximum spanning tree decoding following <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sagae and Lavie (2006)</ref>.</p><p>DELEX The multi-source direct delexicalized transfer baseline of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McDonald et al. (2011)</ref>. Each source is represented by an approximately equal number of sentences. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides a summary of dependency pars- ing scores. We report UAS scores over predicted and gold POS. The predicted tags come from our cross-lingual taggers. Our ILP approach consis- tently outperforms DCA on both by a large margin of 3-5 points UAS using predicted POS, and 5-10 points on gold POS. Note that DELEX is trained on gold POS and therefore has an advantage in this <ref type="bibr">6</ref> https://github.com/andersjo/ TurboParser <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We do not include DELEX in the comparison for the gold POS scenario only. In this particular scenario, DELEX is also trained on gold POS, and thus biased: the cross-lingual tag- gers do not have gold POS available for training, and the same holds for DELEX and projected POS.  In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we split the scores across the test languages and parallel data sources, and we also report the POS tagging accuracies. Our WTC tag- gers are on average 3.5 points better than EBC tag- gers, yielding the top score for 16/23 languages from the overlap. Notably, on several non-Indo- European languages, we observe significant im- provements. For example, on Indonesian, DCA improves over DELEX by 12 points UAS, while ILP adds 6 more points on top. We observe a sim- ilar pattern for Arabic and Estonian. We note that DELEX tops ILP and DCA on only 1 EBC and 3 WTC languages, and by a narrow margin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>Analysis A projected parse is allowed to be a composite of edges from many source languages. To find out to what degree this actually happens, we analyze all projections into English and Ger- man on the WTC corpus.</p><p>For German the top four source languages are Czech, Norwegian, French, and English, con- tributing between 16% and 7% of all edges. For English the top languages are Norwegian, Ital- ian, Indonesian, and Swedish. Here, the top lan- guage Norwegian is responsible for 42% of the edges, while Swedish accounts for 13%. Only the language projecting the highest scoring edge is counted. On average, a German sentence has edges from 4.1 source languages. The same num- ber for English is slightly higher, at 4.5.</p><p>Manually annotated data We annotate a small number of sentences in English from EBC and  WTC, which gives us a way to directly evaluate the projections without training parsers. On this small test set of 2 × 50 sentences, we obtain UAS scores of 68% (WTC) and 62% (EBC). The POS accuracies are 79% and 80%. All figures are com- parable to the results from the indirect projection evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related work</head><p>In recent years, we note an increased interest for work in cross-lingual processing, and particularly in POS tagging and dependency parsing of low- resource languages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yarowsky et al. (2001)</ref> proposed the idea of in- ducing NLP tools via parallel corpora. Their con- tribution started a line of work in annotation pro- jection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Das and Petrov (2011)</ref> used graph-based label propagation to yield competitive POS tag- gers, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hwa et al. (2005)</ref> introduced the pro- jection of dependency trees. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tiedemann (2014)</ref> further improved this approach to single-source projection in the context of synthesizing depen- dency treebanks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Tiedemann and Agi´cAgi´c, 2016)</ref>. The current state of the art in cross-lingual de- pendency parsing also involves exploiting large parallel corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ma and Xia, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rasooli and Collins, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Transferring models by training parsers with- out lexical features was first introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zeman and Resnik (2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McDonald et al.

(2015) exposed a bias towards closely related Indo-European lan- guages shared by most previous work on anno- tation projection, while introducing a bias-free projection algorithm for learning 100 POS tag- gers from multiple sources. Their line of work is non-trivially extended to multilingual dependency parsing by Agi´c .</p><p>The work in annotation projection for cross- lingual NLP invariably treats mutually dependent layers of annotation separately. Our contribution is distinct from these works by implementing the first approach to joint projection of POS and de- pendencies, while maintaining the outlook on pro- cessing truly low-resource languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In our contribution, we addressed tagging and parsing for low-resource languages through joint cross-lingual projection of POS tags and syntac- tic dependencies from multiple source languages. Our novel approach to transferring the annotations via word alignments is based on integer linear programming, more specifically on a commodity- flow formalization for spanning trees.</p><p>In our experiments with 27 treebanks from the Universal Dependencies (UD) project, our ap- proach compared very favorably to two competi- tive cross-lingual systems: we provided the best cross-lingual taggers and parsers for 18/27 and 20/23 languages, depending on the parallel cor- pora used. We made no unrealistic assumptions as to the availability of parallel texts and prepro- cessing tools for the target languages. Our code and data is freely available. 9</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Approach</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
