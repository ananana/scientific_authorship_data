<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the computational task of providing natural language descriptions of domain entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Levelt, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dale and Reiter, 1995)</ref>, as in 'the second street on the left', 'the money that I found in the kitchen' etc. In this paper we will focus on the issue of content selection of relational descriptions, that is, those in which the intended target is described via an- other object, hereby called a landmark. Consider the example of context in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Let us consider the goal of uniquely identify- ing the target obj1 in the context in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref>. Since the target shares most atomic properties (e.g., type, colour and size) with other distractor objects in the context (and particularly so with respect to obj4), using a relational property (near-obj2) may help prevent ambiguity. The following (a)-(c) are ex- amples of descriptions of this kind produced from the above context. As in example (a), existing REG algorithms will usually pay regard to the Gricean maxim of quan- tity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grice, 1975)</ref>, and avoid the inclusion of prop- erties that are not strictly required for disambigua- tion. In the case of relational reference, this means that both target and landmark portions of the de- scription may be left underspecified, and unique- ness will follow from the fact that they mutually disambiguate each other ( <ref type="bibr">Teixeira et al., 2014</ref>). In other words, example (a) may be considered felic- itous even though both 'cone' and 'box' are am- biguous if interpreted independently.</p><p>Minimally distinguishing descriptions as in (a) are the standard output of many REG algorithms that handle relational descriptions as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dale and Haddock, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Krahmer and Theune, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Krahmer et al., 2003)</ref>. Human speakers, on the other hand, are largely redundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Engelhardt et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arts et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Koolen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Engelhardt et al., 2011</ref>), and will often produce so- called overspecified descriptions as in (b-c) above.</p><p>In this paper we will focus on the issue of gener- ating overspecified relational descriptions as in ex- amples (b-c), discussing which properties should be selected by a REG algorithm assuming that the decision to overspecify has already been made. More specifically, we will discuss whether the al- gorithm should include colour as in (b), size as in (c), or other alternatives, and we will assess the impact of a referential overspecification strategy that favours highly discriminatory properties over preferences that are well-established in the liter- ature. Although this may in principle seem as a narrow research topic, the generation of relational descriptions is still subject of considerable debate in the field (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Viethen and Dale, 2011</ref>) and the issue of landmark under/full-specification has a number of known consequences for referential identification (e.g., <ref type="bibr">(Paraboni and van Deemter, 2014)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work 2.1 Relational REG</head><p>One of the first REG algorithms to take relations into account is the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dale and Haddock, 1991)</ref>, which generates descriptions that may in- clude relational properties only as a last resort, that is, only when it is not possible to obtain a uniquely identifying descriptions by making use of a set of atomic properties. The algorithm prevents circu- larity (e.g., 'the cup on the table that supports a cup that...') and avoids the inclusion of redundant properties with the aid of consistency networks. As a result, the algorithm favours the generation of minimally distinguishing relational descriptions as example (a) in the previous section.</p><p>In the Graph algorithm described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Krahmer et al., 2003)</ref>, the referential context is modelled as a labelled directed graph with vertices representing domain entities and edges representing properties that can be either relational (when connecting two entities) or atomic (when forming self-loops). The task of obtaining a uniquely identifying descrip- tion is implemented as a subgraph construction problem driven by domain-dependent cost func- tions associated with the decisions made by the al- gorithm. The work in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Krahmer et al., 2003</ref>) does not make specific assumptions about the actual at- tribute selection policy, and by varying the cost functions it is possible to implement a wide range of referential strategies. The use of the algorithm for the generation of relational descriptions is dis- cussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Viethen et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>The work in ( <ref type="bibr">Paraboni et al., 2006</ref>) discusses the issue of ease of search by focussing on the particu- lar case of relational description in hierarchically- ordered domains (e.g., books divided into sections and subsections etc.) Descriptions that may ar- guably make search difficult, as in 'the section that contains a picture' are prevented by produc- ing fully-specified descriptions of each individual object (i.e., picture, section etc.). As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dale and Haddock, 1991)</ref>, atomic properties are always at- tempted first, and each target (e.g., a subsection) holds only one relation (e.g., to its parent section). Descriptions of this kind are similar to the exam- ples (b-c) in the previous section. However, hier- archical structures are highly specialised domains, and it is less clear to which extent these findings are applicable to more general situations of ref- erence as in, e.g., spatial domains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Byron et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">dos Santos Silva and Paraboni, 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Referential overspecification</head><p>Assuming that we would like to add a redun- dant property to overspecify a certain description, which property should be selected? Research on REG, cognitive sciences and related fields has in- vestigated a number of factors that may play a role in referential overspecification. First of all, it has been widely observed that some properties are simply preferred to others. This seems to be the case, for instance, of the colour attribute. Colour is ubiquitously found in both redundant and non-redundant use <ref type="bibr">(Pechmann, 1989)</ref>, and empirical evidence suggests that colour is over- specified more frequently than size <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Belke and Meyer, 2002</ref>).</p><p>The inherent preference for colour has how- ever been recently challenged. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(van Gompel et al., 2014</ref>), for instance, points out that when perceptual salience is manipulated so that a high contrast between target and distractors is observed, the size attribute may be preferred to colour. In other words, a highly preferred prop- erty may not necessarily match the choices made by human speakers when producing overspecified descriptions. Results along these lines are also re- ported in <ref type="bibr">(Tarenskeen et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Redundant and non-redundant uses of colour (and possibly other preferred properties) may also be influenced by the difficulty in encoding visual properties. In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Viethen et al., 2012)</ref>, for instance, it is argued that the colour property is more likely to be selected when it is maximally different from the other colours in the context. For instance, a red object is more likely to be described as 'red' when none of the distractors is red, and less so when a modifier (e.g., 'light red') would be required for disambiguation.</p><p>Closer to our present discussion, we notice that the issue of discrimination as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Olson, 1970)</ref> has been considered by most REG algo- rithms to date (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dale and Reiter, 1995;</ref>), and it has even motivated a number of greedy or minimally dis- tinguishing REG strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gardent, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dale, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Areces et al., 2011</ref>). Interestingly, the work in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gatt et al., 2013)</ref> has suggested that small dif- ferences in discriminatory power do not seem to influence content selection, but large differences do, a notion that has been applied to the design of REG algorithms on at least two occasions: in (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lucena et al., 2010)</ref> properties are selected in order of preference regardless of their discrimina- tory power and, if necessary, an additional, highly discriminatory property is included; in (van <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gompel et al., 2012</ref>), a fully distinguishing property is attempted first and, if necessary for disambigua- tion, further properties are considered based on both preference and discrimination.</p><p>Discrimination clearly plays a major role in the disambiguation task, but it less clear whether it is still relevant when disambiguation is not an issue, that is, in the case of referential overspecification. The present work is an attempt to shed light on this particular issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Current work</head><p>Following ( <ref type="bibr">Pechmann, 1989</ref>) and others, we may assume that colour should be generally (or perhaps always) preferred to size. Moreover, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006</ref>), we may follow the prin- ciple of minimal effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986)</ref> and assume that atomic properties such as colour or size should be preferred to relations that lead to more complex descriptions. In our current work, however, we will argue that neither needs to be the case: under the right circumstances, a wide range of properties -colour, size and even spatial relations -may be overspecified depend- ing on their discriminatory power alone. Thus, it may be the case that size is preferred to colour (un- like, e.g., <ref type="bibr">(Pechmann, 1989)</ref>), and that longer, re- lational descriptions are preferred to shorter ones (unlike, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006)</ref>).</p><p>The possible preference for highly discrimina- tory properties in referential overspecification is easily illustrated by the examples in the introduc- tion section. Following <ref type="bibr">(Pechmann, 1989)</ref>, one might assume that, if a speaker decides to over- specify the landmark portion of description (a), she may add the colour attribute, as in (b). This strategy, however, turns out to be far less common in language use if a more discriminatory property is available, as in the example. More specifically, the availability of a highly discriminatory land- mark property (size-small) makes (c) much more likely than (b). This observation gives rise to the following research hypothesis:</p><p>h1: Given the goal of overspecifying a relational description by using an ad- ditional landmark property p, p should correspond to the most discriminatory property available in the context.</p><p>The idea that speakers may take discriminatory power into account when referring is of course not novel. What is less obvious, however, is that dis- crimination may also play a significant role in sit- uations that do not involve ambiguity, as in the above examples. To illustrate this, let us consider a basic REG algorithm -hereby called Baseline -consisting of a relational implementation of an Incremental-like algorithm as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dale and Reiter, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Given the goal of producing a uniquely identify- ing description L of a target object r, the Baseline algorithm works as follows: first, an atomic de- scription is attempted by examining a list of pre- ferred attributes P and by selecting those that help disambiguate the reference, as in the standard In- cremental approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dale and Reiter, 1995)</ref>. If the description is uniquely identifying, the algorithm terminates. If not, a relational property relating r to a landmark object o is included in L, and the algorithm is called recursively to describe o using an atomic description if possible.</p><p>Since Baseline terminates as soon as a uniquely identifying description is obtained, the landmark description will be usually left underspecified as in example (a) in Section 1. This behaviour is consis- tent with existing relational REG algorithms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dale and Haddock, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Krahmer et al., 2003)</ref>).</p><p>Using the Baseline descriptions as a starting point, however, we may decide to fully-specify the landmark description (e.g., in order to facilitate search, as in ( <ref type="bibr">Paraboni and van Deemter, 2014)</ref>) by selecting an additional property p from the re- mainder P list, hereby called P 0 .</p><p>There are of course many ways of defining p. In corpus-based REG, for instance, a plausible strat- egy would be to assume that the definition of p is domain-dependent, and simply select the most frequent (but still discriminatory) property in P 0 as seen in training data. We will call this variation the Most Frequent overspecification strategy.</p><p>Choosing the most frequent property p may lead to descriptions that closely resemble those observed in the data. However, we predict that the availability of a highly discriminatory prop- erty may change this preference. To illustrate this, we will also consider a Proposal strategy in which p is taken to be the most discriminatory property available in P 0 . In case of a tie, the most fre- quent property that appears in P 0 is selected. If P 0 does not contain any discriminatory properties, none will be selected and the landmark descrip- tion will remain underspecified as in the standard Baseline approach.</p><p>The context in the previous <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref> and the ac- companying examples (a-c) in Section 1 illustrate the expected output of each of the three algorithms under consideration. As in previous work on re- lational REG, the Baseline approach would pro- duce the minimally distinguishing description (a); the Most Frequent strategy would overspecify the landmark portion of the description by adding the preferred property in the relevant domain (e.g., colour) as in (b); and the Proposal strategy would overspecify by adding the highly discriminatory property (in this particular example, size) as in (c).</p><p>The relation between the three algorithms and our research hypothesis h1 is straightforward. We would like to show that the predictions made by Proposal are more accurate than those made by Baseline and Most Frequent. An experiment to verify this claim is described in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiment</head><p>For evaluation purposes we will make use the Stars2 corpus of referring expressions 1 . Stars2 is an obvious choice for our experiment since these data convey visual scenes in which objects will usually have one highly discriminatory property available for reference. Moreover, descriptions in this domain may convey up to two relations (e.g., 'the cone next to the ball, near the cone'), which gives rise to multiple opportunities for referential overspecification.</p><p>In addition to this, we will also make use of the subset of relational descriptions available from the GRE3D3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dale and Viethen, 2009</ref>) and GRE3D7 (Viethen and Dale, 2011) corpora. Situations of reference in the GRE3D3/7 domain are in many ways simpler than those in Stars2 (i.e., by con- taining at most one possible relation in each scene, by not presenting any property whose discrimina- tory power is substantially higher than others etc.), <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Some of the corpus features are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014)</ref> but the comparison is still useful since GRE3D3/7 are among the very few annotated relational REG corpora made publicly available for research pur- poses, and which have been extensively used in previous work.</p><p>From the three domains -Stars2, GRE3D3 and GRE3D7 -we selected all instances of relational descriptions in which the landmark object was de- scribed by making use of the type attribute and ex- actly one additional property p. This amounts to three Reference sets containing 725 descriptions in total: 367 descriptions from Stars2, 114 from GRE3D3 and 244 from GRE3D7.</p><p>In the situations of reference available from these domains, the use of p is never necessary for disambiguation, and p will never be selected by a standard REG algorithm as the Baseline strategy described in the previous section. Thus, our goal is to investigate which overspecification strategy - Proposal or Most Frequent, cf. previous section - will select the correct p, and the corresponding im- pact of this decision on the overall results of each algorithm.</p><p>From the unused portion of each corpus, we es- timate attribute frequencies to create the prefer- ence list P required by the algorithms. The fol- lowing preference orders were obtained: P (Stars2) ={type, colour, size, near, in-front-of, right, left, below, above, behind} P (GRE3D) ={type, colour, size, above, in-front-of, hpos, vpos, near, right, left}</p><p>In the case of the GRE3D3/7 corpora, we no- tice that not all attributes appear in both data sets. Moreover, the attributes hpos and vpos were com- puted from the existing pos attribute, which was originally intended to model both horizontal and vertical screen coordinates as a single property in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dale and Viethen, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Each of the three REG strategies -Baseline, Proposal and Most Frequent -received as an in- put the 725 situations of reference represented in the Reference data and the corresponding P list for each domain. As a result, three sets of output descriptions were obtained, hereby called System sets.</p><p>Evaluation was carried out by comparing each System set to the corresponding Reference cor- pus descriptions and measuring Dice scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dice, 1945)</ref> and overall accuracy (that is, the number of exact matches between each System-Reference de- scription pair).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows descriptive statistics for the eval- uation of our three algorithms -Baseline, Pro- posal and Most Frequent -applied to each corpus -Stars2, GRE3D3 and GRE3D7. Best results are highlighted in boldface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gatt and Belz, 2007</ref>) and many others, we compare Dice scores obtained by the three algorithms applied to the generation of the selected descriptions of each domain using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. In the Overall evalua- tion, Proposal outperforms both alternatives. The difference is significant (W (338)=-34327, Z=- 9.55, p &lt; 0.0001). Highly discriminatory proper- ties are indeed those that are normally selected by human speakers when they decide to overspecify a landmark description. This supports our research hypothesis h1.</p><p>Individual results are as follows.</p><p>In the case of the Stars2 domain, Proposal outperforms both alternatives. The difference is significant (W (241)=-26639, Z=-12.29, p &lt; 0.0001). In the case of GRE3D3, once again Proposal out- performs the alternatives. The difference is also significant (W (27)=-248, Z=-2.97, p &lt; 0.03). Fi- nally, in the case of GRE3D7, an effect in the op- position direction was observed, i.e., the Most Fre- quent algorithm outperforms the alternatives. The difference is significant (W (70)=1477, Z=4.32, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>The differences across domains are explained by the proportion of highly discriminatory land- mark properties in each corpus. In Stars2, the nearest landmark has at least one highly discrim- inatory property in all scenes involving relational reference. In GRE3D3, the nearest landmark has a highly discriminatory property in 80% of the scenes, and in GRE3D7 this is the case in only 50% of the scenes. Thus, given the opportu- nity, the use of a highly discriminatory property seems to be preferred. The absence of a prop- erty that 'stands out', by contrast, appears to make the choice among them a matter of preference, an observation that is consistent with the findings in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gatt et al., 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Final remarks</head><p>This paper has presented a practical REG experi- ment to illustrate the impact of discrimination on the generation of overspecified relational descrip- tions. The experiment shows that discrimination - which normally plays a major role in the disam- biguation task -is also a considerable influence in referential overspecification, that is, even when discrimination is in principle not an issue. Our findings correlate with previous empirical work in the field, and show that discrimination may effec- tively trump the inherent preference for absolute properties and for those that are easier to realise in surface form. For instance, contrary to <ref type="bibr">(Pechmann, 1989</ref>) and many others, speakers would generally prefer referring to size as in (b), despite evidence suggesting that colour is overspecified more frequently than size. Moreover, contrary to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006</ref>), speakers would also prefer referring to a spatial relation as in (c) even though the resulting descriptions turns out to be more complex.</p><p>We are aware that the present work has focussed on extreme situations in which a highly discrimi- natory property is available for overspecification. As future work, it is necessary to further this inves- tigation by taking into account various degrees of discrimination. As suggested in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gatt et al., 2013)</ref>, the effect of discrimination may be perceived as a continuum, and in that case a practical REG algo- rithm should be able to make more complex deci- sions that those presently implemented. <ref type="bibr">Ivandré Paraboni and Kees van Deemter. 2014</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A simple visual context.
