				<p>We present ongoing doctoral work on automatically understanding the positions of politicians with respect to those of the party they belong to. To this end, we use textual data, namely transcriptions of political speeches from meetings of the Ger-man Bundestag, and party manifestos, in order to automatically acquire the positions of political actors and parties, respectively. We discuss a variety of possible supervised and unsupervised approaches to determine the topics of interest and compare positions, and propose to explore an approach based on topic modeling techniques for these tasks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Bundestag is the legislative institution of Ger- many. In its plenary sessions, the members discuss the introduction and formulation of bills. Sub- jects under discussion include a wide spectrum of issues, ranging from funding of public transport through fighting right-wing extremism, or the de- ployment of German troops in Afghanistan. For each issue, a few selected members give a speech stating their opinion towards the topic, while the audience is allowed to interact: by questions, heckles, applause or even laughter. Transcrip- tions of the Bundestag's sessions provide us with a gold-mine of political speech data, encoding het- erogeneous political phenomena such as, for in- stance, the prominence or engagement of the dif- ferent politicians with respect to the current polit- ical situation, or their interest for specific topics.</p><p>In our work, we propose to leverage these data to enable the analysis of the speakers' positions with respect to the party they belong to, on the ba- sis of the content of their speech. Questions we in- vestigate include: which party's views do different politicians support? How much are their political views aligned with those of their party? Although we know a-priori which party a speaker belongs to, we view their positions on different topics with respect to their party's official lines as degrees of alignment, and measure them based on the con- tent of their speeches. There are several circum- stances under which a speaker might deviate from his or her party's opinion. For instance, he might stem from an election district where membership of a particular party increases his chances of be- ing elected. Moreover, it might just happen that a politician who generally supports his party's lines personally has a different view on one particular topic. If we are able to measure positions from text, we allow for methods of analyzing adherence to party lines, which is an important issue in po- litical science (cf. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Clinton et al., 2004</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ceron, 2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ansolabehere et al., 2001)</ref>).</p><p>At its heart, our work aims at modeling politi- cians' positions towards a specific topic, as in- ferred from their speech. To estimate a position, in turn, we need a statement of the party's opinion towards the topic of interest, which can be then used for comparison against the speech. Various work in political science suggests to take this from party manifestos like <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Keman, 2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Slapin and Proksch, 2008)</ref>. Research in political sci- ence has previously focused on analyzing politi- cal positions within text, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Laver and Garry, 2000</ref>), ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Laver et al., 2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Keman, 2007)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sim et al., 2013)</ref>. However, most of previous work focused on the general position of a party or a person, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Slapin and Proksch, 2008)</ref>, as opposed to fine-grained positions towards specific topics. In our research, we address the two follow- ing tasks:</p><p>1. Determine the speeches' topics -namely de- velop methods to determine the topic(s) covered by a political speech, such as those given in the Bundestag.</p><p>2. Quantify adherence to party lines -namely es- timate the speaker's position relatively to his party's opinion towards the respective topic(s).</p><p>In the following thesis proposal we present a variety of approaches that we plan to investigate in order to address these tasks, as well as discuss their limitations and challenges.</p><p>The first task, determining the topics, could be in principle addressed using well-studied su- pervised approaches like state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. However, we cannot rely on the fact that all topics are covered in the train- ing data. Consequently, we propose to explore an unsupervised approach that integrates information from an external resource. We suggest to use a variant of topic models which allows us to influ- ence the creation of the topics.</p><p>The second task, determining the positions, is a bigger challenge, given the current state of the art. Some previous research looked at the related field of opinion mining, also on political discus- sion, as in (Abu-Jbara et al., 2012), <ref type="bibr">(Anand et al., 2011) or (Somasundaran and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wiebe, 2009)</ref>. These methods, however, are hardly applicable to the complex data of plenary meetings. In our sce- nario, we have to deal with a very specific kind of text, since the discussions do not consist of spon- taneous dialogues, but rather formal statements. Consequently, we are forced to deal with a type of language which lies in-between dialogue and text. More concretely, within these speeches speakers roughly assume what positions the parties have and also have expectations about their opponents' opinions. Besides, as opposed to full-fledged di- alogues, our data shows a very limited amount of interaction between the speaker and the audi- ence, solely consisting of a few questions, heck- les, laughter or applause. Further, as it is the goal of the discussions to constructively develop laws and agree on formulations, the speakers do not just state reasons pro or contra some issue. They rather illustrate different aspects of the discussed items. Furthermore, they try to convince others by emphasizing what their party has achieved in the past or criticize decisions taken in the past. To ad- dress these complex problems, we propose to start by using manually annotated party manifestos in order to provide us with an upper bound. Next, we propose to investigate the applicability of topic models to provide us, again, with a flexible unsu- pervised approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>The German Bundestag meets about 60 times a year, and discusses various items in each plenary session. There are various types of items on the agenda: they can be discussions about bills, but also question times or government's statements. We are interested in the first type only. Each bill has a unique identifier which is also mentioned by the session chair. By looking it up in a database provided by the Bundestag, it is possible to filter the bill discussions from other forms of items.</p><p>For each discussed item, a few selected mem- bers are permitted to give a speech. Most of the members belong to a party and their affiliation is publicly known.</p><p>The Bundestag releases the transcripts of its sessions as plain text documents. OffenesParla- ment 1 is a project run by volunteers that processes these documents and publishes them in a struc- tured form on the web as HTML documents. The data distinguishes between parts of a given speech, utterances by the chairman and heckles, each an- notated with its speaker. OffenesParlament makes the attempt to divide each session's transcript into parts containing a single item of the agenda only. This is not trivial, as it is the chairman who leads over using a non-standardized formulations, and thus contains many mistakes.</p><p>We collected a number of regular expressions and hope to improve the segmentation of the items. We will evaluate the performance of this heuristic by checking a sample with human judges.</p><p>Our extracted dataset covers the time period be- tween March 2010 and December 2012 and con- sists of 182 meetings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Determining topics in speeches</head><p>We aim at comparing the positions stated within the speeches to the general positions of the par- ties represented in the Bundestag. The parties' po- sitions can be found in their manifestos, and are commonly used as a source by scholars, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Keman, 2007)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Slapin and Proksch, 2008)</ref>. In or- der to being able to compare speakers' and parties positions, we need to address two different tasks, namely: i) identifying the topic of a speech, and ii) locating that very same topic within the party manifesto or some further resource. The latter task depends on how the comparison is done. In this section, we will focus on the first task: determin- ing the topic of the speech.</p><p>There are two general approaches to classify the topics of text: either the topics are known in advance and constitute a static set of categories, for example ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hillard et al., 2008</ref>), or they are un- known in advance and dynamically created de- pending on the data, as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Quinn et al., 2010</ref>) (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Grimmer and Stewart, 2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sebastiani, 2002</ref>) for an overview). In our scenario, we as- sume a common set of topics over several data sources, namely the party manifestos and tran- scripts of speeches in our case. Therefore, we opt for a fixed set of topic categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Definition of topical categories</head><p>In political science, there are various schemes to categorize political topics. A well-known and important project is the Comparative Manifesto Project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Budge et al., 2001</ref>), in which party man- ifestos are hand-coded on sentence level with a scheme of 560 categories. A similar project is the Comparative Agendas Project 2 , which uses 21 top level categories further divided into fine-grained subcategories.</p><p>An alternative approach is to use the ministries as definition of the available categories, which in- spired the category scheme used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Seher and Pappi, 2011</ref>). In our work, we develop a category scheme for our particular task on the basis of the responsibilities of committees of the Bundestag, as suggested by internal discussions with scholars of political science. Similar to the ministries in government, the responsibilities for political areas are divided among various committees (see <ref type="table">Table  1</ref> for a list of committees). Each item discussed in the Bundestag is assigned to all committees who investigate the issues in more detail. For instance, in our data we find that a discussion about contin- uing the German participation in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan has been assigned to the following committees: Foreign Af- fairs, Internal Affairs, Legal Affairs, Defense, Hu- man Rights and Humanitarian Aid, Economic Co- operation and Development. For each issue, one of the committees is appointed as the leading one (German: federfÃ¼hrende Ausschuss), the Commit- tee of Foreign Affairs in this case.</p><p>Note that, crucially for our work, this assign- ment process provides us with human-annotated 2 http://www.comparativeagendas.info <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Committees of the 17th German Bun- destag.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affairs of the European Union Labour and social Affairs Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth Health Cultural and Media Affairs Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid</head><note type="other">Tourism Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Transport, Building and Urban Development Scrutiny of Elections, Immunity and the Rules of Procedure Economics and Technology Economic Cooperation and Development Foreign Affairs Finance Budget Internal Affairs Petitions Legal Affairs Sports Defense Education, Research and Technology Assessment</note><p>topic labels: in fact, not only can we use the com- mittees as category definitions, but we can also use these very same assignments as a gold standard. Consequently, we use the definitions describing the responsibilities of the committees as our cat- egory scheme for political topics. We exclude three committees from the experiments namely: a) the Committee on Scrutiny of Elections, Immunity and the Rules of Procedure, b) the Committee on Petitions, and c) the Committee of Legal Affairs. This is because these committees are not directly responsible for a particular political domain, but perform meta functions.</p><p>Descriptions of the particular committees in- cluding their responsibilities and tasks as well as concrete examples of their work, accomplished by lists of current members, can be found in flyers re- leased by the Bundestag <ref type="bibr">3</ref> .</p><p>Given this definition of political categories on the basis of the committees, we can create a gold standard for our topic classification scenario: to label a speech, we take the item it is given about, and use the committees the item has been assigned to as labels. The committee responsible, in turn, can be seen as the most important (i.e., primary) topic label <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Topic assignments are automatically harvested from a freely available source of infor-mation, namely a public database offered by the German Bundestag <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . Each item discussed in the Bundestag is associated with a printed document (Drucksache) tagged with a unique identifier, by which it can be tracked in the database and where the list of assigned committees can be queried.</p><p>Given these topic assignments, we aim at ac- quiring a model to classify the speeches with their assigned categories. To this end, we could focus on predicting the main label only (i.e. the commit- tee responsible), or rather perform a multi-class la- beling task predicting all labels (all committees the item is assigned to). We now overview a super- vised and unsupervised approach to address these classification problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Supervised approach</head><p>Given that we have labeled data, a first solution is to opt for a supervised approach to text clas- sification, which has been successfully used for many tasks like topic detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">((Diermeier et al., 2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Husby and Barbosa, 2012)</ref>, or sentiment analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakliwal et al., 2013)</ref>, to name a few. Consequently, in our case we could represent the speeches as a word vector and train state-of-the- art machine learning algorithms like Support Vec- tor Machines, using the assigned committees as la- bels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Unsupervised approach</head><p>In order to develop a generally applicable ap- proach that can easily be applied to other resources such as speeches given in a context different from that of the Bundestag, we are interested to explore an unsupervised approach and compare it to the supervised one.</p><p>External definition of categories. The particu- lar issues that fall into the responsibility of a com- mittee are broad and might not be completely cov- ered when using the speeches themselves as train- ing data. As mentioned in Section 3.1, we have a clear definition of the tasks of each committee provided within the flyers. We will use them as a basis for the category definitions, and extend them with political issues discussed in party manifestos. We will explain this further in Section 3.3.</p><p>Known set of categories. Techniques such as LDA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blei et al., 2003</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">and Blei, 2011</ref>). As discussed in Section 3, we prefer to have a fixed set of categories. This allows for comparison between applications of the clas- sification on different sources and domains sep- arately. But while topic models do not fit this requirement, they have one property that corre- sponds quite well to our task: rather than assign- ing the text one single label, they return a dis- tribution over topics contained by it. The items discussed in the speeches touch a range of polit- ical topics, and are assigned to various commit- tees. There are variations of topic models that al- low for influencing the creation of the topics, such as the systems of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ramage et al., 2009</ref>) (Labeled LDA), <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andrzejewski and Zhu, 2009)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jagarlamudi et al., 2012)</ref>. Labeled LDA is trained on a corpus of documents. In contrast to standard topic model approaches, it needs as input the in- formation which labels (topics) are contained by the document, though not their proportions, thus uses a fixed set of categories.</p><p>We illustrate our methodology in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Our proposed approach starts by extracting seed words for the categories from the flyers about the com- mittees. These seed words are then used to label training data for labeled LDA. As training data, we take an external resource: the manifestos 6 of all parties. Finally, we apply the trained model to the speeches to infer the labels. The output can be evaluated by comparing the predicted categories to the committees the issue is actually assigned to. In the following, we will explain each step in more detail.</p><p>1) Extraction of seed words. We first download the flyers provided by the Bundestag. Then, we filter for nouns and calculate their TF-IDF val- ues for the committee, by which we rank them. In a final step, we ask a scholar of political sci- ence to clean them, i.e. to delete nouns that are not necessarily important for the particular com- mittee or are too ambiguous, and to cut the tail of low-ranked nouns. To give an example, we finally receive the following keywords for the committee of Labour and Social Affairs: age-related poverty, labour-market policy, employee, social affairs, so- cial security, labour, work, pension, basic social security, regulated rates, partial retirement, social standard, subcontracted labour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Automatically generating training data.</head><p>We take the manifestos of all parties in the Bun- destag to train our labeled LDA model. While topic models expect a whole collection of docu- ments as input, we only provide a handful of them: accordingly, we generate a pseudo document col- lection by cutting the documents into snippets, fol- lowing our previous work in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zirn and Stuckenschmidt, 2013)</ref>, and treating each of them as sin- gle documents. If a keyword for a committee is found within a snippet, we add the corresponding category to the documents labels. We finally run labeled LDA using standard configurations on the so labeled data.</p><p>3) Applying labeled LDA. Finally, we can ap- ply the trained model on our transcribed speech data: we do this by inferring, for each speech, the distribution of topics, i.e. of categories. To evaluate the model, we check that the committee responsible corresponds to the highest probable topic inferred for the speech, and the other n as- signed committees to the n most probable topics.</p><p>Currently, in our work, we are in the final stages of creating the gold standard, and evaluating our method. However, we have already implemented the proposed system as prototype, and accordingly show a part of the created topic model in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> to give the reader an impression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Detecting positions</head><p>The overall goal of our work is to analyze the positions expressed by the speakers towards the debated item. As we aim at performing a fine- grained analysis, approaches merely classifying</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ENCNS LSA TBUD consumer (male)</formula><p>labour mobility consumer <ref type="table">(female)  employee male  research  environment  employees female infrastructure  protection  salary  railway  products  pension  traffic  farming  labour market  investments  nature  old-age provision  development  variety  unemployment  future  raw materials  employment  rails  transparency  percentage  streets   Table 2</ref> In order to produce a finer-grained model of po- sitions, we want to develop a model that places positions stated in text along a one-dimensional scale, as done by (Slapin and Proksch, 2008) with their system called Wordfish, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gabel and Huber, 2000</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Laver and Garry, 2000</ref>), ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Laver et al., 2003)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sim et al., 2013)</ref>. Wordfish places party manifestos on a left-right-scale, what visualizes very well which parties are close to each other and which ones are distant. This is similar in spirit to the purpose of our work, since we are inter- ested primarily in estimating closeness and dis- tances between the speakers' and the parties' po- sitions. However, in contrast to their work, we are interested in positions towards specific topics, as opposed to general parties' positions.</p><p>We define our task as follows: we want to an- alyze the distance between the position towards a topic expressed in a speech and the position to- wards the same topic stated in a party manifesto. In the previous section, we described an approach to determine the topic of the speech. We now move on and present how we can retrieve the seg- ments of the manifestos that correspond to the topic(s) addressed within the speeches, as well as how to compare these positions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Approach A: Hand-coding of manifestos</head><p>Extract positions As part of a larger collabora- tion project with scholars of political science we decided to start with hand-coding a set of man- ifestos on sentence-level in order to have a gold standard for further work. To facilitate the manual work, we use a computer-assisted method based using the seed words created in Section 3.3. In more detail, we first use occurrences of the seed words to assign them the corresponding category label. Then, a human annotator validates these as- signments, optionally adding missing labels.</p><p>If the sentence-wise labeled data proofs suc- cessful and necessary for the further analysis of political positions, we will investigate approaches to automate this process, for example with super- vised learning or bootstrapping techniques starting with our seed words. For each topic, we can then accumulate the sentences assigned to its corre- sponding category and use this data as the party's opinion towards this topic.</p><p>Compare positions The comparison between the speech and the parties' opinions can then be performed as follows: for each party, we extract the sentences from the manifesto that are tagged with the topic covered in the speech. We then rep- resent the extracted sentences and the speeches as word vectors, and compare them with a distance metric, e.g., a standard measure like cosine simi- larity, which gives us the closeness of the speech to each party's position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Approach B: Topic Models</head><p>Extract positions Instead of selecting sentences from the manifesto that cover a topic, the posi- tion could be extracted from the manifesto using topic models, as shown in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Thomas et al., 2006</ref>) and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gerrish and Blei, 2011)</ref>. To extract the topics from the manifestos, we run labeled LDA sepa- rately on each manifesto, following the technique described in Section 3, yet with an important dif- ference. In Section 3, we trained one common topic model on all manifestos, in order to have a broad coverage over all topics. Here, we are in- terested in the positions carried by the particular words chosen by the party to describe a topic. Ac- cordingly, we train a separate topic model on each manifesto. The result is a distribution over terms for each committee, hence for each topic.</p><p>Compare positions As a result of the process to determine the topic of a speech (Section 3), the speeches also have a representation of the dis- cussed topics as a distribution over terms. This way we can directly compare the distributions for the most probable topics in the speech with the corresponding topic in the party manifestos. This can be done using measures to estimate the distance between probability distributions like, for instance, Kullback-Leibler distance or Jensen- Shannon divergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we presented an overview of our the- sis proposal on comparing positions found within political speeches against those expressed in party manifestos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of this kind to aim at providing a fine-grained analysis of speakers' positions on po- litical data. Arguably, the most exiting aspect of this work is that it grounds a variety of Natural Language Processing topics -e.g., polarity detec- tion, topic modeling, among others -within a con- crete, multi-faceted application scenario.</p><p>Being this a proposal, the first step in the fu- ture will be to complete the implementation of all above described methods and evaluate them. In our dataset, we are provided with additional in- formation apart from the speech text: we know about heckles, laughter and applause and even know their origin. This knowledge can be used to estimate a network of support or opposition. This knowledge is also used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Strapparava et al., 2010)</ref> to predict persuasiveness of sentences, which could constitute another source of informa- tion for our model. Another idea would be to make use of the speaker's given party affiliations and bootstrap an approach to analyze their positions: if we assume that a majority of the speakers actu- ally does follow their parties' lines, we can train a classifier for each party for each topic, and apply it to the same data to detect outliers. Besides, a big research question would be to see how much we can complement our topic models with addi- tional supervision in the form of symbolic knowl- edge sources like wide-coverage ontologies, e.g., DBpedia. Finally, while we do focus in this work on German data, we are interested in extending our model to other languages, including resource-rich ones like English as well as resource-poor ones.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Approach overview</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="4,331.37,62.81,170.08,128.16" type="bitmap" /></figure>
