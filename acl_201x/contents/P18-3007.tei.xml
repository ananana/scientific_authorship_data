			<abstract>
				<p>Detecting interesting, cross-disciplinary knowledge associations hidden in scientific publications can greatly assist scientists to formulate and validate scientifically sensible novel research hypotheses. This will also introduce new areas of research that can be successfully linked with their research discipline. Currently, this process is mostly performed manually by exploring the scientific publications, requiring a substantial amount of time and effort. Due to the exponential growth of scientific literature, it has become almost impossible for a scientist to keep track of all research advances. As a result, scientists tend to deal with fragments of the literature according to their specialisation. Consequently, important and hidden associations among these fragmented knowledge that can be linked to produce significant scientific discoveries remain un-noticed. This doctoral work aims to develop a novel knowledge discovery approach that suggests most promising research pathways by analysing the existing scientific literature.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Problem Statement</head><p>Formulation of scientifically sensible novel re- search hypotheses requires a comprehensive anal- ysis of the existing literature. However, the voluminous nature of literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cheadle et al., 2016</ref>) makes the hypothesis generation process ex- tremely difficult and time-consuming even in the narrow specialisation of a scientist. In this re- gard, Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) research is highly beneficial as it aims to detect non-trivial implicit associations by analysing a massive num- ber of documents that have the potential to gen- erate novel research hypotheses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ganiz et al., 2005</ref>). Moreover, LBD outcomes encourage the progress of cross-disciplinary research by suggest- ing promising cross domain research pathways, which are typically unnoticed during manual anal- ysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sebastian et al., 2017b</ref>).</p><p>Independent of the domain, LBD is highly valu- able to accelerate knowledge acquisition and re- search development process. However, the exist- ing LBD approaches are mostly limited to medi- cal domain that attempt to find associations among genes, proteins, drugs, and diseases. The main reason for this can be the highly specific and de- scriptive nature of medical literature that is suit- able for LBD research <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ittipanuvat et al., 2014</ref>). The application of LBD process in domains such as Computer Science (CS) is challenging due to the rapidly evolving nature of terms in the content of research publications. The medical related LBD approaches are strongly coupled with the medi- cal domain knowledge by utilising resources such as Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), MetaMap, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sebastian et al., 2017a)</ref>. This makes the applicability of these approaches to other do- mains challenging.</p><p>LBD research outside of medical domain is still in an immature state. There are only a few LBD studies performed outside of medical domain (e.g., Water Purification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kostoff et al., 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Technology &amp; Social Issues (Ittipanuvat et al., 2014</ref>), Hu- manities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cory, 1997)</ref>). To date, a work by Gor- don and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lindsay (2002)</ref> is the only available CS- related LBD research. Hence, in this doctoral re- search, we attempt to contribute to LBD discipline outside of medical domain by automating cross- disciplinary knowledge discovery process. As a proof of concept, the proposed solution will be ap- plied to different CS-related concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">LBD Discovery Models</head><p>Most of the LBD literature are based on the fun- damental premise introduced by Swanson namely, ABC Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Swanson, 1986)</ref>. It employs a simple syllogism to identify the potential knowledge as- sociations. i.e. given two concepts A and C in two disjoint scientific literature, if A is associated with concept B, and the same concept B is associated with C, the model deduces that A is associated with C. Swanson demonstrated how these com- bined knowledge pairs contribute to reach solu- tions by manually making several medical discov- eries (e.g., Raynaud's disease ↔ Fish Oil <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Swanson, 1986)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Migraine ↔ Magnesium (Swanson, 1988)</ref>). These medical discoveries are the ba- sis of the LBD discipline.</p><p>The ABC model has two variants named as open and closed discovery models <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Henry and McInnes, 2017)</ref>. Open discovery starts with an initial user-defined concept (e.g., Learning Analytics (LA)) where the LBD process automat- ically analyses the literature related to the initial concept to detect the potential interesting and im- plicit associations. This model is generally used when there is a single problem (A-concept) with limited knowledge on what concepts can be in- volved (B and C concepts). This model greatly assists in hypothesis generation process. On the contrary, closed discovery process requires two user-defined concepts (e.g., LA and Deep Learn- ing) as the input to output potential hidden asso- ciations (B-concepts) between these specified two concepts A and C. This model is generally used for hypotheses testing and validation. However, the derived associations of the model can also be considered to generate more granular hypotheses.</p><p>The granularity of the user-defined concepts of the two discovery models can vary depending on the researcher's interest ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ganiz et al., 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Even though the early work in LBD was per- formed manually, over the time, different compu- tational techniques were adopted to automate the LBD process. Most of the existing LBD research are semi-automated and requires a human expert to make decisions during the LBD process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sebastian et al., 2017a</ref>).</p><p>Much of the early computational approaches utilise lexical statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Swanson and Smalheiser, 1997</ref>  frequency, token frequencies, which can be con- sidered as the most primitive LBD approach. Later, Distributional Semantics approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gordon and Dumais, 1998</ref>) such as Latent Seman- tic Indexing, Reflective Random Indexing were introduced. Subsequently, knowledge-based ap- proaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Weeber et al., 2001</ref>) were adopted in the LBD process that heavily rely on the existence of external structured knowledge-based resources to acquire domain-specific knowledge.</p><p>Relations-based approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hristovski et al., 2006</ref>) make use of user-defined explicit predicates to convey the meaning of the associations. How- ever, these approaches are restricted to problems where semantic types and predicates are known in advance. Another category is Graph-based ap- proaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cameron et al., 2015</ref>) that generate a number of bridging terms to define the associa- tions. Bibliometrics-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kostoff, 2014</ref>) utilise bibliographic link structures in the LBD process to identify potential knowledge as- sociations. Several attempts have been taken in LBD literature to employ link prediction tech- niques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sebastian et al., 2015)</ref>. i.e. attributes of the concepts and observed links are used to predict the existence of new links between the concepts.</p><p>As discussed earlier, majority of the LBD re- search are in medical domain and dependent on medical domain knowledge. As a result, it is not feasible to apply these approaches to other do- mains. To date, there are only a handful of LBD research studies performed outside of the medical domain. This points out the importance of con- tributing to non-medical LBD research which is still in an early stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Goals and Research Questions</head><p>Development of an automatic LBD system can significantly improve the typical research process  followed by the scientists. With such system, sci- entists can generate scientifically sensible research hypotheses in a shorter time by considering the suggestions provided by the system. Moreover, the cross-domain knowledge discovery process of LBD facilitates the development of cross disci- plinary research. Thus, in this study we are aim- ing to develop a novel knowledge discovery ap- proach by utilising both the variants of LBD pro- cess namely, open and closed discovery.</p><p>Our main intention is to uplift the LBD pro- cess in non-medical domains. The ultimate goals of this doctoral research are; 1) Fully automate the LBD process: Most of the existing LBD ap- proaches are semi-automatic and require human decisions to direct the knowledge discovery pro- cess at various stages. Thus, automating the en- tire LBD process will be highly beneficial for the users of the LBD model. 2) Provide a generic LBD solution that is independent of domain specific knowledge: Most of the existing LBD approaches rely on domain-specific knowledge to identify the knowledge associations. As a result, the appli- cability of these approaches to other domains are limited. Therefore, it is important to generate a LBD model that is suitable for any domain, with- out incorporating any domain specific knowledge.</p><p>While focusing on technical literature, in par- ticular, CS domain, the research questions of this study are; 1) How to leverage NLP and Machine Learning techniques to enhance the understanding of content in the literature to accurately detect re- search areas with different levels of granularity? 2) How bibliometrics analysis can be integrated to enhance identification of implicit knowledge asso- ciations? 3) What are the scoring schemes that can be used to rank the identified associations? 4) How to improve the existing evaluation approaches to accurately validate the LBD outcomes? This doc- toral work plans to answer these research ques- tions to fulfill the aforementioned goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Current Work and Future Directions</head><p>We have conducted a comprehensive literature analysis and have defined our research questions based on the gaps identified in the literature. Cur- rently, we are carrying out preliminary studies to identify potential techniques that would be use- ful to enhance the predictability of the open dis- covery LBD model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> depicts the high- level overview of our methodology that addresses research questions 1 and 3. The proposed LBD approach is based on Swanson's ABC discovery model. In this approach we are attempting to iden- tify the importance of neural word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>) to accurately capture the context of the main keywords of the abstracts. As for the literature database, we are using Web of Sci- ence Core Collection (WoS) 1 to obtain the meta data of the literature such as title, abstract, and au- thor keywords.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, initially the frequencies of the author keywords were analysed to obtain the B-literature. The retrieved title and abstract in B-literature were cleaned using several care- fully picked preprocessing techniques. In sum- mary, the potential abbreviations in the text are identified by using multiple regex patterns. Af- terwards, variable length n-grams in the text were identified by using a formula based on colloca- tion patterns described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mikolov et al. (2013a)</ref>. We also removed numbers, punctuation marks and terms constituent of single letters before analysing the texts.</p><p>After the preprocessing phase, we identified the sentence in the abstract that describes the in- tention/purpose of the study by using multiple intention-based word patterns. We further pro- cessed the identified purpose sentence along with the title by removing stop words. The intention of using the purpose sentence and title is that they typically include the most important concepts that best describe the study.</p><p>For each post-processed n-grams (w i ) of the purpose sentence and title, we calculated a seman- tic importance (informativeness) score based on word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>) word embed- ding method. In other words, we measured the informativeness of w i based on the validity and se- mantic richness of N neighbouring terms derived using cosine similarity. To measure the validity and semantic richness of N neighbouring terms, we imposed the following three criterions for the three categories of the neighbouring terms; uni- grams, abbreviations and n-grams respectively. 1) valid technical unigram 2) valid detected abbrevia- tion 3) valid n-gram by eliminating partial n-grams with different Part of Speech (POS) tag patterns. If the neighbouring term (n i ) fulfills the relevant cri- teria based on its category, it will be considered as a valid, quality neighbouring term (n i ∈ N &amp; N ⊂ N). We excluded w i if its informativeness is less than or equal to 50%. i.e. the excluded terms have majority of neighbours that does not fulfill the valid, quality neighbouring criterions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">inf ormativeness(w i ) = 1 N N i=1 [n i ∈ N ]</formula><p>The frequency of w i denotes the importance of the term within B-literature. Therefore, we multi- plied informativeness(w i ) by the number of occur- rences w i appeared in the title and purpose sen- tences to obtain the final weighted score. This score was used to rank the derived w i terms which represent the important concepts in B-literature (i.e. seed concepts). Each seed concept was ex- tended by linking valid quality neighbouring terms (using the same criteria used to measure the va- lidity and semantic richness of the neighbouring terms) in word2vec vector space.</p><p>We performed the same steps of the experi- ment with fastText ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bojanowski et al., 2016</ref>) word embedding method. An important observation is that with respect to word2vec, we obtained a broad topic coverage in the same field showing what areas are connected with the seed concept whereas with fastText, we obtained topics in a nar- row range.</p><p>We used Learning Analytics (LA) as the A- concept to evaluate our approach. The reason for choosing LA is that it is a relatively novel but rapidly growing area connected to many disci- plines like education, psychology, machine learn- ing etc. We utilised intersection evaluation of Gor- don and Lindsay's work <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref> to evaluate the C- concepts obtained for LA. As for the evaluation lit- erature database, we used WoS and Scopus 2 to ob- tain the intersection frequencies. We categorised the derived C-concepts as existing, emerging and novel based on the intersection frequencies. In to- tal we obtained 564 knowledge associations <ref type="bibr">3</ref> .</p><p>Unlike Gordon and Lindsay's work (2002), the knowledge discovery process of our approach is fully automated and does not require any human intervention to make decisions during the process. Therefore, verifying the validity of the obtained concepts is important to ensure that the associ- ated intersections are meaningful. We performed an expert-based concept validation by utilising le- gitimate concept criteria discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hurtado et al. (2016)</ref>. From the evaluation performed by two LA researchers with CS background, we ob- tained an average accuracy of 97.87%, 98.21%, 95.68% for existing, emerging, and novel associ- ations respectively. The experts' agreement for the valid terms is 93.6%. Through our experi- ment, we could successfully identify many inter- esting C-concepts that have the potential to gener- ate scientifically sensible novel research hypoth- esis. For example, our existing C-concepts in- cluded well-established research areas in LA such as machine learning, data mining, and e-learning whereas the emerging C-concepts included infre- quently used potential research areas in LA such as computer vision, linked open data, and cogni- tive science. We could also obtain many inter- esting novel C-concepts such as word embedding techniques, deep learning architectures such as LSTM, BLSTM, CNN, that can be utilised in future LA research. Therefore, the suggestions provided through our approach will greatly influence to up- lift the process of research in LA. In comparison with the only existing CS-related LBD approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gordon and Lindsay, 2002</ref>), our approach utilises an improved methodology <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-medical LBD study that utilises neural word embeddings to detect the target C-concepts. Our initial results demonstrate the importance of ex- ploiting neural word embeddings to effectively identify potential cross-disciplinary knowledge associations buried in literature. We would like to further enhance our existing approach by consider- ing the below-mentioned future directions that are categorised based on our four research questions (RQ) described in Section 4.</p><p>RQ 1 (Content Analysis): A subtle analysis of literature is needed to accurately capture the hid- den knowledge associations. In our current exper- iment, we are considering concepts at keywords- level by identifying seed concepts. As an improve- ment, we would like to have an organised topic structure with different levels of granularity. In or- der to achieve that, we are intending to utilise se- mantic web technologies and pre-existing topical categories (e.g., Dewey Decimal Classification) to enhance the understanding of the content. More- over, the identified topic structure will also be use- ful to provide a clearly structured, logical output to the user than merely listing the identified as- sociations. Due to the lack of LBD research that analyse the effects of topic modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sebastian et al., 2017b)</ref>, it is also important to study how top- ical information propagate among research pub- lications to detect interesting, implicit knowledge associations. Another interesting future direction would be to utilise deep language understanding techniques to infer ontologies from the scientific literature automatically which can be utilised to identify more granular knowledge associations.</p><p>RQ 2 (Bibliometrics Analysis): In our cur- rent experiment, we are utilising the popular ABC model to discover the knowledge associations. However, the inference steps introduced through ABC model is simple and not foolproof. There- fore, in our future research studies, we are intend- ing to analyse more complex inference steps to identify complex knowledge associations that can- not be identified through ABC model. To achieve that, we are aiming to integrate a graph-based ap- proach by analysing the relationships among the four entity types (i.e. author, term, paper, venue) illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. In other words, we are intending to utilise different bibliographics-based link structures such as co-author relationships, di- rect citation links, co-word analysis, bibliograph- ics coupling, and co-citation links to uncover com- plex knowledge associations. For example, when authors from disjoint research fields collaborate for a research, it implies a potential association between the two knowledge areas. This simple co-author relationship can be further expanded to more complex associations by analysing shared authors in the citations of the source and target lit- erature, analysing authors in source literature that are cited by the target literature etc. Same as for the author entity, this procedure can be followed for the remaining entities (i.e. paper, term, venue) of the network schema in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> to derive more complex and implicit associations. With regards to term entity, the identified associations can be fur- ther expanded by leveraging topic modeling and topical categories. We are intending to automati- cally generate all the aforementioned associations (up to four degree meta path associations) for the four entity types by traversing through the network schema in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. From the derived associations we would like to identify the most effective asso- ciation links by comparing the output results. The identified effective association links will provide an improved understanding of an implicit associa- tion than the simple ABC model. RQ 3 (Associations Ranking): The generated target concepts list should be ordered in a way where the most significant knowledge association should be listed in the top. Therefore, it is impor- tant to identify the factors that can be utilised to rank the derived associations. In our current ap- proach, we are incorporating semantic importance and frequency to rank the associations. In fre- quently evolving domains like CS, it is also impor- tant to consider the temporal factors to accurately identify the new research advancements. There- fore, we would like to propose different temporal- related weighting mechanisms to rank the target C-concepts. To accomplish this, we need to anal- yse the concepts in chronologically ordered time slices. For example, when deriving the tempo- ral weight of a concept, factors such as the sig- nificance of the concept in its corresponding time interval, and changes of the concept's trend over the time using a sliding-window mechanism need to be considered. Moreover, we can also utilise pre-existing algorithms that analyse the evolution of topics (e.g., Dynamic Topic Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wang and McCallum, 2006</ref>), Topics over Time Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Blei and Lafferty, 2006)</ref>) in this regard. RQ 4 (Evaluation): Evaluating the validity of the identified knowledge associations outside of medical domain is very challenging due to the unavailability of gold standard datasets. Medi- cal LBD literature mostly attempted to replicate Swanson's manually detected medical discoveries (e.g., Raynaud's Disease ↔ Fish Oil) to evaluate their results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sebastian et al., 2017a</ref>). However, when dealing with other domains, the possible evaluation approaches that can be utilised are in- tersection evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gordon and Lindsay, 2002</ref>), time-sliced evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt, 2009)</ref> and expert based evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gordon and Lindsay, 2002</ref>) that have number of inherent limi- tations in accurately validating the results. There- fore, we would like to improve the existing LBD evaluation approaches to accurately evaluate our results. In our current evaluation, we are using in- tersection evaluation along with expert-based con- cept validation. In our future experiments, we would like to quantitatively evaluate the knowl- edge associations by utilising information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall (to evaluate the complete set of target C-concepts) and 11- point average interpolated precision curves, preci- sion at k, and mean average precision (to evaluate the rankings of the target C-concepts). To quanti- tatively evaluate the overall quality of the results a ground truth is required. For this purpose, we are intending to create a time-sliced dataset described in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt (2009)</ref>. In other words, the literature is divided into two sets namely, pre-cut-off set (includes literature before a cut-off date) and post-cut-off set (includes liter- ature after the cut-off date). Afterwards, the LBD methodology is applied to pre-cut-off set to obtain the implicit knowledge associations. Later, the existence of these identified associations (that do not exist explicitly in pre-cut-off set) is checked in the post-cut-off set. A major limitation of this ap- proach is that a knowledge association considered as a false positive can become a true positive once a new research is published. This limitation can be overcome upto some extent by incorporating hu- man experts to further evaluate validity of the false positives. Another interesting avenue for evalu- ation would be user performance evaluation by incorporating users with diversified range of ex- pertise such as users with limited prior knowledge and experts in the field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Qi and Ohsawa, 2016)</ref>. Through this approach, we can evaluate the extent to which the proposed LBD approach assist differ- ent levels of users to generate hypotheses by util- ising the suggested knowledge associations.</p><p>Thus, this doctoral work can be expanded in nu- merous ways since LBD outside of medical do- main is still in an early stage. Our next phase is to address the above discussed four focus points. Moreover, in our future work, we are also aim- ing to test our proposed LBD methodology on the better studied medical domain as well as on other domains such as humanities and social sciences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Open and closed discovery models.</figDesc></figure>
