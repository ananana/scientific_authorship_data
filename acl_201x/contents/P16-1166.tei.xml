			<abstract>
				<p>This paper describes the first robust approach to automatically labeling clauses with their situation entity type (Smith, 2003), capturing aspectual phenomena at the clause level which are relevant for interpreting both semantics at the clause level and discourse structure. Previous work on this task used a small data set from a limited domain, and relied mainly on words as features, an approach which is impractical in larger settings. We provide a new corpus of texts from 13 genres (40,000 clauses) annotated with situation entity types. We show that our sequence labeling approach using distributional information in the form of Brown clusters, as well as syntactic-semantic features targeted to the task, is robust across genres, reaching accuracies of up to 76%.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Clauses in text have different aspectual properties, and thus contribute to the discourse in different ways. Distinctions that have been made in the linguistic and semantic theory literature include the classification of states, events and processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vendler, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bach, 1986)</ref>, and whether clauses introduce particular eventualities or report regular- ities generalizing either over events or members of a kind ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Krifka et al., 1995)</ref>. Such aspectual distinctions are relevant to natural language pro- cessing tasks requiring text understanding such as information extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Van Durme, 2010</ref>) or tem- poral processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Costa and Branco, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we are concerned with automat- ically identifying the type of a situation entity (SE), which we assume to be expressed by a clause. Specifically, we present a system for au- tomatically labeling clauses using the inventory of STATE: The colonel owns the farm. EVENT: John won the race. REPORT: "...", said Obama. GENERIC SENTENCE: Generalizations over kinds. The lion has a bushy tail. GENERALIZING SENTENCE:</p><p>Generalizations over events (habituals).</p><p>Mary often fed the cat last year. QUESTION: Who wants to come? IMPERATIVE: Hand me the pen! <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: SE types, adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Smith (2003)</ref>. SE types shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Smith, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Smith, , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Palmer et al., 2007</ref>). The original motivation for the above inventory of SE types is the observation that different modes of discourse, a classification of linguistic properties of text at the passage level, have different distributions of SE types. For ex- ample, EVENTs and STATEs are predominant in narrative passages, while GENERIC SENTENCEs occur frequently in information passages.</p><p>A previous approach to automatically labeling SE types <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Palmer et al., 2007</ref>) -referred to here as UT07 -captures interesting insights, but is trained and evaluated on a relatively small amount of text (about 4300 clauses), mainly from one rather spe- cialized subsection of the Brown corpus. The data shows a highly skewed distribution of SE types and was annotated in an intuitive fashion with only moderate agreement. In addition, the UT07 sys- tem relies mostly on part-of-speech tags and words as features. The latter are impractical when deal- ing with larger data sets and capture most of the corpus vocabulary, overfitting the model to the data set. Despite this overfitting, the system's ac- curacy is only around 53%.</p><p>We address these shortcomings, developing a robust system that delivers high performance com- pared to the human upper bound across a range of genres. Our approach uses features which increase robustness: Brown clusters and syntactic-semantic features. Our models for labeling texts with the aspectual properties of clauses in the form of SE types reach accuracies of up to 76%.</p><p>In an oracle experiment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Palmer et al. (2007)</ref> show that including the gold labels of the previ- ous clauses as features into their maximum en- tropy model is beneficial. We implement the first true sequence labeling model for SE types, us- ing conditional random fields to find the globally- best sequence of labels for the clauses in a docu- ment. Performance increases by around 2% abso- lute compared to predicting labels for clauses sep- arately; much of this effect stems from the fact that GENERIC SENTENCEs often occur together.</p><p>Moving well beyond the single-domain setting, our models are trained and evaluated on a multi- genre corpus of approximately 40,000 clauses from MASC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ide et al., 2008)</ref> and Wikipedia which have been annotated with substantial agree- ment. We train and test our models both within genres and across genres, highlighting differences between genres and creating models that are ro- bust across genres. Both the corpus and the code for an SE type labeler are freely available. 1 These form the basis for future research on SE types and related aspectual phenomena and will enable the inclusion of SE type information as a preprocess- ing step into various NLP tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Linguistic background</head><p>The inventory of SE types proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Smith (2003)</ref> consists of three high-level categories, each with two subtypes. Eventualities comprise EVENT and STATE, categories for clauses representing ac- tual happenings, states of the world, or attributes of entities or situations. General Statives include GENERIC SENTENCE and GENERALIZING SEN- TENCE and reflect regularities in the world or gen- eral information predicated over classes or kinds. Finally, Abstract Entities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2</ref>) have the sub- types FACT and PROPOSITION. Although Ab- stract Entities are part of the label inventory for UT07, we treat them in a separate identification step, for reasons discussed in Section 7. The in- ventory was expanded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Palmer et al. (2007)</ref> to include three additional types: REPORT, QUES- TION and IMPERATIVE. The latter two categories were added to accommodate exhaustive annota-FACT: Objects of knowledge.</p><p>I know that Mary refused the offer. PROPOSITION: Objects of belief.</p><p>I believe that Mary refused the offer. tion of text; REPORT is a subtype of event for at- tributions of quoted speech. Two parts of a clause provide important in- formation for determining the SE type <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Friedrich and Palmer, 2014b</ref>): a clause's main verb and its main referent. The latter is loosely defined as the main entity that the segment is about; in English this is usually the subject. For example, main referents of GENERIC SENTENCEs are kinds or classes as in "Elephants are huge", while the main referents of Eventualities and GENERALIZ- ING SENTENCEs are particular individuals ("John is short"). For English, the main verb is the non-auxiliary verb ranked highest in the depen- dency parse (e.g. "kiss" in "John has kissed Joe"). STATEs and EVENTs differ in the fundamental lex- ical aspectual class <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Siegel and McKeown, 2000</ref>) of their main verbs (e.g. dynamic in "She filled the glass with water" vs. stative in "Water fills the glass"). While fundamental lexical aspectual class is a word-sense level attribute of the clause's main verb, habituality is a property of the entire clause which is helpful to determine the clause's SE type. For example, EVENT and GENERALIZ- ING SENTENCE differ in habituality (e.g. episodic in "John cycled to work yesterday" vs. habitual in "John cycles to work").</p><p>Like habituality, SE types are a categorization at the clause level. Properties of the clause such as modals, negation, or the perfect influence the SE type: for instance, "John might win" is treated as a STATE as it describes a possible state of the world rather than an EVENT. Such coercions hap- pen only for clauses which, without the trigger for aspectual shift, would be EVENTs; other SEs re- tain their type even under coercions such as nega- tion, e.g., "Elephants are not small" is a GENERIC SENTENCE. SE types aim to capture how clauses behave in discourse, and the types STATE and EVENT are aspectual rather than ontological cat- egories. The types reflect not so much semantic content of a clause as its manner of presentation, and all parts of a clause contribute to determining its SE type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related work</head><p>SE types model aspect at the clause level; thus they are most closely related to other works performing automatic classification for various aspect-related phenomena of the verb or the clause. For exam- ple, Vendler classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vendler, 1957)</ref> ascribe four categories as lexical properties of verbs, distin- guishing states from three types of events (ac- complishment, achievement, and activity), differ- ing according to temporal and aspectual proper- ties (e.g. telicity and punctuality). The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Siegel and McKeown (2000)</ref> is a major inspiration in computational work on modeling these linguis- tic phenomena, introducing the use of linguistic indicators (see Section 5.1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hermes et al. (2015)</ref> model Vendler classes computationally on a verb- type level for 95 different German verbs, combin- ing distributional vectors with supervised classifi- cation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Zarcone and Lenci (2008)</ref> investigate both supervised and unsupervised classification frame- works for occurrences of <ref type="bibr">28 Italian verbs, and Friedrich and Palmer (2014a)</ref> predict lexical as- pectual class for English verbs in context.</p><p>The only previous approach to automatic clas- sification of SE types comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Palmer et al.

The inventory of event classes, described in detail in the TimeML anno- tation guidelines <ref type="bibr">(Saurí et al., 2006</ref>), combines semantic (REPORTING, PERCEPTION), aspectual (ASPECTUAL, STATE, OCCURRENCE), and inten- sional (I ACTION, I STATE) properties of events.</p><p>Finally, there are close connections to systems which predict genericity of noun phrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reiter and Frank, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015a)</ref>, and habituality of clauses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mathew and Katz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data sets</head><p>The experiments presented in this paper make use of two data sets labeled with SE types.</p><p>Brown data. This data set consists of 20 texts from the popular lore section of the Brown corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Francis and Kučera, 1979)</ref>, manually segmented into 4391 clauses and marked by two annotators in  an intuitive way with κ=0.52 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cohen, 1960)</ref>. Fi- nal labels were created via adjudication. The texts are essays and personal stories with topics ranging from maritime stories to marriage advice.</p><p>MASC and Wikipedia. Our main data set con- sists of documents from MASC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ide et al., 2010)</ref> and Wikipedia. The MASC data covers 12 of the written genres (see <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>). Texts are split into clauses using SPADE (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) with some heuristic post-processing, and the clauses are labeled by three annotators inde- pendently. Annotators, all student assistants with basic linguistic training, were given an extensive annotation manual. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reports agreement over types in terms of <ref type="bibr">Fleiss' κ (Fleiss, 1971)</ref>. As we do not force annotators to assign a label to each clause, we compute κ using all pairings of labels where both annotators assigned an SE type. The gold standard is constructed via majority voting. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the distribution of SE types. The largest proportion of segments in MASC are STATEs, while the largest proportion in Wikipedia are GENERIC SENTENCEs. The Wikipedia data was collected to supplement MASC, which con- tains few generics and no data from an encyclo- pedic genre. Within MASC, the various genres' distributions of SE types differ as well, and agree- ment scores also vary: some genres contain many instances of easily classifiable SE types, while oth- ers (e.g., essays or journal) are more difficult to annotate (more details in Section 6.6).</p><p>The rightmost column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the val- ues for Krippendorff's diagnostics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Krippendorff, 1980)</ref>, a tool for determining which categories hu- features describing the SE's main verb &amp; its arguments tense, lemma, lemma of object, auxiliary, WordNet sense and hypernym sense, progressive, POS, perfect, particle, voice, linguistic indicators mr features describing the main refer- ent, i.e., the NP denoting the main verb's subject lemma, determiner type, noun type, number, WordNet sense and super- sense, dependency relations linked to this token, person, countability, bare plural cl features describing entire clause that invokes the SE presence of adverbs / prepositional clauses, conditional, modal, whether subject before verb, negated, verbs embedding the clause <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Overview of feature set B.

For each cate- gory, one computes κ for an artificial set-up in which all categories except one are collapsed into an artificial OTHER category. A high value indi- cates that annotators can distinguish this SE type well from others. GENERALIZING SENTENCEs are most difficult to agree upon. For all frequently occurring types as well as QUESTIONs and IM- PERATIVEs, agreement is substantial. Agreement on QUESTION and IMPERATIVEs is not perfect even for humans, as identifying them requires recognizing cases in reported speech, which is not a trivial task (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brunner, 2013)</ref>. To illustrate another difficult case, consider the ex- ample "You must never confuse faith", which was marked as both IMPERATIVE and GENERIC SEN- TENCE, by different annotators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Method</head><p>This section describes the feature sets and classifi- cation methods used in our approach, which mod- els SE type labeling as a supervised sequence la- beling task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Feature sets</head><p>Our feature sets are designed to work well on large data sets, across genres and domains. Features are grouped into two sets: A consists of standard NLP features including POS tags and Brown clusters. Set B targets SE labeling, focusing on syntactic- semantic properties of the main verb and main ref- erent, as well as properties of the clause which in- dicate its aspectual nature. Texts are pre-processed with Stanford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Manning et al., 2014</ref>), including tokenization, POS tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>) and dependency parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Klein and Manning, 2002</ref>) using the UIMA-based DKPro framework ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ferrucci and Lally, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eckart de Castilho and Gurevych, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>A-pos: part-of-speech tags. These features count how often each POS tag occurs in a clause.</p><p>A-bc: Brown cluster features. UT07 relies mostly on words and word/POS tag pairs. These simple features work well on the small Brown data set, but the approach quickly becomes impracti- cal with increasing corpus size. We instead turn to distributional information in the form of Brown clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown et al., 1992)</ref>, which can be learned from raw text and represent word classes in a hi- erarchical way. Originally developed in the con- text of n-gram language modeling, they aim to as- sign words to classes such that the average mutual information of the words in the clusters is maxi- mized. We use existing, freely-available clusters trained on news data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Turian et al. (2010)</ref> using the implementation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liang (2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Clusterings with 320 and 1000 Brown clusters work best for our task. We use one feature per cluster, counting how often a word in the clause was assigned to this cluster (0 for most clusters).</p><p>B-mv: main verb. Using dependency parses, we extract the verb ranked highest in the clause's parse as the main verb, and extract the set of fea- tures listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> for that token. Features based on WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref> use the most frequent sense of the lemma. Tense and voice information is extracted from sequences of POS tags using a set of rules ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Loaiciga et al., 2014</ref>). Linguistic indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Siegel and McKeown, 2000</ref>) are features collected per verb type over a large parsed background corpus, encoding how often a verb type occurred with each linguistic marker, e.g., in past tense or with an in-PP. We use val- ues collected from Gigaword ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Graff et al., 2003)</ref>; these are freely available at our project web site <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Friedrich and Palmer, 2014a</ref>). B-mr: main referent. We extract the gram- matical subject of the main verb (i.e., nsubj or nsubjpass) as the clause's main referent. While the main verb must occur within the clause, the main referent may be a token either within or out- side the clause. In the latter case, it still functions as the clause's main referent, as in most cases it can be considered an implicit argument within the clause. <ref type="table">Table 3 lists the features extracted for the  main referent.</ref> B-cl: clause. These features (see also <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>)</p><note type="other">describe properties at the clause level, capturing both grammatical phenomena such as word order and lexical phenomena including presence of par- ticular adverbials or prepositional phrases, as well as semantic information such as modality. If the clause's main verb is embedded in a ccomp rela- tion, we also use features describing the respective governing verb.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Classification / sequence labeling model</head><p>Our core modeling assumption is to view a doc- ument as a sequence of SE type labels, each as- sociated with a clause; this motivates the choice of using a conditional random field (CRF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lafferty et al. (2001)</ref>) for label prediction. The conditional probability of label sequence y given an observa- tion sequence x is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P ( y| x) = 1 Z( x) exp( n j=1 m i=1 λ i f i (y j−1 , y j , x, j)),</formula><p>with Z( x) being a normalization constant (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Klinger and Tomanek (2007)</ref>). λ i , the weights of the feature functions, are learned via L-BGFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Wright and Nocedal, 1999</ref>).</p><p>We create a linear chain CRF using the CRF++ toolkit 3 with default parameters, apply- ing two forms of feature functions: f i (y j , x j ) and f i (y j−1 , y j ). The former consists of indicator functions for combinations of SE type labels and each of the features listed above. The latter type of feature function (also called "bigram" features in CRF++ terminology) gets instantiated as indicator functions for each combination of labels, thereby enabling the model to take sequence information into account. When using only the former type of feature function, our classifier is equivalent to a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model.</p><p>Side remark: pipeline approach. Feature set B is inspired by previous work on two subtasks of assigning an SE type to a clause (see Section 3): (a) identifying the genericity of a noun phrase in its clausal context, and (b) identifying whether a clause is episodic, habitual or static. This informa- 3 https://code.google.com/p/crfpp tion can in turn be used to determine a clause's SE type label in a rule-based way, e.g., GENERALIZ- ING SENTENCEs are habitual clauses with a non- generic main referent. As our corpus is also anno- tated with this information, we also trained sepa- rate models for these subtasks and assigned the SE type label accordingly. However, such a pipeline approach is not competitive with the model trained directly on SE types (see Section 6.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>Here we present our experiments on SE type clas- sification, beginning with a (near) replication of the UT07 system, and moving on to evaluate our new approach from multiple perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Replication and extension of UT07</head><p>As a first step, we implement a system similar to UT07, which relies on the features summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. For W and T features, we set a frequency threshold of 7 occurrences. Feature set L com- prises sets of predicates assumed to correlate with particular SE types, and whether or not the clause contains a modal or finite verb. Set G includes all verbs of the clause and their POS-tags. UT07 additionally uses CCG supertags and grammatical function information. The UT07 system approx- imates a sequence labeling model by adding the predicted labels of previous clauses as lookback (LB) features. To parallel their experiments, we train both MaxEnt and CRF models, as explained in Section 5.2. Results on the Brown data, with the same training/test split, appear in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref>. Unlike the LB model, our CRF predicts the label sequence jointly and outperforms UT07 on the Brown data by up to 7% accuracy. We assume that the per- formance boost in the MaxEnt setting is at least partially due to having better parses.</p><p>In sum, on the small Brown data set, a CRF ap- proach successfully leverages sequence informa- tion, and a simple set of features works well. Pre- liminary experiments applying our new features on Brown data yield no improvements, suggesting that word-based features overfit this domain.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Experimental settings</head><p>We develop our models using 10-fold cross val- idation (CV) on 80% (counted in terms of the number of SEs) of the MASC and Wikipedia data (a total of 32,855 annotated SEs), keeping the re- maining 20% as a held-out test set. Development and test sets each contain distinct sets of docu- ments; the documents of each MASC genre and of Wikipedia are distributed over the folds. We re- port results in terms of macro-average precision, macro-average recall, macro-average F1-measure (harmonic mean of macro-average precision and macro-average recall), and accuracy. We apply McNemar's test <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(McNemar, 1947</ref>) with p &lt; 0.01 to test significance of differences in accuracy. In the following tables, we mark numerically-close scores with the same symbols if they are found to be significantly different.</p><p>Upper bound: human performance. Labeling clauses with their SE types is a non-trivial task even for humans, as there are many borderline cases (see Sections 4 and 8). We compute an upper bound for system performance by iterating over all clauses: for each pair of human annotators, two entries are added to a co-occurrence matrix (simi- lar to a confusion matrix), with each label serving once as "gold standard" and once as the "predic- tion." From this matrix, we can compute scores in the same manner as for system predictions. Preci- sion and recall scores are symmetric in this case, and accuracy corresponds to observed agreement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Impact of feature sets</head><p>We now compare various configurations of our CRF-based SE type labeler, experimenting with the feature sets as described in Section 5.1. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Ta- ble 6</ref> shows the results for 10-fold CV on the dev portion of the MASC+Wiki corpus.

Finally, having developed exclusively on the dev set, we run the system on the held-out test set, training on the entire dev set.

To gain further insight, we ablate each feature subgroup from the full system, see Ta- ble 8. Again, bc features and mv features are identified as the most important ones. The other feature groups partially carry redundant informa- tion when combining A and B. Next, we rank fea- tures by their information gain with respect to the SE types. In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, the features of each group are ordered by this analysis. Ablating single fea- tures from the full system does not result in signif- icant performance losses.

In addition, CRFs are known to be able to deal with a large number of potentially dependent features.</p><p>Side remark: pipeline approach. We here use the subset of SEs labeled as EVENT, STATE, GENERIC SENTENCE or GENERALIZING SEN- TENCE because noun phrase genericity and habit- uality is not labeled for IMPERATIVE and QUES- TION, and REPORT is identified lexically based on the main verb rather than these semantic features. Models for subtasks of SE type identification, i.e., (a) genericity of noun phrases and (b) habitual- ity reach accuracies of (a) 86.8% and (b) 83.6% (on the relevant subset). Applying the labels out- put by these two systems as (the only) features in a rule-based way using a J48 decision tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Witten et al., 1999</ref>) results in an accuracy of 75.5%, which is lower than 77.2%, the accuracy of the CRF which directly models SE types (when using only the above four types).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Impact of amount of training data</head><p>Next we test how much training data is required to get stable results for SE type classification. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 3</ref> shows accuracy and F1 for 10-fold CV us- ing A+B, with training data downsampled to dif- ferent extents in each run by randomly removing documents. Up to the setting which uses about 60% of the training data, performance increases steadily. Afterwards, the curves start to level off. We conclude that robust models can be learned from our corpus. Adding training data, especially in-domain data, will, as always, be beneficial.  <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> a MaxEnt model including the correct label of the preceding clause (seq-oracle), simulating an upper bound for the impact of se- quence information on our system. <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> shows the results. Scores for GENER- ALIZING SENTENCE are the lowest as this class is very infrequent in the data set. The most strik- ing improvement of the two sequence labeling settings over MaxEnt concerns the identification of GENERIC SENTENCEs. These often "cluster" in texts (Friedrich and Pinkal, 2015b) and hence their identification profits from using sequence in- formation. The results for seq-oracle show that the sequence information is useful for STATE, GENERIC and GENERALIZING SENTENCEs, but that no further improvement is to be expected from this method for the other SE types. We conclude that the CRF model is to be preferred over the MaxEnt model; in almost all of our experiments it performs significantly better or equally well.  <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>: Impact of sequence information: (F1 by SE type): CRF, Masc+Wiki, 10-fold CV.</p></div>

As expected, in the latter setting, both overall accuracy and macro- average F1 are lower compared to the case when in-genre training data is available. Nevertheless, our model is able to capture the nature of SE types across genres: the prediction of STATE, EVENT, REPORT and QUESTION is relatively stable even in the case of not having in-genre training data. An EVENT seems to be easily identifiable regard- less of the genre. GENERIC SENTENCE is a prob- lematic case; in the genre-CV setting, its F1-score drops by 23.5%. The main reason for this is that the distribution of SE types in Wikipedia differs completely from the other genres (see section 4). Precision for GENERIC SENTENCE is at 70.5% in the genre-CV setting, but recall is only 32.8% (compared to 70.1% and 66.6% in the 10-fold CV setting). Genericity seems to work differently in the various genres: most generics in Wikipedia clearly refer to kinds (e.g., lions or plants), while many generics in essays or letters are instances of more abstract concepts or generic you.</p><p>Results by genre. Next, we drill down in the evaluation of our system by separately inspect- ing results for individual genres. <ref type="table">Table 11</ref> shows that performance differs greatly depending on the genre. In some genres, the nature of SE types seems clearer to our annotators than in others, and this is reflected in the system's performance. The majority class is GENERIC SENTENCE in wiki, and STATE in all other genres. In the 'same genre' setting, 10-fold CV was performed within each genre. Adding out-of-genre training data improves macro-average F1 especially for genres with low scores in the 'same genre' setting. This boost is  <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>: Macro-avg. F1 by genre, CRF, 10-fold CV. Majority class given in % of clauses.</p><p>due to adding training data for types that are infre- quent in that genre. Accuracy (not shown in <ref type="table">table)</ref> improves significantly for blog, essays, govt-docs, jokes, and journal, and does not change for the re- maining genres. We conclude that it is extremely beneficial to use our full corpus for training, as ro- bustness of the system is increased, especially for SE types occurring infrequently in some genres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Identification of Abstract Entities</head><p>Our system notably does not address one of Smith's main SE categories: Abstract Entities, in- troduced in Section 2. These SEs are expressed as clausal arguments of certain predicates such as (canonically) know or believe. Note that the Ab- stract Entity subtypes FACT and PROPOSITION do not imply that a clause's propositional content is true or likely from an objective point of view, they rather indicate that the clause's content is intro- duced to the discourse as an object of knowledge or belief, respectively. Following Smith (2003), we use PROPOSITION in a different sense than the usual meaning of "proposition" in semantics - naturally situation entities of any type may have propositional content. Smith's use of the term (and thus ours too) contrasts PROPOSITION with FACT -our PROPOSITIONs are simply sentences presented as a belief (or with uncertain evidential status) of the writer or speaker. This use of "propo- sition" also occurs in linguistic work by Peterson (1997) on factive vs. propositional predicates. During the creation of the corpus, annotators were asked to give one label out of the SE types included in our classification task, and to mark the clause with one of the Abstract Entity sub- types in addition if applicable. Analysis of the data shows that our annotators frequently for- got to mark clauses as Abstract Entities, which makes it difficult to model these categories cor- rectly. As a first step toward resolving this issue, we implement a filter which automatically identi- fies Abstract Entities by looking for clausal com- plements of certain predicates. The list of pred- icates is compiled using WordNet synonyms of know, think, and believe, as well as predicates extracted from FactBank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">TruthTeller (Lotan et al., 2013</ref>). Many of the clauses automatically identified as Abstract Entities are cases that annotators missed during annotation. We thus performed a post-hoc evalua- tion, presenting these clauses in context to annota- tors and asking whether the clause is an Abstract Entity. The so-estimated precision of our filter is 85.8% (averaged over 3 annotators). Agreement for this annotation task is κ = 0.54, with an ob- served agreement of 88.7%. Our filter finds 80% of the clauses labeled as Abstract Entity by at least one annotator in the gold standard; this is approx- imately its recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a system for automatically la- beling clauses with their SE type which is mostly robust to changes in genre and which reaches ac- curacies of up to 76%, comparing favorably to the human upper bound of 80%. The system benefits from capturing contexual effects by using a linear chain CRF with label bigram features. In addition, the distributional and targeted syntactic-semantic features we introduce enable SE type prediction for large and diverse data sets. Our publicly avail- able system can readily be applied to any written English text, making it easy to explore the utility of SE types for other NLP tasks.</p><p>Discussion. Our annotation scheme and guide- lines for SE types <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Friedrich and Palmer, 2014b</ref>) follow established traditions in linguistics and se- mantic theory. When applying these to a large number of natural texts, though, we came across a number of borderline cases where it is not easy to select just one SE type label. As we have re- ported before <ref type="bibr">(Friedrich et al., 2015)</ref>, the most dif- ficult case is the identification of GENERIC SEN- TENCEs, which are defined as making a statement about a kind or class. We find that making this task becomes particularly difficult for argumenta- tive essays (Becker et al., to appear).</p><p>Future work. A next major step in our research agenda is to integrate SE type information into various applications, including argument mining, temporal reasoning, and summarization. Together with the mode of progression through the text, e.g., temporal or spatial, SE type distribution is a key factor for a reader or listener's intuitive recog- nition of the discourse mode of a text passage. Therefore the automatic labeling of clauses with their SE type is a prerequisite for automatically identifying a passage's discourse mode, which in turn has promising applications in many areas of NLP, as the mode of a text passage has implica- tions for the linguistic phenomena to be found in the passage. Examples include temporal process- ing of text <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Smith, 2008)</ref>, summarization, or ma- chine translation (for work on genres see van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wees et al., 2015</ref>). Here we focus on the automatic identification of SE types, leaving the identifica- tion of discourse modes to future work. The present work, using the SE type inventory introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Smith (2003)</ref>, is also the basis for research on more fine-grained aspectual type in- ventories. Among others, we plan to create sub- types of the STATE label, which currently sub- sumes clauses stativized by negation, modals, lex- ical information or other aspectual operators. Dis- tinguishing these is relevant for temporal relation processing or veridicality recognition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Abstract Entity SE types.</figDesc></figure>
