				<p>We propose a perspective on dialogue that focuses on relative information contributions of conversation partners as a key to successful communication. We predict the success of collaborative task in English and Danish corpora of task-oriented dialogue. Two features are extracted from the frequency domain representations of the lexical entropy series of each interlocutor, power spectrum overlap (PSO) and relative phase (RP). We find that PSO is a negative predictor of task success, while RP is a positive one. An SVM with these features significantly improved on previous task success prediction models. Our findings suggest that the strategic distribution of information density between interlocutors is relevant to task success.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>What factors affect whether information is con- veyed effectively and reliably in conversations? Several theoretical frameworks have emerged that model dialogical behavior at different granularity levels. Can we use them to measure communica- tive effectiveness?</p><p>Grounding theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clark and Brennan, 1991</ref>) models a successful communication as a pro- cess during which "common ground" (i.e., mu- tual knowledge, beliefs etc.) is jointly built among interlocutors. The interactive alignment model (IAM) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pickering and Garrod, 2004)</ref> proposes that the ultimate goal of dialogue is the alignment of interlocutors' situational model, which is helped by alignment at all other lower representation lev- els (e.g., lexical, syntactic etc.), driven by the psy- chologically well-documented priming effects.</p><p>Recently, empirical studies have verified the explanatory powers of the above-mentioned the- ories, especially the IAM, utilizing dialogues recorded and transcribed from various collabora- tive tasks conducted in laboratory settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Reitter and Moore, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reitter and Moore, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fusaroli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fusaroli and Tylén, 2016)</ref>. In those studies, the quality of communication is directly reflected in the collaborative performance of interlocutors, i.e., how successful they are in ac- complishing the task. Although they do not come to fully agree on which theoretical accounts of di- alogue (e.g., interactive alignment vs. interper- sonal synergy) provides better explanations (see Section 2.1 for details), the majority of these stud- ies have confirmed that the alignment of certain linguistic markers, lexical items, or syntactic rules between interlocutors correlates with task success.</p><p>What is missing from the picture, however, is the computational understanding of how strategies of interaction and the mix of information contribu- tions to the conversation facilitate successful com- munication. This is understandable because those higher level concepts do not directly map onto the atomic linguistic elements and thus are much more difficult to define and operationalize. In the present study, we intend to explore this missing part of work by characterizing how the interaction between interlocutors in terms of their informa- tion contributions affects the quality of communi- cation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">An information-based approach</head><p>Recent work has already used information theory to study the dynamics of dialogue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu and Reitter (2016b)</ref> observed that the amount of lexical in- formation (measured by entropy) from interlocu- tors of different roles, converges within the span of topic episodes in natural spoken dialogue. <ref type="bibr">Anon (2017)</ref> interpret this converging pattern as a re-flection of the dynamic process in which the infor- mation contributed by two interlocutors fluctuates in a complementary way at the early stage, and gradually reaches an equilibrium status. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu and Reitter (2016b)</ref> also correlated this entropy con- verging pattern with the topic shift phenomenon that frequently occurs in natural conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ng and Bradac, 1993)</ref>, and proposed that it reflects the process of interlocutors building the common ground that is necessary for the ongoing topics of conversation.</p><p>Based on <ref type="bibr">Xu and Reitter's (2016)</ref> finding that entropy converging pattern repeatedly occurs within dialogue (though not necessarily at strictly regular intervals), it is reasonable to expect that after applying some spectral analysis techniques (time space to frequency space conversion) to the entropy series of dialogue, the frequency space representations should demonstrate some patterns that are distinct from white noise, because the pe- riodicity properties in time space are captured.</p><p>Furthermore, we expect that how the frequency representations of two interlocutors correlate pro- vides some information about the higher level properties of dialogue, e.g., the task performance etc. The thought is intuitive: If we imagine the entropy series from two interlocutors as two ideal sinusoidal signals s 1 and s 2 (supposedly of dif- ferent frequencies, f 1 and f 2 ) <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), then the observed converging pattern can be thought of as a segment from the full spans of the signals. Then the frequency space properties, such as how close f 1 and f 2 are, and the phase difference φ between them, will definitely affect the shape of the converging pattern (solid lines in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). As <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu and Reitter (2016b)</ref> argues that the con- verging segment reflects the grounding process be- tween interlocutors, it is reasonable to expect that the shape and length of this segment are reflective of how well interlocutors understand each other, and the overall collaborative performance as well.</p><p>Based on the above considerations, the goal of the present study is to explore how the frequency space representations of the entropy series of dia- logue are correlated with the collaborative perfor- mance of task. We first demonstrate that entropy series satisfy the prerequisites of spectral analy- sis techniques in Section 4. Then we use two fre- quency space statistics, power spectrum overlap (PSO) and relative phase (RP), to predict task suc- cess. The reasons of using these two specific in- Figure 1: Analogizing the entropy converging pat- terns reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu and Reitter (2016b)</ref> to a segment from two periodic signals. The shad- owed area and the solid lines indicate the observed entropy convergence between interlocutors. The dashed lines are the imaginary parts of the ideal signals.</p><p>dices are discussed in Section 2.3, and their def- initions are given in Section 3.3. The results are shown in Sections 5 to 7, and the implications are discussed.</p></div>

The way humans use natural language to communicate also follows this principle: by computing the local per-word entropy of the sentence (which, under the predic- tion of ERC, will increase with sentence position), ERC is confirmed in both written text <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Genzel and Charniak, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Genzel and Charniak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Keller, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Qian and Jaeger, 2011</ref>) and spoken dialogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu and Reitter, 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xu and Reitter, 2016a)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Spectral analysis methodology</head><p>Spectral analysis, also referred to as frequency do- main analysis, is a pervasively used technique in physics, engineering, economics and social sci- ences. The key idea of it is to decompose a com- plex signal in time space into simpler components in frequency space, using mathematical operations such as Fourier transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bracewell, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>The application of spectral analysis in human language technology mainly focuses on process- ing the acoustic signals of human voice, and cap- turing the para-linguistics features relevant to cer- tain tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schuller et al., 2013</ref>). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bitouk et al. (2010)</ref> find that utterance-level spec- tral features are useful for emotion recognition. Gregory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jr and Gallagher (2002)</ref> demonstrate that spectral information beneath 0.5 kHz can predict US president election outcomes. However, we are not aware of the usage of spectral analysis in studying linguistic phenomena at higher represen- tation levels than the acoustic level.</p><p>For our study, we are looking for some tech- niques that can capture the coupling between two signals at frequency space. The nature of the sig- nal (whether it is language-related or not) should not be the first concern from the perspective of methodology. Therefore, studies outside the field of speech communication and linguistics could also be enlightening to our work.</p><p>After searching the literature, we find that the spectral analysis techniques that <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Oullier et al. (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Oullier et al. (2008)</ref> use to study the physical and social functions of human body movement are useful to our research goal. In <ref type="bibr">Oullier et al.'s (2002)</ref> work, subjects stood in a mov- ing room and were to track a target attached to the wall. A frequency space statistics, power spec- trum overlap (PSO), was used to demonstrate the coupling between motion of the room and motion of the subject's head. Stronger coupling effect (higher PSO) was found in the tracking task than a no-tracking baseline. PSO in nature quantifies how much the frequency space representations of two signals (power spectrum density) overlap. It allows us to explore the frequency space coupling of two interlocutors' entropy series in dialogue.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Oullier et al. (2008)</ref> used the metrics of peak-to-peak relative phase (RP) and PSO to study the spontaneous synchrony in behavior that emerges between interactants as a result of infor- mation exchange. The signals to be analyzed were the flexion-extension movement of index fingers of two subjects sitting in front of each other. Both metrics showed different patterns when the partici- pants see each other or not. RP, in their work, mea- sures the magnitude of delay between two signals, and it corresponds to the notion of φ in Section 1.1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Corpus data</head><p>Two corpora are examined in this study: the HCRC Map Task Corpus (A. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al., 1991</ref>) and a smaller corpus in Danish from a joint decision-making study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fusaroli et al., 2012)</ref>, henceforth DJD.</p><p>Map Task contains a set of 128 dialogues be- tween two subjects, who accomplished a cooper- ative task together. They were given two slightly different maps of imaginary landmarks. One of them plays as the instruction giver, who has routes marked on her map, and the other plays as the in- struction follower, who does not have routes. The task for them is to reproduce the giver's route on the follower's map. The participants are free to speak, but they cannot see each other's map. The whole conversations were recorded, transcribed and properly annotated. The collaborative perfor- mance in the task is measured by the PATHDEV variable, which quantifies the deviation between the paths drawn by interlocutors. Larger values indicate poorer task performance.</p><p>DJD contains a set of 16 dialogues from na- tive speakers of Danish (11,100 utterances and 56,600 words). In <ref type="bibr">Fusaroli et al.'s (2012)</ref> original study the participants were to accomplish a series of visual perception task trials, by discussing the stimuli they saw and reaching a joint decision for each trial. The collaborative performance is mea- sured by the CollectivePerformance vari- able, which is based on a psychometric function that measures the sensitivity of the dyad's joint de- cision to the actual contrast difference of the trial ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fusaroli et al., 2012)</ref>. Higher value of this vari- able indicates better task performance.</p><p>The Switchboard Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Godfrey et al., 1992</ref>) is used to train the language model for estimating the sentence entropy in Map Task. The Copen- hagen Dependency Treebanks Corpus 1 is used for the same purpose for DJD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Estimating information density in dialogue</head><p>The information density of language is estimated at the sentence level, by computing the per-word entropy of each sentence using a trigram language model trained from a different corpus. We con- sider a sentence to be a sequence of words, S = {w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n }, and the per-word entropy is es- timated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H(w 1 ...w n ) = − 1 n w i ∈W log P (w i |w 1 ...w i−1 )</formula><p>(1) where P (w i |w 1 . . . w i−1 ) is estimated by a trigram model that is trained from an outside corpus. The SRILM software <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Stolcke, 2002</ref>) is used to train the language model and to compute sentence en- tropy.</p><p>Dialogue is a sequence of utterances contributed by two interlocutors. For the k th dialogue whose total utterance number is N k , we mark it as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D k = {u k i | i = 1, 2, . . . , N k }, in which u k i</formula><p>is the i th utterance. Map Task contains annotations of sen- tence structure in utterances, and one utterance could consist of several sentences that are syn- tactically independent. Thus we further split D k into a sequence of sentence,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D k = {s k i | i = 1, 2, . . . , N k }, in which N k is number of sentences in D k .</formula><p>Since DJD lacks the sentence annotations, we do not further split the utterance sequence, and simply treat an utterance as a complete sentence.</p><p>Given a sequence {s k i } (Map Task), or {u k i } (DJD), we calculate the per-word entropy for each item in the sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H k = {H(s k i ) or H(u k i ) | i = 1, 2, . . . , N k (orN k )} (2) where H(s k i ) or H(u k i ) is computed according to Equation 1.</formula><p>Then we split the entropy series H k into two sub-series by the source of utterances (i.e., who speaks them), resulting in H A k for interlocutor A, and H B k for interlocutor B. For Map Task, the two interlocutors have distinct roles, instruction giver and follower. Thus the resulting two entropy series are H g k and H f k . These per-interlocutor entropy series will be the input of our next-step spectral analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Computing power spectrum overlap and relative phase</head><p>The time intervals between utterances (or sen- tences) vary, but since we care about the aver- age information contribution within a complete se- mantic unit, we treat entropy series as regular time series. The time scale is not measured in seconds but in turns (or sentences). For a given dialogue D k , we apply the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on its two entropy se-ries H A k and H B k , and obtain the power spectra (or, power spectral density plots) of them, P A k and P B k . The power spectra are estimated with the pe- riodogram method provided by the open source R software. The Y axis of a power spectrum is the squared amplitude of signal (or power), and X axis ranges from 0 to π/2 (we do not have sampling frequency, thus the X axis is in angular frequency but not in Hz).</p><p>The power spectrum overlap, PSO k , is calcu- lated by computing the common area under the curves of P A k and P B k is calculated, and normal- izing by the total area of the two curves (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig- ure 2)</ref>. PSO k ranges from 0 to 1, and a larger value indicates higher similarity between P A k and P B k .</p><p>Common area is directly returned by the spectrum function in R. It is a vector of real numbers that range from 0 to π, and each element represent the phase differ- ence between two signals at a particular frequency position of the spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Prerequisites of Spectral Analysis</head><p>Before proceeding to the actual analysis, we first examine whether the data we use satisfy some of the prerequisites of spectral analysis techniques. One common assumption of Fourier transforms is that the signals (time series) are stationary (Dwivedi and Subba Rao, 2011). Stationarity means that the mean, variance and other distri- butional properties do not change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Natrella, 2010</ref>). Another presumption we hold is that the entropy series contain some periodic patterns (see Section 1.1), which means their power spec- trum should differ from that of white noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Examine stationarity</head><p>We use three pervasively used statistical tests to test the stationarity of our entropy series data: the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dickey and Fuller, 1979)</ref>, the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt- Shin (KPSS) test <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kwiatkowski et al., 1992)</ref>, and the Phillips-Perron (PP) test <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Phillips and Perron, 1988)</ref>. The percentage of entropy series that pass the stationarity tests are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We can see that the majority of our data satisfy the assumption of stationarity, and thus it is valid to conduct Fourier transform on the entropy series. The stationarity property seems contradictory to the previous findings about entropy increase in written text and spoken dialogue <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Genzel and Charniak, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Genzel and Charniak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu and Reitter, 2016b</ref>), because stationarity predicts that the mean entropy stays constant over time. We examine this in our data by fitting a simple linear model with entropy as the dependent, and sentence position as the independent variable, which yields significant (marginal) effects of the latter: For Map Task, β = 2.3 × 10 −3 , p &lt; .05, Adj-R 2 = 1.7 × 10 −4 ; For DJD, β = 7.2 × 10 −5 , p = .06, Adj-R 2 = 2.2 × 10 −4 . It indicates that the stationarity of entropy series does not conflict with the entropy increasing trend predicted by the prin- ciple of ERC <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shannon, 1948)</ref>. We conjecture that stationarity satisfies because the effect size (Adj-R 2 ) of entropy increase is very small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparison with white noise</head><p>Power spectra for all entropy series are obtained with an FFT. We compare them with those of white noise. The white noise data are simulated with i.i.d. random data points that are generated from normal distributions (same means and stan- dard deviations as the actual data). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the smoothed average spectrums of the actual en- tropy data and the simulated white noise data.</p><p>White noise signals should demonstrate a con- stant power spectral density <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Narasimhan and Veena, 2005)</ref>, and if the entropy series is not completely random, then their average spectrum should be flat. Linear models show that the aver- age spectrums of the entropy data have slopes that are significantly larger than zero (For Map Task, for DJD, β = 314.1, SE = 19.8, p &lt; .001), while the slopes of the white noise data are not signifi- cantly different from zero. This confirms our pre- sumption that the entropy series of dialogue con- tains some periodic patterns that are identifiable in frequency space. We also conduct Ljung-Box test <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ljung and Box, 1978)</ref> to examine how the entropy series is different from white noise. The null hypothesis is that the time series being tested is independent of the lagged sequence of itself. The test on a white noise series will give big p-values, for any lags greater than 0, because of its randomness na- ture. We try several lags on each entropy series, and pick the smallest p-value. Consequently, we obtain a mean p-value of .23 on MapTask, and a mean p-value of .27 on DJD. Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis for all the entropy series data, but the Type-I error of considering them as different form white noise is pretty low.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Results of linear models</head><p>We compute PSO for all the dialogues in Map Task and DJD and fit two linear mod- els using PSO as predictor, with PATHDEV and CollectivePerformance as dependent vari- ables respectively.</p><p>PSO is a reliable predictor in both models (p &lt; .05). The coefficients are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Since PATHDEV is a measure of failure, but collabora- tive task performance is a measure of success, the negative correlation between PSO and collabora- tive task performance is consistent. Regression lines with residuals are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> (a) suggests a heteroscedasticity prob- lem, because the right half of data points seem to stretch up along the y axis.

To rec- tify this issue, we adopt a Box-Cox transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Box and Cox, 1964)</ref> on the dependent variable, PATHDEV, which is a typical way of handling het- eroscedasticity. The new model that uses PSO to predict the Box-Cox transformed PATHDEV also yields significant coefficients: β = 3.85, SE = 1.67, F (1, 113) = 5.32, p &lt; .05. Therefore, the correlation between PSO and PATHDEV is re- liable.</p><p>As for DJD, due to the lack of data (we only have 16 dialogues), we do not run further diagnos- tics analysis on the regression model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Discussion</head><p>The coupling of entropy series in frequency space is negatively correlated with task success. In other words, synchrony between interlocutors in terms of their information distribution hinders the suc- cess of collaboration. By "synchrony", we mean an overlap in the frequencies at which they choose to inject novel information into the conversation.</p><p>This conclusion seems contradictory to the per- spective of interactive alignment at the first glance. However, here we are starting with a very high- level model of dialogue that has does not refer to linguistic devices. Instead, we utilize the concept of "information density" and the entropy metric of natural language, to paint the picture of a system in which communicators inject novelty into the di- alogue, and that each communicator does so reg- ularly and with a set of overlapping frequencies. We assume that the rapid change of sentence en- tropy, i.e., the high frequency components in the spectrum, correspond to the moments in conversa- tion where one interlocutor brings relatively novel content to the table, such as a detailed instruc- tion, a strange question, an unexpected response etc. This assumption is reasonable because pre- vious work has shown that sudden change in en- tropy predicts topic change in dialogue <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Genzel and Charniak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Qian and Jaeger, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu and Reitter, 2016b</ref>).</p><p>We argue that higher synchrony (larger overlap in frequency space) in terms of how much nov- elty each interlocutor contributes, does not neces- sarily leads to better outcomes of communication. Rather, we would expect the correlation to be op- posite (and our empirical results confirm this), be- cause dialogue is a joint activity, in which a tak- ing on different roles as interlocutors (e.g., the one who gives orders versus the one who follows) is often required to push the activity along <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clark, 1996)</ref>. A dialogue with maximal synchrony or fre- quency overlap would be one where partners take turns at regular intervals. Perhaps because such regularity in turn-taking assigns no special roles to interlocutors, and because they engage in turn- taking with no regard for content, it is not strange that such synchrony is disadvantageous.</p><p>Let's look at several scenarios of different syn- chrony levels between interlocutors: First, high synchrony due to both interlocutors contributing large amount of new information, which means there is more overlap near the high frequency band of spectrums. In this case, they are more likely to have difficulty in comprehending each other due to the potential information overload. Situations such as arguing, or both speakers asking a lot of questions are good examples. Second, high syn- chrony due to both interlocutors providing ineffec- tive information, which indicates overlap in spec- trums near the low frequency band. Obviously this type of ineffective communication is not helpful to the collaborative task. Third, low synchrony due to one interlocutor providing more informa- tion and the other one providing less, which means the overlap in spectrums is minimum. An example of this case is that one interlocutor is saying some- thing important, while the other one is produc- ing short utterances such "uh-huh", "yes", or short questions to make sure that they are on the same page, which is known as the back-channel mecha- nism in conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Oreström, 1983)</ref>. This com- plementary style of communication allows them to build mutual understand of each other's intention, and thus reaches better collaborative performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RP Predicts Task Success</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Results of linear models</head><p>We obtain the relative phase (RP) vector (absolute values) of all frequency components, and fit linear models using the mean of RP as predictor, and task performance as the dependent variable. We get non-significant coefficients for both models: For Map Task, F (1, 113) = .004, p &gt; .05; for DJD, F (1, 14) = .772, p &gt; .05. This suggests that the phase information of all frequency components in spectrum is not very indicative of task success.</p><p>The power spectra describe the distribution of energy across the span of frequency components that compose the signal. The frequency com- ponents with higher energy (peaks in spectrum) are more dominant than those with lower energy (troughs) in determining the nature of the signal. Therefore it makes sense to only include the peak frequencies into the model, because they are more "representative" of the signal, and so the "noise" from the low energy frequencies are filtered out. Thus we obtain RP from the local peak frequency components, and use the mean, median, and max- imum values of them as predictors. It turns out that for Map Task, the maximum of RP is a sig- nificant predictor (the mean and median are left out via stepwise analysis). For DJD, the mean of RP is a significant predictor of task success (when median and maximum are included in the model). (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). From the significant effect of maximum RP in Map Task and mean RP in DJD, it is safe to state that RP is positively correlated with task per- formance. However, this relationship is not as straight-forward as PSO, because of the marginal effect at the opposite direction. A more fine- grained analysis is required, but it is outside the scope of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Discussion</head><p>The relative phase in frequency space can be un- derstood as the "lag" between signals in time space. Imagine that we align the two entropy se- ries from one dialogue onto the same time scale (just like <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), the distance between the en- tropy "peaks" is proportionate to the relative phase in frequency space. Then, the positive correlation between relative phase and task performance sug- gests that relatively large delays between entropy <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: R 2 performance on the HCRC MapTask task success prediction task (percentage of vari- ance explained). 10-fold cross-validated by dia- logue; same folds for each model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Reitter and Moore (2007)</ref>  "surges" seen in each interlocutor are beneficial to collaborative performance.</p><p>The delay of entropy surges can be understood as a strategy for an interlocutor to distribute in- formation in his or her own utterance accordingly with the information received. For example, after interlocutor A contributes a big piece of informa- tion, the other one, B, does not rush to make new substantial contributions, but instead keeps her ut- terances at low entropy until it is the proper time to take a turn to contribute. This does not have to coincide with dialogic turn-taking.</p><p>This delay gives B more time to "digest" the information provided by A, which could be an instruction that needs to be comprehended, or a question that needs to be thought about and so on. A relatively long delay guarantees enough time for interlocutors to reach mutual understanding. On the contrary, if B rushes to speak a lot shortly after the A's input, then it will probably cause informa- tion overload and be harmful to communication.</p><p>Therefore, we believe that the RP statistic cap- tures the extent to which interlocutors manage the proper "timing" of information contribution to maintain effective communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Prediction Task</head><p>Here we explore whether the frequency domain features, PSO and RP, can help with an existing framework that utilizes alignment features, such as the repetition of lexical and syntactic elements, to predict the success of dialogue in MapTask <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Reitter and Moore, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>R&amp;M described an SVM model that takes into the repetition count of lexicons (LEXREP) and syn- tax structures (SYNREP), and the length of di- alogues (LENGTH) as features. The full model achieves an R 2 score of .17, which means that it can account for 17% of the variance of task suc- cess.</p><p>We add the new PSO and RP (mean, median and maximum RP features per dialogue are included) covariates to the original SVM model. An RBF kernel (γ = 5) was used. The cost parameter C was (coarsely) tuned on different cross-validation folds to reduce overfitting on this relatively small dataset, and the R&amp;M's original full model was re- calculated (shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> as R&amp;M). Two mod- els with PSO and RP interactions (once without the alignment/repetition features) are shown for comparison. (See <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).</p><p>Significant improvement in the model's ex- planatory power, i.e., R 2 , is gained after the PSO and RP features are added. The best model we have is by adding PSO and RP as predictors with- out the interaction term (bold number in <ref type="table">Table 4)</ref>, which gives about 60% increase of R 2 compared to R&amp;M's full model. Note that even if we ex- clude the alignment features, and include only (LENGTH) and the frequency features (last row in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>), the performance also exceeds R&amp;M's full model.</p><p>The results indicate that the frequency domain features (PSO and RP) of the sentence informa- tion density can capture some hidden factors of task success that are unexplained by the alignment approach. It is not surprising that how people coordinate their information contribution matters a lot to the success of the collaboration. What we show here is that regular, repeated patterns of information-dense and information-sparse turns seem to make speakers more or less compatible with each other. Whether individuals have typi- cal patterns (frequency distributions) of informa- tion density, or whether this is a result of dynamic interaction in each particular dialogue, remains to be seen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>The empirical results of the present study suggest that examining how the information contribution from interlocutors co-develops can provide a way to understand dialogue from a higher-level per- spective, which has been missing in existing work.</p><p>Our work adds a brick to the series of endeavors on studying the linguistic and behavioral factors of successful dialogue, and for the first time (as far as we know) demonstrates quantitatively that the dy- namics of not just "what" and "how" we say, but also "how much" we say and the "timing" of dis- tributing what we say in dialogue, are relevant to the quality of communication. Although the way we model information in language is simply the entropy at lexical level, we believe the findings still reveal the nature of information production and processing in dialogue. We hope that by com- paring and combining our methodology with other approaches of studying dialogue, we can reach a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of this common yet mysterious human practice.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: How PSO is computed.
