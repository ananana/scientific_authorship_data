				<p>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a mental disorder difficult to diagnose. Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic correction of transcripts. In this paper, we mod-eled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Por-tuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks , while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for Dementia-Bank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can affect one or multiple cognitive domains (e.g. memory, language, visuospatial skills and executive func- tions), and may represent a pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The impairment that affects memory, referred to as amnestic MCI, is the most frequent, with the highest conversion rate for AD, at 15% per year versus 1 to 2% for the general population. Since dementias are chronic and progressive diseases, their early diagnosis en- sures a greater chance of success to engage pa- tients in non-pharmacological treatment strategies such as cognitive training, physical activity and socialization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Teixeira et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Language is one of the most efficient in- formation sources to assess cognitive functions. Changes in language usage are frequent in patients with dementia and are normally first recognized by the patients themselves or their family mem- bers. Therefore, the automatic analysis of dis- course production is promising in diagnosing MCI at early stages, which may address potentially re- versible factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Muangpaisan et al., 2012)</ref>. Pro- posals to detect language-related impairment in dementias include machine learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jarrold et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fraser et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fraser et al., , 2015</ref>, magnetic resonance imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dyrba et al., 2015)</ref>, and data screening tests added to demographic in- formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Weakley et al., 2015)</ref>. Discourse pro- duction (mainly narratives) is attractive because it allows the analysis of linguistic microstructures, including phonetic-phonological, morphosyntac- tic and semantic-lexical components, as well as semantic-pragmatic macrostructures.</p><p>Automated discourse analysis based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources and tools to diagnose dementias via machine learning methods has been used for English language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lehr et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jarrold et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Orimaye et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fraser et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Davy et al., 2016</ref>) and for Brazilian Portuguese <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aluísio et al., 2016)</ref>. A va- riety of features are required for this analysis, in- cluding Part-of-Speech (PoS), syntactic complex- ity, lexical diversity and acoustic features. Pro- ducing robust tools to extract these features is ex- tremely difficult because speech transcripts used in neuropsychological evaluations contain disflu- encies (repetitions, revisions, paraphasias) and patient's comments about the task being evalu- ated. Another problem in using linguistic knowl- edge is the high dependence on manually created resources, such as hand-crafted linguistic rules and/or annotated corpora. Even when traditional statistical techniques (Bag of Words or ngrams) are applied, problems still appear in dealing with disfluencies, because mispronounced words will not be counted together. Indeed, other types of dis- fluencies (repetition, amendments, patient's com- ments about the task) will be counted, thus in- creasing the vocabulary.</p><p>An approach applied successfully to several ar- eas of NLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mihalcea and Radev, 2011)</ref>, which may suffer less from the problems mentioned above, relies on the use of complex networks and graph theory. The word adjacency network model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(i Cancho and Solé, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Roxas and Tapang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Amancio et al., 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amancio, 2015b)</ref> has provided good results in text classifi- cation (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Arruda et al., 2016)</ref> and related tasks, namely author detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amancio, 2015a)</ref>, iden- tification of literary movements ( <ref type="bibr">Amancio et al., 2012c</ref>), authenticity verification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Amancio et al., 2013)</ref> and word sense discrimination ( <ref type="bibr">Amancio et al., 2012b)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we show that speech transcripts (narratives or descriptions) can be modeled into complex networks that are enriched with word em- bedding in order to better represent short texts pro- duced in these assessments. When applied to a machine learning classifier, the complex network features were able to distinguish between control participants and mild cognitive impairment partic- ipants. Discrimination of the two classes could be improved by combining complex networks with linguistic and traditional statistical features. With regard to the task of detecting MCI from transcripts, this paper is, to the best of our knowl- edge, the first to: a) show that classifiers using features extracted from transcripts modeled into complex networks enriched with word embedding present higher accuracy than using only complex networks for 3 datasets; and b) show that for lan- guages that do not have competitive dependency and constituency parsers to exploit syntactic fea- tures, e.g. Brazilian Portuguese, complex net- works enriched with word embedding constitute a source to extract new, language independent fea- tures from transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Detection of memory impairment has been based on linguistic, acoustic, and demographic features, in addition to scores of neuropsychological tests. Linguistic and acoustic features were used to auto- matically detect aphasia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fraser et al., 2014</ref>); and AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fraser et al., 2015</ref>) or dementia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Orimaye et al., 2014</ref>) in the public corpora of Dementia- Bank 1 . Other studies distinguished different types of dementia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Garrard et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jarrold et al., 2014)</ref>, in which speech samples were elicited us- ing the Picnic picture of the Western Aphasia Bat- tery <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kertesz, 1982)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Davy et al. (2016)</ref> also used the Picnic scene to detect MCI, where the subjects were asked to write (by hand) a detailed descrip- tion of the scene.</p><p>As for automatic detection of MCI in narra- tive speech,  extracted speech features and linguistic complexity measures of speech samples obtained with the Wechsler Log- ical Memory (WLM) subtest ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wechsler et al., 1997)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lehr et al. (2012)</ref> fully automatized the WLM subtest. In this test, the examiner tells a short narrative to a subject, who then retells the story to the examiner, immediately and after a 30- minute delay. WLM scores are obtained by count- ing the number of story elements recalled. <ref type="bibr">Tóth et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vincze et al. (2016)</ref> used short animated films to evaluate immediate and de- layed recalls in MCI patients who were asked to talk about the first film shown, then about their previous day, and finally about another film shown last. <ref type="bibr">Tóth et al. (2015)</ref> adopted automatic speech recognition (ASR) to extract a phonetic level seg- mentation, which was used to calculate acoustic features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vincze et al. (2016)</ref> used speech, mor- phological, semantic, and demographic features collected from their speech transcripts to automat- ically identify patients suffering from MCI.</p><p>For the Portuguese language, machine learning algorithms were used to identify subjects with AD and MCI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aluísio et al. (2016)</ref> used a variety of linguistic metrics, such as syntactic complexity, idea density (da <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cunha et al., 2015)</ref>, and text co- hesion through latent semantics. NLP tools with high precision are needed to compute these met- rics, which is a problem for Portuguese since no robust dependency or constituency parsers exist. Therefore, the transcriptions had to be manually revised; they were segmented into sentences, fol- lowing a semantic-structural criterion and capital- ization was applied. The authors also removed disfluencies and inserted omitted subjects when they were hidden, in order to reduce parsing er- rors. This process is obviously expensive, which has motivated us to use complex networks in the present study to model transcriptions and avoid a manual preprocessing step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Modeling and Characterizing Texts as Complex Networks</head><p>The theory and concepts of complex networks have been used in several NLP tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mihalcea and Radev, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cong and Liu, 2014</ref>), such as text classification (de Arruda et al., 2016), summa- rization ( <ref type="bibr">Antiqueira et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Amancio et al., 2012a</ref>) and word sense disambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Silva and Amancio, 2012)</ref>. In this study, we used the word co-occurrence model (also called word adjacency model) because most of the syntactical relations occur among neighboring words <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(i Cancho et al., 2004</ref>). Each distinct word becomes a node and words that are adjacent in the text are connected by an edge. Mathematically, a network is defined as an undirected graph G = {V, E}, formed by a set V = {v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n } of nodes (words) and a set E = {e 1 , e 2 , ..., e m } of edges (co-occurrence) that are represented by an adjacency matrix A, whose elements A ij are equal to 1 whenever there is an edge connecting nodes (words) i and j, and equal to 0 otherwise. Before modeling texts into complex networks, it is often necessary to do some preprocessing in the raw text. Preprocessing starts with tokenization where each document/text is divided into tokens (meaningful elements, e.g., words and punctua- tion marks) and then stopwords and punctuation marks are removed, since they have little seman- tic meaning. One last step we decided to eliminate from the preprocessing pipeline is lemmatization, which transforms each word into its canonical form. This decision was made based on two fac- tors. First, a recent work has shown that lemma- tization has little or no influence when network modeling is adopted in related tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Machicao et al., 2016)</ref>. Second, the lemmatization process requires part-of-speech (POS) tagging that may in- troduce undesirable noises/errors in the text, since the transcriptions in our work contain disfluencies.</p><p>Another problem with transcriptions in our work is their size. As demonstrated by Aman- cio (2015c), classification of small texts using net- works can be impaired, since short texts have al- most linear networks, and the topological mea- sures of these networks have little or no informa- tion relevant to classification. To solve this prob- lem, we adapted the approach of inducing lan- guage networks from word embeddings, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Perozzi et al. (2014)</ref> to enrich the networks with semantic information. In their work, language net- works were generated from continuous word rep- resentations, in which each word is represented by a dense, real-valued vector obtained by train- ing neural networks in the language model task (or variations, such as context prediction) <ref type="bibr">(Bengio et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collobert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mikolov et al., 2013a,b)</ref>. This structure is known to cap- ture syntactic and semantic information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Perozzi et al. (2014)</ref>, in particular, take advantage of word embeddings to build networks where each word is Following this methodology, in our model we added new edges to the co-occurrence networks considering similarities between words, that is, for all pairs of words in the text that were not con- nected, an edge was created if their vectors (from word embedding) had a cosine similarity higher than a given threshold. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of a co-occurrence network enriched by similarity links (the dotted edges). The gain in information by enriching a co-occurrence network with seman- tic information is readily apparent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">The Cookie Theft Picture Description Dataset</head><p>The clinical dataset used for the English lan- guage was created during a longitudinal study con- ducted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine on Alzheimer's and related dementia, funded by the National Institute of Aging. To be eligible for inclusion in the study, all participants were required to be above 44 years of age, have at least 7 years of education, no history of nervous system disorders nor be taking neuroleptic med- ication, have an initial Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score of 10 or greater, and be able to give informed consent. The dataset contains transcripts of verbal interviews with AD and related Demen- tia patients, including those with MCI (for further details see <ref type="bibr">(Becker et al., 1994)</ref>). We used 43 transcriptions with MCI in addi- tion to another 43 transcriptions sampled from 242 healthy elderly people to be used as the control group. For this dataset, interviews were conducted in English and narrative speech was elicited using the Cookie Theft picture ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Goodglass et al., 2001</ref>) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig- ure 3</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Goodglass et al. (2001)</ref> in Section A.1). During the interview, patients were given the pic- ture and were told to discuss everything they could see happening in the picture. The patients' ver- bal utterances were recorded and then transcribed into the CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts) transcription format <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacWhinney, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>We extracted the word-level transcript patient sentences from the CHAT files and discarded the annotations, as our goal was to create a fully au- tomated system that does not require the input of a human annotator. We automatically removed filled pauses such as uh, um , er , and ah (e.g. uh it seems to be summer out), short false starts (e.g. just t the ones ), and repetition (e.g. mother's fin- ished certain of the the dishes ), as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fraser et al., 2015</ref>). The control group had an average of 9.58 sentences per narrative, with each sentence having an average of 9.18 words; while the MCI group had an average of 10.97 sentences per narrative, with 10.33 words per sentence in average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">The Cinderella Narrative Dataset</head><p>The dataset examined in this study included 20 subjects with MCI and 20 normal elderly control subjects, as diagnosed at the Medical School of the University of São Paulo (FMUSP). <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the demographic information of the two diagnos- tic groups, which were also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aluísio et al.

Diagnostics were carried out by a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychi- atrists, geriatricians, neurologists, neuropsycholo- gists, speech pathologists, and occupational ther- apists, by a criterion of consensus. Inclusion cri- teria for the control group were elderlies with no cognitive deficits and preservation of functional capacity in everyday life. The exclusion criteria for the normal group were: poorly controlled clin- ical diseases, sensitive deficits that were not being compensated for and interfered with the perfor- mance in tests, and other neurological or psychi- atric diagnoses associated with dementia or cogni- tive deficits and use of medications in doses that affected cognition.</p><p>Speech narrative samples were elicited by hav- ing participants tell the Cinderella story; partici- pants were given as much time as they needed to examine a picture book illustrating the story <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig- ure 4</ref> in Section A). When each participant had fin- ished looking at the pictures, the examiner asked the subject to tell the story in their own words, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Saffran et al. (1989)</ref>. The time was recorded, but there was no limit imposed to the narrative length. If the participant had difficulty initiating or continuing speech, or took a long pause, an evaluator would use the stimulus question "What happens next ?", seeking to encourage the partici- pant to continue his/her narrative. When the sub- ject was unable to proceed with the narrative, the examiner asked if he/she had finished the story and had something to add. Each speech sample was recorded and then manually transcribed at the word level following the NURC/SP N. 338 EF and 331 D2 transcription norms 3 .</p><p>Other tests were applied after the narrative, in the following sequence: phonemic verbal fluency test, action verbal fluency, Camel and Cactus test <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bozeat et al., 2000</ref>), and Boston Naming test , in order to diagnose the groups.</p><p>Since our ultimate goal is to create a fully au- tomated system that does not require the input of a human annotator, we manually segmented sentences to simulate a high-quality ASR tran- script with sentence segmentation, and we auto- matically removed the disfluencies following the same guidelines of TalkBank project. However, other disfluencies (revisions, elaboration, para- phasias and comments about the task) were kept. The control group had an average of 30.80 sen- tences per narrative, and each sentence averaged 12.17 words. As for the MCI group, it had an av- erage of 29.90 sentences per narrative, and each sentence averaged 13.03 words.</p><p>We also evaluated a different version of the dataset used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aluísio et al. (2016)</ref>, where narra- tives were manually annotated and revised to im- prove parsing results. The revision process was the following: (i) in the original transcript, segments with hesitations or repetitions of more than one word or segment of a single word were annotated to become a feature and then removed from the narrative to allow the extraction of features from parsing; (ii) empty emissions, which were com- ments unrelated to the topic of narration or con- firmations, such as "né" (alright), were also an- notated and removed; (iii) prolongations of vow- els, short pauses and long pauses were also an- notated and removed; and (iv) omitted subjects in sentences were inserted. In this revised dataset, the control group had an average of 45.10 sen- tences per narrative, and each sentence averaged 8.17 words. The MCI group had an average of 31.40 sentences per narrative, with each sentence averaging 10.91 words.</p></div>

In order to carry out experiments with a balanced corpus, as with the previous two datasets, we excluded seven tran- scriptions from the MCI group.

The subject then retold the narrative to the examiner twice: once immediately upon hearing it and again after a 30-minute delay ( <ref type="bibr">Bayles and Tomoeda, 1991)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Linguistic Features</head><p>Linguistic features for classification of neuropsy- chological assessments have been used in sev- eral studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jarrold et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fraser et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Orimaye et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fraser et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vincze et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Davy et al., 2016)</ref>. We used the Coh-Metrix <ref type="bibr">4 (Graesser et al., 2004</ref>) tool to extract features from En- glish transcripts, resulting in 106 features. The metrics are divided into eleven categories: De- scriptive, Text Easability Principal Component, Referential Cohesion, Latent Semantic Analy- sis (LSA), Lexical Diversity, Connectives, Situa- tion Model, Syntactic Complexity, Syntactic Pat- tern Density, Word Information, and Readabil- ity (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coh-Metrix L2 Readability).</p><p>For Portuguese, Coh-Metrix-Dementia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aluísio et al., 2016</ref>) was used. The metrics affected by constituency and dependency parsing were not used because they are not robust with disfluen- cies. Metrics based on manual annotation (such as proportion short pauses, mean pause dura- tion, mean number of empty words, and others) were also discarded. The metrics of Coh-Metrix- Dementia are divided into twelve categories: Am- biguity, Anaphoras, Basic Counts, Connectives, Co-reference Measures, Content Word Frequen- cies, Hypernyms, Logic Operators, Latent Seman- tic Analysis, Semantic Density, Syntactical Com- plexity, and Tokens. The metrics used are shown in detail in Section A.2. In total, 58 metrics were used, from the 73 available on the website 5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Bag of Words</head><p>The representation of text collections under the BoW assumption (i.e., with no information relat- ing to word order) has been a robust solution for text classification. In this methodology, transcripts are represented by a table in which the columns represent the terms (or existing words) in the tran- scripts and the values represent frequency of a term in a document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Classification Algorithms</head><p>In order to quantify the ability of the topologi- cal characterization of networks, linguistic met- rics and BoW features were used to distinguish subjects with MCI from healthy controls. We employed four machine learning algorithms to induce classifiers from a training set. These techniques were the Gaussian Naive Bayes (G- NB), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vec- tor Machine (SVM), linear and radial bases func- tions (RBF), and Random Forest (RF). We also combined these classifiers through ensemble and multi-view learning. In ensemble learning, multi- ple models/classifiers are generated and combined using a majority vote or the average of class prob- abilities to produce a single result <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Zhou, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In multi-view learning, multiple classifiers are trained in different feature spaces and thus com- bined to produce a single result. This approach is an elegant solution in comparison to combining all features in the same vector or space, for two main reasons. First, combination is not a straight- forward step and may lead to noise insertion since the data have different natures. Second, using dif- ferent classifiers for each feature space allows for different weights to be given for each type of fea- ture, and these weights can be learned by a regres- sion method to improve the model. In this work, we used majority voting to combine different fea- ture spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>All experiments were conducted using the Scikit- learn <ref type="bibr">6 (Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref>, with classifiers evaluated on the basis of classification accuracy i.e. the total proportion of narratives which were correctly classified. The evaluation was per- formed using 5-fold cross-validation instead of the well-accepted 10-fold cross-validation because the datasets in our study were small and the test set would have shrunk, leading to less precise mea- surements of accuracy. The threshold parameter was optimized with the best values being 0.7 in the Cookie Theft dataset and 0.4 in both the Cin- derella and ABCD datasets.</p><p>We used the model proposed by <ref type="bibr">Bojanowski et al. (2016)</ref> with default parameters (100 di- mensional embeddings, context window equal to 5 and 5 epochs) to generate word embedding. We trained the models in Portuguese and English Wikipedia dumps from October and November 2016 respectively.</p><p>The accuracy in classification is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables  4 through 6</ref>. CN, CNE, LM, and BoW denote, respectively, complex networks, complex network enriched with embedding, linguistic metrics and Bag of Words, and CNE-LM, CNE-BoW, LM- BoW and CNE-LM-BoW refer to combinations of the feature spaces (multiview learning), using the majority vote. Cells with the "-" sign mean that it was not possible to apply majority voting be- cause there were two classifiers. The last line rep- resents the use of an ensemble of machine learning algorithms, in which the combination used was the majority voting in both ensemble and multiview learning.</p><p>In general, CNE outperforms the approach us- ing only complex networks (CN), while SVM (Linear or RBF kernel) provides higher accuracy than other machine learning algorithms. The re- sults for the three datasets show that characteriz- ing transcriptions into complex networks is com- petitive with other traditional methods, such as the use of linguistic metrics. In fact, among the three types of features, using enriched networks (CNE) provided the highest accuracies in two datasets (Cookie Theft and original Cinderella). For the ABCD dataset, which contains short narratives, the small length of the transcriptions may have had an effect, since BoW features led to the high- est accuracy. In the case of the revised Cinderella dataset, segmented into sentences and capitalized as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aluísio et al. (2016)</ref>, <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows that the manual revision was an important factor, since the highest accuracies were obtained with the approach based on linguistic metrics (LM). However, this process of manually removing dis- fluencies demands time; therefore it is not practi- cal for large-scale assessments.</p><p>Ensemble and multi-view learning were helpful for the Cookie Theft dataset, in which multi-view learning achieved the highest accuracy (65% of ac- curacy for narrative texts, a 3% of improvement compared to the best individual classifier). How- ever, neither multi-view or ensemble learning en- hanced accuracy in the Cinderella dataset, where SVM-RBF with CNE space achieved the highest accuracy (65%). For the ABCD dataset, multi- view CNE-LM-BoW with SVM-RBF and KNN classifiers improved the accuracy to 4% and 2%, respectively. Somewhat surprising were the results of SVM with linear kernel in BoW feature space (75% of accuracy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this study, we employed metrics of topological properties of CN in a machine learning classifica- tion approach to distinguish between healthy pa- tients and patients with MCI. To the best of our knowledge, these metrics have never been used to detect MCI in speech transcripts; CN were enriched with word embeddings to better repre- sent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The topological properties of CN outperform traditional linguistic metrics in indi- vidual classifiers' results. Linguistic features de- pend on grammatical texts to present good re- sults, as can be seen in the results of the manu- ally processed Cinderella dataset <ref type="table">(Table 7)</ref>. Fur- thermore, we found that combining machine and multi-view learning can improve accuracy. The accuracies found here are comparable to the val- ues reported by other authors, ranging from 60% to 85% <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Prud'hommeaux and Roark, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lehr et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tóth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vincze et al., 2016)</ref>, which means that it is not easy to distinguish be- tween healthy subjects and those with cognitive impairments. The comparison with our results is not straightforward, though, because the databases used in the studies are different. There is a clear need for publicly available datasets to compare different methods, which would optimize the de- tection of MCI in elderly people.</p><p>In future work, we intend to explore other meth- ods to enrich CN, such as the Recurrent Language Model, and use other metrics to characterize an ad- jacency network. The pursuit of these strategies is relevant because language is one of the most ef- ficient information sources to evaluate cognitive functions, commonly used in neuropsychological assessments. As this work is ongoing, we will keep collecting new transcriptions of the ABCD retelling subtest to increase the corpus size and obtain more reliable results in our studies. Our final goal is to apply neuropsychological assess- ment batteries, such as the ABCD retelling sub- test, to mobile devices, specifically tablets. This adaptation will enable large-scale applications in hospitals and facilitate the maintenance of appli- cation history in longitudinal studies, by storing the results in databases immediately after the test application.</p><p>Classifier CN CNE LM BoW CNE-LM CNE-BoW LM-BoW CNE-LM-BoW <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">SVM-Linear  52  55  56  59  - - - 60  SVM-RBF  56  62  58  60  - - - 65  k-NN  59  61  46  57  - - - 59  RF  52  47  45  48  - - - 50  G-NB  51  48  56  55  - - - 50  Ensemble  56  60  54  58  57  60</ref> 63 65    <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Classification accuracy achieved on Cin- derella dataset manually processed to revise non- grammatical sentences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> is Cookie Theft picture, which was used in DementiaBank project. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> is a sequence of pictures from the Cin- derella story, which were used to elicit speech nar- ratives.  </p></div>
