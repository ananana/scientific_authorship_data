			<abstract>
				<p>In addition to the positive and negative sentiments expressed by speakers, opinions on the web also convey suggestions. Such text comprise of advice, recommendations and tips on a variety of points of interest. We propose that suggestions can be extracted from the available opinionated text and put to several use cases. The problem has been identified only recently as a viable task, and there is a lot of scope for research in the direction of problem definition, datasets, and methods. From an abstract view, standard algorithms for tasks like sentence classification and keyphrase extraction appear to be usable for suggestion mining. However , initial experiments reveal that there is a need for new methods, or variations in the existing ones for addressing the problem specific challenges. We present a research proposal which divides the problem into three main research questions; we walk through them, presenting our analysis , results, and future directions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Online text is becoming an increasingly popular source to acquire public opinions towards entities like persons, products, services, brands, events, social debates etc. State of the art opinion mining systems primarily utilise this plethora of opinions to provide summary of positive and negative sen- timents towards entities or topics. We stress that opinions also encompass suggestions, tips, and ad- vice, which are often explicitly sought by stake- holders. We collaboratively refer to this kind of information as suggestions. Suggestions about a variety of topics of interest may be found on opin- ion platforms like reviews, blogs, social media, and discussion forums. These suggestions, once detected and extracted, could be exploited in nu- merous ways. In the case of commercial entities, suggestions present among the reviews can con- vey ideas for improvements to the brand owners, or tips and advice to customers.</p><p>Suggestion extraction can also be employed for the summarisation of dedicated suggestion fo- rums <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . People often provide the context in such posts, which gets repetitive over a large number of posts. Suggestion mining methods can identify the exact textual unit in the post where a suggestion is conveyed. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides examples of suggestions found in opinion mining datasets. In our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Negi and Buitelaar, 2015b)</ref>, we showed that sug- gestions do not always possess a particular senti- ment polarity. Thus the detection of suggestions in the text goes beyond the scope of sentiment po- larity detection, while complements its use cases at the same time.</p><p>In the recent past, suggestions have gained the attention of the research community. However, most of the related work so far performs a binary classification of sentences into suggestions or non- suggestions, where suggestions are defined as the sentences which propose improvements in a re- viewed entity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brun and Hagege, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ramanand et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dong et al., 2013</ref>). These studies an- notated datasets accordingly and developed sys- tems for the detection of only these type of sug- gestions; and performed an in-domain evaluation of the classifier models on these datasets.</p><p>We emphasise that in addition to the classi- fication tasks performed earlier, there are a lot more aspects associated with the problem, includ- ing a well-formed and consistent problem defini-tion. We divide the study of suggestion mining into three guiding aspects or research questions: 1) Definition of suggestions in the context of sug- gestion mining, 2) Their automatic detection from opinionated text, and 3) Their representation and summarisation.</p><p>A comprehensive research on suggestion min- ing demands the problem specific adaptation and integration of common NLP tasks, like text classi- fication, keyphrase extraction, sequence labelling, text similarity etc. Last but not least, recent progress in the adaptation of deep learning based methods for NLP tasks opens up various possibil- ities to employ them for suggestion mining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Research Problem</head><p>A broad statement of our research problem would be, mining expressions of suggestions from opin- ionated text. There are several aspects of the prob- lem which can lead to a number of research ques- tions. We identify three broad research questions which are the guiding map for our PhD research.</p><p>• Research Question 1 (RQ1): How do we define suggestions in suggestion mining?</p><p>• Research Question 2 (RQ2): How do we detect suggestions in a given text ?</p><p>• Research Question 3 (RQ3): How can sugges- tions be represented and summarised ?</p><p>The following sections will give a more detailed description of these aspects, including the prelim- inary results, challenges, and future directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Research Methodology</head><p>In this section we address each of the research questions, our findings so far, and the future di- rections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">RQ1: Suggestion Definition</head><p>The first sense of suggestion as listed in the ox- ford dictionary is, an idea or plan put forward for consideration, and the listed synonyms are proposal, proposition, recommendation, advice, counsel, hint, tip, clue etc. This definition, how- ever needs to be defined on a more fine grained level, in order to perform manual and automatic labelling of a text as an expression of suggestion. There have been variations in the definition of suggestions targeted by the related works, which renders the system performances from some of the works incomparable to the others. We identify three parameters which can lead us to a well-formed task definition of suggestions for suggestion mining task: What is the unit of a suggestion, who is the intended receiver, and whether the suggestion is expressed explicitly or not.</p><p>Unit: Currently, we consider sentence as a unit of suggestion, which is in-line with related works. However, it was observed that some sentences tend to be very long, where suggestion markers are present in only one of the constituent clauses. For example: When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the web- site. In this sentence, although the full sentence provides context, the suggestion is identifiable from the last clause. It is common to witness such non-uniform choice of punctuation in online content. Considering this, we intend to build classification models which can identify the exact clause/phrase where a suggestion is expressed, despite of individual instances being sentences.</p><p>Receiver: Different applications of suggestion mining may target different kinds of suggestions, which can differ on the basis of intended receiver. For example, in domains like online reviews, there are two types of intended receivers, brand owners, and fellow customers. Therefore, suggestions need to be defined on the basis of the intended receivers.</p><p>How is a suggestion expressed: The first round of suggestion labelling performed by us resulted in a very low inter-annotator agreement, i.e. a kappa score of 0.4 -0.5. It was observed that given a layman definition of suggestions, humans do not distinguish between explicit and implicit forms of suggestions, since they can inherently infer suggestions from their implicit forms. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the two forms. Specifically, in the case of domains like reviews, annotators mostly disagreed on whether the implicit ones are suggestions or not. We define an explicit suggestion as the text which directly proposes, recommends, or advices an action or an entity; whereas the implicit ones provide the information <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Implicit and explicit forms of sugges- tions from which the suggested action or entity can be inferred. In remainder of the paper, we refer to explicit suggestions as suggestions.</p><p>We observe that certain linguistic properties consistently mark suggestions across different datasets <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. One such phenomenon is im- perative and subjunctive mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Negi and Buitelaar, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Negi and Buitelaar, 2015b</ref>). The presence of these properties makes it more likely, but does not guarantee a text to be a suggestion. Another linguistic property is speech act <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Searle, 1969)</ref>. Speech act is a well studied area of com- putational linguistics, and several typologies for speech acts exist in literature, some of which con- sider suggestions as a speech act (Zhang et al., 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">RQ2: Suggestion Detection</head><p>The problem of suggestion detection in a big dataset of opinions can be defined as a sentence classification problem: Given a set S of sentences {s 1 ,s 2 ,s 3 ,...,s n }, predict a label l i for each sen- tence in S, where l i ∈ {suggestion, non sugges- tion}.</p><p>The task of suggestion detection rests on the hy- pothesis that a large amount of opinionated text about a given entity or topic is likely to contain suggestions which could be useful to the stake- holders for that entity or topic. This hypothesis has been proven to be true when sentences from reviews and tweets about commercial entities were manually labeled <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Also, the survey pre- sented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asher et al. (2009)</ref> shows that although in a low proportion, opinionated texts do contain expressions of advice and recommendations.</p><p>The required datasets for suggestion based sentence classification task are a set of sen- tences which are labelled as suggestion and non-suggestion, where the labeled suggestions should be explicitly expressed.</p><p>Existing Datasets: Some datasets on sug- gestions for product improvement are unavailable due to their industrial ownership. To the best of our knowledge, only the below mentioned datasets are publicly available from the previous studies: 1) Tweet dataset about Microsoft phones: com- prises of labeled tweets which give suggestions about product improvement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dong et al., 2013</ref>). Due to the short nature of tweets, suggestions are labeled at the tweet level, rather than the sentence level.</p><p>2) Travel advice dataset: comprises of sentences from discussion threads labeled as advice <ref type="bibr">(Wicaksono and Myaeng, 2013)</ref>. We observe that the statements of facts (implicit suggestions/advice) are also tagged as advice in this dataset, for example, The temperature may reach upto 40 degrees in summer. Therefore, we re-labeled the dataset with the annotation guidelines for explicit suggestions, which reduced the number of positive instances from 2192 to 1314. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> lists the statistics of these datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduced Datasets:</head><p>In our previous work (Negi and Buitelaar, 2015b), we prepared two datasets from hotel and electronics reviews <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref> where suggestions targeted to the fellow customers are labeled. Similar to the existing Microsoft tweets dataset, the number of suggestions are very low in these datasets. As stated previously, we also formulate annotation guidelines for the explicit expression of sugges- tions, which led to a kappa score of upto 0.86 as the inter-annotator agreement. In another work (Negi et al., 2016), we further identify possible domains and collection methods, which are likely to provide suggestion rich datasets for training statistical classifiers. 1) Customer posts from a publicly accessible suggestion forums for the products Feedly mobile app 2 , and Windows App studio 3 . We crawled</p><note type="other">Source, En- tity/Topic Sentence Intended Re- ceiver Sentiment Linguistic Properties</note><p>Reviews, Electron- ics I would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sentence Classification:</head><p>Conventional text classification approaches, including, rule based classifiers, and SVM based classifiers have been previously used for this task. We employ these two approaches on all the available datasets as baselines. In addition to the in-domain training and evaluation of statistical classifiers, we also perform a cross-domain training and evaluation. The reason for performing a cross domain training experiment is that the suggestions possess similar linguistic properties irrespective of the domain <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Since, it is expensive to prepare dedi- cated training dataset for each domain or use case, we aim for domain independent classification models.</p><p>We performed a first of its kind study of the employability of neural network architectures like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convo- lutional Neural Nets (CNN) for suggestion detec- tion. The F-scores for positive class are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. A neural network based approach seems to be promising compared to the baseline approaches, specifically in the case of domain in- dependent training. Our intuition is that the ability of word embeddings to capture semantic and syn- tactic knowledge, as well as the ability of LSTM to capture word dependencies are the contributing factors to this.</p><p>There is a lot of scope for improvement in the current results. One challenge is that the sen- tences are often longer, whereas the suggestion is present only as a phrase or clause. Therefore, a future direction is to explore sequential classi- fication approaches in this regard, where we can tag sentences at the word level, and train the clas- sifiers to predict binary labels corresponding to whether a word is a part of suggestion or not. For example, My 1 recommendation 1 is 1 to 1 wait 1 on 1 buying 1 one 1 from 1 this 1 com- pany 1 as 0 they 0 will 0 surely 0 get 0 sent 0 a 0 message 0 of 0 many 0 returned 0 dvd 0 play- ers 0 after 0 christmas 0. LSTM NNs have also been proven to be a good choice for sequence la- belling tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Huang et al., 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Suggestion Representation and Summarisation</head><p>In order to apply suggestion mining to real life applications, a more structured representation of suggestions might be required. After the extrac- tion of suggestion sentences from large datasets, there should be a way to cluster suggestions, link them to relevant topics and entities, and sum- marise them. One way of achieving this is to fur- ther extract information from these sentences, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. We start with the task of extracting the cen- tral phrase from a suggestion, which either cor- responds to a recommended entity or a suggested action. As a first step in this direction, we experi- mented with keyphrase extraction. Keyphrase ex- traction has been mainly used for the detection of topical information, and is therefore noun-based    <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hasan and Ng, 2014</ref>). As <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows, we also need to detect verb based keyphrases in the case of advice or action based suggestions, however a noun based keyphrase would work in the case of suggestions which recommend an entity.</p><note type="other">Dataset Intended receiver No. of sugges- tions F1 score Rules SVM LSTM CNN In-domain Evaluation Hotel</note><p>In the <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>, we show the examples of keyphrases extracted using TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) algorithm on 3 different re- view datasets, i.e. ebook reader, camera, and ho- tel. TextRank and almost all of the keyphrase extraction algorithms rely on the occurrence and co-occurrence of candidate keyphrases (noun phrases) in a given corpus. We ran TextRank on the reviews and obtained a set of keyphrase. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows whether the central phrases con- tained in a suggestion from the dataset were de- tected as a keyphrase by the algorithm or not. In the case of suggestion for improvement i.e. sentence 1, TextRank is able to capture relevant noun keyphrases. This can be attributed to a large number of sentences in the corpus which mention price, which is an important aspect of the reviewed entity. However, in the case of suggestions which are addressed to the other customers, reviewers of- ten speak about aspects which do not appear fre- quently in reviews. This can be observed in sen- tence 2 and 3, where the keyphrase were not de- tected.</p><p>We plan to include keyphrase annotations to the sequence labels mentioned in section 3.2, in order to identify the suggestions as well as the keyphrases within those suggestions at the same time.</p><p>After the representation of suggestions in the proposed format, we plan to use the methods for text similarity and relatedness in order to cluster similar suggestions.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, all of the related work so far focussed on research question 2, i.e. detection of suggestions in a given text. In recent years, only a limited number of experiments have been performed in this regard, all of which frame the task as a sentence classification task. Suggestion Detection: Ramanand et al. (2010) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brun et al. (2013)</ref> employed manually crafted linguistic rules to identify suggestions for product improvement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dong et al. (2013)</ref> performed clas- sification of given tweets about Microsoft Win- dows' phone as suggestions for improvement or not. <ref type="bibr">Wicaksono et al. (Wicaksono and Myaeng, 2013</ref>) detected advice containing sentences from travel related discussion threads. They employed sequential classifiers, based on Hidden Markov Model, and Conditional Random Fields. Most of the datasets are not available, and annotations for the available datasets are ambiguous with no de- tailed definition of what is considered as a sugges- tion or advice. Text Classification using deep learning: Recent advances in the application of Neural Networks (NNs) to NLP tasks demonstrate their effective- ness in some of the text classification problems, like sentiment classification, pos tagging, and se- mantic categorisation. Long Short Term Mem- ory NNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Graves, 2012)</ref>, and Convolutional NNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Kim, 2014)</ref> are the two most popular neural net- work architectures in this regard. An end to end combination of CNN and LSTM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Zhou et al., 2015</ref>) has also shown improved results for senti- ment analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this work we presented a research plan on sug- gestion mining. The problem in itself introduces a novel information mining task. Several useful datasets have already been released, with more to come. The related work in this direction is very limited, and has so far focussed on only one aspect of the problem. Our proposal proposes research contributions in three research aspects/questions, and presents initial results and analysis.</p><p>Since suggestions tend to exhibit similar lin- guistic structure, irrespective of topics and in- tended receiver of the suggestions, there is a scope of learning domain independent models for sug- gestion detection. Therefore, we test the discussed approaches both in a domain-independent setting as well, in order to test the domain-independence of models learnt in these approaches. Neural net- works in general outperformed the results on ex- isting test datasets, in both domain dependent and independent training. In light of these findings, building neural network based classification archi- tectures for intra-domain feature learning can be an interesting future direction for us.</p><p>The results also point towards the challenges and complexity of the task of suggestion mining. Building word level suggestion tagged datasets seems to be a promising direction in this regard, which can simultaneously address the tasks of sug- gestion detection and as keyphrase extraction for suggestion mining.</p><p>Our research findings and datasets can also be employed to similar problems, like classifica- tion of speech acts, summarisation, verb based keyphrase extraction, and cross domain classifica- tion model learning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>appeared as top unigram features in our SVM based classification experiments.
