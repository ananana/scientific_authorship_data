				<p>Existing knowledge-based question answering systems often rely on small annotated training data. While shallow methods like relation extraction are robust to data scarcity, they are less expressive than the deep meaning representation methods like semantic parsing, thereby failing at answering questions involving multiple constraints. Here we alleviate this problem by empowering a relation extraction method with additional evidence from Wikipedia. We first present a neural network based relation extractor to retrieve the candidate answers from Freebase, and then infer over Wikipedia to validate these answers. Experiments on the WebQuestions question answering dataset show that our method achieves an F 1 of 53.3%, a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Since the advent of large structured knowledge bases (KBs) like Freebase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bollacker et al., 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007)</ref>, answering natural language questions using those structured KBs, also known as KB- based question answering (or KB-QA), is attract- ing increasing research efforts from both natural language processing and information retrieval com- munities.</p><p>The state-of-the-art methods for this task can be roughly categorized into two streams. The first is based on semantic parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kwiatkowski et al., 2013)</ref>, which typically learns a grammar that can parse natural language to a so- phisticated meaning representation language. But such sophistication requires a lot of annotated train- ing examples that contains compositional struc- tures, a practically impossible solution for large KBs such as Freebase. Furthermore, mismatches between grammar predicted structures and KB structure is also a common problem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kwiatkowski et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Berant and Liang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Reddy et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, instead of building a for- mal meaning representation, information extraction methods retrieve a set of candidate answers from KB using relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Yao and Van Durme, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yih et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yao, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bast and Haussmann, 2015</ref>) or distributed representations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bordes et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dong et al., 2015)</ref>. Designing large training datasets for these methods is relatively easy <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Yao and Van Durme, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bordes et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Serban et al., 2016</ref>). These methods are often good at producing an answer irrespective of their correct- ness. However, handling compositional questions that involve multiple entities and relations, still re- mains a challenge. Consider the question what mountain is the highest in north america. Relation extraction methods typically answer with all the mountains in North America because of the lack of sophisticated representation for the mathematical function highest. To select the correct answer, one has to retrieve all the heights of the mountains, and sort them in descending order, and then pick the first entry. We propose a method based on textual evidence which can answer such questions without solving the mathematic functions implicitly.</p><p>Knowledge bases like Freebase capture real world facts, and Web resources like Wikipedia pro- vide a large repository of sentences that validate or support these facts. For example, a sentence in Wikipedia says, Denali (also known as Mount McKinley, its former official name) is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190 m) above sea level.</p><p>To answer our example question against a KB us- ing a relation extractor, we can use this sentence as external evidence, filter out wrong answers and pick the correct one.</p><p>Using textual evidence not only mitigates rep- resentational issues in relation extraction, but also alleviates the data scarcity problem to some extent. Consider the question, who was queen isabella's mother. Answering this question involves predict- ing two constraints hidden in the word mother. One constraint is that the answer should be the parent of Isabella, and the other is that the answer's gen- der is female. Such words with multiple latent constraints have been a pain-in-the-neck for both semantic parsing and relation extraction, and re- quires larger training data (this phenomenon is coined as sub-lexical compositionality by ). Most systems are good at trigger- ing the parent constraint, but fail on the other, i.e., the answer entity should be female. Whereas the textual evidence from Wikipedia, . . . her mother was Isabella of Barcelos . . . , can act as a further constraint to answer the question correctly.</p><p>We present a novel method for question answer- ing which infers on both structured and unstruc- tured resources. Our method consists of two main steps as outlined in §2. In the first step we extract answers for a given question using a structured KB (here Freebase) by jointly performing entity link- ing and relation extraction ( §3). In the next step we validate these answers using an unstructured resource (here Wikipedia) to prune out the wrong answers and select the correct ones ( §4). Our evalu- ation results on a benchmark dataset WebQuestions show that our method outperforms existing state-of- the-art models. Details of our experimental setup and results are presented in §5. Our code, data and results can be downloaded from https://github. com/syxu828/QuestionAnsweringOverFB. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> gives an overview of our method for the question "who did shaq first play for". We have two main steps: (1) inference on Freebase (KB-QA box); and (2) further inference on Wikipedia (An- swer Refinement box). Let us take a close look into step 1. Here we perform entity linking to identify a topic entity in the question and its possible Free- base entities. We employ a relation extractor to predict the potential Freebase relations that could exist between the entities in the question and the answer entities. Later we perform a joint inference step over the entity linking and relation extraction <ref type="bibr">who</ref>   results to find the best entity-relation configura- tion which will produce a list of candidate answer entities. In the step 2, we refine these candidate answers by applying an answer refinement model which takes the Wikipedia page of the topic entity into consideration to filter out the wrong answers and pick the correct ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our Method</head><p>While the overview in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> works for ques- tions containing single Freebase relation, it also works for questions involving multiple Freebase relations. Consider the question who plays anakin skywalker in star wars 1. The actors who are the an- swers to this question should satisfy the following constraints: (1) the actor played anakin skywalker; and (2) the actor played in star wars 1. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bao et al. (2014)</ref>, we design a dependency tree- based method to handle such multi-relational ques- tions. We first decompose the original question into a set of sub-questions using syntactic patterns which are listed in Appendix. The final answer set of the original question is obtained by intersecting the answer sets of all its sub-questions. For the example question, the sub-questions are who plays anakin skywalker and who plays in star wars 1. These sub-questions are answered separately over Freebase and Wikipedia, and the intersection of their answers to these sub-questions is treated as the final answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Inference on Freebase</head><p>Given a sub-question, we assume the question word 1 that represents the answer has a distinct KB relation r with an entity e found in the question, and predict a single KB triple (e, r, ?) for each sub- question (here ? stands for the answer entities). The QA problem is thus formulated as an information extraction problem that involves two sub-tasks, i.e., entity linking and relation extraction. We first in- troduce these two components, and then present a joint inference procedure which further boosts the overall performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Entity Linking</head><p>For each question, we use hand-built sequences of part-of-speech categories to identify all possi- ble named entity mention spans, e.g., the sequence NN (shaq) may indicate an entity. For each men- tion span, we use the entity linking tool S-MART 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yang and Chang, 2015)</ref> to retrieve the top 5 en- tities from Freebase. These entities are treated as candidate entities that will eventually be disam- biguated in the joint inference step. For a given mention span, S-MART first retrieves all possi- ble entities of Freebase by surface matching, and then ranks them using a statistical model, which is trained on the frequency counts with which the surface form occurs with the entity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Relation Extraction</head><p>We now proceed to identify the relation between the answer and the entity in the question. Inspired by the recent success of neural network models in KB question-answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dong et al., 2015)</ref>, and the success of syntactic dependen- cies for relation extraction ( , we propose a Multi-Channel Convo- lutional Neural Network (MCCNN) which could exploit both syntactic and sentential information for relation extraction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">MCCNNs for Relation Classification</head><p>In MCCNN, we use two channels, one for syn- tactic information and the other for sentential in- formation. The network structure is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Convolution layer tackles an input of varying length returning a fixed length vector (we use max pooling) for each channel. These fixed length vectors are concatenated and then fed into a softmax classifier, the output dimension of which is equal to the number of predefined relation types. The value of each dimension indicates the confi- dence score of the corresponding relation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Syntactic Features</head><p>We use the shortest path be- tween an entity mention and the question word in the dependency tree 3 as input to the first channel. Similar to , we treat the path as a concatenation of vectors of words, dependency edge directions and dependency labels, and feed it to the convolution layer. Note that, the entity mention and the question word are excluded from the dependency path so as to learn a more general relation representation in syntactic level. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, the dependency path between who and shaq is ← dobj -play -nsubj →.</p><p>Sentential Features This channel takes the words in the sentence as input excluding the ques- tion word and the entity mention. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, the vectors for did, first, play and for are fed into this channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Objective Function and Learning</head><p>The model is learned using pairs of question and its corresponding gold relation from the training data. Given an input question x with an annotated entity mention, the network outputs a vector o(x), where the entry o k (x) is the probability that there exists the k-th relation between the entity and the expected answer. We denote t(x) ∈ R K×1 as the target distribution vector, in which the value for the gold relation is set to 1, and others to 0. We compute the cross entropy error between t(x) and o(x), and further define the objective function over the training data as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J(θ) = − x K k=1 t k (x) log o k (x) + λ||θ|| 2 2</formula><p>where θ represents the weights, and λ the L2 reg- ularization parameters. The weights θ can be ef- ficiently computed via back-propagation through network structures. To minimize J(θ), we apply stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Joint Entity Linking &amp; Relation Extrac- tion</head><p>A pipeline of entity linking and relation extraction may suffer from error propagations. As we know, entities and relations have strong selectional prefer- ences that certain entities do not appear with certain relations and vice versa. Locally optimized models could not exploit these implicit bi-directional pref- erences. Therefore, we use a joint model to find a globally optimal entity-relation assignment from local predictions. The key idea behind is to lever- age various clues from the two local models and the KB to rank a correct entity-relation assignment higher than other combinations. We describe the learning procedure and the features below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Learning</head><p>Suppose the pair (e gold , r gold ) represents the gold entity/relation pair for a question q. We take all our entity and relation predictions for q, create a list of entity and relation pairs {(e 0 , r 0 ), (e 1 , r 1 ), ..., (e n , r n )} from q and rank them using an SVM rank classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Joachims, 2006</ref>) which is trained to predict a rank for each pair. Ide- ally higher rank indicates the prediction is closer to the gold prediction. For training, SVM rank classifier requires a ranked or scored list of entity- relation pairs as input. We create the training data containing ranked input pairs as follows: if both e pred = e gold and r pred = r gold , we assign it with a score of 3. If only the entity or relation equals to the gold one (i.e., e pred = e gold , r pred = r gold or e pred = e gold , r pred = r gold ), we assign a score of 2 (encouraging partial overlap). When both en- tity and relation assignments are wrong, we assign a score of 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Features</head><p>For a given entity-relation pair, we extract the fol- lowing features which are passed as an input vector to the SVM ranker above:</p><p>Entity Clues. We use the score of the predicted entity returned by the entity linking system as a feature. The number of word overlaps between the entity mention and entity's Freebase name is also included as a feature. In Freebase, most entities have a relation fb:description which describes the entity. For instance, in the running example, shaq is linked to three potential entities m.06 ttvh (Shaq Vs. Television Show), m.05n7bp (Shaq Fu Video Game) and m.012xdf (Shaquille O'Neal). Interest- ingly, the word play only appears in the description of Shaquille O'Neal and it occurs three times. We count the content word overlap between the given question and the entity's description, and include it as a feature.</p><p>Relation Clues. The score of relation returned by the MCCNNs is used as a feature. Furthermore, we view each relation as a document which consists of the training questions that this relation is expressed in. For a given question, we use the sum of the tf-idf scores of its words with respect to the relation as a feature. A Freebase relation r is a concatenation of a series of fragments r = r 1 .r 2 .r 3 . For instance, the three fragments of people.person.parents are people, person and parents. The first two fragments indicate the Freebase type of the subject of this re- lation, and the third fragment indicates the object type, in our case the answer type. We use an indica- tor feature to denote if the surface form of the third fragment (here parents) appears in the question.</p><p>Answer Clues. The above two feature classes in- dicate local features. From the entity-relation (e, r) pair, we create the query triple (e, r, ?) to retrieve the answers, and further extract features from the answers. These features are non-local since we re- quire both e and r to retrieve the answer. One such feature is using the co-occurrence of the answer type and the question word based on the intuition that question words often indicate the answer type, e.g., the question word when usually indicates the answer type type.datetime. Another feature is the number of answer entities retrieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Inference on Wikipedia</head><p>We use the best ranked entity-relation pair from the above step to retrieve candidate answers from Freebase. In this step, we validate these answers using Wikipedia as our unstructured knowledge resource where most statements in it are verified for factuality by multiple people. Our refinement model is inspired by the intuition of how people refine their answers. If you ask someone: who did shaq first play for, and give them four candidate answers (Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Orlando Magic and Miami Heat), as well as access to Wikipedia, that person might first determine that the question is about Shaquille O'Neal, then go to O'Neal 's Wikipedia page, and search for the sentences that contain the candidate answers as evidence. By analyzing these sentences, one can figure out whether a candidate answer is correct or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Finding Evidence from Wikipedia</head><p>As mentioned above, we should first find the Wikipedia page corresponding to the topic entity in the given question. We use Freebase API to con- vert Freebase entity to Wikipedia page. We extract the content from the Wikipedia page and process it with Wikifier (Cheng and Roth, 2013) which rec- ognizes Wikipedia entities, which can further be linked to Freebase entities using Freebase API. Ad- ditionally we use Stanford CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) for tokenization and entity co-reference resolution. We search for the sentences containing the candidate answer entities retrieved from Free- base. For example, the Wikipedia page of O'Neal contains a sentence "O'Neal was drafted by the Or- lando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft", which is taken into account by the re- finement model (our inference model on Wikipedia) to discriminate whether Orlando Magic is the an- swer for the given question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Refinement Model</head><p>We treat the refinement process as a binary classi- fication task over the candidate answers, i.e., cor- rect (positive) and incorrect (negative) answer. We prepare the training data for the refinement model as follows. On the training dataset, we first in- fer on Freebase to retrieve the candidate answers. Then we use the annotated gold answers of these questions and Wikipedia to create the training data. Specifically, we treat the sentences that contain correct/incorrect answers as positive/negative ex- amples for the refinement model. We use LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) to learn the weights for classification.</p><p>Note that, in the Wikipedia page of the topic en- tity, we may collect more than one sentence that contain a candidate answer. However, not all sen- tences are relevant, therefore we consider the can- didate answer as correct if at least there is one positive evidence. On the other hand, sometimes, we may not find any evidence for the candidate answer. In these cases, we fall back to the results of the KB-based approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Lexical Features</head><p>Regarding the features used in LIBSVM, we use the following lexical features extracted from the ques- tion and a Wikipedia sentence. Formally, given a question q = &lt;q 1 , ... q n &gt; and an evidence sentence s = &lt;s 1 , ... s m &gt;, we denote the tokens of q and s by q i and s j , respectively. For each pair (q, s), we identify a set of all possible token pairs (q i , s j ), the occurrences of which are used as features. As learning proceeds, we hope to learn a higher weight for a feature like (first, drafted ) and a lower weight for (first, played ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In this section we introduce the experimental setup, the main results and detailed analysis of our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Training and Evaluation Data</head><p>We use the WebQuestions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Berant et al., 2013</ref>) dataset, which contains 5,810 questions crawled via Google Suggest service, with answers anno- tated on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The questions are split into training and test sets, which contain 3,778 questions (65%) and 2,032 questions (35%), respectively. We further split the training questions into 80%/20% for development.</p><p>To train the MCCNNs and the joint inference model, we need the gold standard relations of the questions. Since this dataset contains only question- answer pairs and annotated topic entities, instead of relying on gold relations we rely on surrogate gold relations which produce answers that have the highest overlap with gold answers. Specifically, for a given question, we first locate the topic entity e in the Freebase graph, then select 1-hop and 2-hop relations connected to the topic entity as relation candidates. The 2-hop relations refer to the n-ary relations of Freebase, i.e., first hop from the sub- ject to a mediator node, and the second from the mediator to the object node. For each relation can- didate r, we issue the query (e, r, ?) to the KB, and label the relation that produces the answer with minimal F 1 -loss against the gold answer, as the surrogate gold relation. From the training set, we collect 461 relations to train the MCCNN, and the target prediction during testing time is over these relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experimental Settings</head><p>We have 6 dependency tree patterns based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bao et al. (2014)</ref> to decompose the question into sub- questions (See Appendix). We initialize the word embeddings with <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Turian et al. (2010)</ref>'s word rep- resentations with dimensions set to 50. The hyper parameters in our model are tuned using the devel- opment set. The window size of MCCNN is set to 3. The sizes of the hidden layer 1 and the hidden layer 2 of the two MCCNN channels are set to 200 and 100, respectively. We use the Freebase version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Berant et al. (2013)</ref>, containing 4M entities and 5,323 relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>We use the average question-wise F 1 as our eval- uation metric. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> To give an idea of the impact of different configurations of our method, we compare the following with existing methods.</p><p>Structured. This method involves inference on Freebase only. First the entity linking (EL) system is run to predict the topic entity. Then we run the relation extraction (RE) system and select the best relation that can occur with the topic entity. We choose this entity-relation pair to predict the answer.</p></div>

The joint EL and RE combined with inference on unstructured data further improves the default pipelined model by 9.2% (from 44.1% to 53.3%), and achieves a new state-of-the-art result beating the previous reported best result of  (with one-tailed t-test significance of p &lt; 0.05).   <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Impact of different MCCNN channels on the development set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Impact of Joint EL &amp; RE</head><p>From We first evaluate the EL component using the gold entity annotations on the development set. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, for 79.8% questions, our entity linker can correctly find the gold standard topic entities. The joint inference improves this result to 83.2%, a 3.4% improvement. Next we use the sur- rogate gold relations to evaluate the performance of the RE component on the development set. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, the relation prediction accuracy increases by 9.4% (from 45.9% to 55.3%) when using the joint inference. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> presents the results on the impact of individ- ual and joint channels on the end QA performance. When using a single-channel network, we tune the parameters of only one channel while switching off the other channel. As seen, the sentential features are found to be more important than syntactic fea- tures. We attribute this to the short and noisy nature of WebQuestions questions due to which syntactic parser wrongly parses or the shortest dependency path does not contain sufficient information to pre- dict a relation. By using both the channels, we see further improvements than using any one of the channels. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Example questions and corresponding pre- dicted answers before and after using unstructured inference. Before uses (Structured + Joint) model, and After uses Structured + Joint + Unstructured model for prediction. The colors blue and red indi- cate correct and wrong answers respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Impact of the Inference on Unstructured Data</head><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref>, when structured inference is augmented with the unstructured inference, we see an improvement of 2.9% (from 44.1% to 47.0%).</p><p>And when Structured + Joint uses unstructured inference, the performance boosts by 6.2% (from 47.1% to 53.3%) achieving a new state-of-the-art result. For the latter, we manually analyzed the cases in which unstructured inference helps. <ref type="table">Ta- ble 4</ref> lists some of these questions and the corre- sponding answers before and after the unstructured inference. We observed the unstructured infer- ence mainly helps for two classes of questions: (1) questions involving aggregation operations (Ques- tions 1-3); (2) questions involving sub-lexical com- positionally (Questions 4-5). Questions 1 and 2 contain the predicate largest an aggregation oper- ator. A semantic parsing method should explicitly handle this predicate to trigger max(.) operator. For Question 3, structured inference predicts the Freebase relation fb:teams..from retrieving all the years in which Ray Allen has played basketball. Note that Ray Allen has joined Connecticut Uni- versity's team in 1993 and NBA from 1996. To an- swer this question a semantic parsing system would require a min(·) operator along with an additional constraint that the year corresponds to the NBA 's term. Interestingly, without having to explicitly model these complex predicates, the unstructured inference helps in answering these questions more accurately. Questions 4-5 involve sub-lexical com-positionally ( ) predicates father and college. For example in Question 5, the user queries for the colleges that John Steinbeck at- tended. However, Freebase defines the relation fb:education..institution to describe a person's ed- ucational information without discriminating the specific periods such as high school or college. In- ference using unstructured data helps in alleviating these representational issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">Error analysis</head><p>We analyze the errors of Structured + Joint + Un- structured model. Around 15% of the errors are caused by incorrect entity linking, and around 50% of the errors are due to incorrect relation predic- tions. The errors in relation extraction are due to (i) insufficient context, e.g., in what is duncan bannatyne, neither the dependency path nor sen- tential context provides enough evidence for the MCCNN model; (ii) unbalanced distribution of re- lations (3022 training examples for 461 relations) heavily influences the performance of MCCNN model towards frequently seen relations. The re- maining errors are the failure of unstructured infer- ence due to insufficient evidence in Wikipedia or misclassification.</p><p>Entity Linking. In the entity linking component, we had handcrafted POS tag patterns to identify entity mentions, e.g., DT-JJ-NN (noun phrase), NN- IN-NN (prepositional phrase). These patterns are designed to have high recall. Around 80% of entity linking errors are due to incorrect entity prediction even when the correct mention span was found.</p><p>Question Decomposition. Around 136 ques- tions (15%) of dev data contains compositional questions, leading to 292 sub-questions (around 2.1 subquestions for a compositional question).</p><p>Since our question decomposition component is based on manual rules, one question of interest is how these rules perform on other datasets. By human evaluation, we found these rules achieves 95% on a more general but complex QA dataset QALD-5 6 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Over time, the QA task has evolved into two main streams -QA on unstructured data, and QA on structured data. TREC QA evaluations (Voorhees and Tice, 1999) were a major boost to unstruc- tured QA leading to richer datasets and sophisti- cated methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heilman and Smith, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yih et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hermann et al., 2015)</ref>. While initial progress on structured QA started with small toy domains like GeoQuery ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zelle and Mooney, 1996)</ref>, recent focus has shifted to large scale structured KBs like Freebase, DB- Pedia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Unger et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cai and Yates, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kwiatkowski et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xu et al., 2014)</ref>, and on noisy KBs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banko et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Carlson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fader et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Parikh et al., 2015</ref>). An exciting development in structured QA is to exploit multiple KBs (with different schemas) at the same time to answer questions jointly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yahya et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fader et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhang et al., 2016)</ref>. QALD tasks and linked data initiatives are contributing to this trend. Our model combines the best of both worlds by inferring over structured and unstructured data. Though earlier methods exploited unstructured data for KB-QA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yao and Van Durme, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Reddy et al., 2014;</ref>, these methods do not rely on unstructured data at test time. Our work is closely related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Joshi et al. (2014)</ref> who aim to answer noisy telegraphic queries using both structured and unstructured data. Their work is lim- ited in answering single relation queries. Our work also has similarities to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sun et al. (2015)</ref> who does question answering on unstructured data but enrich it with Freebase, a reversal of our pipeline. Other line of very recent related work include <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yahya et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Savenkov and Agichtein (2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our work also intersects with relation extrac- tion methods. While these methods aim to predict a relation between two entities in order to pop-ulate <ref type="bibr">KBs (Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hoffmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Riedel et al., 2013</ref>), we work with sentence level relation extraction for question answering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Krishnamurthy and Mitchell (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fader et al. (2014)</ref> adopt open relation extraction methods for QA but they require hand-coded grammar for pars- ing queries. Closest to our extraction method is <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yao and Van Durme (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yao (2015)</ref> who also uses sentence level relation extraction for QA. Unlike them, we can predict multiple relations per question, and our MCCNN architecture is more ro- bust to unseen contexts compared to their logistic regression models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dong et al. (2015)</ref> were the first to use MCCNN for question answering. Yet our approach is very different in spirit to theirs. <ref type="bibr">Dong et al. aim</ref> to maximize the similarity between the distributed representation of a question and its answer entities, whereas our network aims to predict Freebase re- lations. Our search space is several times smaller than theirs since we do not require potential an- swer entities beforehand (the number of relations is much smaller than the number of entities in Free- base). In addition, our method can explicitly handle compositional questions involving multiple rela- tions, whereas Dong et al. learn latent representa- tion of relation joins which is difficult to compre- hend. Moreover, we outperform their method by 7 points even without unstructured inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have presented a method that could infer both on structured and unstructured data to answer natu- ral language questions. Our experiments reveal that unstructured inference helps in mitigating represen- tational issues in structured inference. We have also introduced a relation extraction method using MCCNN which is capable of exploiting syntax in addition to sentential features. Our main model which uses joint entity linking and relation extrac- tion along with unstructured inference achieves the state-of-the-art results on WebQuestions dataset. A potential application of our method is to improve KB-question answering using the documents re- trieved by a search engine.</p><p>Since we pipeline structured inference first and then unstructured inference, our method is limited by the coverage of Freebase. Our future work in- volves exploring other alternatives such as treating structured and unstructured data as two indepen- dent resources in order to overcome the knowledge gaps in either of the two resources.</p><p>The syntax-based patterns for question decomposi- tion are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. The first four patterns are designed to extract sub-questions from simple questions, while the latter two are designed for complex questions involving clauses. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An illustration of our method to find answers for the given question who did shaq first play for.</figDesc></figure>
