			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a framework for lexical substitution that is able to perform transfer learning across languages. Datasets for this task are available in at least three languages (English, Italian, and German). Previous work has addressed each of these tasks in isolation. In contrast, we regard the union of three shared tasks as a combined multilingual dataset. We show that a supervised system can be trained effectively , even if training and evaluation data are from different languages. Successful transfer learning between languages suggests that the learned model is in fact independent of the underlying language. We combine state-of-the-art unsupervised features obtained from syntactic word em-beddings and distributional thesauri in a supervised delexicalized ranking system. Our system improves over state of the art in the full lexical substitution task in all three languages.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The lexical substitution task is defined as replac- ing a target word in a sentence context with a synonym, which does not alter the meaning of the utterance. Although this appears easy to hu- mans, automatically performing such a substitu- tion is challenging, as it implicitly addresses the problem of both determining semantically simi- lar substitutes, as well as resolving the ambiguity of polysemous words. In fact, lexical substitution was originally conceived as an extrinsic evaluation of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) when first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">McCarthy &amp; Navigli (2007)</ref>. How- ever, a system capable of replacing words by ap- propriate meaning-preserving substitutes can be utilized in downstream tasks that require para- phrasing of input text. Examples of such use cases include text simplification, text shortening, and summarization. Furthermore, lexical substitution can be regarded as an alternative to WSD in down- stream tasks requiring word disambiguation. For example, it was successfully applied in Semantic Textual Similarity ( <ref type="bibr">Bär et al., 2012)</ref>. A given list of substitution words can be regarded as a vector representation modeling the meaning of a word in context. As opposed to WSD systems, this is not reliant on a predefined sense inventory, and there- fore does not have to deal with issues of cover- age, or sense granularity. On the other hand, per- forming lexical substitution is more complex than WSD, as a system has to both generate and rank a list of substitution candidates per instance.</p><p>Over the last decade, a number of shared tasks in lexical substitution has been organized and a wide range of methods have been proposed. Al- though many approaches are in fact language- independent, most existing work is tailored to a single language and dataset. In this work, we investigate lexical substitution as a multilingual task, and report experimental results for English, German and Italian datasets. We consider a su- pervised approach to lexical substitution, which casts the task as a ranking problem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Szarvas et al., 2013b</ref>). We adapt state-of-the-art unsupervised features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Biemann and Riedl, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Melamud et al., 2015a</ref>) in a delexicalized ranking frame- work and perform transfer learning experiments by training a ranker model from a different lan- guage. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of ag- gregating data from different languages and train our model on this single multilingual dataset. We are able to improve the state of the art for the full task on all datasets.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as fol- lows. In Section 2 we elaborate on the lexical sub-stitution task and datasets. Section 3 shows related work of systems addressing each of these tasks. In Section 4 we describe our method for building a supervised system capable of transfer learning. Section 5 shows our experimental results and dis- cussion. Finally in Section 6 we give a conclusion and outlook to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Lexical substitution datasets and evaluation</head><p>The lexical substitution task was first defined at <ref type="bibr">SemEval 2007 (McCarthy and</ref><ref type="bibr">Navigli, 2007, "SE07")</ref>. A lexical sample of target word is se- lected from different word classes (nouns, verbs, and adjectives). Through annotation, a set of valid substitutes was collected for 10-20 contexts per target. Whereas in the original SE07 task, anno- tators were free to provide "up to three, but all equally good" substitutes, later tasks dropped this restriction. Substitutes were subsequently aggre- gated by annotator frequency, creating a ranking of substitutes. The use of SE07 has become a de-facto standard for system comparison, however equivalent datasets have been produced for other languages. Evalita 2009 posed a lexical substitu- tion task for Italian (Toral, 2009, "EL09"). Par- ticipants were free to obtain a list of substitution candidates in any way, most commonly Italian WordNet 1 was used. A WeightedSense baseline provided by the organizers proved very strong, as all systems scored below it. This baseline is ob- tained by aggregating differently weighted seman- tic relations from multiple human-created lexical resources ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ruimy et al., 2002)</ref>. A German ver- sion of the lexical substitution task was organized at <ref type="bibr">GermEval 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cholakov et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miller et al., 2015</ref>, "GE15"). Likewise, WeightedSense was able to beat both of two participating systems in oot evaluations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miller et al., 2015)</ref>. A variation for cross-lingual lexical substitution was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mihalcea et al. (2010)</ref>, in which substitute words are required in a different lan- guage than the source sentence. The sentence con- text as well as the target word were given in En- glish, whereas the substitute words should be pro- vided in Spanish (annotators were fluent in both languages). This variant is motivated by direct ap- plication in Machine Translation systems, or as an aid for human-based translation. There also ex-ists a larger crowd-sourced dataset of 1012 nouns <ref type="bibr">(Biemann, 2013, "TWSI")</ref>, as well as an all-words dataset in which all words in each sentence are annotated with lexical expansions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kremer et al., 2014</ref>). Evaluation of lexical substitution adheres to metrics defined by SE07 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McCarthy and Navigli, 2007)</ref>, who provide two evaluation settings 2 ; best evaluating only a system's "best guess" of a single target substitute and oot, an unordered eval- uation of up to ten substitutes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Thater et. al (2009)</ref> proposed to use Generalized Average Precision (GAP), to compare an output ranking rather than unordered sets of substitutes.</p><p>Dataset comparison The proposed lexical substitution datasets (SE07, EL09, GE15) differ in their degree of ambiguity of target items. If a dataset contains mostly target words that are un- ambiguous, substitution lists of different instances of the same target are similar, despite occurring in different context. We can quantify this degree of variation by measuring the overlap of gold substi- tutes of each target across all contexts. For this, we adapt the pairwise agreement (PA) metric de- fined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McCarthy &amp; Navigli (2009)</ref>. Instead of inter-annotator agreement we measure agreement across different context instances. Let T be a set of lexical target words, and D dataset of instances (t i , S i ) ∈ D, in which target t i ∈ T is annotated with a set of substitutes S i . Then we regard for each tar- get word t the substitute sets S t ⊂ D for t. We de- fine a substitute agreement as SA (t) as the mean pairwise dice coefficient between all s 1 , s 2 ∈ S t where s 1 = s 2 . For each dataset D we list the sub- stitute variance SV = 1 − 1 |T | ∑ t∈T SA (t). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows this metric for the three datasets, as well as for subsets of the dataset according to target part of speech. It can be seen that the variance in gold substitutes differs substantially between datasets, but not much between target word type within a dataset. EL09 has the highest degree of variance, suggesting that targets tend to be more ambiguous, whereas GE15 has the lowest degree of variance, suggesting less ambiguity.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Séaghdha and Korhonen, 2014)</ref>, and proba- bilistic graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Moon and Erk, 2013)</ref>. The current state of the art combines a distri- butional model with the use of n-gram language models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Melamud et al., 2015a</ref>). They define the context vector of each word in a background cor- pus as a substitute vector, which is a vector of suit- able filler words for the current n-gram context. They then obtain a contextualized paraphrase vec- tor by computing a weighted average of substitute vectors in the background corpus, based on their similarity to the current target instance. In con- trast to traditional sparse vector representations obtained through distributional methods, a recent trend is the use of low-dimensional dense vector representations. The use of such vector repre- sentations or word embeddings has been popular- ized by the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and Skip-gram model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mikolov et al., 2013a</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Melamud et al. (2015b)</ref> show a simple and knowledge- lean model for lexical substitution based solely on syntactic word embeddings. As we leverage this model as a feature in our approach, we will elab- orate on this in Section 4. Another approach for applying word embeddings to lexical substitution is their direct extension with multiple word senses, which can be weighted according to target context ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Neelakantan et al., 2014</ref>). Biemann (2013) first showed that the lexical substitution task can be solved very well when suf- ficient amount of training data is collected per tar- get. An approach based on crowdsourcing human judgments achieved the best performance on the S07 dataset to day. However, judgments had to be collected for each lexical item, and as a conse- quence the approach can not scale to an open vo- cabulary. As an alternative to per-word supervised systems trained on target instances per lexeme, all- words systems aim to generalize over all lexical items. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Szarvas et al. (2013a)</ref> proposed such a sys- tem by using delexicalization: features are gener- alized in such a way that they are independent of lexical items, and thus generalize beyond the train- ing set and across targets. Originally, a maximum entropy classifier was trained on target-substitute instances and used for pointwise ranking of sub- stitution candidates. In a follow-up work it was shown that learning-to-rank methods could dras- tically improve this approach, achieving state-of- the-art performance with a LambdaMART ranker ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Szarvas et al., 2013b</ref>). In this work we will build upon this model and further generalize not only across lexical items but across different languages.</p><p>For both EL09 and GE15, existing approaches have been adapted. For the Italian dataset, a distributional method was combined with LSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Cao and Basili, 2009</ref>). The best perform- ing system applied a WSD system and language models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Basile and Semeraro, 2009)</ref>. For the Ger- man dataset, Hintz and Biemann (2015) adapted the supervised approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Szarvas et al., 2013a</ref>), achieving best performance for nouns and adjec- tives. Jackov (2015) used a deep semantic analy- sis framework employing an internal dependency relation knowledge base, which achieved the best performance for verbs. tutes s ∈ C t , where C t is a static per-target candi- date list. Our method is agnostic to the creation of this static resource, which can be obtained either by an unsupervised similarity-based approach, or from a lexical resource. In particular, candidates obtained at this stage do not disambiguate possible multiple senses of t, and are filtered and ordered in the ranking stage by a supervised model.</p><p>In modeling a supervised system, we have ex- perimented with two learning setups. The first is applying a standard classification / regression learner. Here, lexical substitution is cast into a pointwise ranking task by training on target- substitute pairs generated from the gold standard. For each sentence context c, target word t and sub- stitute s, we regard the tuple (c,t, s) as a training instance. We obtain these training instances for each lexsub instance (c,t) by considering all sub- stitutes s ∈ G t ∪C t where G t are all candidates for target t pooled from the gold data and C t are ob- tained from lexical resources. We then experiment with two labeling alternatives for a binary classi- fication and a regression setup, respectively. For binary classification we label each instance (c,t, s) as positive if s has been suggested as a substitute for t by at least one annotator, and as negative oth- erwise. For regression, we normalize the annota- tion counts for each substitute to obtain a score in (0, 1] if a substitute s occurs in the gold data, 0 otherwise. The ranking of substitutes per target is obtained by considering the posterior likelihood of the positive label as yielded by a classifier model. We have tried multiple classifiers but have found no significant improvement over a maximum en- tropy baseline 3 . Our second setup is a learning- to-rank framework, adapted from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Szarvas et al., 2013b</ref>). Here, we are not restricted to a pointwise ranking model, but consider pairwise and listwise models 4 .</p><p>We base our feature model on existing research. In addition to basic syntactic and frequency-based features, we obtained sophisticated features from trigram and syntactic thesauri, motivated by the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Biemann and Riedl (2013)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">and Feldweg, 1997</ref>) for German and MultiWord- Net ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pianta et al., 2002</ref>) for Italian. For all re- sources, we consider all possible senses for a given target word and obtain all synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms and their transitive hull. Thus, for the hypernymy and hyponymy relation, we follow the respective edges in the graph collecting all nodes (synsets) along the path. For each synset, we extract all lemmas as substitution candidates. Although restricting candidates incurs a relatively low upper bound on system recall, we still obtain best results using this rather conservative filter. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Ta- ble 2</ref> shows the upper bound for system recall for each of the datasets, evaluated with and without re- moving all multiword expressions from both can- didate lists and gold data. A higher coverage of WordNet is a plausible explanation for the much higher recall on the English data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Supervised ranking</head><p>Learning-to-rank methods train a supervised model for ranking a list of items by relevance. A basic pointwise approach applies regression tech- niques to obtain a relevance scores for each item in isolation. More advanced models are based on pairwise preference information for instance pairs, and listwise approaches, which are optimized on a global metric of a given ranking output. An ex- tensive overview of learning-to-rank models can be found in . For lexical substi- tution, LambdaMART (Wu et al., 2010) has been found to be particularly effective. LambdaMART is a listwise method based on gradient boosting of regression trees. Its two main hyperparameters are the number of leaves in each regression tree and the number of iterations and trees. We have not performed extensive tuning of these hyperparame- ters and used default settings, an ensemble of 1000 trees with 10 leaves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Delexicalized features</head><p>The idea of delexicalization has been proposed, for instance, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bergsma et al. (2007)</ref>. They propose to use statistical measures based solely on the frequency of different expansions of the same target term. Their feature set has motivated a large subset of the feature model, which we adapt in this work. The idea of generalizing fea- tures for lexical substitution in such a way that they work across lexical items has been shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moon and Erk (2013)</ref>, and made explicit by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Szarvas et al. (2013a)</ref>. Instances are characterized using non-lexical features from heterogeneous ev- idence. The intuition of this feature model is to exploit redundant signals of substitutability from different sources and methods. In cases where background corpora are re- quired, the following data is used throughout all features: For English, a newspaper corpus com- piled from 105 million sentences from the Leipzig Corpora Collection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Richter et al., 2006</ref>) and the Gigaword corpus (Parker et al., 2011) was used. For German a 70M sentence newswire corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Biemann et al., 2007</ref>) was used. For Italian, a subset of 40M sentences of itWac, a large web- crawl, was used ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>Shallow syntactic features We apply a part- of-speech tagger trained on universal POS tags ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Petrov et al., 2012</ref>), which we simplify into the classes noun, verb, adjective and adverb. Using these simplified tags we construct an n-gram slid- ing window, with n ∈ [1..5], of POS around the target. We could also reduce window sizes drasti- cally to n = 1,2 without sacrificing performance.</p><p>Frequency features We use language models for each of the languages to obtain frequency ratio features. An n-gram sliding window around a tar- get t is used to generate a set of features freq(c l ,s,c r ) freq(c l ,t,c r ) , where c l and c r are the left and right context words around t. Here, we normalize the frequency of the substitute with the frequency of the n-gram with original target t. As a variant, we further normal- ize frequencies by the set of all substitutes, to ob- tain frequencies features freq(c l ,s,c r ) ∑ s ∈C t freq(c l ,s ,c r ) where C t is the set of candidate substitutes for t. In our ex- periments we used sliding windows of size [1.</p><p>.5].</p><p>We obtain 5-gram counts from web1t ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brants and Franz, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Conjunction ratio features Based on the n- gram resources above, we further define a con- junctive phrase ratio feature, which measures how often the construct (c l ,t, conjunction, s, c r ) occurs in a background corpus; i.e. how often t and s co- occur with a conjunction word ("and", "or", ","), within the context of the sentence. As there is a different set of conjunction words for each lan- guage, we first aggregate the mean over all con- junction words:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">conj l,r (t, s) = 1 |CONJ| ∑ con∈CONJ freq (c l ,t, con, s, c r )</formula><p>where l and r is the size of the left and right con- text window, and CONJ is a set of conjunction words per-language <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . For left and right context size l = r = 0 this feature also captures a context- independent conjunction co-occurrence between only t and s. Again, we normalize this feature over the set of all candidates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">conj l,r (t, s) ∑ s ∈C t conj l,r (t, s)</formula><p>Distributional features We construct a distri- butional thesaurus (DT) for each of the lan- guages by following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Biemann and Riedl (2013)</ref> and obtain first-order word-to-context measures, as well as second-order word-to-word similarity measures. As context features we have experi- mented with both syntactic dependencies as well as left and right neighboring words, and have found them to perform equivalently. As a salience measure we use Lexicographer's Mutual Informa- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bordag, 2008)</ref> and prune the data, keep- ing only the 1000 most salient features per word. Word similarity is obtained from an overlap count in the pruned context features. We model features for the contextualized distributional similarity be- tween t and s as</p><p>• percentage of shared context features for the top-k context features of t and s, globally and restricted to sentence context (k =5, 20, 50, 100, 200)</p><p>• percentage of shared words for the top-k sim- ilar words of t and s (k =200)</p><p>• sum of salience score of context features of s overlapping with the sentence context</p><p>• binary occurrence of s in top-k similar words of t (k =100, 200)</p><p>With the exception of the last feature, these mea- sures are scaled to <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref> over the set of all substi- tute candidates.</p><p>Syntactic word embeddings We adapt the un- supervised approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Melamud et al., 2015a</ref>) as a set of features. We follow ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Levy and Goldberg, 2014</ref>) to construct dependency-based word embeddings; we obtain syntactic contexts by run- ning a syntactic dependency parser 6 , and comput- ing word embeddings using dependency edges as context features <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . The resulting dense vector rep- resentations for words and context live within the same vector space. We compute the semantic sim- ilarity between a target and a substitute word from the cosine similarity in the word embedding space, as well as the first-order target-to-context similar- ity. For a given target word t and substitute s, let C t be the syntactic context of t and c ∈ C t a single context -i.e. a dependency edge attached to t; let v t , v s be the vector representations of t and s in the word embedding space, and v c the vector represen- tation of c in the context embedding space. Then Sim 1 = cos (v s , v c ) and Sim 2 = cos (v s , v t ) are the first-order and second-order substitutability mea- sures considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Melamud et al. (2015a)</ref>. In contrast to their approach, we do not just consider an unsupervised combination of these two mea- sures, but instead use both Sim 1 and Sim 2 as sin- gle features. We also use their combinations of a balanced / unbalanced, arithmetic / geometrical mean, to obtain six numeric features in total. Im- portantly, these features are independent of the un- derlying embedding vectors and can therefore gen- eralize across arbitrary embeddings between lan- guages.</p><p>Semantic resource features To generalize across multiple languages we minimize the <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We trained models for Mate (https://code. google.com/p/mate-tools/) based on universal dependencies (http://universaldependencies. org/) <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We used word2vecf (https://bitbucket.org/ yoavgo/word2vecf) for computing syntactic word em- beddings complexity of features obtained from semantic resources -which may differ notably in size and structure. From the resources listed in Section 4.1 we extract binary features for the semantic relations synonymy, hypernymy and hy- ponymy, occurring between t and s. We have also experimented with graded variants for transitive relations, such as encoding n-th level hypernymy, but have not observed any gain from this feature variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Transfer learning</head><p>Transfer learning is made feasible by a fully lexeme-independent and language-independent feature space. Language-specific knowledge re- sides only within the respective resources for each language, and gets abstracted in feature extraction. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates this process at the example of two entirely unrelated sentences in different lan- guages (English and German). A further mediator for transfer learning is a model based on boosted decision trees. As opposed to linear models, which could not be reasonably learned across languages, a LambdaMART ranker is able to learn feature in- teraction across languages. To give an example of what the resulting model can pick up on, we can regard conditionally strong features. Consider the n-gram pair frequency ratio feature of win- dow size (l, r) = (1, 0), which compares the fre- quency ratio of the target and substitute including a single left context word. Depending on the POS window, this feature can be highly informative in some cases, where it is less informative in others. For adjective-noun pairs, in which the noun is the substitution target, the model can learn that this frequency ratio is strongly positively correlated; in this case, the substitute frequently occurs with the same adjective than the original target. For other POS windows, for example determiner-noun pairs, the same frequency ratio may be less indica- tive, as most nouns frequently occur with a deter- miner. This property works across languages, as long as as attributive adjectives are prepositioned. In our subset of languages, this is the case for En- glish and German, but not for Italian, which uses postpositive adjectives. Nevertheless, we are able to learn such universal feature interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results and discussion</head><p>Evaluation of lexical substitution requires spe- cial care, as different evaluation settings are used <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Visualization of feature extraction and delexicalization. Two unrelated sentences in English and German (translation: "the strain has to be limited") are shown. Language-specific knowledge is obtained from resources for each language respectively. The resulting feature space is delexicalized and language independent.</p><p>throughout previous work and comparability is not always guaranteed. We follow the convention of reporting the full lexical substitution task (both generating and ranking candidates) with the met- rics P-best and P-oot and report the ranking-only task (candidates pooled from the gold standard) with the GAP score. We further observe that pre- vious work commonly discards multiword expres- sions from both the candidate lists as well as the gold data 8 . We follow this convention, but note that our system is in fact capable of successfully ranking multiword expansions out of the box. Sys- tem performance slightly decreases when includ- ing MWE, as there is virtually no overlap between those provided by the system and those in the gold standard.</p><p>For ranking we experiment with different point- wise classifiers as provided by Mallet (MaxEnt classification and regression) as well learning-to- rank models provided by RankLib (RankBoost, RankNet, LambdaMART). In line with findings in <ref type="figure">(Szarvas et al., 2013b)</ref>, we observe that learning- to-rank approaches work better than a pointwise classification / regression setup throughout all lan- guages and feature subsets. Among different rankers, we confirm LambdaMART to yield the best performance, and will only report numbers using this model. As optimization metric we have explored both NDCG@10 and MAP.   based on annotator overlap, however MAP di- rectly correlates with evaluation score. We have found optimizing on MAP to yield slightly bet- ter results, even if this disregards the relative score weights between gold substitutes. For the ranking- only task, we also extended the pooled train- ing data with additional negative examples (i.e. adding all candidates as for the full task) but ob- served a minor decrease in system performance.</p><p>We report transfer learning results across all three datasets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows a transfer-learning matrix for the full lexical substitution task, whereas <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows results for the ranking-only task. For evaluation, we consistently use the com- plete datasets, which are roughly equal in size for all languages <ref type="bibr">(~ 2000 instances)</ref>. For the identity entries in this matrix, as well as training on the complete dataset ("all") we follow previous super- vised work and perform 10-fold cross-validation. Splits are based on the target lexeme, so that no two instances for the same target word are in dif- ferent sets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Tables 3 and 4</ref> suggest the feasibil- ity of transfer learning. Although models trained on the original language (identity entries of the matrix) perform best, training on a different lan- guage still yields reasonable results. Training only on a single other language, not surprisingly, yields worse results for each dataset, however combining the data from the two remaining languages ("oth- ers") can mitigate this issue to some degree. Im- portantly, adding the data from two additional lan- guages consistently improves system performance throughout all datasets for the open candidate task <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 3)</ref>. It is interesting to note that in case of SE07, training on only other languages performs surprisingly well for the best-P score, beating even a model trained on English. A possible explana- tion for this is that the SE07 dataset appears to be somewhere in the middle between EL09 and GE15 in terms of substitute variance. For the ranking- only task, transfer learning seems to work a lit- tle less effectively. In case of German, adding foreign language data in fact hurts GAP perfor- mance. This potentially originates from a much smaller set of training instances and inconsistency of the amount and overlap of pooled candidates across different tasks (as described in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). We also observe that a learning-to-rank model is es- sential for performing transfer learning. In case of LambdaMART, an ensemble of decision trees is constructed, which is well suited to exploit re- dundant signals across multiple features. Linear models resulted in worse performance for trans- fer learning, as the resulting weights seem to be language-specific.</p><p>Feature ablation experiments are performed for various feature groups in the full and ranking-only task <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 5</ref>). The ablation groups correspond to the feature categories defined in Section 4.3. The frequency group includes plain frequency features as well as conjunction ratio features. We consider only our universal model trained on all language data (with 10-fold CV for each dataset). In case of English, the full system performs best and all feature groups improve overall performance. For other languages these results are mixed. In case of the German data, embedding features and se- mantic relation features seem to work well on their own, so that results for other ablation groups are slightly better. For ranking-only, embedding fea- tures seem to be largely subsumed by the combi- nation of the other groups. Ablation of embed- dings differs vastly between the full and ranking- only task; they seem to more more crucial for the full task. For all languages, semantic relations are the best feature in the full task, acting as a strong filter for candidates; in ranking-only they are more dispensable.</p><p>In summary, we observe that delexicalized transfer learning for lexical substitution is possi- ble. Existing supervised approaches can be ex- tended to generalize across multiple languages without much effort. Training a supervised sys- tem on different language data emphasizes that the learned model is sufficiently generic to be language independent. Our feature space con- structed from heterogeneous evidence consists of many features that perform relatively weakly on their own. The resulting ranking model captures redundancy between these signals. Finally, Ta- ble 6 shows our results in comparison to previ- ous work. Note that we omit some participating systems from the original SE07 task. The rea- son we did not list IRST2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Giuliano et al., 2007)</ref> is that for out-of-ten results, the system outputs the same substitute multiple times and the eval- uation scheme gives credit for each copy of the substitute. Our (and other) systems do not tam- per with the metric in this way, and only yield a set of substitutes. UNT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hassan et al., 2007</ref>) uses a much richer set of knowledge bases, not all of them easily available, to achieve slightly better oot scores. From our experiments, we list both a model trained per language, as well as a universal model trained on all data. The latter beats nearly all other approaches on the full lexical substitu- tion task, despite not being optimized for a single language. Although omission of MWEs is com- mon practice for SE07, it is unclear if this was  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We are the first to model lexical substitution as a language-independent task by considering not just a single-language dataset, but by merging data from distinct tasks in English, German and Ital- ian. We have shown that a supervised, delex- icalized approach can successfully learn a sin- gle model across languages -and thus perform transfer learning for lexical substitution. We ob- serve that a listwise ranker model such as Lamb- daMART facilitates this transfer learning. We have further shown that incorporating more data helps training a more robust model and can consis- tently improve system performance by adding for- eign language training data. We extended an exist- ing supervised learning-to-rank approach for lexi- cal substitution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Szarvas et al., 2013b</ref>) with state- of-the-art embedding features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Melamud et al., 2015b</ref>). In our experiments, a single model trained on all data performed best on each language. In all <ref type="bibr">10</ref> For comparison, our scores including MWE for the "all data" model are as follows (best-P, oot-P, GAP). <ref type="bibr">EL09: 15.12, 33.92, 45.8; GE15: 12.20, 41.15, 50.0</ref> 11 Our evaluation of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Melamud et al., 2015b</ref>), balAdd yields a GAP score of 48.8, which is likely related to different evaluation settings. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> baseline by task organizer SemEval '07 method best-P oot-P GAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Erk and Padó, 2010</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Experimental results of our method com- pared to related work for all three lexical substitu- tion tasks three datasets we were able to improve the current state of the art for the full lexical substitution task.</p><p>The resulting model can be regarded as language- independent; given an unannotated background corpus for computing language-specific resources and a source of substitution candidates, the sys- tem can be used almost out of the box. For obtain- ing substitution candidates, we still rely on lexi- cal resources such as WordNet, which have to be available for each language. As future work we aim to make our approach completely knowledge- free by eliminating this dependency. We can con- sider substitution candidates based on their dis- tributional similarity. First experiments confirm that this already yields a much better coverage, i.e. upper bound on recall, while introducing more noise. The remaining key challenge is to bet- ter characterize possible substitutes from bad sub- stitutes in ranked lists of distributionally similar words, which frequently contain antonyms and co- hyponyms. We will explore unsupervised acquisi- tion of relational similarity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mikolov et al., 2013b)</ref> for this task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>dataset</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
