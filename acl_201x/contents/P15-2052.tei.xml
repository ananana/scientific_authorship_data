				<p>We give an algorithm for disambiguating generic versus referential uses of second-person pronouns in restaurant reviews in Chinese. Reviews in this domain use the &apos;you&apos; pronoun either generically or to refer to shopkeepers, readers, or for self-reference in reported conversation. We first show that linguistic features of the local context (drawn from prior literature) help in disambigation. We then show that document-level features (n-grams and document-level embeddings)-not previously used in the referentiality literature-actually give the largest gain in performance , and suggest this is because pronouns in this domain exhibit &apos;one-sense-per-discourse&apos;. Our work highlights an important case of discourse effects on pronoun use, and may suggest practical implications for audience extraction and other sentiment tasks in online reviews.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and Task Description</head><p>Detecting whether a given entity is referential is an important question in computational discourse processing. Linguistic features in the local con- text of a given mention have been successfully used for determining whether a second-person pronoun (you) in dialogue is referential <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Gupta et al., 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Purver et al., 2009)</ref>. The related task of anaphoricity detection is an important subtask of coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ng and Cardie, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ng, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Luo, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhou and Kong, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Recasens et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we consider the task of audience identification in review texts, using restaurant re- views written in Chinese. Our task is to disam- biguate a mention of the Chinese second-person pronoun (ni, "you") into the following four la- bels that we found to occur commonly in reviews:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generic</head><p>For drinks they only have Sprite and Coke, and you have to order before they'll give them to you.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Referential -Shop</head><p>With such good service, I'll definitely come back to your shop next time!</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Referential -Reader</head><p>Go and try it if you don't believe me -your whole body will feel regret! Referential -Writer / Self "" The shop employee said, "You only want the stone-bowl chicken?"</p><p>We aim to gain insight into the linguistics of narrative by distinguishing the types of discourse contexts in which different referential senses are found. Restaurant reviews provide an important new test case, and resolving who a reviewer wants to address could have important implications for coreference resolution or sentiment analysis of re- views, as well as downstream tasks like informa- tion extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>A number of closely related earlier papers have fo- cused on disambiguating 'you' in English. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gupta et al. (2007b)</ref> annotated the Switchboard cor- pus of telephone dialogue, showing that features based on specific lexical patterns, adjacent parts- of-speech, punctuation, and dialog acts are suf- ficient to achieve performance of 84.39% at the binary generic/referential prediction task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gupta et al. (2007a)</ref> show that similar features gener- alize to addressee prediction for multi-party in-teractions significantly better than a simple base- line.  combine discourse features with acoustic and visual information for four-way interactions to resolve participant refer- ence, and in the same setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Purver et al. (2009)</ref> employ cascaded classifiers that first establish ref- erentiality and then attempt to resolve the refer- ent. They show that utterance-level lexical fea- tures help, suggesting that different uses of 'you' are associated with distinct vocabularies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Reiter and Frank (2010)</ref> investigate the more general question of identifying genericity for noun phrases, showing the usefuleness of linguistic fea- tures such as syntactic dependency relations. Sim- ilar local structural cues like phrase-structure po- sitioning, head word identity, and distance to sur- rounding clauses have been used as features in ma- chine learning approaches for anaphoricity detec- tion as one stage in a coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kong and Zhou, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhou and Kong, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kong and Ng, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Prior work has also shown improvements in per- formance in the dialogue domain from incorporat- ing features having to do with acoustic prosody, gaze, and head movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Jovanovi´cJovanovi´c et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Takemae and Ozawa, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gupta et al., 2007b;</ref>. Of course in the review domain we have no access to such information; as we'll see, however, we can exploit other unique properties of reviews to make up for this lack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>We scrape reviews from dianping.com, a Chinese- language restaurant review site, from the ten cities with the most reviews. We randomly sample 750 restaurants within each city and randomly sample reviews of those restaurants.</p><p>We scraped 346,381 reviews, including all as- sociated metadata (city, restaurant category, and cost) for each restaurant, as well as the provided ratings (service, taste, ambience, and overall stars) for each review. Of these reviews only 6,704 (less than 2%) have the second-person pronominal character ni, highlighting another particular inter- est of this task: explicit second-person pronomi- nals are quite rare in Chinese, at least in this genre, making the reviews in which they appear linguis- tically marked.</p><p>Summary statistics for this dataset are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We release all our data and annotations at nlp.stanford.edu/robvoigt/nis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preprocessing</head><p>We apply the Stanford CRF Word Segmenter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tseng et al., 2005</ref>) to segment the text of each re- view into words, and use simple heuristics based on whitespace and punctuation to extract sen- tences or sentence fragments. The Stanford Parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Klein and Manning, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Levy and Manning, 2003</ref>) is then run on each extracted sentence or fragment containing a ni to produce a dependency graph and set of part-of-speech (POS) tags for later use in feature extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Annotation</head><p>We hand-annotated 701 examples of ni tokens (in- cluding both singular and plural cases), placing them into one of seven categories: generic, writer- referential, reader-referential, shop-referential, id- iomatic, non-"you", and other. The idiomatic and non-"you" cases are commonly comprised of set phrases such as (nihao, "hello") or (mini, "mini") and are therefore relatively trivial to filter; and the "other" class is both rare and varied, including cases such as direct reference to prior review-writers.</p><p>We therefore only consider the generic and large-class referential cases, leaving us with 636 examples for our task; the distribution of anno- tated nis is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The approximately half-and-half split between generic and referential tokens is surprisingly sim- ilar to that found by studies on English dialogue like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gupta et al. (2007b)</ref>, in spite of the large di- vergence in language and genre.</p><p>We also found an unexpected word-sense prop- erty of second-person pronouns in this genre: of the 122 annotated reviews which contain more than one ni, 83.6% use ni with the same sense in each occurrence in the review, recalling the one-sense-per-discourse hypothesis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gale et al. (1992)</ref>. Finding that this discourse property- normally predicated of word-sense in common nouns-occurs in pronouns suggests the use of features of the entire discourse in this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Features</head><p>We consider two primary types of features: "lo- cal" and "discourse".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Local Features</head><p>"Local" features model textual and linguistic properties of the immediate context of a given ni  mention, and were drawn from the large litera- ture on referentiality, anaphoricity, and singleton- detection:</p><p>Word Identity This feature simply encodes the word-segmented identity of the word in which the current ni token is found, capturing cases such as the second-person plural (nimen, "you [plu- ral]"). Dependencies We include binary features for the presence or absence of lexicalized dependency relations in which the given ni participates. As an example, for the phrase ("if you want to sell dishes"), we extract a feature for NSUBJ( , ) -you is the subject of the verb sell.</p><p>Lexical Context This feature set fires binary features for the presence or absence of words in the vocabulary within a three-word window on ei- ther side of the given ni token.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Discourse Features</head><p>The "discourse" category considers features that characterize the entire review, capturing the intu- ition that the classic one-sense-per-discourse prop- erty is likely to hold for a given review, so we ex- pect that features on the entire text of the review will be relevant for prediction. This is a novel contribution of this work: we propose that in certain contexts (such as reviews), referentiality resolution can be interpreted in part as a text classification task.</p><p>Review N-grams These are binary features for the presence or absence of n-grams in the entire text of the review. We found that using a larger n than 1 caused overfitting on our relatively small dataset and reduced performance; therefore, re- sults are reported using unigram features.</p><p>Review Vector Embedding To see if we can induce higher-level representations of the review text than simply binary n-gram features, we also train a document-level distributed vector represen- tation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Le and Mikolov, 2014</ref>) on the entire corpus of reviews using the "doc2vec" implementation in GENSIM <ref type="bibr">( ˇ Rehůřek and Sojka, 2010)</ref>, and include 200 vector features per review: a 100-dimensional embedding learned on the entire document, as well as a 100-dimensional average embedding calcu- lated by averaging the vectors for each word in the document. In experiments we found using both the document and the average vectors combined resulted in higher performance than either alone, so we report results in this setting.</p><p>Metadata In addition to discourse features, we also included features that encode the category, city, and estimated cost for each restaurant, as well as the service, taste, environment, and overall star rank ratings associated with a given review on a 5-point scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>We tested the effectiveness of these features at predicting genericity and reference for each ni to- ken with multinomial logistic regression, as imple- mented in SCIKIT-LEARN <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>). We used two classification settings: a binary pre- diction of whether a given ni is referential or not, and a four-way prediction including distinctions between the three annotated referential targets. The results for each task are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>In each case, we compare the performance of all local and discourse features, as well as several relevant subsets. One question we aim to address is whether our discourse-level n-gram and embed-   ding features contribute similar information, so we test them both separately and together. We com- pare our results to a baseline of choosing the most common class for either task. We train and test models with ten-fold cross- validation. In each fold, we use 80% of the data for training, 10% for development, and 10% for testing. For each feature set, we set the l2 regu- larization strength as a hyperparameter based on average cross-validation accuracy on the develop- ment data in each fold. All reported results are average cross-validation accuracy at that regular- ization strength on the test set in each fold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Meta-analysis</head><p>To better understand the effectiveness of each fea- ture set for this task, we perform a full ablation study by training a classifier on all 127 (2 7 − 1, ig- noring the empty set) possible combinations of our 7 feature sets, and run a linear regression predict- ing the classification score from the feature sets used. This allows us to obtain estimates of the ef- fect size and statistical significance for each set of features with reference to all the others. These re- sults are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>These results show that on the task of detecting genericity and reference for second-person pro- nouns in our annotated set of Chinese-language restaurant reviews, both discourse-level features as well as local, contextual features significantly im-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">FEATURE BINARY FOUR-WAY estimate p estimate p ID 2.5% *** 1.9% *** POS 1.0% . 1.0% .

Simple word identity features alone already provide surprising performance: the classifier learns that the singular ni is more likely to be generic while the plural often refers to peo- ple affiliated with the shop.</p><p>While local features alone achieve respectable performance (78.44% for binary genericity detec- tion and 72.19% for four-way classification), we show that in the review context significant gains can be made from using a combination of local and discourse-level features, exploiting discourse- level indicators of referentiality and the fact that a one-sense-per-discourse assumption tends to hold with regards to the use of ni.</p><p>Analysis of learned feature weights in our highest-performing model also provides some in- teresting social insights. Reviews with a high overall star rank were more likely to use generic ni, and reviewers who thought highly of the restau- rant's service as indicated by their quality-of- service rating were more likely to use reader- directed referential ni.</p><p>Reviews with shop-directed referential ni were likely to use emotive sentence-final particles like (a), exclamation points, and question marks, just as question marks were among the strongest indicators of referential uses in the English "you"s in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gupta et al. (2007b)</ref>. We also found that other pronouns like (wo, "I") and (women, "we"), as well as words of temporal sequencing (diyi, "the first"), (you, "again"), and (ci, "[one] time") receive high weights for referential classes.</p><p>Combined with the observation that reviews containing ni simply tend to be much longer than those without (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), these results suggest a link to the narrative work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jurafsky et al. (2014)</ref>, who characterize negative reviews as narrative ex- positions of an individual bad experience.</p><p>For example, consider the following review containing a referential ni:</p><p>The food and quantity was fine. The ambi- ence need not be mentioned. But in spite of having been a bit late for lunch, we wouldn't have imagined you'd first turn off the lights, and then turn off the air conditioner. I'd like to ask: saving money on electricity like this, do you mean to imply that there's no need for us to pay for our meal?</p><p>While the immediate context suggests a refer- ential interpretation (, literally "want to ask you [plural], saving electricity"), it is only when this mention is connected to elements of the entire discourse (the sequence of events, the first-person pronouns) that it becomes completely clear first that the mention is referential and sec- ond that it refers to the shop owner.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that when combined with local features, features derived from dis- tributed representations of each document per- form at least as well for this task as document- level n-grams, but at a much lower dimensional- ity. This suggests that these embeddings do suc- cessfully encode the information necessary to re- produce document-level distinctions in discourse types, such as between the personal narratives that often surround referential uses of ni and the ab- stract descriptions of generic uses.</p><p>Our meta-analysis shows that more linguisti- cally motivated local features such as POS tags and dependency relations are substantially over- shadowed in effectiveness by lexical and discourse features, although this may be due in part to re- duced performance of these automatic taggers on the more colloquial language in online reviews.</p><p>Finally, this work challenges prior claims that spoken language is "more complex" than other genres with regards to referentiality. On the con- trary: whereas in a spoken discourse the poten- tial addressees are by default the participants, web texts such as the reviews studied here have no such default, and may include complex, creative, and domain-specific deictic reference that can be im- portant for computational systems to address.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Adjacent POS Tags Following Gupta et al.
