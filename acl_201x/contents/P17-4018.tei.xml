			<abstract>
				<p>We introduce a modular approach for literature-based discovery consisting of a machine reading and knowledge assembly component that together produce a graph of influence relations (e.g., &quot;A promotes B&quot;) from a collection of publications. A search engine is used to explore direct and indirect influence chains. Query results are substantiated with textual evidence, ranked according to their relevance, and presented in both a table-based view, as well as a network graph visualization. Our approach operates in both domain-specific settings, where there are knowledge bases and ontologies available to guide reading, and in multi-domain settings where such resources are absent. We demonstrate that this deep reading and search system reduces the effort needed to uncover &quot;undis-covered public knowledge&quot;, and that with the aid of this tool a domain expert was able to drastically reduce her model building time from months to two days.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Since at least 1990, there has been exponential growth in the number of academic papers pub- lished annually in the biomedical domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pautasso, 2012</ref>). For example, the number of En- glish language biomedical publications indexed by PubMed 1 alone since 1900 has now surpassed 25 million 2 . Over 17 million of these were published between 1990 and 2015.</p><p>Although a number of information extraction (IE) systems have been developed to mine indi- vidual facts (e.g., biochemical interactions) from these publications, there is limited work on as- sembling and interpreting these fragments. This limitation may result in solutions to critical prob- lems being overlooked, as many tasks today cross several disciplines that interact only minimally. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Swanson (1986)</ref> described this problem as "undis- covered public knowledge".</p><p>In this work, we propose a machine reading and assembly approach that facilitates connections be- tween different research efforts and research com- munities across several fields. Following past ef- forts in literature-based discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Smalheiser and Swanson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bekhuis, 2006</ref>), we introduce a modular system that performs (a) information ex- traction and assembly from publications, and (b) hypothesis exploration using a custom search en- gine that queries the knowledge graph of direct and indirect links uncovered by the machine.</p><p>We elected to focus on links that highlight influ- ence relations between two concepts (e.g., "CTCF activates FOXA1") in the biomedical domain. Im- portantly, our approach reads statements about in- fluence relations from publications, and does not attempt to verify these findings directly through separate modeling. 3 We apply our system to build influence graphs for two scenarios: (a) biomolec- ular explanations of cell signaling pathways with applications to cancer research (this is a single do- main rich with knowledge base (KB) resources to guide information extraction), and (b) factors in- fluencing children's health (this task crosses mul- tiple domains, and has limited supported from KBs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Previous Work</head><p>There is a substantial body of work addressing open-domain machine reading ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banko et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carlson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Zhang, 2015)</ref>, as well as sys- tems that target specific domains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Björne et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nédellec et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Peters et al., 2014</ref>). All of these systems read individual facts, which makes Swanson's observation even more valid to- day. Attempts have been made in the biomedi- cal domain to assemble relations extracted by ma- chine reading into coherent models . This domain is known for the com- plexity of its models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lander, 2010)</ref>, which has spurred research on improved visualizations for actionable insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Our work builds on these previous efforts by assembling complex influence graphs from the extractions of a machine reading system, and through a novel search engine that efficiently searches this graph and visualizes the results in a simple and intuitive interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head><p>Our approach consists of two stages: (a) machine reading and assembly (MRA), which produces a graph of influence relations from a collection of publications, and (b) a search engine that explores both direct and indirect connections in this graph. In this section, we describe our machine reading and assembly approach. In Section 4 we describe the search engine over this influence graph.</p><p>We introduce methods for machine reading and assembly in two scenarios: (a) a domain- specific machine reading system for molecular bi- ology, and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> an open-domain system for discov- ering factors influencing children's health. Both systems are rule-based, which has the desirable property of producing an interpretable extraction model that allows for incremental, isolated im- provements by an end user that understands the task at hand but is not a natural language process- ing (NLP), or a machine learning (ML) expert (the likely maintainer of such a system). Although the IE models we discuss in the next section are rule- based, the modular design of the system means that the graph explorer interface is agnostic of and independent to the IE component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Domain-specific Reading and Assembly</head><p>Our MRA system for the biomedical literature is called REACH (from REading and Assembling Contextual and Holistic mechanisms from text) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . This system extracts entities (e.g., proteins, other chemicals, biological processes) and events (e.g., biochemical interactions) from biomolecular lit- erature. REACH is built on top of the Odin IE framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Valenzuela-Escarcega et al., 2016)</ref> and captures 17 kinds of events, including nested events (i.e., events involving other events). The event grammars are applied in cascades composed of rules that describe patterns over both syntac- tic dependencies and token sequences, using con- straints over a token's attributes (part-of-speech tag, lemma, etc.). The system architecture is sum- marized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, and described below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entity Extraction and Resolution</head><p>Because of its focus on a single domain (molec- ular biology), REACH leverages domain-specific resources such as curated knowledge bases (e.g., Uniprot 5 for protein names, and PubChem 6 for other chemicals) to perform entity recognition and resolution.</p><p>REACH's named entity recognizer (NER) is a hybrid model that combines a rule-based compo- nent with a statistical one. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The output of the NER system is then matched against the set of knowl- edge bases in order to "ground" these textual men- tions to real-world entities through ID assignment. This grounding component enables the dedupli- cation of entity nodes during graph construction (the assembly phase). That is, all synonyms of the same protein are mapped to the same node in the influence graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Event Extraction</head><p>REACH uses a two-stage bottom-up strategy for event extraction, following biochemical seman- tics inspired by <ref type="bibr">BioPAX (Demir et al., 2010)</ref>. First, we identify biochemical reactions that op- erate directly on entities, initially ignoring their catalysts and other controllers, e.g., phosphory- lation of a protein. We call these events "sim- ple". REACH uses a domain-specific taxon- omy for specifying the selectional restrictions on event arguments. Next, nested events are cap- tured. For example, during this stage, catalysts that control simple events such as phosphory- lations are extracted. During graph construc- tion, these nested events are "flattened" into bi- nary influence links. For example, the nested in- teraction PositiveRegulation(Controller:A, Controlled:Phosphorylation(B)) is reduced to A → B, where the arrow indicates a left-to-right influence relation. Additionally, these links pre- serve the type (e.g., phosphorylation) and polarity of the biochemical interaction, e.g., a positive reg- ulation is equivalent to a "promotes" link, whereas a negative regulation reduces to "inhibits". 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coreference Resolution and Negation</head><p>The coreference resolution component in REACH adapts the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lee et al. (2013)</ref> to the biomedical domain, where it operates both over entity mentions (e.g., by resolving pronominal and nominal mentions such as "it" or "this protein" to the corresponding entity) and event mentions (e.g., "this interaction" is resolved to an actual event) ( .</p><p>The negation detection module identifies ex- plicit statements that a reaction does not oc- cur (e.g., "ZAP70 does not induce TRIM phos- phorylation") in a particular experimental con- text. REACH also handles more subtle linguis- tic phenomena such as reversing the polarity of events. For example, the naive interpretation of the text "decreased PTPN13 expression enhances EphrinB1 phosphorylation" yields a positive reg- ulation (due to "enhances"). The polarity correc- tion module changes this to a negative regulation due to the presence of the "decreased" modifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multi-domain Reading and Assembly</head><p>Our second use case for MRA models children's health, which involves complex influence chains that span multiple levels of abstraction, linking low-level biomolecular processes with nutritional and socio-economic issues.</p><p>In such a setting, comprehensive resources are unavailable. Unlike in REACH, we cannot rely on a taxonomy to guide our extractions. While incomplete resources are available for a subset of the covered domains, we treat this use case as an opportunity to explore what can be extracted and assembled when no knowledge base is available for entity recognition or resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entity Extraction</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banko et al. (2007)</ref>, we instead con- sider expanded noun phrases as a coarse approx- imation of the concepts we wish to link. Start- ing at each noun, we traverse amod, advmod, ccmod, dobj, nn, vmod, and prep_ * Stanford collapsed dependency relations and promote only the longest span to our pool of candidate concepts. For example, starting at infections in "viral infec- tions among infants are [. . . ]", the expansion pro- cedure produces viral infections among infants as a candidate entity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Event Extraction and Resolution</head><p>For event extraction, we adapted the REACH grammars that capture influence state- ments (e.g., positive and negative regulations) to the current task by removing selectional restric- tions on the arguments of each event predicate. That is, we extract any lexicalized variation of "A causes B" where A and B are entities identified in the previous step. Matches to these rules pro- duce a directed influence relation that maintains polarity (i.e., increase or decrease). Any mention that is detected as being negated (e.g., "X was not found to increase Y") is discarded from further consideration.</p><p>Surviving edges are consolidated through a conservative deduplication procedure where two edges are considered identical if and only if the set of lemmatized content terms 9 for corresponding source-destination concepts between two edges is identical (e.g., "children's stunting" = "stunted children"). When merging duplicates, textual provenance of the extractions is aggregated. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Function words are ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>105</head><p>Conventional visualization of any sufficiently complex network suffers from the "hairball" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lander, 2010</ref>) problem. To mitigate this obfuscation, we introduce a search user interface (UI) 10 that al- lows for structured queries where a user can ex- plore the influence neighborhood around a CAUSE and/or EFFECT to a configurable distance in terms of "hops" in the graph. Alternatively, the user may choose to explore direct and indirect chains of in- fluence linking a possible CAUSE and EFFECT pair (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> for a detailed description of the UI).</p><p>As the pool of analyzed documents grows, pos- sible connections may become so numerous that the results of a query could overwhelm a user. For this reason, we rank query results using a rele- vance score designed to bring surprising findings to the attention of the user. The scoring procedure is discussed in Section 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Estimating Event Relevance</head><p>In order to rank the results of extraction by an estimate of their relative novelty, each dedupli- cated edge is scored according to a relevance met- ric based on the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the lemmatized terms in its concept nodes. We provide several scores for each edge, which differ by (a) whether or not the score incorporates all of the terms in the source and destination concepts or only their head lemmas, and (b) whether the score is an average or maximum. IDF scores were calcu- lated for the lemma of each term in the vocabulary using the entire open access subset of PubMed. To simplify ranking, the scores were normalized us- ing the maximum IDF possible for the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Influence Graphs</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, we show an example of output for our domain-specific IE system (see §3.1). The output demonstrates the system's ability to capture chains of biomolecular interactions. Output for our open domain IE system (see §3.2) is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, which showcases the system's ability to uncover indirect links between concepts across domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>An early version of this system was evaluated by a biologist who used the tool to augment her model <ref type="bibr">10</ref> More information on this system can be found at http://clulab.cs.arizona.edu/demos/ influence-search building process for the topic of children's health. The biologist provided the system a set of terms as input. The terms were used to formulate a in- formation retrieval query against the open access subset of PubMed to identify papers relevant to her use case. We then extracted influence rela- tions from the retrieved documents and presented the ranked results to the biologist.</p><p>Through her exploration, the biologist refined her search terms of interest and the process was repeated for three cycles over two days. The re- sult was a model containing 35 core concepts such as "EBF", "improved water access", and "govern- ment subsidy", and 48 directed influence relations holding between these concepts (e.g., rapid ur- banization PROMOTES (availability of) cheap pro- cessed food). Importantly, all influence relations incorporated in her model were substantiated by evidence from the literature.</p><p>According to the biologist, the system reduced the model building process from months to two days, remarking that "finding one of these links manually may well take 1-3 days -sometimes one is lucky and comes across a review paper where someone has already drawn a fairly mature mental model -but filling in the details and making sure they are not biased can take much longer." We consider this success as a first step toward bridg- ing research islands through Swanson linking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We introduced a search engine that operates over influence graphs that were automatically mined from scientific literature. Our approach consists of two high-level components. The first compo- nent is a machine reading and assembly system that extracts entities of interest and influence re- lations that hold between them (e.g., "promotes" or "inhibits"). The reading system can operate in both domain-specific settings, where there are knowledge bases that can support reading (e.g., lists of protein names), and in multi-domain set- tings where such resources are not available. The second component of our approach is a search en- gine interface that allows the user to explore not by keywords, but by direct and indirect influence pat- terns. The results are displayed in a network graph format depicting the subgraph matching the query, and in a table-based view that lists the match- ing influence relations in descending order of rel- evance. Through a user study we demonstrated  that this deep reading and search approach reduces the effort needed to uncover "undiscovered public knowledge" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Swanson, 1986)</ref>. With the aid of this tool, a domain expert reduced her model building time from months to two days.</p><p>In future work, we will strengthen our assem- bly approach by improving node and edge dedu- plication. This remains a challenging problem in the multi-domain setting where comprehensive knowledge bases are not available. For exam- ple, minimal pairs differing in a single modifier such as "acute diarrhea" vs. "chronic diarrhea" have clinical definitions with clear distinctions.</p><p>Care must be taken in determining which syntac- tic constituents (e.g., prepositional phrases) can be safely ignored during comparisons. Additionally, we plan to add a context filter to the search fields, which will allow the user to focus results by con- text, e.g., "show results just for pancreatic can- cer", or "show impact factors to children's health in Sudan." <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: A sample of the top 50 indirect connections between pollution and disease.
