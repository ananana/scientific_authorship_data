				<p>Neural network based models commonly regard event detection as a word-wise classification task, which suffer from the mis-match problem between words and event triggers, especially in languages without natural word delimiters such as Chinese. In this paper, we propose Nugget Proposal Networks (NPNs), which can solve the word-trigger mismatch problem by directly proposing entire trigger nuggets centered at each character regardless of word boundaries. Specifically, NPNs perform event detection in a character-wise paradigm, where a hybrid representation for each character is first learned to capture both structural and semantic information from both characters and words. Then based on learned representations, trigger nuggets are proposed and categorized by exploiting character compositional structures of Chinese event triggers. Experiments on both ACE2005 and TAC KBP 2017 datasets show that NPNs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Automatic event extraction is a fundamental task of information extraction. Event detection, which aims to identify event triggers of specific types, is a key step of event extraction. For example, from the sentence "Henry was injured, and then passed away soon", an event detection system should detect an "Injure" event triggered by "injured", and a "Die" event triggered by "passed away".</p><p>Recently, neural network methods, which trans- form event detection into a word-wise classifica- tion paradigm, have achieved significant progress in event detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nguyen and Grishman, 2015</ref>; </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>那个/ 受/ 了/ 伤/ 的/ 士兵/ 不治/ 身亡/ 。</head><p>The company acquired and merged with a number of companies. Chen et al., 2015b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ghaeini et al., 2016)</ref>. For instance, a model will detect events in sentence "Henry was injured" by successively classifying its three words into NIL, NIL and Injure. By automatically extracting features from raw texts, these methods rely little on prior knowledge and achieved promising results.</p><p>Unfortunately, word-wise event detection mod- els suffer from the word-trigger mismatch prob- lem, because a number of triggers do not ex- actly match with a word. Specifically, a trigger can be part of a word or cross multiple words, which is impossible to detect using word-wise models. This problem is more severe in lan- guages without natural word delimiters such as Chinese. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> (a) shows several examples of part-of-word triggers, where two characters in one word "¿"(acquire and merge) trigger two different events: a "Merge Org" event triggered by "¿"(merge) and a "Transfer Ownership" event triggered by "" (acquire). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> (b) shows a multi-word trigger, where three words "É"(is), "" and "ú"(injured) trigger an Injure event together. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the statistics of differ- ent types of word-trigger match on two standard datasets. We can see that word-trigger mismatch is crucial for Chinese event detection since nearly 25% of triggers in RichERE and 15% of them in ACE2005 dataset don't exactly match with a word.</p><p>To resolve the word-trigger mismatch problem,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Match Type Rich ERE ACE2005</head><p>Exact Match 75.52% 85.39% Part of Word 19.55% 11.67% Cross words 4.93% 2.94% <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Percentages of different types of matches between words and triggers.</p><p>this paper proposes Nugget Proposal Networks (NPNs), which identify triggers by modeling char- acter compositional structures of trigger nuggets regardless of word boundaries. Given a sentence, NPNs regard characters as basic detecting units and are able to 1) directly propose the entire poten- tial trigger nugget at each character by exploiting inner compositional structure of triggers; 2) ef- fectively categorize proposed triggers by learning semantic representation from both characters and words. For example, at character "ú"(injured) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> (b), NPNs are not only capable to detect it is part of an Injure event trigger, but also can propose the entire trigger nugget "É ú"(is injured). The main idea behind NPNs is that most Chinese triggers have regular character com- positional structure ( . Concretely, most of Chinese event triggers have one central character which can indicate its event type, e.g. "à"(kill) in "l à"(kill by shooting). Further- more, characters are composed into a trigger based on regular compositional structures, e.g. "manner + verb" for "là"(kill by shooting), "và"(hack to death), as well as "verb + auxiliary + noun" for "Éú"(is injured) and "E‹"(beaten). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows the architecture of NPNs. Given a character in sentence, a hybrid representation learning module is first used to learn its semantic representation from both characters and words in the sentence. This hybrid representation is then fed into two modules: one is trigger nugget gen- erator, which proposes the entire potential trigger nugget by exploiting inner character composition- al structure. Once a trigger is proposed, an event type classifier is applied to determine its event type. Compared with previous methods, NPNs mainly have following advantages: 1) By directly proposing the entire trig- ger nugget centered at a character, trigger nugget generator can effectively resolve the word-trigger mismatch problem. First, using characters as basic units, NPNs will not suf- fer from the word-trigger mismatch problem of word-wise methods. Furthermore, by modeling and exploiting character compositional structure  of triggers, our model is more error-tolerant to character-wise classification errors than traditional character-based models, as shown in Section 4.4.</p><p>2) By summarizing information from both characters and words, our hybrid represen- tation can effectively capture information for both inner character composition and accurate event categorization. For example, the inner compositional structure of trigger "là"(kill by shooting) can be learned from the character-level sequence. Besides, characters are often ambigu- ous, therefore the accurate representations must take their word context into consideration. For example, the representation "à"(kill) in " l à"(kill by shooting) should be different from its representation in "à""(completed).</p><p>We conducted experiments on both the ACE2005 and the TAC KBP 2017 Event Nugget Detection datasets. Experiment results show that NPNs can effectively solve the word-mismatch problem, and therefore significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Hybrid Representation Learning</head><p>Given a sentence, NPNs will first learn a represen- tation for each character, then the representation is fed into downstream modules. We observe that both characters and words contain rich in- formation for Chinese event detection: characters reveals the inner compositional structure of event  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Token-level feature extractor, where PE is relative positional embeddings and WE is word embeddings. The concerning token is "¿".</p><p>triggers ( ), while words can provide more accurate and less ambiguous semantics than characters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen et al., 2015a</ref>). For example, character-level information can tell us that "l à"(kill by shooting) is a trigger constructed of regular pattern "manner + verb". While word- level sequences can provide more explicit in- formation when we distinguish the semantics of "à"(kill) in this context with that character in other words like "à""(completed). Therefore, we propose to learn a hybrid repre- sentation which can summarize information from both characters and words. Specifically, we first learn two separate character-level and word-level representations using token-level neural networks. Then we design three kinds of hybrid paradigms to obtain the hybrid representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Token-level Representation Learning</head><p>Two token-level neural networks are used to ex- tract features from characters and words respec- tively. The network architecture is similar to <ref type="bibr">DMCNN (Chen et al., 2015b)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows a word-level example. Given n tokens t 1 , t 2 , ..., t n in the sentence and the concerning token t c , let x i be the concatenation of the word embedding of t i and the embedding of t i 's relative position to t c , a convolutional layer with window size as h is introduced to capture compositional semantics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">rij = tanh(wi · x j:j+h−1 + bi)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here x i:i+j refers to the concatenation of embed- dings from x i to x i+j , w i is the i-th filter of the convolutional layer, b i ∈ R is a bias term. Then a dynamic multi-pooling layer is applied to preserve important signals of different parts of the sentence: After that we concatenate r lef t i and r right i from all feature maps, as well as the embeddings of tokens nearing to t c to obtain the word-level repre- sentation f word of t c . Using the same procedure to character sequences, we can obtain the character- level representation f char .</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r lef t i = max j&lt;c rij, r right i = max j≥c rij (2) f C f ' char z G f G f N f T z N z T f ' word f ' char f ' word f ' char f ' word (a) Concat Hybrid (b) General Hybrid (c) Task-specific Hybrid</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hybrid Representation Learning</head><p>So far we have both character-level feature repre- sentation f char and word-level feature representa- tion f word . This section describes how we mix them up to obtain a hybrid representation. Before this, we first project f char and f word respectively into the same vector space using two dense layers, and we represent the projected d -dimensional vectors as f char and f word . Then we design three different paradigms to mix them up: Concat Hybrid, General Hybrid and Task-specific Hybrid, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>Concat Hybrid is the most simple method, which simply concatenates character-level and word-level representations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f C = f char ⊕ f word (3)</formula><p>This simple approach doesn't introduce any addi- tional parameter, but we find it very effective in our experiments. General Hybrid aims to learn a shared hybrid representation for both trigger nugget proposal and event type classification. Specifically, we design a gated structure to model the information flow from f char and f word to the general hybrid feature representation f G :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">z G = s(W GH f char + U GH f word + b GH ) (4) f G = z G f char + (1 − z G )f word (5)</formula><p>Here s is the sigmoid function, W GH ∈ R d ×d and U GH ∈ R d ×d are weight matrix, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">b GH ∈ R d is the bias term. z G is a d - dimensional</formula><p>vector whose values represent the contribution of f char and f word to the final hybrid representation, which models the importance of individual features in the given contexts.</p><p>As two downstream modules of NPNs have individual functions, they might hold different requirements to the input features. Intuitively, trigger nugget generator depends more on fine- grained character-level features. In contrast, word- level features might play more important roles in the event type classifier since it is enriched with more explicit semantics. As a result, a unified representation may be insufficient and it is better to learn task-specific hybrid representations.</p><p>Task-specific Hybrid is proposed to tackle this problem, where two gates are introduced for two modules respectively. Formally, we learn one representation for the trigger nugget generator and one for event type classifier as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">z N = s(W N f char + U N f word + b N )<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">z T = s(W T f char + U T f word + b T )<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">f N = z N f char + (1 − z N )f word (8) f T = z T f char + (1 − z T )f word<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Here f N and f T are hybrid features for the trigger nugget generator and the event type classifier re- spectively and the meanings of other parameters are similar to the ones in Equation <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> and (5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Nugget Proposal Networks</head><p>Given the hybrid representation of a character in a sentence, the goal of NPNs is to propose the potential trigger nugget, as well as to identify its corresponding event type at each character. For example in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, centered at the character "ú"(injured), NPNs need to propose "Éú"(is injured) as the entire trigger nugget and identify its event type as "Injure". For this, NPNs are equipped with two modules: one is called trigger nugget generator, which is used to propose the potential trigger nugget containing the concerning character by exploiting character compositional structures of triggers. Another module, named as event type classifier, is used to determine the specific type of this event once a trigger nugget is detected. Figure 5: Our trigger nugget generator. For each character, there are 7 candidate nuggets including "NIL" if the maximum length of nuggets is 3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">那 受 了 伤 的 士 兵 3 3 受了伤 0.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Trigger Nugget Generator</head><p>Chinese event triggers have regular inner com- positional structures, e.g. "É ú"(is injured) and "E ‹"(is beaten) have the same "verb + auxiliary + noun" structure, and "l à"(kill by shooting) and "à"(kill by shooting) share the same "manner + verb" pattern. If a model is able to learn this compositional structure reg- ularity, it can effectively detect trigger nuggets at characters. Recent advances have presented that convolutional neural networks are effective at capturing and predicting the region information in object detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ren et al., 2015</ref>) and semantic segmentation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">He et al., 2017)</ref>, which reveals the strong ability of CNNs to learning spatial and po- sitional information. Inspired by this, we propose a neural network based trigger nugget generator, which is expected to not only be able to predict whether a character belongs to a trigger nugget, but also can point out the entire trigger nugget. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> is an illustration of our trigger nugget generator. Hybrid representation f N for con- cerning character is first learned as described in Section 2, which is then fed into a fully-connected layer to compute the scores for different possible trigger nuggets containing that character:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">O G = W G f N + b G<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where O G ∈ R d N and d N is the amount of candidate nuggets plus one "NIL" label indicating this character doesn't belong to an trigger. Given the maximum length L of trigger nuggets, there are L 2 +L 2 possible nuggets containing a specific character, as we shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. In both ACE and Rich ERE corpus, more than 98.5% triggers contain no more than 3 characters, so for a specific character we consider 6 candidate nuggets and thus d N = 7. We expect NPNs to give a high score to a nugget if it follows a regular compositional structure of triggers. For example in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, "É ú"(is injured) follows the compositional pattern of "verb + auxiliary + noun", therefore a high score is given to the category where "ú" is at the 3 rd place of a nugget with a length of 3. By contrast "ú" does not match a regular pattern, then the score for "ú" at the 2 nd place of a nugget with a length of 2 will be low in this context.</p><p>After obtaining the scores for each nugget, a softmax layer is applied to normalize the scores:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P (y G i |x; θ) = e O G i d N j=1 e O G j<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where O G i is the i-the element in O G and θ is the model parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Event Type Classifier</head><p>The event type classifier aims to identify whether the given character in the given context will ex- hibit an event type. Once we detect an event trigger nugget at one character, the hybrid feature f T extracted previously is then feed into a neural network classifier, which further determines the specific type of this trigger. Following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chen and Ng, 2012)</ref>, our event type classi- fier directly classifies nuggets into event subtypes, while ignores the hierarchy between event types.</p><p>Formally, given the hybrid feature vector f T of input x, a fully-connected layer is applied to compute its scores assigned to each event subtype:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">O C = W C f T + b C<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where O C ∈ R d T and d T is the number of event subtypes. Then similar to the trigger nugget generator, a softmax layer is introduced:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P (y C i |x; θ) = e O C i d T j=1 e O C j<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where O C i is the i-th element in O C , representing the score for i-th subtype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Dealing with Conflicts between Proposed Nuggets</head><p>While NPNs directly propose nugget at each char- acter, there might exists conflicts between pro- posed nuggets at different characters. Generally speaking, there are two types of conflicts: (i) NIL/trigger conflict, which means NPNs propose a trigger nugget at one character, but classify other character in that nugget into "NIL" (e.g., proposing nugget "Éú"(is injured) at "É" and output "NIL" at ""); (ii) overlapped conflict, i.e., proposing two overlapped nuggets (e.g., proposing nugget "Éú"(is injured) at "É" and nugget "ú" at "ú"). But we find that overlapped conflict is very rare because NPNs is very effective in capturing positional knowledge and the main chal- lenge of event detection is to distinguish triggers from non-triggers. Therefore in this paper, we employ a redundant prediction strategy by simply adding all proposed nuggets into results and ignoring "NIL" predic- tions. For example, if NPNs successively propose "É ú"(is injured), "NIL", " ú" from "É ú", then we will ignore the "NIL" and add both two other nuggets into result. We found such a redundant prediction paradigm is an advan- tage of our model. Compared with conventional character-based models, even NPNs mistakenly classified character " 0into "NIL0, we can still accurately detect trigger "Éú"(is injured) if we can predict the entire nugget at character "É0or "ú0. This redundant prediction makes our model more error-tolerant to character-wise classification errors, as verified in Section 4.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Model Learning</head><p>To train the trigger nugget generator, we regard all characters included in trigger nuggets as positive training instances, and randomly sample charac- ters not in any trigger as negative instances and label them as "NIL". Suppose we have T G train- ing examples in S G = {(x k , y G k )|k = 1, 2, ...T G } to train the trigger nugget generator, as well as T C examples in S C = {(x k , y C k )|k = 1, 2, ...T C } to train the event type classifier, we can define the loss function L(θ) as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">L(θ) = − (x k ,y G k )∈S G log P (y G k |x k ; θ) − (x k ,y C k )∈S C log P (y C k |x k ; θ)<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where θ is parameters in NPNs. Since all modules in NPNs are differentiable, any gradient-based algorithms can be applied to minimize L(θ).</p></div>

We conducted a supplementary exper- iment by replacing our trigger nugget generator and event type classifier with an IOB encoding labeling layer. We call this system NPN(IOB). Besides, we also compared the result with F- BRNN(Char), which proposes candidate trigger nuggets according to an external trigger   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows the results on KBP2017Eval. We can see that NPN(Task-specific) outperforms other methods significantly. We believe this is because: 1) FBRNN(Char) only regards tokens in the candidate table as potential trigger nuggets, which limits the choice of possible trigger nuggets and results in a very low recall rate.</p><p>2) To accurately identify a trigger, NPN(IOB) and conventional character-based methods require all characters in a trigger being classified correctly, which is very challenging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zeng et al., 2016</ref>): many characters appear in a trigger nugget will not serve as a part of a trigger nugget in the majority of contexts, thus they will be easily classified into "NIL". For the first example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, NPN(IOB) was unable to fully recognize the trig- ger nugget "å &gt;"(congratulatory message) be- cause character "å"(congratulatory) doesn't of- ten serve as part of "PhoneWrite" trigger. In fact, "å" serves as a "NIL" in the majority of similar contexts, e.g., "åU"(congratulation) and "6å"(congratulation).</p><p>3) NPNs are able to handle above problems. First, NPNs doesn't rely on candidate tables to generate potential triggers, which guarantees a good generalization ability. Second, NPNs pro- pose the entire trigger nugget at each charac- ter, such a redundant prediction paradigm makes NPNs more error-tolerant to character-level errors. For example, even might mistakenly classify "å" into "NIL", NPNs can still identify the correct nugget "å&gt;" at character "&gt;" because "&gt;" is a common part of "PhoneWrite" event trigger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Influence of Word-Trigger Mismatch</head><p>This subsection investigates the effects of resolv- ing the word-trigger mismatch problem using dif- ferent methods. According to different types of word-trigger match, we split KBP2017Eval test set into three parts: Exact, Part-of-Word, Cross- Words, which are as defined in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Recall rates on three word-trigger match splits on KBP2017Eval Trigger Identification task. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the recall of different methods on each split. NPN(Task-specific) significantly out- perform other baselines when trigger-word mis- match exists. This verified that NPNs can resolve different cases of word-trigger mismatch problems robustly, meanwhile retain high performance on exact match cases. In contrast, NPN(IOB) can not</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Sentence DMCNN NPN(IOB) NPN Correct å å å&gt; &gt; &gt;/©/Xe,... Full congratulatory message:... (å&gt;,PhoneWrite) (&gt;,PhoneWrite) (å&gt;,PhoneWrite) (å&gt;,PhoneWrite)</formula><p>k k kú ú ú//¤k/¬W... all soldiers died and injured... exactly detect boundaries of trigger nuggets, thus has a low recall on all splits. Conventional DM- CNN regards words as potential triggers, which means it can only identify triggers that exactly match with words. As the second example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, word "kú"(dead or injured) as a whole has never been annotated as a trigger, so DMCNN is unable to recognize it at all. Errata replacing can only solve some of the part-of-word mismatch problem, but it can not handle the cases where one word contains multiple triggers(e.g., "kú" in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>) and the cases that a trigger crosses multiple words.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">None (k,Die) (ú,Injure) (k,Die) (ú,Injure) (k,Die) (ú,Injure)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Effects of Hybrid Representation</head><p>This section analyzed the effect of feature hybrid in NPNs. First, from <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we can see that Task-specific Hybrid method achieved the best performance in both datasets. Surprisingly, simple Concat Hybrid outperforms the General Hybrid approach. We believe this is because the trigger nugget generator and the event type classifier rely on different information, and therefore using one unified gate is not enough. And Task-specific Hy- brid uses two different task-specific gates which can satisfy both sides, thus resulting in the best overall performance.</p><p>Furthermore, to investigate the necessary of using hybrid features, an auxiliary experiment, called NPN(Char), was conducted by removing word-level features from NPNs. Also, we com- pared with the model removing character-level features, which is the original DMCNN(Word).  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Results of using different representation on Trigger Classification task on KBP2017Eval. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the experiment results. We can see that neither character-level or word- level representation can achieve competitive re- sults with the NPNs. This verified the necessity of hybrid representation. Besides, we can see that NPN(Char) outperforms other character-level methods in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, which further confirms that our trigger nugget generator is still effective even only using character-level information.</p></div>

Experiment results have shown that our method significantly outperforms conventional methods.</p><p>Because the mismatch between words and ex- traction units is a common problem in information extraction, we believe our method can also be applied to many other languages and tasks for exploiting inner composition structure during ex- traction, such as Named Entity Recognition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Die 这家/ 公司/ 并购/ 了/ 多家/ 公司/ 。 Injure Transfer_Ownership Merge_Organization The injured solider died.</figDesc></figure>
