				<p>The large and growing amounts of online scholarly data present both challenges and opportunities to enhance knowledge discovery. One such challenge is to automatically extract a small set of keyphrases from a document that can accurately describe the document&apos;s content and can facilitate fast information processing. In this paper, we propose PositionRank, an unsupervised model for keyphrase extraction from scholarly documents that incorporates information from all positions of a word&apos;s occurrences into a biased PageR-ank. Our model obtains remarkable improvements in performance over PageR-ank models that do not take into account word positions as well as over strong base-lines for this task. Specifically, on several datasets of research papers, PositionRank achieves improvements as high as 29.09%.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The current Scholarly Web contains many millions of scientific documents. For example, Google Scholar is estimated to have more than 100 million documents. On one hand, these rapidly-growing scholarly document collections offer benefits for knowledge discovery, and on the other hand, find- ing useful information has become very challeng- ing. Keyphrases associated with a document typi- cally provide a high-level topic description of the document and can allow for efficient information processing. In addition, keyphrases are shown to be rich sources of information in many natu- ral language processing and information retrieval tasks such as scientific paper summarization, clas- sification, recommendation, clustering, and search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Qazvinian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jones and Staveley, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zha, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hammouda et al., 2005</ref>). Due to their importance, many approaches to keyphrase extrac- tion have been proposed in the literature along two lines of research: supervised and unsupervised <ref type="bibr">Ng, 2014, 2010</ref>).</p><p>In the supervised line of research, keyphrase extraction is formulated as a binary classification problem, where candidate phrases are classified as either positive (i.e., keyphrases) or negative (i.e., non-keyphrases) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Frank et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hulth, 2003)</ref>. Various feature sets and classification algorithms yield different extraction systems. For example, Frank et al. (1999) developed a system that ex- tracts two features for each candidate phrase, i.e., the tf-idf of the phrase and its distance from the be- ginning of the target document, and uses them as input to Na¨ıveNa¨ıve Bayes classifiers. Although super- vised approaches typically perform better than un- supervised approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kim et al., 2013)</ref>, the re- quirement for large human-annotated corpora for each field of study has led to significant attention towards the design of unsupervised approaches.</p><p>In the unsupervised line of research, keyphrase extraction is formulated as a ranking problem with graph-based ranking techniques being considered state-of-the-art ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hasan and Ng, 2014</ref>). These graph-based techniques construct a word graph from each target document, such that nodes cor- respond to words and edges correspond to word association patterns. Nodes are then ranked us- ing graph centrality measures such as PageRank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al., 2010)</ref> or HITS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Litvak and Last, 2008)</ref>, and the top ranked phrases are returned as keyphrases. Since their introduction, many graph-based extensions have been proposed, which aim at modeling various types of information. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao (2008)</ref> proposed a model that incorporates a local</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factorizing Personalized Markov Chains for Next-Basket Recommendation by Steffen Rendle, Christoph Freudenthaler and Lars Schmidt-Thieme</head><p>Recommender systems are an important component of many websites. Two of the most popular ap- proaches are based on matrix factorization (MF) and Markov chains (MC). MF methods learn the general taste of a user by factorizing the matrix over observed user-item preferences. <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref> we present a method bringing both approaches together. Our method is based on personalized transition graphs over underlying Markov chains. [...] our factorized personalized MC (FPMC) model subsumes both a common Markov chain and the normal matrix factorization model. <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref> we introduce an adaption of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework for sequential basket data. <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref> Author-input keyphrases: Basket Recommendation, Markov Chain, Matrix Factorization neighborhood of the target document correspond- ing to its textually-similar documents, computed using the cosine similarity between the tf-idf vec- tors of documents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al. (2010)</ref> assumed a mixture of topics over documents and proposed to use topic models to decompose these topics in order to select keyphrases from all major topics. Keyphrases are then ranked by aggregating the topic-specific scores obtained from several topic- biased PageRanks. We posit that other information can be leveraged that has the potential to improve unsupervised keyphrase extraction.</p><p>For example, in a scholarly domain, keyphrases generally occur on positions very close to the be- ginning of a document and occur frequently. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref> shows an anecdotal example illustrating this behavior using the 2010 best paper award win- ner in the World Wide Web conference. The au- thor input keyphrases are marked with red bold in the figure. Notice in this example the high fre- quency of the keyphrase "Markov chain" that oc- curs very early in the document (even from its ti- tle). Hence, can we design an effective unsuper- vised approach to keyphrase extraction by jointly exploiting words' position information and their frequency in documents? We specifically address this question using research papers as a case study. The result of this extraction task will aid indexing of documents in digital libraries, and hence, will lead to improved organization, search, retrieval, and recommendation of scientific documents. The importance of keyphrase extraction from research papers is also emphasized by the SemEval Shared Tasks on this topic from 2017 <ref type="bibr">1 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">2010 (Kim et al., 2010)</ref>. Our contributions are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task10/</formula><p>• We propose an unsupervised graph-based model, called PositionRank, that incorporates information from all positions of a word's oc- currences into a biased PageRank to score keywords that are later used to score and rank keyphrases in research papers.</p><p>• We show that PositionRank that aggregates information from all positions of a word's oc- currences performs better than a model that uses only the first position of a word.</p><p>• We experimentally evaluate PositionRank on three datasets of research papers and show statistically significant improvements over PageRank-based models that do not take into account word positions, as well as over strong baselines for keyphrase extraction.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We summarize related work in the next section. Po- sitionRank is described in Section 3. We then present the datasets of research papers, and our experiments and results in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Many supervised and unsupervised approaches to keyphrase extraction have been proposed in the lit- erature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hasan and Ng, 2014</ref>). Supervised approaches use annotated docu- ments with "correct" keyphrases to train clas- sifiers for discriminating keyphrases from non- keyphrases for a document. KEA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Frank et al., 1999</ref>) and GenEx <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Turney, 2000</ref>) are two repre- sentative supervised approaches with the most im- portant features being the frequency and the po- sition of a phrase in a target document. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hulth (2003)</ref> used a combination of lexical and syn- tactic features such as the collection frequency and the part-of-speech tag of a phrase in conjunc- tion with a bagging technique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nguyen and Kan (2007)</ref> extended KEA to include features such as the distribution of candidate phrases in different sections of a research paper, and the acronym sta- tus of a phrase. In a different work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Medelyan et al. (2009)</ref> extended KEA to integrate information from Wikipedia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lopez and Romary (2010)</ref> used bagged decision trees learned from a combination of features including structural features (e.g., the presence of a phrase in particular sections of a document) and lexical features (e.g., the presence of a candidate phrase in WordNet or Wikipedia). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chuang et al. (2012)</ref> proposed a model that in- corporates a set of statistical and linguistic fea- tures (e.g., tf-idf, BM25, part-of-speech filters) for identifying descriptive terms in a text. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Caragea et al. (2014a)</ref> designed features based on informa- tion available in a document network (such as a citation network) and used them with traditional features in a supervised framework.</p><p>In unsupervised approaches, various measures such as tf-idf and topic proportions are used to score words, which are later aggregated to ob- tain scores for phrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barker and Cornacchia, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Liu et al., 2009</ref>). The ranking based on tf-idf has been shown to work well in practice <ref type="bibr">Ng, 2014, 2010)</ref>, de- spite its simplicity. Graph-based ranking meth- ods and centrality measures are considered state- of-the-art for unsupervised keyphrase extraction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mihalcea and Tarau (2004)</ref> proposed TextRank for scoring keyphrases by applying PageRank on a word graph built from adjacent words within a document. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao (2008)</ref> extended Tex- tRank to SingleRank by adding weighted edges between words that co-occur in a window of vari- able size w ≥ 2. Textually-similar neighboring documents are included in ExpandRank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao, 2008)</ref> to compute more accurate word co- occurrence information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gollapalli and Caragea (2014)</ref> extended ExpandRank to integrate infor- mation from citation networks where papers cite one another. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lahiri et al. (2014)</ref> extracted keyphrases from documents using various centrality measures such as node degree, clustering coefficient and close- ness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Martinez-Romo et al. (2016)</ref> used informa- tion from WordNet to enrich the semantic relation- ships between the words in the graph.</p><p>Several unsupervised approaches leverage word clustering techniques such as first grouping can- didate words into topics and then, extracting one representative keyphrase from each topic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Liu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bougouin et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al. (2010)</ref> extended topic-biased PageRank <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Haveliwala, 2003</ref>) to kephrase extraction. In particular, they decomposed a document into multiple topics, using topic models, and applied a separate topic- biased PageRank for each topic. The PageRank scores from each topic were then combined into a single score, using as weights the topic propor- tions returned by topic models for the document.</p><p>The best performing keyphrase extraction sys- tem in SemEval 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(El-Beltagy and Rafea, 2010</ref>) used statistical observations such as term frequencies to filter out phrases that are unlikely to be keyphrases. More precisely, thresholding on the frequency of phrases is applied, where the thresholds are estimated from the data. The candi- date phrases are then ranked using the tf-idf model in conjunction with a boosting factor which aims at reducing the bias towards single word terms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Danesh et al. (2015)</ref> computed an initial weight for each phrase based on a combination of sta- tistical heuristics such as the tf-idf score and the first position of a phrase in a document. Phrases and their initial weights are then incorporated into a graph-based algorithm which produces the final ranking of keyphrase candidates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Le et al. (2016)</ref> showed that the extraction of keyphrases from a document can benefit from considering candidate phrases with part of speech tags other than nouns or adjectives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adar and Datta (2015)</ref> extracted keyphrases by mining abbreviations from scien- tific literature and built a semantically hierarchi- cal keyphrase database. Word embedding vectors were also employed to measure the relatedness be- tween words in graph based models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wang et al., 2014</ref>). Many of the above approaches, both su- pervised and unsupervised, are compared and an- alyzed in the ACL survey on keyphrase extraction by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hasan and Ng (2014)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to the above approaches, we pro- pose PositionRank, aimed at capturing both highly frequent words or phrases and their position in a document. Despite that the relative position of a word in a document is shown to be a very effective feature in supervised keyphrase extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hulth, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhang et al., 2007)</ref>, to our knowledge, the position information has not been used before in unsupervised methods. The strong contribution of this paper is the design of a position-biased PageR- ank model that successfully incorporates all posi- tions of a word's occurrences, which is different from supervised models that use only the first po- sition of a word. Our model assigns higher proba- bilities to words found early on in a document in- stead of using a uniform distribution over words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed Model</head><p>In this section, we describe PositionRank, our fully unsupervised, graph-based model, that si- multaneously incorporates the position of words and their frequency in a document to compute a biased PageRank score for each candidate word. Graph-based ranking algorithms such as PageR- ank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Page et al., 1998</ref>) measure the importance of a vertex within a graph by taking into account global information computed recursively from the entire graph. For each word, we compute a weight by aggregating information from all positions of the word's occurrences. This weight is then incor- porated into a biased PageRank algorithm in order to assign a different "preference" to each word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">PositionRank</head><p>The PositionRank algorithm involves three essen- tial steps: (1) the graph construction at word level; (2) the design of Position-Biased PageRank; and (3) the formation of candidate phrases. These steps are detailed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Graph Construction</head><p>Let d be a target document for extracting keyphrases. We first apply the part-of-speech filter using the NLP Stanford toolkit and then select as candidate words only nouns and adjectives, simi- lar to previous works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao, 2008)</ref>. We build a word graph G = (V, E) for d such that each unique word that passes the part-of-speech filter corresponds to a node in G. Two nodes v i and v j are con- nected by an edge (v i , v j ) ∈ E if the words cor- responding to these nodes co-occur within a win- dow of w contiguous tokens in the content of d. The weight of an edge (v i , v j ) ∈ E is computed based on the co-occurrence count of the two words within a window of w successive tokens in d. Note that the graph can be constructed both directed and undirected. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mihalcea and Tarau (2004)</ref> showed that the type of graph used to represent the text does not significantly influence the per- formance of keyphrase extraction. Hence, in this work, we build undirected graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Position-Biased PageRank</head><p>Formally, let G be an undirected graph constructed as above and let M be its adjacency matrix. An element m ij ∈ M is set to the weight of edge (v i , v j ) if there exist an edge between nodes v i and v j , and is set to 0 otherwise. The PageRank score of a node v i is recursively computed by sum- ming the normalized scores of nodes v j , which are linked to v i (as explained below).</p><p>Let S denote the vector of PageRank scores, for all v i ∈ V . The initial values of S are set to 1 |V | . The PageRank score of each node at step t+1, can then be computed recursively using:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S(t + 1) = M · S(t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where M is the normalized form of matrix M with m ij ∈ M defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m ij = m ij / |V | j=1 m ij if |V | j=1 m ij = 0 0 otherwise</formula><p>The PageRank computation can be seen as a Markov Chain process in which nodes represent states and the links between them are the transi- tions. By recursively applying Eq. (1), we ob- tain the principal eigenvector, which represents the stationary probability distribution of each state, in our case of each node ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Manning et al., 2008)</ref>. To ensure that the PageRank (or the random walk) does not get stuck into cycles of the graph, a damping factor α is added to allow the "teleport" operation to another node in the graph. Hence, the computation of S becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S = α · M · S + (1 − α) · p (2)</formula><p>where S is the principal eigenvector and p is a vec- tor of length |V | with all elements 1 |V | . The vector p indicates that, being in a node v i , the random walk can jump to any other node in the graph with equal probability.</p><p>By biasing p, the random walk would prefer nodes that have higher probability in the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Haveliwala, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The idea of PositionRank is to assign larger weights (or probabilities) to words that are found early in a document and are frequent. Specifically, we want to assign a higher probability to a word found on the 2 nd position as compared to a word found on the 50 th position in the same document. We weigh each candidate word with its inverse po- sition in the document before any filters are ap- plied. If the same word appears multiple times in the target document, then we sum all its position weights. For example, if a word is found on the following positions: 2 nd , 5 th and 10 th , its weight is: 1 2 + 1 5 + 1 10 = 4 5 = 0.8. Summing up the posi- tion weights for a given word aims to grant more confidence to frequently occurring words by tak- ing into account the position weight of each occur- rence. Then, the vector p is set to the normalized weights for each candidate word as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p = p 1 p 1 +p 2 +...+p |V | , p 2 p 1 +p 2 +...+p |V | , ..., p |V | p 1 +p 2 +...+p |V |</formula><p>The PageRank score of a vertex v i , i.e., S(v i ), can be obtained in an algebraic way by recursively computing the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S(v i ) = (1 − α) · p i + α · v j ∈Adj(v i ) w ji O(v j ) S(v j )</formula><p>where O(v j ) = v k ∈Adj(v j ) w jk and p i is the weight found in the vector p for vertex v i . In our experiments, the words' PageRank scores are recursively computed until the difference be- tween two consecutive iterations is less than 0.001 or a number of 100 iterations is reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Forming Candidate Phrases</head><p>Candidate words that have contiguous positions in a document are concatenated into phrases. We consider noun phrases that match the regu- lar expression (adjective)*(noun)+, of length up to three, (i.e., unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams).</p><p>Finally, phrases are scored by using the sum of scores of individual words that comprise the phrase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao, 2008)</ref>. The top-scoring phrases are output as predictions (i.e., the pre- dicted keyphrases for the document).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Datasets and Evaluation Metrics</head><p>In order to evaluate the performance of Posi- tionRank, we carried out experiments on three datasets. The first and second datasets were made available by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gollapalli and Caragea (2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> These datasets are compiled from the CiteSeerX digital library ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Giles et al., 1998</ref>) and consist of 2 http://www.cse.unt.edu/∼ccaragea/keyphrases.html research papers from the ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) and the World Wide Web Conference (WWW). The third dataset was made available by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nguyen and Kan (2007)</ref> and consist of research papers from various disciplines. In experiments, we use the title and abstract of each paper to ex- tract keyphrases. The author-input keyphrases are used as gold-standard for evaluation. All three datasets are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, which shows the number of papers in each dataset, the total number of keyphrases (Kp), the average number of keyphrases per document (AvgKp), and a brief insight into the length and number of available keyphrases.</p><p>Evaluation Metrics. We use mean reciprocal rank (MRR) curves to illustrate our experimental findings. MRR gives the averaged ranking of the first correct prediction and is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M RR = 1 |D| d∈D 1 r d</formula><p>where D is the collection of documents and r d is the rank at which the first correct keyphrase of document d was found. We also summarize the results in terms of Precision, Recall, and F1- score in a table to contrast PositionRank with pre- vious models since these metrics are widely used in previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hulth, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hasan and Ng, 2014</ref>). To compute "performance@k" (such as MRR@k), we examine the top-k predictions (with k ranging from 1 to 10). We use average k to refer to the average number of keyphrases for a particu- lar dataset as listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For example, aver- age k = 5 for the WWW dataset. For comparison purposes, we used Porter Stemmer to reduce both predicted and gold keyphrases to a base form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results and Discussion</head><p>Our experiments are organized around several questions, which are discussed below. How sensitive is PositionRank to its parame- ters? One parameter of our model that can influ- ence its performance is the window size w, which determines how edges are added between candi- date words in the graph. We experimented with values of w ranging from 2 to 10 in steps of 1 and chose several configurations for illustration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 2</ref> shows the MRR curves of PositionRank for different values of w, on all three datasets. As can be seen from the figure, the performance of our model does not change significantly as w changes.   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: A summary of our datasets. In addition to the window size, our model has one more parameter, i.e., the damping factor α. In order to understand its influence on the per- formance of PositionRank, we experimented with several values of α, e.g., 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, and did not find significant differences in the perfor- mance of PositionRank (results not shown due to highly overlapping curves). Hence, in Equation 2, we set α = 0.85 as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Haveliwala, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>What is the impact of aggregating information from all positions of a word over using a word's first position only? In this experiment, we ana- lyze the influence that position-weighted frequent words in a document would have on the perfor- mance of PositionRank. Specifically, we compare the performance of the model that aggregates in- formation from all positions of a word's occur- rences, referred as PositionRank -full model with that of the model that uses only the first position of a word, referred as PositionRank -fp. In the ex- ample from the previous section, a word occurring on positions 2 nd , 5 th , and 10 th will have a weight of 1 2 + 1 5 + 1 10 = 4 5 = 0.8 in the full model, and a weight of 1 2 = 0.5 in the first position (fp) model. Note that the weights of words are normalized be- fore they are used in the biased PageRank. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the results of this experiment in terms of MRR for the top k predicted keyphrases, with k from 1 to 10, for all datasets, KDD, WWW, and Nguyen. As we can see from the figure, the performance of PositionRank -full model consis- tently outperforms its counterpart that uses the first position only, on all datasets. We can conclude from this experiment that aggregating information from all occurrences of a word acts as an impor- tant component in PositionRank. Hence, we use PositionRank -full model for further comparisons.</p><p>How well does position information aid in un- supervised keyphrase extraction from research papers? In this experiment, we compare our position-biased PageRank model (PositionRank) with two PageRank-based models, TextRank and SingleRank, that do not make use of the position information. In TextRank, an undirected graph is built for each target paper, so that nodes corre- spond to words and edges are drawn between two words that occur next to each other in text, i.e., the window size w is 2. SingleRank extends TextRank by adding edges between two words that co-occur in a window of w ≥ 2 contiguous words in text. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the MRR curves comparing Po- sitionRank with TextRank and SingleRank. As can be seen from the figure, PositionRank sub- stantially outperforms both TextRank and Sin- gleRank on all three datasets, illustrating that the words' positions contain significant hints that aid the keyphrase extraction task. PositionRank can successfully harness this information in an unsu- pervised setting to obtain good improvements in the extraction performance. For example, Posi- tionRank that uses information from all positions of a word's occurrences yields improvements in MRR@average k of 17.46% for KDD, 20.18% for WWW, and 17.03% for Nguyen over SingleRank.</p><p>How does PositionRank compare with other existing state-of-the-art methods? In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, we  compare PositionRank with several strong base- lines: TF-IDF, ExpandRank, and TopicalPageR- ank (TPR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hasan and Ng, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al., 2010)</ref>. We selected these base- lines based on the ACL survey on keyphrase ex- traction by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hasan and Ng (2014)</ref>. In TF-IDF, we calculate the tf score of each candidate word in the target document, whereas the idf compo- nent is estimated from all three datasets. In Ex- pandRank, we build an undirected graph from each paper and its local textual neighborhood and calculate the candidate words' importance scores using PageRank. We performed experiments with various numbers of textually-similar neighbors and present the best results for each dataset. In TPR, we build an undirected graph using infor- mation from the target paper. We then perform topic decomposition of the target document us- ing topic models to infer the topic distribution of a document and to compute the probability of words in these topics. Last, we calculate the candi- date words' importance scores by aggregating the scores from several topic-biased PageRanks (one PageRank per topic). We used the implementation of topic models from Mallet. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> To train the topic 3 http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ model, we used a subset of about 45, 000 paper ab- stracts extracted from the CiteSeer x scholarly big dataset introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Caragea et al. (2014b)</ref>. For all models, the score of a phrase is obtained by summing the score of the constituent words in the phrase.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, we can see that PositionRank achieves a significant increase in MRR over the baselines, on all datasets. For example, the high- est relative improvement in MRR@average k for this experiment is as high as 29.09% achieved on the Nguyen collection. Among all models com- pared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, ExpandRank is clearly the best performing baseline, while TPR achieves the low- est MRR values, on all datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Overall Performance</head><p>As already mentioned, prior works on keyphrase extraction report results also in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and F1-score (F1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hulth, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hasan and Ng, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wan and Xiao, 2008)</ref>. Consistent with these works, in Ta- ble 2, we show the results of the comparison of PositionRank with all baselines, in terms of P, R and F1 for top k = 2, 4, 6, 8 predicted keyphrases, on all three datasets. As can be seen from the ta-   ble, PositionRank outperforms all baselines, on all datasets. For example, on WWW at top 6 pre- dicted keyphrases, PositionRank achieves an F1- score of 12.1% as compared to 11.2% achieved by ExpandRank and 10.7% achieved by both TF- IDF and TPR. From the table, we can also see that ExpandRank is generally the best performing baseline on all datasets. However, it is interesting to note that, unlike PositionRank that uses infor- mation only from the target paper, ExpandRank adds external information from a textually-similar neighborhood of the target paper, and hence, is computationally more expensive. PositionRank-first position only (fp) typically performs worse than PositionRank-full model, but it still outperforms the baseline methods for most top k predicted keyphrases, on all datasets. For example, on Nguyen at top 4, PositionRank-fp achieves an F1-score of 10.5% compared to the best baseline (TF-IDF in this case), which reaches only a score of 9.6%.</p><p>A striking observation is that PositionRank out- performs TPR on all datasets. Compared with our model, TPR is a very complex model, which uses topic models to learn topics of words and infer the topic proportion of documents. Addi- tionally, TPR has more parameters (e.g., the num- ber of topics) that need to be tuned separately for each dataset. PositionRank is much less complex, it does not require an additional dataset (e.g., to train a topic model) and its performance is better than that of TPR. TF-IDF and ExpandRank are the best performing baselines, on all datasets, KDD, WWW, and Nguyen. For example, on KDD at k = 4, TF-IDF and ExpandRank yield an F1-score of 9.4% and 10.1%, respectively, compared with 8.4%, 9.0% and 8.9% achieved by TextRank, Sin- gleRank and TPR, respectively. Geographically 0.274 Focused 0.134 Collaborative 0.142 Crawling 0.165 by Weizheng Gao, Hyun Chul Lee and Yingbo Miao A collaborative 0.142 crawler 0.165 is a group 0.025 of crawling 0.165 nodes 0.033 , in which each crawling 0.165 node 0.033 is responsible 0.012 for a specific 0.010 portion 0.010 of the web 0.015 . We study the problem 0.007 of collecting 0.011 geographically 0.274 aware 0.006 pages 0.018 using collaborative 0.142 crawling 0.165 strategies 0.017 . We first propose several collaborative 0.142 crawling 0.165 strategies 0.017 for the geographically 0.274 focused 0.134 crawling 0.165 , whose goal 0.004 is to collect web 0.015 pages 0.018 about specified 0.010 geographic 0.274 locations 0.003 by considering features 0.005 like URL 0.006 address 0.005 of page 0.018 <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref> More precisely, features 0.005 like URL 0.006 address 0.005 of page 0.018 and extended 0.004 anchor 0.004 text 0.004 of link 0.004 are shown to yield the best overall performance 0.003 for the geographically 0.274 focused 0.134 crawling 0.165 .</p><p>Author-input keyphrases: collaborative crawling, geographically focused crawling, geographic entities With a paired t-test on our results, we found that the improvements in MRR, precision, recall, and F1-score for PositionRank are statistically signifi- cant (p-values &lt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Anecdotal Evidence</head><p>We show anecdotal evidence using a paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gao et al. (2006)</ref> that is part of the Nguyen dataset. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> shows the title and abstract of this pa- per together with the author-input keyphrases. We marked in bold dark red the candidate phrases that are predicted as keyphrases by our proposed model (PositionRank), in black the words that are selected as candidate phrases and in gray the words that are filtered out based on their part-of- speech tags or the stopwords list being used. We show the probability (or weight) of each candidate word in its upper right corner. These weights are computed based on both the word's position and its frequency in the text. Note that our model uses these weights to bias the PageRank algorithm to prefer specific nodes in the graph.</p><p>As we can see from the figure, component words of author's keyphrases such as: "collab- orative," "crawling," "focused," and "geographi- cally" are assigned the highest scores while can- didates such as "performance," "anchor," or "fea- tures" are assigned very low weights, making them less likely to be chosen as keyphrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We proposed a novel unsupervised graph-based al- gorithm, called PositionRank, which incorporates both the position of words and their frequency in a document into a biased PageRank. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate the po- sition information in novel ways in unsupervised keyphrase extraction. Specifically, unlike super- vised approaches that use only the first position information, we showed that modeling the entire distribution of positions for a word outperforms models that use only the first position.</p><p>Our experiments on three datasets of research papers show that our proposed model achieves bet- ter results than strong baselines, with relative im- provements in performance as high as 29.09%. In the future, it would be interesting to explore the performance of PositionRank on other types of documents, e.g., web pages and emails.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The title and abstract of a WWW paper by Rendle et al.
