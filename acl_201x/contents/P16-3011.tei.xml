				<p>We present a new, sizeable dataset of noun-noun compounds with their syntactic analysis (bracketing) and semantic relations. Derived from several established linguistic resources, such as the Penn Treebank, our dataset enables experimenting with new approaches towards a holistic analysis of noun-noun compounds, such as joint-learning of noun-noun compounds bracketing and interpretation, as well as integrating compound analysis with other tasks such as syntactic parsing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Noun-noun compounds are abundant in many lan- guages, and English is no exception. <ref type="bibr">According tó O Séaghdha (2008)</ref>, three percent of all words in the British National Corpus <ref type="bibr">(Burnard, 2000, BNC)</ref> are part of nominal compounds. There- fore, in addition to being an interesting linguis- tic phenomenon per se, the analysis of noun- noun compounds is important to other natural lan- guage processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation and information extraction. Indeed, there is already a nontrivial amount of research on noun-noun compounds within the field of com- putational linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lauer, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nakov, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">´ O Séaghdha, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tratz, 2011, inter alios)</ref>.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lauer and Dras (1994)</ref> point out, the treat- ment of noun-noun compounds involves three tasks: identification, bracketing and semantic in- terpretation. With a few exceptions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Girju et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kim and Baldwin, 2013)</ref>, most studies on noun-noun compounds focus on one of the afore- mentioned tasks in isolation, but these tasks are of course not fully independent and therefore might benefit from a joint-learning approach, especially bracketing and semantic interpretation.</p><p>Reflecting previous lines of research, most of the existing datasets on noun-noun compounds ei- ther include bracketing information or semantic relations, rarely both. In this article we present a fairly large dataset for noun-noun compound bracketing as well as semantic interpretation. Fur- thermore, most of the available datasets list the compounds out of context. Hence they implic- itly assume that the semantics of noun-noun com- pounds is type-based; meaning that the same com- pound will always have the same semantic rela- tion. To test this assumption of type-based vs. token-based semantic relations, we incorporate the context of the compounds in our dataset and treat compounds as tokens rather than types. Lastly, to study the effect of noun-noun compound brack- eting and interpretation on other NLP tasks, we derive our dataset from well-established resources that annotate noun-noun compounds as part of other linguistic structures, viz. the Wall Street Journal Section of the Penn Treebank ( <ref type="bibr">Marcus et al., 1993, PTB)</ref>, PTB noun phrase annotation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vadas and</ref><ref type="bibr">Curran (2007), DeepBank (Flickinger et al., 2012)</ref>, the Prague Czech-English Depen- dency Treebank 2.0 ( <ref type="bibr">Hajič et al., 2012, PCEDT)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004</ref>). We therefore can quantify the effect of compound bracketing on syntactic parsing using the PTB, for example.</p><p>In the following section, we review some of the existing noun compound datasets. In § 3, we present the process of constructing a dataset of noun-noun compounds with bracketing informa- tion and semantic relations. In § 4, we explain how we construct the bracketing of noun-noun compounds from three resources and report 'inter- resource' agreement levels. In § 5, we present the semantic relations extracted from two resources and the correlation between the two sets of rela- tions. In § 6, we conclude the article and present an outlook for future work.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Relations Bracketing  Nastase &amp; Szpakowicz  600  30  No  Girju et al.  4,500  21  600´O 600´ 600´O Séaghdha &amp; Copestake 1,443  6  No  Kim &amp; Baldwin 1  2,169  20  No  Tratz &amp; Hovy  17,509  43  No   Table 1</ref>: Overview of noun compound datasets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>The syntax and semantics of noun-noun com- pounds have been under focus for years, in linguis- tics and computational linguistics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Levi (1978)</ref> presents one of the early and influential stud- ies on noun-noun compounds as a subset of so- called complex nominals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Levi (1978)</ref> defines a set of nine "recoverably deletable predicates" which express the "semantic relationship between head nouns and prenominal modifiers" in complex nominals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Finin (1980)</ref> presented one of the ear- liest studies on nominal compounds in computa- tional linguistics, but Lauer (1995) was among the first to study statistical methods for noun com- pound analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lauer (1995)</ref> used the Grolier encyclopedia to estimate word probabilities, and tested his models on a dataset of 244 three-word bracketed compounds and 282 two-word com- pounds. The compounds were annotated with eight prepositions which Lauer takes to approxi- mate the semantics of noun-noun compounds. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows an overview of some of the exist- ing datasets for nominal compounds. The datasets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Girju et al. (2005)</ref> are not limited to noun-noun com- pounds; the former includes compounds with ad- jectival and adverbial modifiers, and the latter has many noun-preposition-noun constructions. The semantic relations in´Oin´ in´O <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Séaghdha and Copestake (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kim and Baldwin (2008)</ref> are based on the relations introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Levi (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barker and Szpakowicz (1998)</ref>, respectively. All of the datasets in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> list the compounds out of context. In addition, the dataset by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Girju et al. (2005)</ref> includes three-word bracketed compounds, whereas the rest include two-word compounds only. On the other hand, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Girju et al., 2005</ref>) is the only dataset in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Framework</head><p>This section gives an overview of our method to automatically construct a bracketed and semanti- cally annotated dataset of noun-noun compounds from four different linguistic resources. The con- struction method consists of three steps that cor- respond to the tasks defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lauer and Dras (1994)</ref>: identification, bracketing and semantic in- terpretation.</p><p>Firstly, we identify the noun-noun compounds in the PTB WSJ Section using two of the com- pound identification heuristics introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fares et al. (2015)</ref>, namely the so-called syntax-based NNP h heuristic which includes compounds that contain common and proper nouns but excludes the ones headed by proper nouns, and the syntax- based NNP 0 heuristic which excludes all com- pounds that contain proper nouns, be it in the head position or the modifier position. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the number of compounds and compound types we identified using the NNP h and NNP 0 heuristics. Note that the number of compounds will vary in the following sections depending on the resources we use.</p><p>Secondly, we extract the bracketing of the iden- tified compounds from three resources: PTB noun phrase annotation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vadas and Curran (2007)</ref>, DeepBank and PCEDT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vadas and Curran (2007)</ref> manually annotated the internal structure of noun phrases (NPs) in PTB which were originally left unannotated. However, as is the case with other resources, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vadas and Curran (2007)</ref> annotation is not completely error-free, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fares et al. (2015)</ref>. We therefore crosscheck their brack- eting through comparing to those of DeepBank and PCEDT. The latter two, however, do not con- tain explicit annotation of noun-noun compound bracketing, but we can 'reconstruct' the bracket- ing based on the dependency relations assigned in both resources, i.e. the logical form meaning rep- resentation in DeepBank and the tectogrammatical layer (t-layer) in PCEDT. Based on the bracketing extracted from the three resources, we define the subset of compounds that are bracketed similarly in the three resources. Lastly, we extract the se-mantic relations of two-word compounds as well as multi-word bracketed compounds from two re- sources: PCEDT and NomBank.</p><p>On a more technical level, we use the so- called phrase-structure layer (p-layer) in PCEDT to identify noun-noun compounds, because it in- cludes the NP annotation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vadas and Curran (2007)</ref>, which is required to apply the noun-noun compound identification heuristics by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fares et al. (2015)</ref>. For bracketing, we also use the PCEDT p- layer, in addition to the dataset prepared by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Oepen et al. (2016)</ref> which includes DeepBank and the PCEDT tectogrammatical layer. We opted for the dataset by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Oepen et al. (2016)</ref> because they con- verted the tectogrammatical annotation in PCEDT to dependency representation in which the "set of graph nodes is equivalent to the set of surface to- kens." For semantic relations, we also use the dataset by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Oepen et al. (2016)</ref> for PCEDT rela- tions and the original NomBank files for Nom- Bank relations.</p><p>Throughout the whole process we store the data in a relational database with a schema that repre- sents the different types of information, and the different resources from which they are derived. As we will show in § 4 and § 5, this set-up allows us to combine information in different ways and therefore create 'different' datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Bracketing</head><p>Noun-noun compound bracketing can be defined as the disambiguation of the internal structure of compounds with three nouns or more. For exam- ple, we can bracket the compound noon fashion show in two ways:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1. Left-bracketing: [[noon fashion] show] 2. Right-bracketing: [noon [fashion show]]</formula><p>In this example, the right-bracketing interpretation (a fashion show happening at noon) is more likely than the left-bracketing one (a show of noon fash- ion). However, the correct bracketing need not al- ways be as obvious, some compounds can be sub- tler to bracket, e.g. car radio equipment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Girju et al., 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data &amp; Results</head><p>As explained in § 3, we first identify noun-noun compounds in the WSJ Corpus, then we extract and map their bracketing from three linguistic re- sources: PCEDT, DeepBank and noun phrase an- notation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vadas and Curran (2007)</ref> (VC-PTB, henceforth). Even though we can identify 38,917 noun-noun compounds in the full WSJ Corpus (cf <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">. Table 2</ref>), the set of compounds that consti- tutes the basis for bracketing analysis (i.e. the set of compounds that occur in the three resources) is smaller. First, because DeepBank only an- notates the first 22 Sections of the WSJ Cor- pus. Second, because not all the noun sequences identified as compounds in VC-PTB are treated as such in DeepBank and PCEDT. Hence, the number of compounds that occur in the three re- sources is 26,500. Furthermore, three-quarters (76%) of these compounds consist of two nouns only, meaning that they do not require bracket- ing, which leaves us a subset of 6,244 multi-word compounds-we will refer to this subset as the bracketing subset.</p><p>After mapping the bracketings from the three resources we find that they agree on the brack- eting of almost 75% of the compounds in the bracketing subset. Such an agreement level is relatively good compared to previously reported agreement levels on much smaller datasets, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Girju et al. (2005)</ref> report a bracketing agreement of 87% on a set of 362 three-word compounds. Inspecting the disagreement among the three re- sources reveals two things. First, noun-noun com- pounds which contain proper nouns (NNP) consti- tute 45% of the compounds that are bracketed dif- ferently. Second, 41% of the differently bracketed compounds are actually sub-compounds of larger compounds. For example, the compound con- sumer food prices is left-bracketed in VC-PTB, i.e. [[consumer food] prices], whereas in PCEDT and DeepBank it is right-bracketed. This dif- ference in bracketing leads to two different sub- compounds, namely consumer food in VC-PTB and food prices in PCEDT and DeepBank.</p><p>It is noteworthy that those two observations do not reflect the properties of compounds contain- ing proper nouns or sub-compounds; they only tell us their percentages in the set of differently brack- eted compounds. In order to study their properties, we need to look at the number of sub-compounds and compounds containing NNPs in the set of compounds where the three resources agree. As it turns out, 72% of the compounds containing proper nouns and 76% of the sub-compounds are bracketed similarly. Therefore when we exclude them from the bracketing subset we do not see a significant change in bracketing agreement among α-β α-γ β-γ α-β-γ NNP h 80% 79% 88% 75% NNP 0 78% 75% 90% 74% NNP h w/o sub 82% 82% 86% 75% NNP 0 w/o sub 81% 77% 90% 74%  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. We report pairwise bracketing agreement among the three resources in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. We observe higher agreement level between PCEDT and VC- PTB than the other two pairs; we speculate that the annotation of the t-layer in PCEDT might have been influenced by the so-called phrase-structure layer (p-layer) which in turn uses VC-PTB anno- tation. Further, PCEDT and VC-PTB seem to dis- agree more on the bracketing of noun-noun com- pounds containing NNPs; because when proper nouns are excluded (NNP 0 ), the agreement level between PCEDT and VC-PTB increases, but it de- creases for the other two pairs.</p><p>As we look closer at the compound instances where at least two of the three resources disagree, we find that some instances are easy to classify as annotation errors. For example, the compound New York streets is bracketed as right-branching in VC-PTB, but we can confidently say that this a left-bracketing compound. Not all bracketing dis- agreements are that easy to resolve though; one example where left-and right-bracketing can be accepted is European Common Market approach, which is bracketed as follows in DeepBank (1) and PCEDT and VC-PTB (2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1. [[European [Common Market]] approach] 2. [European [[Common Market] approach]]</formula><p>Even though this work does not aim to resolve or correct the bracketing disagreement between the three resources, we will publish a tool that allows resource creators to inspect the bracketing disagreement and possibly correct it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Relations</head><p>Now that we have defined the set of compounds whose bracketing is agreed-upon in different re- sources, we move to adding semantic relations to</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compound</head><p>Functor <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">NomBank Arg  Negligence penalty  CAUS  ARG3  Death penalty  RSTR  ARG2  Staff lawyer  RSTR  ARG3  Government lawyer  APP  ARG2   Table 4</ref>: Example compounds with semantic rela- tions our dataset. We rely on PCEDT and NomBank to define the semantic relations in our dataset, which includes bracketed compounds from § 4 as well as two-word compounds. However, unlike § 4, our set of noun-noun compounds in this section con- sists of the compounds that are bracketed simi- larly in PCEDT and VC-PTB and occur in both resources. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> This set consists of 26,709 compounds and 14,405 types. PCEDT assigns syntactico-semantic labels, so- called functors, to all the syntactic dependency re- lations in the tectogrammatical layer (a deep syn- tactic structure). Drawing on the valency theory of the Functional Generative Description, PCEDT defines 69 functors for verbs as well as nouns and adjectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cinková et al., 2006</ref>). 3 NomBank, on the other hand, is about nouns only; it assigns role labels (arguments) to common nouns in the PTB. In general, NomBank distinguishes between pred- icate arguments and modifiers (adjuncts) which correspond to those defined in PropBank <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002</ref>). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We take both types of roles to be part of the semantic relations of noun- noun compounds in our dataset. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows some examples of noun-noun compounds annotated with PCEDT functors and NomBank arguments. The functor CAUS ex- presses causal relationship; RSTR is an under- specified adnominal functor that is used whenever the semantic requirements for other functors are not met; APP expresses appurtenance. While the PCEDT functors have specific definitions, most of the NomBank arguments have to be interpreted in connection with their predicate or frame. For ex-ample, ARG3 of the predicate penalty in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> describes crime whereas ARG3 of the predicate lawyer describes rank. Similarly, ARG2 in penalty describes punishment, whereas ARG2 in lawyer describes beneficiary or consultant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data &amp; Results</head><p>Given 26,709 noun-noun compounds, we con- struct a dataset with two relations per compound: a PCEDT functor and a NomBank argument. The resulting dataset is relatively large compared to the datasets in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. However, the largest dataset in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tratz and Hovy (2010)</ref>, is type-based and does not include proper nouns. The size of our dataset becomes 10,596 if we exclude the com- pounds containing proper nouns and only count the types in our dataset; this is still a relatively large dataset and it has the important advantage of including bracketing information of multi-word compounds, inter alia.</p><p>Overall, the compounds in our dataset are an- notated with 35 functors and 20 NomBank argu- ments, but only twelve functors and nine Nom- Bank arguments occur more than 100 times in the dataset. Further, the most frequent NomBank argument (ARG1) accounts for 60% of the data, and the five most frequent arguments account for 95%. We see a similar pattern in the distribu- tion of PCEDT functors, where 49% of the com- pounds are annotated with RSTR (the least spe- cific adnominal functor in PCEDT). Further, the five most frequent functors account for 89% of the data (cf. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). Such distribution of relations is not unexpected because according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cinková et al. (2006)</ref>, the relations that cannot be expressed by "semantically expressive" functors usually re- ceive the functor PAT, which is the second most frequent functor. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kim and Baldwin (2008)</ref> report that 42% of the compounds in their dataset are annotated as TOPIC, which appears closely related to ARG1 in NomBank.</p><p>In theory, some of the PCEDT functors and NomBank arguments express the same type of relations. We therefore show the 'correlation' between PCEDT functors and NomBank argu- ments in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. The first half of the table maps PCEDT functors to NomBank arguments, and the second half shows the mapping from Nom- Bank to PCEDT. Due to space limitations, the table only includes a subset of the relations- the most frequent ones. The underlined num- bers in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> indicate the functors and Nom- Bank arguments that are semantically compara- ble; for example, the temporal and locative func- tors (TWHEN, THL, TFRWH and LOC) intuitively correspond to the temporal and locative modifiers in NomBank (ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC), and this correspondence is also evident in the figures in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. The same applies to the functor AUTH (authorship) which always maps to the NomBank argument ARG0 (agent). However, not all 'the- oretical similarities' are necessarily reflected in practice, e.g. AIM vs. ARGM-PNC in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> (both express purpose). NomBank and PCEDT are two different resources that were created with different annotation guidelines and by different annotators, and therefore we cannot expect perfect correspon- dence between PCEDT functors and NomBank ar- guments.</p><p>PCEDT often assigns more than one functor to different instances of the same compound. In fact, around 13% of the compound types were an- notated with more than one functor in PCEDT, whereas only 1.3% of our compound types are annotated with more than one argument in Nom- Bank. For example, the compound takeover bid, which occurs 28 times in our dataset, is annotated with four different functors in PCEDT, including AIM and RSTR, whereas in NomBank it is always annotated as ARGM-PNC. This raises the question whether the semantics of noun-noun compounds varies depending on their context, i.e. token-based vs. type-based relations. Unfortunately we can- not answer this question based on the variation in PCEDT because its documentation clearly states that " <ref type="bibr">[t]</ref>he annotators tried to interpret complex noun phrases with semantically expressive func- tors as much as they could. This annotation is, of course, very inconsistent." 5 Nonetheless, our dataset still opens the door to experimenting with learning PCEDT functors, and eventually deter- mining whether the varied functors are mere in- consistencies or there is more to this than meets the eye.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</head><p>In this article we presented a new noun-noun com- pound dataset constructed from different linguis- tic resources, which includes bracketing informa- tion and semantic relations. In § 4, we explained  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Correlation between NomBank arguments and PCEDT functors the construction of a set of bracketed multi-word noun-noun compounds from the PTB WSJ Cor- pus, based on the NP annotation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vadas and Curran (2007)</ref>, DeepBank and PCEDT. In § 5, we con- structed a variant of the set in § 4 whereby each compound is assigned two semantic relations, a PCEDT functor and NomBank argument. Our dataset is the largest data set that includes both compound bracketing and semantic relations, and the second largest dataset in terms of the num- ber of compound types excluding compounds that contain proper nouns. Our dataset has been derived from different re- sources that are licensed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). Therefore, we are investigat- ing the possibility of making our dataset publicly available in consultation with the LDC. Otherwise the dataset will be published through the LDC.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H H H H P N ARG1 ARG2 ARG0 ARG3 M-LOC M-MNR M-TMP M-PNC Count Freq RSTR 0.60</formula><p>In follow-up work, we will enrich our dataset by mapping the compounds in our dataset to the datasets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kim and Baldwin (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tratz and Hovy (2010)</ref>; all of the compounds in the former and some of the compounds in the latter are ex- tracted from the WSJ Corpus. Further, we will ex- periment with different classification and ranking approaches to bracketing and semantic interpre- tation of noun-noun compounds using different combinations of relations. We will also study the use of machine learning models to jointly bracket and interpret noun-noun compounds. Finally, we aim to study noun-noun compound identification, bracketing and interpretation in an integrated set- up, by using syntactic parsers to solve the identifi- cation and bracketing tasks, and semantic parsers to solve the interpretation task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>Table 2 : Noun-noun compounds in WSJ Corpus</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table></table></figure>
