				<p>We present a computational analysis of three language varieties: native, advanced non-native, and translation. Our goal is to investigate the similarities and differences between non-native language productions and translations, contrasting both with native language. Using a collection of computational methods we establish three main results: (1) the three types of texts are easily distinguishable; (2) non-native language and translations are closer to each other than each of them is to native language; and (3) some of these characteristics depend on the source or native language , while others do not, reflecting, perhaps , unified principles that similarly affect translations and non-native language.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper addresses two linguistic phenomena: translation and non-native language. Our main goal is to investigate the similarities and differ- ences between these two phenomena, and contrast them with native language. In particular, we are interested in the reasons for the differences be- tween translations and originals, on one hand, and native and non-native language, on the other. Do they reflect "universal" principles, or are they de- pendent on the source/native language?</p><p>Much research in translation studies indicates that translated texts have unique characteristics. Translated texts (in any language) constitute a sub- language of the target language, sometimes re- ferred to as translationese <ref type="bibr">(Gellerstam, 1986)</ref>. The unique characteristics of translationese have been traditionally classified into two categories: proper- ties that stem from interference of the source lan- guage <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Toury, 1979)</ref>, and universal traits resulting from the translation process itself, independently of the specific source and target languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Toury, 1995)</ref>. The latter so-called transla- tion universals have triggered a continuous debate among translation studies researchers <ref type="bibr">(Mauranen and Kujam√§ki, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">House, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Becher, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, over half a century of research on second language acquisition (SLA) established the presence of cross-linguistic influences (CLI) in non-native utterances <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jarvis and Pavlenko, 2008)</ref>. CLI is a cover term proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kellerman and Sharwood-Smith (1986)</ref> to denote various phe- nomena that stem from language contact situa- tions such as transfer, interference, avoidance, bor- rowing, etc. 1 In addition, universal traits result- ing from the learning process itself have been no- ticed regardless of the native language, L1. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For example, similar developmental sequences have been observed for negation, question formation, and other sentence structures in English ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dulay and Burt, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Odlin, 1989)</ref> for both Chinese and Spanish natives. Phenomena such as overgener- alization, strategies of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Selinker, 1972)</ref>, psychological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellis, 1985)</ref>, and cultural distance <ref type="bibr">(Giles and Byrne, 1982)</ref> are also influen- tial in the acquisition process.</p><p>There are clear similarities between translations and non-native language: both are affected by the simultaneous presence of (at least) two linguistic systems, which may result in a higher cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Shlesinger, 2003)</ref>. The presence of the L1 may also cause similar CLI effects on the target language.</p><p>On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that translationese and non-native language should differ from each other. Translations are produced by native speakers of the target language. Non- natives, in contrast, arguably never attain native- like abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Coppieters, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Johnson and Newport, 1991)</ref>, however this hypothesis is strongly debated in the SLA community <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Birdsong, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lardiere, 2006</ref>).</p><p>Our goal in this work is to investigate three lan- guage varieties: the language of native speakers (N), the language of advanced, highly fluent non- native speakers (NN), and translationese (T). We use the term constrained language to refer to the latter two varieties. We propose a unified com- putational umbrella for exploring two related ar- eas of research on bilingualism: translation studies and second language acquisition. Specifically, we put forward three main hypotheses: (1) The three language varieties have unique characteristics that make them easily distinguishable. (2) Non-native language and translations are closer to each other than either of them is to native language. (3) Some of these characteristics are dependent on the spe- cific L1, but many are not, and may reflect uni- fied principles that similarly affect translations and non-native language.</p><p>We test these hypotheses using several corpus- based computational methods. We use super- vised and unsupervised classification (Section 4) to show that the three language varieties are easily distinguishable. In particular, we show that native and advanced non-native productions can be ac- curately separated. More pertinently, we demon- strate that non-native utterances and translations comprise two distinct linguistic systems.</p><p>In Section 5, we use statistical analysis to ex- plore the unique properties of each language vari- ety. We show that the two varieties of constrained language are much closer to each other than they are to native language: they exhibit poorer lexical richness, a tendency to use more frequent words, a different distribution of idiomatic expressions and pronouns, and excessive use of cohesive devices. This is an unexpected finding, given that both na- tives and translators (in contrast to non-natives) produce texts in their mother tongue.</p><p>Finally, in Section 6 we use language modeling to show that translations and non-native language exhibit similar statistical properties that clearly re- flect cross-linguistic influences: experiments with distinct language families reveal salient ties be- tween the two varieties of constrained language.</p><p>The main contribution of this work is thus the- oretical: it sheds light on some fundamental ques- tions regarding bilingualism, and we expect it to motivate and drive future research in both SLA and translation studies. Moreover, a better under- standing of constrained language may also have some practical import, as we briefly mention in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Corpus-based investigation of translationese has been a prolific field of recent research, laying out an empirical foundation for the theoretically moti- vated hypotheses on the characteristics of transla- tionese. More specifically, identification of trans- lated texts by means of automatic classification shed light on the manifestation of translation uni- versals and cross-linguistic influences as markers of translated texts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baroni and Bernardini, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">van Halteren, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gaspari and Bernardini, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kurokawa et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Koppel and Ordan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ilisei and Inkpen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Volansky et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nisioi, 2015b)</ref>, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gaspari and Bernardini (2008)</ref> introduced a dataset for investigation of potential common traits between translations and non-native texts. Such studies prove to be important for the develop- ment of parallel corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Resnik and Smith, 2003)</ref>, the improvement in quality of plagiarism detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Potthast et al., 2011</ref>), language modeling, and statistical machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lembersky et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lembersky et al., , 2013</ref>.</p><p>Computational approaches also proved benefi- cial for theoretical research in second language acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jarvis and Pavlenko, 2008)</ref>.

These studies are instrumental for language teaching and student evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Smith and Swan, 2001)</ref>, and can improve NLP applications such as authorship profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Estival et al., 2007)</ref> or gram- matical error correction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chodorow et al., 2010)</ref>. Most of these studies utilize techniques that are motivated by the same abstract principles associ-ated with L1 influences on the target language.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address both translations and non-native language under a unifying computational frame- work, and in particular to compare both with na- tive language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology and experimental setup 3.1 Dataset</head><p>Our dataset 3 is based on the highly homogeneous corpus of the European Parliament Proceedings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Koehn, 2005)</ref>. Note that the proceedings are pro- duced as follows: (1) the utterances of the speak- ers are transcribed; (2) the transcriptions are sent to the speaker who may suggest minimal editing without changing the content; (3) the edited ver- sion is then translated by native speakers. Note in particular that the texts are not a product of simul- taneous interpretation.</p><p>In this work we utilize a subset of Europarl in which each sentence is manually annotated with speaker information, including the EU state rep- resented and the original language in which the sentence was uttered ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nisioi et al., 2016</ref>). The texts in the corpus are uniform in terms of style, respecting the European Parliament's formal stan- dards. Translations are produced by native En- glish speakers and all non-native utterances are se- lected from members not representing UK or Ire- land. Europarl N consists of texts delivered by na- tive speakers from England. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> depicts statistics of the dataset. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In contrast to other learner corpora such as ICLE <ref type="bibr">(Granger, 2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">EFCAMDAT (Geertzen et al., 2013)</ref> or TOEFL-11 ( , this corpus contains translations, native, and non- native English of high proficiency speakers. Mem- bers of the European Parliament have the right to use any of the EU's 24 official languages when speaking in Parliament, and the fact that some of them prefer to use English suggests a high degree of confidence in their language skills.</p></div>

For the classification experiments we randomly shuffled the sentences within each language variety to prevent interfer- ence of other artifacts (e.g., authorship, topic) into the classification procedure. We divided the data into chunks of approximately 2,000 tokens, re- specting sentence boundaries, and normalized the values of lexical features by the number of to- kens in each chunk. For classification we used Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Keerthi et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hall et al., 2009</ref>) to train sup- port vector machine classifiers with the default lin- ear kernel.</p><p>In all the experiments we used (the maximal) equal amount of data from each category, thus we always randomly down-sampled the datasets in or- der to have a comparable number of examples in each class; specifically, 354 chunks were used for each language variety: N, NN and T.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Features</head><p>The first feature set we utilized for the classifica- tion tasks comprises function words (FW), proba- bly the most popular choice ever since <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mosteller and Wallace (1963)</ref> used it successfully for the Federalist Papers. Function words proved to be suitable features for multiple reasons:(1) they ab- stract away from contents and are therefore less biased by topic; (2) their frequency is so high that by and large they are assumed to be selected un- consciously by authors; (3) although not easily in- terpretable, they are assumed to reflect grammar, and therefore facilitate the study of how structures are carried over from one language to another. We used the list of approximately 400 function words provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Koppel and Ordan (2011)</ref>.</p><p>A more informative way to capture (admittedly shallow) syntax is to use part-of-speech (POS) tri- grams. Triplets such as PP (personal pronoun) + VHZ (have, 3sg present) + VBN (be, past partici- ple) reflect a complex tense form, represented dis- tinctively across languages. In Europarl, for ex- ample, this triplet is highly frequent in translations from Finnish and Danish and much rarer in trans- lations from Portuguese and Greek. In this work we used the top-3,000 most frequent POS trigrams in each corpus.</p><p>We also used positional token frequency <ref type="bibr">(Grieve, 2007)</ref>. The feature is defined as counts of words occupying the first, second, third, penulti- mate and last positions in a sentence. The motiva- tion behind this feature is that sentences open and close differently across languages, and it should be expected that these opening and closing de- vices will be transferred from L1 if they do not violate the grammaticality of the target language. Positional tokens were previously used for trans- lationese identification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Volansky et al., 2015)</ref> and for native language detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nisioi, 2015a)</ref>.</p><p>Translations are assumed to exhibit explicita- tion: the tendency to render implicit utterances in the source text more explicit in the translation product. For example, causality, even though not always explicitly expressed in the source, is ex- pressed in the target by the introduction of cohe- sive markers such as because, due to, etc. <ref type="bibr">(BlumKulka, 1986)</ref>. Similarly, Hinkel (2001) conducted a comparative analysis of explicit cohesive de- vices in academic texts by non-native English stu- dents, and found that cohesive markers are dis- tributed differently in non-native English produc- tions, compared to their native counterparts. To study this phenomenon, we used the set of over 100 cohesive markers introduced in Hinkel (2001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The status of constrained language</head><p>To establish the unique nature of each language variety in our dataset, we perform multiple pair- wise binary classifications between N, NN, and T, as well as three-way classifications. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> re- ports the results; the figures reflect average ten- fold cross-validation accuracy (the best result in each column is boldfaced).</p><p>In line with previous works (see Section 2), classification of N-T, as well as N-NN, yields excellent results with most features and feature combinations. NN-T appears to be easily distin- guishable as well; specifically, FW+POS-trigrams combination with/without positional tokens yields 99.57% accuracy. The word maybe is among the most discriminative feature for NN vs. T, being overused in NN, as opposed to perhaps, which ex- hibits a much higher frequency in T; this may indi- cate a certain degree of formality, typical of trans- lated texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Olohan, 2003)</ref>. The words or, which and too are considerably more frequent in T, im- plying higher sentence complexity. This trait is also reflected by shorter NN sentences, compared to T: the average sentence length in Europarl is 26 tokens for NN vs. 30 for T. Certain decisiveness devices (sure, very) are underused in T, in accor- dance with Toury (1995)'s law of standardization <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Vanderauwera, 1985)</ref>. The three-way classifica- tion yields excellent results as well; the highest accuracy is obtained using FW+positional tokens with/without POS-trigrams.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> re- veals that NN-T classification is a slightly yet sys- tematically harder task than N-T or N-NN; this implies that NN and T texts are more similar to each other than either of them is to N.</p><p>To emphasize this last point, we analyze the separability of the three language varieties by ap- plying unsupervised classification. We perform bi- secting KMeans clustering procedure previously used for unsupervised identification of transla- tionese by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rabinovich and Wintner (2015)</ref>. Clus- tering of N, NN and T using function words into three clusters yields high accuracy, above 90%. For the sake of clusters' visualization in a bidi- mensional plane, we applied principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. The results are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1 (a)</ref>. Evi- dently, NN and T exhibit higher mutual proximity than either of them with N. Fixing the number of expected clusters to 2 further highlights this obser- vation, as demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> (b): both NN and T instances were assigned to a single cluster, distinctively separable from the N cluster.</p><p>We</p><note type="other">conclude that the three language varieties (N, NN, and T) constitute three different, distin- guishable ontological categories, characterized by various lexical, syntactic and grammatical proper- ties; in particular, the two varieties of constrained language (NN and T) represent two distinct lin- guistic systems. Nevertheless, we anticipate NN and T to share more common tendencies and reg- ularities, when compared to N. In the following sections, we put this hypothesis to the test.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">L1-independent similarities</head><p>In this section we address L1-independent simi- larities between NN and T, distinguishing them from N. We focus on characteristics which are theoretically motivated by translation studies and which are considered to be L1-independent, i.e., unrelated to cross-linguistic influences. We hy- pothesize that linguistic devices over-or under- represented in translation would behave similarly in highly competent non-native productions, com- pared to native texts.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we realized various lin- guistic phenomena as properties that can be easily computed from N, NN and T texts. We refer to the computed characteristics as metrics. Our hypoth- esis is that NN metric values will be similar to T, and that both will differ from N. We used equally- sized texts of 780K tokens for N, NN and T; the exact computation is specified for each metric.</p><p>For the sake of visualization, the three values of each metric (for N, NN and T) were zero- one scaled by total-sum normalization. Lexical richness Translated texts tend to exhibit less lexical diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Shabab, 1996</ref>). Blum- Kulka (1986) suggested that translated texts make do with less words, which is reflected by their lower type-to-token ratio (TTR) compared to that of native productions. We computed the TTR met- ric by dividing the number of unique (lemmatized) tokens by the total number of tokens.</p><p>Mean word rank <ref type="bibr">Halverson (2003)</ref> claims that translators use more prototypical language, i.e., they regress to the mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Shlesinger, 1989)</ref>. We, therefore, hypothesize that rarer words are used more often in native texts than in non-native pro- ductions and translationese. To compute this met- ric we used a BNC-based ranked list of 50K En- glish words <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , excluding the list of function words (see Section 3.3). The metric value was calculated by averaging the rank of all tokens in a text; tokens that do not appear in the list of 50K were excluded.</p><p>Collocations Collocations are distributed differ- ently in translations and in originals <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Toury, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kenny, 2001</ref>). Common and frequent colloca- tions are used almost subconsciously by native speakers, but will be subjected to a more careful choice by translators and, presumably, by fluent non-native speakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Erman et al., 2014</ref>). For ex- ample, the phrase make sure appears twice more often in native Europarl texts than in NN, and five times more than in T; bear in mind has almost double frequency in N, compared to NN and T. Expressions such as: bring forward, figure out, in light of, food chain and red tape appear dozens of times in N, as opposed to zero occurrences in NN and T Europarl texts. This metric is defined by computing the frequency of idiomatic expres- sions 6 in terms of types.</p><p>Cohesive markers Translations were proven to employ cohesion intensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blum-Kulka, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">√òver√•s, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Koppel and Ordan, 2011</ref>). Non- native texts tend to use cohesive markers differ- ently as well: sentence transitions, the major cohe- sion category, was shown to be overused by non- native speakers regardless of their native language <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hinkel, 2001</ref>). The metric is defined as the fre- quency of sentence transitions in the three lan- guage varieties.</p><p>Qualitative comparison of various markers be- tween NN and T productions, compared to N in the Europarl texts, highlights this phenomenon: in addition is twice as frequent in NN and T than in N; according, at the same time and thus occur three times more frequently in NN and T, com- pared to N; moreover is used four times more fre- 5 https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk we used the list extracted from both spoken and written text.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>: Metric values in N, NN and T. Tree-way differences are significant in all metric categories and "*" indicates metrics with higher pairwise similarity of NN and T, compared individually to N.</p><p>quently; and to conclude is almost six times more frequent.</p><p>Personal pronouns We expect both non-native speakers and translators to spell out entities (both nouns and proper nouns) more frequently, as a means of explicitation (Olohan, 2002), thus lead- ing to under-use of personal pronouns, in contrast to native texts. As an example, his and she are twice more frequent in N than in NN and T. We define this metric as the frequency of (all) personal and possessive pronouns used in the three language varieties. The over-use of personal pro- nouns in N utterances, is indeed balanced out by lower frequency of proper and regular nouns in these texts, compared to T and NN. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Analysis</head><p>Evidently (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), translationese and non- native productions exhibit a consistent pattern in both datasets, compared to native texts: NN and T systematically demonstrate lower metric values than N for all characteristics (except sentence tran- sitions, where both NN and T expectedly share a higher value). All metrics except mean word rank exhibit substantial (sometimes dramatic) dif- ferences between N, on the one hand, and NN and T, on the other, thus corroborating our hypothe- sis. Mean word rank exhibits a more moderate variability in the three language varieties, yield- ing near identical value in NN and T; yet, it shows excessive usage in N.</p><p>The differences between metric values are sta- tistically significant for all metrics (Section 5.2). Moreover, in all cases (except transitions), the dif- ference between NN and T metrics is significantly lower than the difference between either of them and N, implying a higher proximity of NN and T distributions, compared individually to N. This finding further emphasizes the common tenden- cies between NN and T.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, NN and T are systemati- cally and significantly different from N. Addition- ally, we can see that T is consistently positioned between N and NN (except for sentence transi- tions), implying that translations produced by na- tive speakers tend to resemble native utterances to a higher degree than non-native productions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Statistical significance</head><p>Inspired by the results depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, we now put to test two statistical hypotheses: (1) N, NN and T productions do not represent identical underlying distributions, i.e., at least one pair is distributed differently; and consequently, (2) NN and T productions exhibit higher similarity (in terms of distance) than either of them with N. We test these hypotheses by applying the bootstrap- ping statistical analysis.</p><p>Bootstrapping is a statistical technique involv- ing random re-sampling (with replacement) from the original sample; it is often used to assign a measure of accuracy (e.g., a confidence interval) to an estimate. Specifically, let C N , C NN and C T de- note native, non-native and translated sub-corpora of equal size (780K tokens). Let C ALL denote the concatenation of all three sub-corpora, resulting in a total of 2,340M tokens. We further denote a function computing a metric m by f m ; when ap- plied to C, its value is f m (C). The sum of pair-wise distances between the three individual dataset metrics is denoted by D total :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D total = |f m (C N ) ‚àí f m (C NN )|+ |f m (C N ) ‚àí f m (C T )| + |f m (C NN ) ‚àí f m (C T )|</formula><p>High values of D total indicate a difference be- tween the three language varieties. To examine whether the observed D total is high beyond chance level, we use the bootstrap approach, and repeat the following process 1,000 times: 8 we sample C ALL with replacement (at sentence granularity), generating in the j-th iteration equal-sized samples</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C N j , C NN j , C T j . The corresponding distance esti- mate, therefore, is: D total j = |f m ( C N j ) ‚àí f m ( C NN j )|+ |f m ( C N j ) ‚àí f m ( C T j )| + |f m ( C NN j ) ‚àí f m ( C T j )|</formula><p>We repeat random re-sampling and computation of D total j 1,000 times, and estimate the p-value of D total by calculation of its percentile within the series of (sorted) D total j values, where j ‚àà</p><p>(1, . . . , 1000). In all our experiments the origi- nal distance D total exceeds the maximum estimate in the series of D total j , implying highly significant difference, with p-value&lt;0.001 for all metrics.</p><p>In order to stress this outcome even further, we now test whether (the constrained) NN and T ex- hibit higher pairwise similarity, as opposed to N. We achieve this by assessment of the distance be- tween NN and T productions, compared to the dis- tance between N and its closest production (again, in terms of distance): either NN or T. We sample C N , C NN and C T (with replacement) separately, constructing C N , C NN and C T , respectively, and define the following distance function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D dif j = |f m ( C N j )‚àíf m ( C j K )|‚àí|f m ( C NN j )‚àíf m ( C T j )| where K = Ô£± Ô£¥ Ô£≤ Ô£¥ Ô£≥ NN if |f m (C N ) ‚àí f m (C NN )| &lt; |f m (C N ) ‚àí f m (C T )| T otherwise</formula><p>We repeat re-sampling and computation of D dif j 1,000 times for each metric value in both datasets and sort the results. The end points of the 95% confidence interval are defined by esti- mate values with 2.5% deviation from the min- imum (min-end-point) and the maximum (max- end-point) estimates. We assess the p-value of the test by inspecting the estimate underlying the min- end-point; specifically, in case the min-end-point is greater than 0, we consider p&lt;0.05. Metric cat- egories exhibiting higher NN-T similarity than ei- ther N-NN or N-T are marked with "*" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">L1-related similarities</head><p>We hypothesize that both varieties of constrained language exhibit similar (lexical, grammatical, and structural) patterns due to the influence of L1 over the target language. Consequently, we antic- ipate that non-native productions of speakers of a certain native language (L1) will be closer to trans- lations from L1 than to translations from other lan- guages.</p><p>Limited by the amount of text available for each individual language, we set out to test this hypoth- esis by inspection of two language families, Ger- manic and Romance. Specifically, the Germanic family consists of NN texts delivered by speak- ers from Austria, Germany, Netherlands and Swe- den; and the Romance family includes NN speak- ers from Portugal, Italy, Spain, France and Roma- nia. The respective T families comprise transla- tions from Germanic and Romance originals, cor- responding to the same countries.  We estimate L1-related traces in the two va- rieties of constrained language by the fitness of a translationese-based language model (LM) to utterances of non-native speakers from the same language family. Attempting to trace structural and grammatical, rather than content similarities, we compile five-gram POS language models from Germanic and Romance translationese (GerT and RomT, respectively). <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We examine the predic- 9 For building LMs we used the closed vocabulary of Penn tion power of these models on non-native produc- tions of speakers with Germanic and Romance na- tive languages (GerNN and RomNN), hypothesiz- ing that an LM compiled from Germanic transla- tionese will better predict non-native productions of a Germanic speaker and vice versa. The fitness of a language model to a set of sentences is esti- mated in terms of perplexity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jelinek et al., 1977)</ref>.</p><p>For building and estimating language models we used the KenLM toolkit <ref type="bibr">(Heafield, 2011)</ref>, em- ploying modified Kneser-Ney smoothing without pruning. Compilation of language-family-specific models was done using 7M tokens of Germanic and Romance translationese each; the test data consisted of 5350 sentences of Germanic and Ro- mance non-native productions. Consequently, for perplexity experiments with individual languages we utilized 500 sentences from each language. We excluded OOVs from all perplexity computations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> reports the results. Prediction of GerNN by the GerT language model yields a slightly lower perplexity (i.e., a better prediction) than pre- diction by RomT. Similarly, RomNN is much bet- ter predicted by RomT than by GerT. These differ- ences are statistically significant: we divided the NN texts into 50 chunks of 100 sentences each, and computed perplexity values by the two LMs for each chunk. Significance was then computed by a two-tailed paired t-test, yielding p-values of 0.015 for GerNN and 6e-22 for RomNN.  As a further corroboration of the above re- sult, we computed the perplexity of the GerT and RomT language models with respect to the lan- guage of NN speakers, this time distinguishing speakers by their country of origin. We used the same language models and non-native test chunks of 500 sentences each. Inspired by the outcome of the previous experiment, we expect that NN productions by Germanic speakers will be better predicted by GerT LM, and vice versa. that all English texts with underlying Romance na- tive languages (under the diagonal) are better pre- dicted (i.e., obtain lower perplexity) by the RomT LM. All Germanic native languages (except Ger- man), on the other hand, are better predicted by the GerT LM. This finding further supports the hy- pothesis that non-native productions and transla- tionese tend to exhibit similar L1-related traits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a unified computational approach for studying constrained language, where many of the features were theoretically motivated. We demonstrated that while translations and non- native productions are two distinct language vari- eties, they share similarities that stem from lower lexical richness, more careful choice of idiomatic expressions and pronouns, and (presumably) sub- conscious excessive usage of explicitation cohe- sive devices. More dramatically, the language modeling experiments reveal salient ties between the native language of non-native speakers and the source language of translationese, highlighting the unified L1-related traces of L1 in both scenar- ios. Our findings are intriguing: native speakers and translators, in contrast to non-native speakers, use their native language, yet translation seems to gravitate towards non-native language use.</p><p>The main contribution of this work is empirical, establishing the connection between these types of language production. While we believe that these common tendencies are not incidental, more re- search is needed in order to establish a theoretical explanation for the empirical findings, presumably (at least partially) on the basis of the cognitive load resulting from the simultaneous presence of two linguistic systems. We are interested in expanding the preliminary results of this work: we intend to replicate the experiments with more languages and more domains, investigate additional varieties of constrained language and employ more complex lexical, syntactic and discourse features. We also plan to investigate how the results vary when lim- ited to specific L1s. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Clustering of N, NN and T into three (a) and two (b) clusters using function words.
