			<abstract>
				<p>This paper presents a system that automatically generates multiple, natural language questions using relative pronouns and relative adverbs from complex English sentences. Our system is syntax-based, runs on dependency parse information of a single-sentence input, and achieves high accuracy in terms of syntactic correctness, semantic adequacy, fluency and uniqueness. One of the key advantages of our system, in comparison with other rule-based approaches, is that we nearly eliminate the chances of getting a wrong wh-word in the generated question, by fetching the requisite wh-word from the input sentence itself. Depending upon the input, we generate both factoid and descriptive type questions. To the best of our information , the exploitation of wh-pronouns and wh-adverbs to generate questions is novel in the Automatic Question Generation task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Asking questions from learners is said to facili- tate interest and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chi, 1994)</ref>, to recognize problem learning areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Tenenberg and Murphy, 2005</ref>) to assess vocabulary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al., 2005</ref>) and reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mitkov, 2006</ref>); ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kunichika et al., 2004</ref>), to provide writing support ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2012)</ref>, to support inquiry needs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ali et al., 2010)</ref>, etc. Manual generation of questions from a text for creating practice exercises, tests, quizzes, etc. has consumed labor and time of aca- demicians and instructors since forever, and with the invent of a large body of educational mate- rial available online, there is a growing need to make this task scalable. Along with that, in the recent times, there is an increased demand to cre- ate Intelligent tutoring systems that use computer- assisted instructional material or self-help prac- tice exercises to aid learning as well as objec- tively check learner's aptitude and accomplish- ments. Inevitably, the task of Automatic Question Generation (QG) caught the attention of NLP re- searchers from across the globe. Automatic QG has been defined as "the task of automatically gen- erating questions from various inputs like raw text, database or semantic representation" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rus et al., 2008)</ref>. Apart from its direct application in the ed- ucational domain, in general, the core NLP areas like Question Answering, Dialogue Generation, Information Retrieval, Summarization, etc. also benefit from large scale automatic Question Gen- eration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Previous work on Automatic QG has focused on generating questions using question tem- plates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mostow and Chen, 2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sneiders, 2002)</ref>, transformation rules based largely on case grammars <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Finn, 1975)</ref>, general-purpose, transformation rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Heilman and Smith, 2009)</ref>, tree manipulation rules (Heil- man, 2011); <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ali et al., 2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gates, 2008)</ref>, dis- course cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal et al., 2011</ref>), queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lin, 2008)</ref>, various scopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mannem et al., 2010)</ref>, de- pendency parse information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mazidi and Nielsen, 2015)</ref>, topic information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chali and Hasan, 2015)</ref> In the current paper, we fetch relative pronouns and relative adverbs from complex English sen- tences and use dependency-based rules, grounded in linguistic theory of relative clause syntactic structure, to generate multiple relevant questions. The work follows in the tradition of question writing algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Finn, 1975)</ref> and transformation rules based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Heilman and Smith, 2009)</ref>. However, while Finn's work was based largely around case grammars <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fillmore, 1968)</ref>, our sys- tem exploits dependency parse information using the Spacy parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Honnibal and Johnson, 2015)</ref>, which provides us with a better internal structure of complex sentences to work with. The general- purpose transformation rules in Heilman's system do not work well on sentences with a highly com- plex structure, as we show in the section on com- parison and evaluation. Although no other state- of-the art system focuses specifically on QG from relative pronouns and relative adverbs, a more re- cent Minimal Recursion semantics-based QG sys- tem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yao et al., 2012</ref>) has a sub part that deals with sentences with a relative clause, but less compre- hensively. We differ from their system in that, for one, we do not decompose the complex sentence into simpler parts to generate questions. The rules are defined for the dependencies between relative pronouns and relative adverbs and the rest of the sentence as a whole. Secondly, our system gener- ates a different set and more number of questions per sentence than their system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Why Relative Clauses?</head><p>In complex sentences, relative pronouns or rela- tive adverbs perform the function of connecting or introducing the relative clause that is embed- ded inside the matrix clause. Examples of these in English include who, whom, which, where, when, how, why, etc. An interesting thing about both relative pronouns and relative adverbs is that they carry unique information on the syntactic relation- ship between specific parts of the sentence. For example, consider the following sentence in En- glish: I am giving fur balls to John who likes cats.</p><p>In this sentence, the relative pronoun who mod- ifies the object of the root verb give of the matrix sentence. At the same time, it acts as the subject of the relative clause likes cats, which it links the matrix clause with. In this paper, we aim to ex- actly exploit this structural relationship to generate questions, thereby adding to the pool of questions that can be generated from a given sentence. One of the key benefits of using the information from relative pronouns and relative adverbs is that we are not likely to go wrong with the wh-word, as we fetch it from the relative clause itself to gen- erate the question. This gives our system an edge over other QG systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">System Description</head><p>We split the complete QG task into the following sub parts -the input natural language sentence is first fed into the Spacy parser. Using the parse in- formation, the system checks for the presence of one or more relative pronouns or adverbs in the sentence. Post that, it further checks for well- defined linguistic features in the sentence, such as tense and aspect type of the root and relative clause verb, head-modifier relationship between different parts of the sentence, etc. to accordingly send the information to the rule sets. Depending upon which rule in the rule sets the information is sent to, questions are generated. We define our rule sets in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Rule Sets</head><p>For each of the nine relative pronouns and rela- tive adverbs in English (who, whom, whose, which, that, where, when, why, how) that we took into consideration, we defined three sets of rules. Each of the three rule sets further contains a total of ten rules, backed by linguistic principles. Each rela- tive pronoun or relative adverb in the sentence is first checked for a set of requirements before get- ting fed into the rules. Depending upon the relative pronoun and relative adverb and the type of rela- tive clause (restrictive or unrestrictive), questions are generated. We present an example of one out of the ten rules from each of the three rule sets in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Rule Set 1.</head><p>We know that the relative pronoun (RP) modi- fies the object of the root of the matrix sentence. Before feeding the sentence to the rule, we first check the sentence for the tense and aspect of the root verb and also for the presence of modals and auxiliary verbs (aux). Based on this information, we then accordingly perform do-insertion before Noun Phrase (NP) or aux/modal inversion. For a sentence of the following form, with an optional Preposition Phrase (PP) and RP who that precedes a relative clause (RC), NP (aux) Root NP (PP)+ {RC} The rule looks like this: RP aux NP root NP Preposition?</p><p>Hence, for the example sentence introduced in the previous section, we get the following question using the first rule: Who/Whom am I giving fur balls to?</p><p>In representation of the rules, we follow the general linguistic convention which is to put round brackets on optional elements and '+' symbol for multiple possible occurrences of a word or phrase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Rule Set 2.</head><p>The next understanding about the relative pronoun or adverb comes from the relative clause it intro- duces or links the matrix sentence with. The rel- ative pronoun can sometimes act as the subject of the verb of relative clause. This forms the basis for rules in the second set.</p><p>After checking for dependency of the RP, which should be noun subject (n-subj) to the verb in the relative clause, we then check the tense and as- pect of the relative clause verb and the presence of modals and auxiliary verbs. Based on this infor- mation, we then accordingly perform do-insertion or modal/auxiliary inversion. For a relative clause of the following form, with the relative pronoun who </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Rule Set 3.</head><p>The relative pronoun modifies or gives more in- formation on the head of the noun phrase of the preceding sentence. This forms the basis to rules in the third set. Before feeding the sentence to this rule, we first check the tense of the relative clause verb along with its number agreement. We do this because English auxiliaries and copula carry tense and number features and we need this information to insert their correct form. In a similar fashion, we define rules for all other relative pronouns and adverbs that we listed in the previous section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Evaluation Criteria</head><p>There is no standard way to evaluate the output of a QG system. In the current paper, we go with manual evaluation, where 4 independent hu- man evaluators, all non-native English speakers but proficient in English, give scores to questions generated from the system. The scoring schema is similar to one used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal et al., 2011</ref>) albeit with some modifications. To judge syntactic cor- rectness, the evaluators give a score of 3 when the questions are syntactically well-formed and natu- ral, 2 when they have a few syntactic errors and 1 when they are syntactically unacceptable. Sim- ilarly, for semantic correctness, the raters give a score of 3 when the questions are semantically correct, 2 when they have a weird meaning and 1 when they are semantically unacceptable. Un- like <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal et al., 2011</ref>), we test the fluency and semantic relatedness separately. The former tells us how natural the question reads. A question with many embedded clauses and adjuncts is syntacti- cally acceptable, but disturbs the intended purpose of the question and, hence, should be avoided. For example, a question like Who is that girl who works at Google which has its main office in Amer- ica which is a big country? is syntactically and semantically fine, but isn't as fluent as the ques- tion Who is that girl who works at Google? which is basically the same question but is more fluent. The evaluators give a score of 1 for questions that aren't fluent and 2 to the ones that are. Lastly, eval- uators rate the questions for how unique they are. Adding this criteria is important because questions generated for academic purposes need to cover different aspects of the sentence. This is why if the generated questions are more or less alike, the evaluators give them a low score on distribution or variety. For a well distributed output, the score is 2 and for a less distributed one, it is 1. The evalua- tors give a score of 0 when there is no output for a given sentence. The scores obtained separately for syntactic correctness, semantic adequacy, fluency and distribution are used to compare the perfor- mance of the two systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Evaluation</head><p>We take sentences from the Wikipedia corpus. Out of a total of 25773127 sentences, 3889289 sen-tences have one or more relative pronoun or rel- ative adverb in them. This means that sentences with relative clauses form roughly 20% of the cor- pus. To conduct manual evaluation, we take 300 sentences from the set of sentences with relative clauses, and run ours and Heilman's system on them. We give the questions generated per sen- tence for both the systems to 4 independent human evaluators who rate the questions on syntactic cor- rectness, semantic adequacy, fluency and distribu- tion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Results</head><p>The results of our system and comparison with Heilman's is given in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The ratings pre- sented are average of ratings of all the evaluators. Our system gets 2.89/3.0 on syntactic correctness, 2.9/3.0 on semantic adequacy, 1.85/2.0 in fluency and 1.8/2.0 in distribution. On the same met- rics, Heilman's system gets 2.56, 2.58, 1.3 and 1.1. The Cohen's kappa coefficient or the inter evaluator agreement is 0.6, 0.7, 0.7 and 0.7 on syntactic correctness, semantic adequacy, fluency and distribution respectively, which indicate reliability. The overall rating of our system is 9.44 out of 10 in comparison of Heilman's which is 7.54. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Evaluation scores: Our system performs better than Heilman's system on all of the given criteria; syntactic correctness, semantic adequacy, fluency and uniqueness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Discussion</head><p>On all the four evaluation criteria that we used for comparison, our system performs better than Heilman's state-of-the-art rule based system, while generating questions from complex English sentences. Let us take a look at some specific input example cases to analyze the results. First of all, by fetching and modifying the wh-word from the sentence itself, we nearly eliminate the possibility of generating a sentence with a wrong wh-word. From the example comparison in <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref>2, we can see that the output of both the systems is the same. However, our system generates the correct wh-word for the generated question. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Wh-Word: Our system performs better than Heil- man's system at fetching the correct Wh-word for the given input.</p><p>By exploiting the unique structural relationships between relative pronouns and relative adverbs with the rest of the sentence, we are able to cover different aspects of the same sentence. Also, by eliminating unwanted dependencies, we ensure that the system generates fluent questions. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> for a reference example. Since Heilman's system does not look deeper into the internal structural dependencies between different parts of the sentence, it fails to generate reasonable questions for most cases of complex sentences. Our system, on the other hand, exploits such dependencies and is, therefore, able to handle complex sentences better. See <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> for a reference example of this case. Lastly, there is a restriction put on the length of the input sentence in Heilman's system. Due to this, there is zero or no output at all for complex sentences that are very long. Our system, however, works well on such sentences also and gives reasonable output.</p><p>Figure 4: Complex Sentences: Our system is able to han- dle the given highly complex sentence better than Heilman's system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Conclusion</head><p>This paper presented a syntax, rule-based system that runs on dependency parse information from the Spacy parser and exploits dependency relation- ship between relative pronouns and relative ad- verbs and the rest of the sentence in a novel way to automatically generate multiple questions from complex English sentences. The system is sim- ple in design and can handle highly complex sen- tences. The evaluation was done by 4 independent human evaluators who rated questions generated from our system and Heilman's system on the ba- sis of how syntactically correct, semantically ad- equate, fluent and well distributed or unique the questions were. Our system performed better than Heilman's system on all the aforesaid criterion. A predictable limitation of our system is that it is only meant to generate questions for sentences that contain at least one relative clause. Such sentences form about 20% of the tested corpus.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>, {matrix }</head><label></label><figDesc>RP (aux/modals)+ RC verb (NP) (PP)+ The rule looks like this: RP do-insertion/aux/modal RC verb (NP) (Preposition)?
