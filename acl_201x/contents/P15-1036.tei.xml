				<p>Prepositional phrases (PPs) express crucial information that knowledge base construction methods need to extract. However , PPs are a major source of syntactic ambiguity and still pose problems in parsing. We present a method for resolving ambiguities arising from PPs, making extensive use of semantic knowledge from various resources. As training data, we use both labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing an expectation maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. Experiments show that our method yields improvements over existing methods including a state of the art dependency parser.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Machine reading and information extraction (IE) projects have produced large resources with many millions of facts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Suchanek et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mitchell et al., 2015)</ref>. This wealth of knowledge creates a positive feedback loop for automatic knowledge base construction efforts: the accumulated knowl- edge can be leveraged to improve machine read- ing; in turn, improved reading methods can be used to better extract knowledge expressed using complex and potentially ambiguous language. For example, prepositional phrases (PPs) express cru- cial information that IE methods need to extract. However, PPs are a major source of syntactic am- biguity. In this paper, we propose to use semantic knowledge to improve PP attachment disambigua- tion. PPs such as "in", "at", and "for" express de- tails about the where, when, and why of relations and events. PPs also state attributes of nouns.</p><p>As an example, consider the following sen- tences: S1.) Alice caught the butterfly with the spots. S2.) Alice caught the butterfly with the net.   Specifically, S1 and S2 differ in where their PPs attach. In S1, the butterfly has spots and there- fore the PP, "with the spots", attaches to the noun. For relation extraction, we obtain a binary relation of the form: Alice caught butterfly with spots. However, in S2, the net is the instrument used for catching and therefore the PP, "with the net", at- taches to the verb. For relation extraction, we get a ternary extraction of the form: Alice caught butterfly with net.</p><p>The PP attachment problem is often defined as follows: given a PP occurring within a sentence where there are multiple possible attachment sites for the PP, choose the most plausible attachment site. In the literature, prior work going as far back as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brill and Resnik, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Collins and Brooks, 1995)</ref> has focused on the language pattern that causes most PP ambigui- ties, which is the 4-word sequence: {v, n1, p, n2} (e.g., {caught, butterfly, with, spots}). The task is to determine if the prepositional phrase (p, n2) at- taches to the verb v or to the first noun n1. Follow- ing common practice, we focus on PPs occurring as {v, n1, p, n2} quadruples -we shall refer to these as PP quads.</p><p>The approach we present here differs from prior work in two main ways. First, we make ex- tensive use of semantic knowledge about nouns, verbs, prepositions, pairs of nouns, and the dis- course context in which a PP quad occurs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarizes the types of knowledge we considered in our work. Second, in training our model, we rely on both labeled and unlabeled data, employ- ing an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dempster et al., 1977)</ref>. Contributions. In summary, our main contribu- tions are:</p><p>1) Semantic Knowledge: Previous methods largely rely on corpus statistics. Our approach draws upon diverse sources of background knowl- edge, leading to performance improvements.</p><p>2) Unlabeled Data: In addition to training on la- beled data, we also make use of a large amount of unlabeled data. This enhances our method's abil- ity to generalize to diverse data sets.</p><p>3) Datasets: In addition to the standard Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994)</ref>, we labeled two new datasets for testing purposes, one from Wikipedia (WKP), and an- other from the New York Times Corpus (NYTC). We make these datasets freely available for fu- ture research. In addition, we have applied our model to over 4 million 5-tuples of the form {n0, v, n1, p, n2}, and we also make this dataset available 1 for research into ternary relation extrac- tion beyond spatial and temporal scoping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">State of the Art</head><p>To quantitatively assess existing tools, we ana- lyzed performance of the widely used Stanford parser 2 as of 2014, and the established baseline algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collins and Brooks, 1995)</ref>, which has stood the test of time. We first manually labeled PP quads from the NYTC dataset, then prepended the noun phrase appearing before the quad, ef- fectively creating sentences made up of 5 lexi- cal items (n0 v n1 p n2). We then applied the Stanford parser, obtaining the results summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. The parser performs well on some prepositions, for example, "of", which tends to oc- cur with noun attaching PPs as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 3</ref>. However, for prepositions with an even dis- tribution over verb and noun attachments, such as "on", precision is as low as 50%. The Collins baseline achieves 84% accuracy on the bench- mark Wall Street Journal PP dataset. However, drawing a distinction in the precision of different prepositions provides useful insights on its per- formance. We re-implemented this baseline and found that when we remove the trivial preposi- tion, "of", whose PPs are by default attached to the noun by this baseline, precision drops to 78%. This analysis suggests there is substantial room for improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Statistics-based Methods. Prominent prior meth- ods learn to perform PP attachment based on corpus co-occurrence statistics, gathered either from manually annotated training data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collins and Brooks, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brill and Resnik, 1994)</ref> or from automatically acquired training data that may be noisy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ratnaparkhi, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pantel and Lin, 2000</ref>). These models collect statistics on how of- ten a given quadruple, {v, n1, p, n2}, occurs in the training data as a verb attachment as opposed to a noun attachment. The issue with this approach is sparsity, that is, many quadruples occuring in the test data might not have been seen in the training data. Smoothing techniques are often employed to overcome sparsity. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collins and Brooks, 1995)</ref> proposed a back-off model that uses subsets of the words in the quadruple, by also keeping frequency counts of triples, pairs and sin- gle words. Another approach to overcoming spar- sity has been to use WordNet <ref type="bibr">(Fellbaum, 1998)</ref> classes, by replacing nouns with their WordNet classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stetina and Nagao, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Toutanova et al., 2004</ref>) to obtain less sparse corpus statistics. Corpus-derived clusters of similar nouns and verbs have also been used <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pantel and Lin, 2000</ref>). Hindle and Rooth proposed a lexical associa- tion approach based on how words are associated with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hindle and Rooth, 1993)</ref>. Lexi- cal preference is used by computing co-occurrence frequencies (lexical associations) of verbs and nouns, with prepositions. In this manner, they would discover that, for example, the verb "send" is highly associated with the preposition from, in- dicating that in this case, the PP is likely to be a verb attachment. Structure-based Methods. These methods are based on high-level observations that are then gen- eralized into heuristics for PP attachment deci- sions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kimball, 1988)</ref> proposed a right associa- tion method, whose premise is that a word tends to attach to another word immediately to its right. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Frazier, 1978)</ref> introduced a minimal attachment method, which posits that words attach to an ex- isting non-terminal word using the fewest addi- tional syntactic nodes. While simple, in practice these methods have been found to perform poorly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Whittemore et al., 1990)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Rule-based Methods. (Brill and Resnik, 1994)</ref> proposed methods that learn a set of transforma- tion rules from a corpus. The rules can be too spe- cific to have broad applicability, resulting in low recall. To address low recall, knowledge about nouns, as found in WordNet, is used to replace cer- tain words in rules with their WordNet classes. Parser Correction Methods. The quadruples for- mulation of the PP problem can be seen as a simplified setting. This is because, with quadru- ples, there is no need to deal with complex sen- tences but only well-defined quadruples of the form {v, n1, p, n2}. Thus in the quadruples set- ting, there are only two possible attachment sites for the PP, the v and n1. An alternative setting is to work in the context of full sentences. In this setting the problem is cast as a dependency parser correction problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atterer and Schütze, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agirre et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anguiano and Candito, 2011)</ref>. That is, given a dependency parse of a sentence, with potentially incorrect PP attachments, rectify it such that the prepositional phrases attach to the correct sites. Unlike our approach, these methods do not take semantic knowledge into account. Sense Disambiguation. In addition to prior work on prepositional phrase attachment, a highly re- lated problem is preposition sense disambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hovy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Srikumar and Roth, 2013)</ref>. Even a syntactically correctly attached PP can still be semantically ambiguous with respect to ques- tions of machine reading such as where, when, and why. Therefore, when extracting information from prepositions, the problem of preposition sense dis- ambiguation (semantics) has to be addressed in ad- dition to prepositional phrase attachment disam- biguation (syntax). In this paper, our focus is on the latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methodology</head><p>Our approach consists of first generating features from background knowledge and then training a model to learn with these features. The types of features considered in our experiments are sum- marized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The choice of features was motivated by our empirically driven characteriza- tion of the problem as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(Verb attach) −→ v has-slot-filler n2 (Noun attach a.) −→ n1 described-by n2 (Noun attach b.) −→ n2 described-by n1 Feature Type # Feature Example Noun-Noun Binary Relations Source: SVOs F1.</formula><p>svo(n2, v, n1) For q1; (net, caught, butterf ly) F2.</p><p>∀i : ∃sv i o; svo(n1, v i , n2) For q2; (butterf ly, has, spots) For q2; (butterf ly, can see, spots) Noun Semantic Categories Source:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T F3. ∀t i ∈ T ; isA(n1, t i ) For q1 isA(butterlf y, animal) F4. ∀t i ∈ T ; isA(n2, t i ) For q2 isA(net, device) Verb Role Fillers Source: VerbNet F5. hasRole(n2, r i ) For q1; (net, instrument) Preposition Relational Source: M Definitions F6. def (prep, v i ) ∀i : ∃sv i o; v i ∈ M ∧ svo(n1, v i , n2) For q2; def (with, has) Discourse Features Source: Sentence(s), T F7. ∀t i ∈ T ; isA(n0, t i ) n0 ∈ {n0, v, n1, p</formula></div>

(p) (with)</formula><p>That is, we found that for verb-attaching PPs, n2 is usually a role filler for the verb, e.g., the net fills the role of an instrument for the verb catch. On the other hand, for noun-attaching PPs, one noun describes or elaborates on the other. In par- ticular, we found two kinds of noun attachments. For the first kind of noun attachment, the second noun n2 describes the first noun n1, for exam- ple n2 might be an attribute or property of n1, as in the spots(n2) are an attribute of the butter- fly (n1). And for the second kind of noun attach- ment, the first noun n1 describes the second noun n2, as in the PP quad {expect, decline, in, rates}, where the PP "in rates", attaches to the noun. The decline:n1 that is expected:v is in the rates:n2. We sampled 50 PP quads from the WSJ dataset and found that every labeling could be explained using our characterization. We make this labeling avail- able with the rest of the datasets.</p><p>We next describe in more detail how each type of feature is derived from the background knowl- edge in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Feature Generation</head><p>We generate boolean-valued features for all the feature types we describe in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Noun-Noun Binary Relations</head><p>The noun-noun binary relation features, F1-2 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, are boolean features svo(n1, v i , n2) (where v i is any verb) and svo(n2, v, n1) (where v is the verb in the PP quad, and the roles of n2 and n1 are reversed). These features de- scribe diverse semantic relations between pairs of nouns (e.g., butterfly-has-spots, clapton-played- guitar). To obtain this type of knowledge, we dependency parsed all sentences in the 500 mil- lion English web pages of the ClueWeb09 corpus, then extracted subject-verb-object (SVO) triples from these parses, along with the frequency of each SVO triple in the corpus. The value of any given feature svo(n1, v i , n2) is defined to be 1 if that SVO triple was found at least 3 times in these SVO triples, and 0 otherwise. To see why these relations are relevant, let us suppose that we have the knowledge that butterfly-has- spots, svo(n1, v i , n2). From this, we can infer that the PP in {caught, butterf ly, with, spots} is likely to attach to the noun. Similarly, suppose we know that net-caught-butterfly, svo(n2, v, n1). The fact that a net can be used to catch a but- terfly can be used to predict that the PP in {caught, butterf ly, with, net} is likely to attach to the verb.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Noun Semantic Categories</head><p>Noun semantic type features, F3-4, are boolean features isA(n1, t i ) and isA(n2, t i ) where t i is a noun category in a noun categorization scheme T such as WordNet classes. Knowledge about se- mantic types of nouns, for example that a butter- fly is an animal, enables extrapolating predictions to other PP quads that contain nouns of the same type. We ran experiments with several noun cat- egorizations including WordNet classes, knowl- edge base ontological types, and an unsupervised noun categorization produced by clustering nouns based on the verbs and adjectives with which they co-occur (distributional similarity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Verb Role Fillers</head><p>The verb role feature, F5, is a boolean fea- ture hasRole(n2, r i ) where r i is a role that n2 can fulfill for the verb v in the PP quad, according to background knowledge. Notice that if n2 fills a role for the verb, then the PP is a verb attachment. Consider the quad {caught, butterf ly, with, net}, if we know that a net can play the role of an instrument for the verb catch, this suggests a likely verb attachment. We obtained background knowledge of verbs and their possible roles from the VerbNet lexical re- source ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kipper et al., 2008</ref>). From VerbNet we obtained 2, 573 labeled sentences containing PP quads (verbs in the same VerbNet group are con- sidered synonymous), and the labeled semantic roles filled by the second noun n2 in the PP quad. We use these example sentences to label similar PP quads, where similarity of PP quads is defined by verbs from the same VerbNet group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Preposition Definitions</head><p>The preposition definition feature, F 6, is a boolean feature def (prep, v i ) = 1 if ∃v i ∈ M ∧ svo(n1, v i , n2) = 1, where M is a def- inition mapping of prepositions to verb phrases. This mapping defines prepositions, using verbs in our ClueWeb09 derived SVO corpus, in or- der to capture their senses using verbs; it con- tains definitions such as def(with, *) = contains, accompanied by, ... . If "with" is used in the sense of "contains" , then the PP is a likely noun attachment, as in n1 contains n2 in the quad ate, cookies, with, cranberries. However, if "with" is used in the sense of "accompanied by", then the PP is a likely verb attachment, as in the quad visted, P aris, with, Sue. To obtain the mapping, we took the labeled PP quads (WSJ, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994)</ref>) and computed a ranked list of verbs from SVOs, that appear frequently between pairs of nouns for a given preposition. Other sample mappings are: def(for,*)= used for, def(in,*)= located in. Notice that this feature F 6 is a selective, more targeted version of F 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.5">Discourse and Lexical Features</head><p>The discourse feature, F 7, is a boolean feature isA(n0, t i ), for each noun category t i found in a noun category ontology T such as WordNet se- mantic types. The context of the PP quad can contain relevant information for attachment deci- sions. We take into account the noun preceding a PP quad, in particular, its semantic type. This in effect makes the PP quad into a PP 5-tuple: {n0, v, n1, p, n2}, where the n0 provides addi- tional context. Finally, we use lexical features in the form of PP quads, features F8-15. To overcome sparsity of occurrences of PP quads, we also use counts of shorter sub-sequences, including triples, pairs and singles. We only use sub-sequences that con- tain the preposition, as the preposition has been found to be highly crucial in PP attachment deci- sions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Collins and Brooks, 1995</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Disambiguation Algorithm</head><p>We use the described features to train a model for making PP attachment decisions. Our goal is to compute P(y|x), the probability that the PP (p, n2) in the tuple {v, n1, p, n2} attaches to the verb (v) , y = 1 or to the noun(n1), y = 0, given a feature vector x describing that tuple. As input to training the model, we are given a collection of PP quads, D where d i ∈ D : d i = {v, n1, p, n2}. A small subset, D l ⊂ D is labeled data, thus for each d i ∈ D l we know the corresponding y i . The rest of the quads, D u , are unlabeled, hence their corre- sponding y i s are unknown. From each PP quad d i , we extract a feature vector x i according to the fea- ture generation process discussed in Section 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Model</head><p>To model P(y|x), there a various possibilities. One could use a generative model (e.g., Naive Bayes) or a discriminative model ( e.g., logistic re- gression). In our experiments we used both kinds of models, but found the discriminative model per- formed better. Therefore, we present details only for our discriminative model. We use the logistic function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P(y|x, θ) = e θx 1+e θx</formula><p>, where θ is a vec- tor of model parameters. To estimate these pa- rameters, we could use the labeled data as training data and use standard gradient descent to minimize the logistic regression cost function. However, we also leverage the unlabeled data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Parameter Estimation</head><p>To estimate model parameters based on both la- beled and unlabeled data, we use an Expecta- tion Maximization (EM) algorithm. EM estimates model parameters that maximize the expected log likelihood of the full (observed and unobserved) data. Since we are using a discriminative model, our likelihood function is a conditional likelihood function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L(θ) = N i=1 ln P(y i |x i ) = N i=1 y i θ T x i − ln (1 + exp(θ T x i )) (1)</formula><p>where i indexes over the N training examples.</p><p>The EM algorithm produces parameter esti- mates that correspond to a local maximum in the expected log likelihood of the data under the posterior distribution of the labels, given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">arg max θ E p(y|x,θ) [ln P(y|x, θ)].</formula><p>In the E-step, we use the current parameters θ t−1 to compute the posterior distribution over the y labels, give by P(y|x, θ t−1 ). We then use this posterior distri- bution to find the expectation of the log of the complete-data conditional likelihood, this expec- tation is given by Q(θ, θ t−1 ), defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q(θ, θ t−1 ) = N i=1 E θ t−1 [ln P(y|x, θ)] (2)</formula><p>In the M-step, a new estimate θ t is then pro- duced, by maximizing this Q function with respect to θ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">θ t = arg max θ Q(θ, θ t−1 )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>EM iteratively computes parameters θ 0 , θ 1 , ...θ t , using the above update rule at each iteration t, halting when there is no further improvement in the value of the Q function. Our algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. The M-step solution for θ t is obtained using gradient ascent to maximize the Q function.</p></div>

For the unla- beled training data, we extracted PP quads from Wikipedia (WKP) and randomly selected 100, 000 which we found to be a sufficient amount of un- labeled data. The largest labeled test dataset is WSJ but it is also made up of a large fraction, of "of" PP quads, 30% , which trivially attach to the noun, as already seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. The New York Times (NYTC) and Wikipedia (WKP) datasets are smaller but contain fewer proportions of "of" PP quads, 15%, and 14%, respectively. Addition- ally, we applied our model to over 4 million un- labeled 5-tuples from Wikipedia. We make this data available for download, along with our man- ually labeled NYTC and WKP datasets. For the WKP &amp; NYTC corpora, each quad has a preced- ing noun, n0, as context, resulting in PP 5-tuples of the form: {n0, v, n1, p, n2}. The WSJ dataset was only available to us in the form of PP quads with no other sentence information. Methods Under Comparison. 1) PPAD (Prepo- sitional Phrase Attachment Disambiguator) is our proposed method. It uses diverse types of seman- tic knowledge, a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data for training data, a logistic regression classi-  fier, and expectation maximization (EM) for pa- rameter estimation 2) Collins is the established baseline among PP attachment algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collins and Brooks, 1995)</ref>. 3) Stanford Parser is a state- of-the-art dependency parser, the 2014 online ver- sion. 4) PPAD Naive Bayes(NB) is the same as PPAD but uses a generative model, as opposed to the discriminative model used in PPAD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">PPAD vs. Baselines</head><p>Comparison results of our method to the three baselines are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. For each dataset, we also show results when the "of" quads are re- moved, shown as "WKP\of", "NYTC\of", and "WSJ\of". Our method yields improvements over the baselines. Improvements are especially sig- nificant on the datasets for which no labeled data was available (NYTC and WKP). On WKP, our method is 7% and 9% ahead of the Collins base- line and the Stanford parser, respectively. On NYTC, our method is 4% and 6% ahead of the Collins baseline and the Stanford parser, respec- tively. On WSJ, which is the source of the labeled data, our method is not significantly better than the Collins baseline. We could not evaluate the Stanford parser on the WSJ dataset. The parser re- quires well-formed sentences which we could not generate from the WSJ dataset as it was only avail- able to us in the form of PP quads with no other sentence information. For the same reason, we could not generate discourse features,F 7, for the WSJ PP quads. For the NYTC and WKP datasets, we generated well-formed short sentences con- taining only the PP quad and the noun preceding it.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Feature Analysis</head><p>We found that features F 2 and F 6 did not im- prove performance, therefore we excluded them from the final model, PPAD. This means that bi- nary noun-noun relations were not useful when used permissively, feature F 2, but when used se- lectively, feature F 1, we found them to be useful. Our attempt at mapping prepositions to verb def- initions produced some noisy mappings, resulting in feature F 6 producing mixed results. To ana- lyze the impact of the unlabeled data, we inspected the features and their weights as produced by the PPAD model. From the unlabeled data, new lex- ical features were discovered that were not in the original labeled data. Some sample new features with high weights for verb attachments are: (per- form,song,for,*), (lose,*,by,*), (buy,property,in,*). And for noun attachments: (*,conference,on,*), (obtain,degree,in,*), (abolish,taxes,on,*).</p><p>We evaluated several variations of PPAD, the results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. For "PPAD- WordNet Verbs", we expanded the data by replac- ing verbs in PP quads with synonymous WordNet verbs, ignoring verb senses. This resulted in more instances of features F1, F8-10, &amp; F12.</p><p>We also used different types of noun categoriza- tions: WordNet classes, semantic types from the NELL knowledge base ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mitchell et al., 2015)</ref> and unsupervised types. The KB types and the unsu- pervised types did not perform well, possibly due to the noise found in these categorizations. Word- Net classes showed the best results, hence they were used in the final PPAD model for features F3-4 &amp; F7. In Section 5.1, PPAD corresponds to the best model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Discussion: The F1 Score of Knowledge</head><p>Why did we not reach 100% accuracy? Should re- lational knowledge not be providing a much big- ger performance boost than we have seen in the re- sults? To answer these questions, we characterize our features in terms precision and recall, and F1 measure of their knowledge sources in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. A low recall feature means that the feature does not fire on many examples, the feature's knowledge source suffers from low coverage. A low preci- sion feature means that when it fires, the feature could be incorrect, the feature's knowledge source contains a lot of errors.</p><p>From <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, the noun-noun binary relation features (F 1 − 2) have low precision, but high recall. This is because the SVO data, extracted from the ClueWeb09 corpus, that we used as our relational knowledge source is very noisy but it is high coverage. The low precision of the SVO data causes these features to be detrimental to perfor- mance. Notice that when we used a filtered ver- sion of the data, in feature F 2, the data was no longer detrimental to performance. However, the F 2 feature is low recall, and therefore it's impact on performance is also limited. The noun seman- tic category features (F 3 − 4) have high recall and precision, hence it to be expected that their im- pact on performance is significant. The verb role filler features (F 5), obtained from VerbNet have high precision but low recall, hence their marginal impact on performance is also to be expected. The preposition definition features (F 6) poor precision made them unusable. The discourse features (F 7) are based noun semantic types and lexical features <ref type="bibr">(F 8 − 15)</ref>, both of which have high recall and pre- cision, hence they useful impact on performance.</p><p>In summary, low precision in knowledge is detrimental to performance. In order for knowl- edge to make even more significant contributions to language understanding, high precision, high recall knowledge sources are required for all fea- tures types. Success in ongoing efforts in knowl- edge base construction projects, will make perfor- mance of our algorithm better.

PPAD predicted verb attachments with accuracy &gt;90% in all relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Application to Ternary Relations</head><p>Through the application of ternary relation extrac- tion, we further tested PPAD's PP disambiguation accuracy and illustrated its usefulness for knowl- edge base population. Recall that a PP 5-tuple of the form {n0, v, n1, p, n2}, whose enclosed PP at- taches to the verb v, denotes a ternary relation with arguments n0, n1, &amp; n2. Therefore, we can extract a ternary relation from every 5-tuple for which our method predicts a verb attachment. If we have a mapping between verbs and binary relations from a knowledge base (KB), we can extend KB rela- tions to ternary relations by augmenting the KB relations with a third argument n2.</p><p>We considered four KB binary re- lations and their instances such as worksF or(T imCook, Apple), from the NELL KB. We then took the collection of 4 million 5-tuples that we extracted from Wikipedia. We mapped verbs in 5-tuples to KB relations, based on significant overlaps in the instances of the KB relations, noun pairs such as (T imCook, Apple) with the n0, n1 pairs in the Wikipedia PP 5-tuple collection. We found that, for example, instances of the noun-noun KB relation "worksFor" match n0, n1 pairs in tuples where v = joined and p = as , with n2 referring to the job title. Other binary relations extended are: "hasSpouse" ex- tended by "in" with wedding location, "acquired" extended by "from" with the seller of the company being acquired. Examples are shown in <ref type="table">Table  6</ref>. In all these mappings, the proportion of verb attachments in the corresponding PP quads is significantly high ( &gt; 90%). PPAD is overwhelm- ing making the right attachment decisions in this setting.</p><p>Efforts in temporal and spatial relation extrac- tion have shown that higher N-ary relation extrac- tion is challenging. Since prepositions specify de- tails that transform binary relations to higher N- ary relations, our method can be used to read infor- mation that can augment binary relations already in KBs. As future work, we would like to incor- porate our method into a pipeline for reading be- yond binary relations. One possible direction is to read details about the where,why, who of events and relations, effectively moving from extracting only binary relations to reading at a more general level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a knowledge-intensive ap- proach to prepositional phrase (PP) attachment disambiguation, which is a type of syntactic ambi- guity. Our method incorporates knowledge about verbs, nouns, discourse, and noun-noun binary re- lations. We trained a model using labeled data and unlabeled data, making use of expectation max- imization for parameter estimation. Our method can be seen as an example of tapping into a pos- itive feedback loop for machine reading, which has only become possible in recent years due to the progress made by information extraction and knowledge base construction techniques. That is, using background knowledge from existing re- sources to read better in order to further populate knowledge bases with otherwise difficult to extract knowledge. As future work, we would like to use our method to extract more than just binary rela- tions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Parse trees where the prepositional phrase (PP) attaches to the noun, and to the verb.</figDesc><graphic url="image-8.png" coords="1,345.64,271.68,63.95,63.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>
