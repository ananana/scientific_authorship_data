				<p>A major challenge of semantic parsing is the vocabulary mismatch problem between natural language and target ontol-ogy. In this paper, we propose a sentence rewriting based semantic parsing method, which can effectively resolve the mismatch problem by rewriting a sentence into a new form which has the same structure with its target logical form. Specifically , we propose two sentence-rewriting methods for two common types of mis-match: a dictionary-based method for 1-N mismatch and a template-based method for N-1 mismatch. We evaluate our sentence rewriting based semantic parser on the benchmark semantic parsing dataset-WEBQUESTIONS. Experimental results show that our system outperforms the base system with a 3.4% gain in F1, and generates logical forms more accurately and parses sentences more robustly.</p>

Semantic parsing is a fundamental technique of natural language understanding, and has been used in many applications, such as question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Liang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">He et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhang et al., 2016</ref>) and information extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Choi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Parikh et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Semantic parsing, however, is a challenging</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sentence:</head><p>What is the capital of Germany?</p><p>Logical form: λx.capital <ref type="bibr">(Germany,x)</ref> Result: {Berlin} task. Due to the variety of natural language ex- pressions, the same meaning can be expressed us- ing different sentences. Furthermore, because log- ical forms depend on the vocabulary of target- ontology, a sentence will be parsed into different logical forms when using different ontologies. For example, in below the two sentences s 1 and s 2 express the same meaning, and they both can be parsed into the two different logical forms lf 1 and lf 2 using different ontologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>s1</head><p>What is the population of Berlin? s2</p><p>How many people live in Berlin? lf1 λx.population(Berlin,x) lf2 count(λx.person(x)∧live(x,Berlin)) Based on the above observations, one major challenge of semantic parsing is the structural mis- match between a natural language sentence and its target logical form, which are mainly raised by the vocabulary mismatch between natural lan- guage and ontologies. Intuitively, if a sentence has the same structure with its target logical form, it is easy to get the correct parse, e.g., a semantic parser can easily parse s 1 into lf 1 and s 2 into lf 2 . On the contrary, it is difficult to parse a sentence into its logic form when they have different structures, e.g., s 1 → lf 2 or s 2 → lf 1 .</p><p>To resolve the vocabulary mismatch problem, (a) An example using traditional method s0 : What is the name of Sonia Gandhis daughter? l0 : λx.child(S.G.,x) r0 : {Rahul Gandhi (Wrong answer), Priyanka Vadra} (b) An example using our method s0 : What is the name of Sonia Gandhis daughter? s1 : What is the name of Sonia Gandhis female child? l1 : λx.child(S.G.,x)∧gender(x,female) r1 : {Priyanka Vadra} <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Examples of (a) sentences s 0 , possible logical form l 0 from traditional semantic parser, result r 0 for the logical form l 0 ; (b) possible sen- tence s 1 from rewriting for the original sentence s 0 , possible logical form l 1 for sentence s 1 , result r 1 for l <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Rahul Gandhi is a wrong answer, as he is the son of Sonia Gandhi.</p><p>this paper proposes a sentence rewriting approach for semantic parsing, which can rewrite a sen- tence into a form which will have the same struc- ture with its target logical form. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gives an example of our rewriting-based semantic pars- ing method. In this example, instead of parsing the sentence "What is the name of Sonia Gand- his daughter?" into its structurally different log- ical form childOf.S.G.∧gender.female directly, our method will first rewrite the sentence into the form "What is the name of Sonia Gand- his female child?", which has the same structure with its logical form, then our method will get the logical form by parsing this new form. In this way, the semantic parser can get the correct parse more easily. For example, the parse obtained through traditional method will result in the wrong answer "Rahul Gandhi", because it cannot iden- tify the vocabulary mismatch between "daughter" and child∧female 1 . By contrast, by rewriting "daughter" into "female child", our method can resolve this vocabulary mismatch. Specifically, we identify two common types of vocabulary mismatch in semantic parsing:</p><p>1. 1-N mismatch: a simple word may corre- spond to a compound formula. For example, the word "daughter" may correspond to the compound formula child∧female.</p><p>2. N-1 mismatch: a logical constant may cor- respond to a complicated natural language expression, e.g., the formula population can be expressed using many phrases such as "how many people" and "live in".</p><p>To resolve the above two vocabulary mismatch problems, this paper proposes two sentence rewrit- ing algorithms: One is a dictionary-based sen- tence rewriting algorithm, which can resolve the 1-N mismatch problem by rewriting a word us- ing its explanation in a dictionary. The other is a template-based sentence rewriting algorithm, which can resolve the N-1 mismatch problem by rewriting complicated expressions using para- phrase template pairs.</p><p>Given the generated rewritings of a sentence, we propose a ranking function to jointly choose the optimal rewriting and the correct logical form, by taking both the rewriting features and the se- mantic parsing features into consideration.</p><p>We conduct experiments on the benchmark WEBQUESTIONS dataset <ref type="bibr">(Berant et al., 2013)</ref>. Experimental results show that our method can ef- fectively resolve the vocabulary mismatch prob- lem and achieve accurate and robust performance.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 de- scribes our sentence rewriting method for seman- tic parsing. Section 4 presents the scoring func- tion which can jointly ranks rewritings and logical forms. Section 5 discusses experimental results. Section 6 concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Semantic parsing has attracted considerable re- search attention in recent years. Generally, se- mantic parsing methods can be categorized into synchronous context free grammars (SCFG) based methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wong and Mooney, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arthur et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li et al., 2015</ref>), syntactic structure based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ge and Mooney, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Reddy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reddy et al., 2016)</ref>, combinatory categor- ical grammars (CCG) based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kwiatkowksi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kwiatkowski et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Artzi et al., 2015)</ref>, and dependency-based compositional se- mantics (DCS) based methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Liang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berant and Liang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Berant and Liang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pasupat and Liang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>One major challenge of semantic parsing is how to scale to open-domain situation like Freebase and Web. A possible solution is to learn lexicons from large amount of web text and a knowledge base using a distant supervised method <ref type="bibr">(Krishna-murthy and Mitchell, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cai and Yates, 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berant et al., 2013)</ref>. Another challenge is how to alleviate the burden of annotation. A possible so- lution is to employ distant-supervised techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clarke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Liang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cai and Yates, 2013b;</ref>, or unsupervised techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Poon and Domingos, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goldwasser et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Poon, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>There were also several approaches focused on the mismatch problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kwiatkowski et al. (2013)</ref> addressed the ontology mismatch prob- lem (i.e., two ontologies using different vocabu- laries) by first parsing a sentence into a domain- independent underspecified logical form, and then using an ontology matching model to transform this underspecified logical form to the target on- tology. However, their method is still hard to deal with the 1-N and the N-1 mismatch prob- lems between natural language and target ontolo- gies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berant and Liang (2014)</ref> addressed the struc- ture mismatch problem between natural language and ontology by generating a set of canonical ut- terances for each candidate logical form, and then using a paraphrasing model to rerank the candi- date logical forms. Their method addresses mis- match problem in the reranking stage, cannot re- solve the mismatch problem when constructing candidate logical forms. Compared with these two methods, we approach the mismatch prob- lem in the parsing stage, which can greatly reduce the difficulty of constructing the correct logical form, through rewriting sentences into the forms which will be structurally consistent with their tar- get logic forms.</p><p>Sentence rewriting (or paraphrase generation) is the task of generating new sentences that have the same meaning as the original one. Sentence rewriting has been used in many different tasks, e.g., used in statistical machine translation to re- solve the word order mismatch problem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">He et al., 2015)</ref>. To our best knowl- edge, this paper is the first work to apply sentence rewriting for vocabulary mismatch problem in se- mantic parsing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Sentence Rewriting for Semantic Parsing</head><p>As discussed before, the vocabulary mismatch be- tween natural language and target ontology is a big challenge in semantic parsing. In this section, we describe our sentence rewriting algorithm for  solving the mismatch problem. Specifically, we solve the 1-N mismatch problem by dictionary- based rewriting and solve the N-1 mismatch prob- lem by template-based rewriting. The details are as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dictionary-based Rewriting</head><p>In the 1-N mismatch case, a word will correspond to a compound formula, e.g., the target logical form of the word "daughter" is child∧female <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref> has more examples).</p><p>To resolve the 1-N mismatch problem, we rewrite the original word ("daughter") into an expression ("female child") which will have the same structure with its target logical form (child∧female). In this paper, we rewrite words using their explanations in a dictionary. This is because each word in a dictionary will be defined by a detailed explanation using sim- ple words, which often will have the same struc- ture with its target formula. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows how the vocabulary mismatch between a word and its logical form can be resolved using its dictionary explanation. For instance, the word "daughter" is explained as "female child" in Wiktionary, which has the same structure as child∧female.</p><p>In most cases, only common nouns will result in the 1-N mismatch problem. Therefore, in order to control the size of rewritings, this paper only rewrite the common nouns in a sentence by replac- ing them with their dictionary explanations. Be- cause a sentence usually will not contain too many common nouns, the size of candidate rewritings is thus controllable. Given the generated rewrit- ings of a sentence, we propose a sentence selection model to choose the best rewriting using multiple features (See details in Section 4). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows an example of the dictionary- based rewriting. In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, the example sen- tence s contains two common nouns ("name" and "daughter"), therefore we will generate three rewritings r 1 , r 2 and r 3 . Among these rewritings, s : What is the name of Sonia Gandhis daughter? r1: What is the reputation of Sonia Gandhis daughter? r2: What is the name of Sonia Gandhis female child? r3: What is the reputation of Sonia Gandhis female child? <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: An example of the dictionary-based sen- tence rewriting. the candidate rewriting r 2 is what we expected, as it has the same structure with the target logical form and doesn't bring extra noise (i.e., replacing "name" with its explanation "reputation").</p><p>For the dictionary used in rewriting, this paper uses Wiktionary. Specifically, given a word, we use its "Translations" part in the Wiktionary as its explanation. Because most of the 1-N mismatch are caused by common nouns, we only collect the explanations of common nouns. Furthermore, for polysomic words which have several explanations, we only use their most common explanations. Be- sides, we ignore explanations whose length are longer than 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Template-based Rewriting</head><p>In the N-1 mismatch case, a complicated natu- ral language expression will be mapped to a sin- gle logical constant. For example, considering the following mapping from the natural language sen- tence s to its logical form lf based on Freebase ontology:</p><p>s: How many people live in Berlin? lf : λx.population <ref type="bibr">(Berlin,x)</ref> where the three words: "how many" (count), "people" (people) and "live in" (live) will map to the predicate population together. <ref type="table">Ta- ble 4</ref> shows more N-1 examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expression</head><p>Logical constant how many, people, live in population how many, people, visit, annually</p><p>annual-visit what money, use currency what school, go to education what language, speak, officially official- language <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Several N-1 mismatch examples.</p><p>To resolve the N-1 mismatch problem, we pro- pose a template rewriting algorithm, which can rewrite a complicated expression into its sim- pler form. Specifically, we rewrite sentences based on a set of paraphrase template pairs P = {(t i1 , t i2 )|i = 1, 2, ..., n}, where each template t How many people live in $y What is the population of $y What money in $y is used What is the currency of $y</p><p>What school did $y go to What is the education of $y What language does $y speak officially What is the official language of $y is a sentence with an argument slot $y, and t i1 and t i2 are paraphrases. In this paper, we only con- sider single-slot templates. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref> shows several paraphrase template pairs. Given the template pair database and a sentence, our template-based rewriting algorithm works as follows:</p><p>1. Firstly, we generate a set of candidate tem- plates ST = {st 1 , st 2 , ..., st n } of the sen- tence by replacing each named entity within it by "$y". For example, we will gener- ate template "How many people live in $y" from the sentence "How many people live in Berlin".</p><p>2. Secondly, using the paraphrase template pair database, we retrieve all possible rewriting template pairs (t 1 , t 2 ) with t 1 ∈ ST , e.g., we can retrieve template pair ("How many peo- ple live there in $y", "What is the population of $y" for t 2 ) using the above ST .</p><p>3. Finally, we get the rewritings by replacing the argument slot "$y" in template t 2 with the corresponding named entity. For exam- ple, we get a new candidate sentence "What is the population of Berlin" by replacing "$y" in t 2 with Berlin. In this way we can get the rewriting we expected, since this rewriting will match its target logical form population(Berlin).</p><p>To control the size and measure the quality of rewritings using a specific template pair, we also define several features and the similarity between template pairs (See Section 4 for details).</p><p>To build the paraphrase template pair database, we employ the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fader et al. (2014)</ref> to automatically collect paraphrase tem- plate pairs. Specifically, we use the WikiAnswers paraphrase corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fader et al., 2013</ref>), which con- tains 23 million question-clusters, and all ques- tions in the same cluster express the same mean- ing. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 6</ref> shows two paraphrase clusters from the WikiAnswers corpus. To build paraphrase template pairs, we first replace the shared noun words in each cluster with the placeholder "$y", then each two templates in a cluster will form a paraphrase template pair. To filter out noisy tem- plate pairs, we only retain salient paraphrase tem- plate pairs whose co-occurrence count is larger than 3.</p><note type="other">How many people live in chembakolli?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Sentence Rewriting based Semantic Parsing</head><p>In this section we describe our semantic rewriting based semantic parsing system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> presents the framework of our system. Given a sentence, we first rewrite it into a set of new sentences, then we generate candidate logical forms for each new sentence using a base semantic parser, finally we score all logical forms using a scoring function and output the best logical form as the final result.</p><p>In following, we first introduce the used base se- mantic parser, then we describe the proposed scor- ing function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Base Semantic Parser</head><p>In this paper, we produce logical forms for each sentence rewritings using an agenda-based seman- tic parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Berant and Liang, 2015)</ref>, which is based on the lambda-DCS proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Liang (2013)</ref>. For parsing, we use the lexicons and the grammars released by <ref type="bibr">Berant et al. (2013)</ref>, where lexicons are used to trigger unary and binary pred- icates, and grammars are used to conduct logical forms. The only difference is that we also use the composition rule to make the parser can handle complicated questions involving two binary pred- icates, e.g., child.obama∧gender.female. For model learning and sentence parsing, the base semantic parser learned a scoring function by modeling the policy as a log-linear distribution over (partial) agenda derivations Q:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p θ (a|s) = exp{φ(a) T θ)} a ∈A exp{φ(a ) T θ)}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The policy parameters are updated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">θ ← θ + ηR(h target ) T t=1 δ(h target )<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">δ t (h) = θ log p θ (a t |s t ) = φ(a t ) − E p θ (a t |st) [φ(a t )]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The reward function R(h) measures the compati- bility of the resulting derivation, and η is the learn- ing rate which is set using the AdaGrad algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Duchi et al., 2011</ref>). The target history h target is generated from the root derivation d * with highest reward out of the K (beam size) root derivations, using local reweighting and history compression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Scoring Function</head><p>To select the best semantic parse, we propose a scoring function which can take both sentence rewriting features and semantic parsing features into consideration. Given a sentence x, a gener- ated rewriting x and the derivation d of x , we score them using follow function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">score(x, x , d) = θ · φ(x, x , d) = θ 1 · φ(x, x ) + θ 2 · φ(x , d)</formula><p>This scoring function is decomposed into two parts: one for sentence rewriting -θ 1 · φ(x, x ) and the other for semantic parsing -θ 2 · φ(x , d). Following Berant and Liang (2015), we update the parameters θ 2 of semantic parsing features as the Input: Q/A pairs {(xi, yi) : i = 1...n}; Knowledge base K; Number of sentences N ; Number of iterations T .</p><p>Definitions: The function REW RIT IN G(xi) returns a set of candidate sentences by applying sentence rewriting on sentence x; P ARSE(p θ , x) parses the sentence x based on current parameters θ, using agenda- based parsing; CHOOSEORACLE(h0) chooses the derivation with highest reward from the root of h0; CHOOSEORACLE(Htarget) chooses the derivation with highest reward from a set of derivations. CHOOSEORACLE(h * target ) chooses the new sen- tence that results in derivation with highest reward.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Parameter Learning Algorithm</head><p>To estimate the parameters θ 1 and θ 2 , our learn- ing algorithm uses a set of question-answer pairs (x i , y i ). Following Berant and Liang (2015), our updates for θ 1 and θ 2 do not maximize reward nor the log-likelihood. However, the reward provides a way to modulate the magnitude of the updates. Specifically, after each update, our model results in making the derivation, which has the highest re- ward, to get a bigger score. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 7</ref> presents our learning algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Features</head><p>As described in Section 4.3, our model uses two kinds of features. One for the semantic parsing module which are simply the same features de- scribed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Berant and Liang (2015)</ref>. One for the sentence rewriting module these features are de- fined over the original sentence, the generated sen- tence rewritings and the final derivations:</p><p>Features for dictionary-based rewriting. Given a sentence s 0 , when the new sentence s 1 is gener- ated by replacing a word to its explanation w → ex, we will generate four features: The first fea- ture indicates the word replaced. The second fea- ture indicates the replacement w → ex we used. The final two features are the POS tags of the left word and the right word of w in s 0 .</p><p>Features for template-based rewriting. Given a sentence s 0 , when the new sentence s 1 is gener- ated through a template based rewriting t 1 → t 2 , we generate four features: The first feature indi- cates the template pair (t 1 , t 2 ) we used. The sec- ond feature is the similarity between the sentence s 0 and the template t 1 , which is calculated using the word overlap between s 0 and t 1 . The third feature is the compatibility of the template pair, which is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between t 1 and t 2 in the WikiAnswers corpus. The final feature is triggered when the target logical form only contains an atomic formula (or predi- cate), and this feature indicates the mapping from template t 2 to the predicate p.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we assess our method and compare it with other methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Settings</head><p>Dataset: We evaluate all systems on the bench- mark WEBQUESTIONS dataset <ref type="bibr">(Berant et al., 2013)</ref>, which contains 5,810 question-answer pairs. All questions are collected by crawling the Google Suggest API, and their answers are obtained using Amazon Mechanical Turk. This dataset covers several popular topics and its ques- tions are commonly asked on the web. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yao (2015)</ref>, 85% of questions can be answered by predicting a single binary relation. In our ex- periments, we use the standard train-test split (Be- rant et al., 2013), i.e., 3,778 questions (65%) for training and 2,032 questions (35%) for testing, and divide the training set into 3 random 80%-20% splits for development. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our method on solving the vocabulary mismatch prob- lem, we manually select 50 mismatch test exam- ples from the WEBQUESTIONS dataset, where all sentences have different structure with their tar- get logical forms, e.g., "Who is keyshia cole dad?" and "What countries have german as the official language?". System Settings: In our experiments, we use the Freebase Search API for entity lookup. We load Freebase using Virtuoso, and execute logical forms by converting them to SPARQL and query- ing using Virtuoso. We learn the parameters of our system by making three passes over the training dataset, with the beam size K = 200, the dictio- nary rewriting size K D = 100, and the template rewriting size K T = 100. Baselines: We compare our method with sev- eral traditional systems, including semantic pars- ing based systems <ref type="bibr">(Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berant and Liang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Berant and Liang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yih et al., 2015)</ref>, information extraction based systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Yao and Van Durme, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yao, 2015)</ref>, machine trans- lation based systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bao et al., 2014</ref>), embed- ding based systems ( <ref type="bibr">Bordes et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yang et al., 2014)</ref>, and QA based system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bast and Haussmann, 2015)</ref>. Evaluation: Following previous work <ref type="bibr">(Berant et al., 2013)</ref>, we evaluate different systems using the fraction of correctly answered questions. Because golden answers may have multiple values, we use the average F1 score as the main evaluation metric. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 8</ref> provides the performance of all base-lines and our method. We can see that:</p></div>

The semantic parser can achieve a higher performance improve- ment when using these two rewriting meth- ods together.</p><p>The effect on improving robustness. We found that the template-based rewriting method can greatly improve the robustness of the base se- mantic parser. Specially, the template-based method can rewrite similar sentences into a uniform template, and the (template, predi- cate) feature can provide additional informa- tion to reduce the uncertainty during parsing. For example, using only the uncertain align- ments from the words "people" and "speak" to the two predicates official language and language spoken, the base parser will parse the sentence "What does jamaican peo- ple speak?" into the incorrect logical form official language.jamaican in our ex- periments, rather than into the correct form language spoken.jamaican (See the final example in <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>). By exploiting the alignment from the template "what language does $y people speak" to the predicate , our system can parse the above sentence correctly. The effect on OOV problem. We found that the sentence rewriting method can also provide extra 2 Our base system yields a slight drop in accuracy com- pared to the original system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Berant and Liang, 2015)</ref>, as we parallelize the learning algorithm, and the order of the data for updating the parameter is different to theirs.</p></div>

Traditionally, if a sentence contains a word which is not covered by the lexicon, it will cannot be correctly parsed. However, with the help of sentence rewriting, we may rewrite the OOV words into the words which are covered by our lexicons. For example, in <ref type="table">Table  11</ref> the 3rd question "What are some of the tradi- tions of islam?" cannot be correctly parsed as the lexicons dont cover the word "tradition". Through sentence rewriting, we can generate a new sen- tence "What is of the religion of islam?", where all words are covered by the lexicons, in this way the sentence can be correctly parsed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Error Analysis</head><p>To better understand our system, we conduct er- ror analysis on the parse results. Specifically, we randomly choose 100 questions which are not cor- rectly answered by our system. We found that the errors are mainly raised by following four reasons (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 12</ref>   The main reasons of parsing errors, the ratio and an example for each reason are also pro- vided.</p><p>The first reason is the label issue. The main la- bel issue is incompleteness, i.e., the answers of a question may not be labeled completely. For ex- ample, for the question "Who does nolan ryan play for?", our system returns 4 correct teams but the golden answer only contain 2 teams. One another label issue is the error labels. For example, the gold answer of the question "What state is barack obama from?" is labeled as "Illinois", however, the correct answer is "Hawaii".</p><p>The second reason is the n-ary predicate prob- lem (n &gt; 2). Currently, it is hard for a parser to conduct the correct logical form of n-ary pred- icates. For example, the question "What year did the seahawks win the superbowl?" describes an n- ary championship event, which gives the champi- onship and the champion of the event, and expects the season. We believe that more research atten- tions should be given on complicated cases, such as the n-ary predicates parsing.</p><p>The third reason is temporal clause. For ex- ample, the question "Who did nasri play for be- fore arsenal?" contains a temporal clause "be- fore". We found temporal clause is complicated and makes it strenuous for the parser to understand the sentence.</p><p>The fourth reason is superlative case, which is a hard problem in semantic parsing. For example, to answer "What was the name of henry viii first wife?", we should choose the first one from a list ordering by time. Unfortunately, it is difficult for the current parser to decide what to be ordered and how to order.</p><p>There are also many other miscellaneous error cases, such as spelling error in the question, e.g., "capitol" for "capital", "mary" for "marry".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we present a novel semantic pars- ing method, which can effectively deal with the mismatch between natural language and target on- tology using sentence rewriting. We resolve two common types of mismatch (i) one word in natu- ral language sentence vs one compound formula in target ontology (1-N), (ii) one complicated expres- sion in natural language sentence vs one formula in target ontology (N-1). Then we present two sen- tence rewriting methods, dictionary-based method for 1-N mismatch and template-based method for N-1 mismatch. The resulting system significantly outperforms the base system on the WEBQUES- TIONS dataset.</p><p>Currently, our approach only leverages sim- ple sentence rewriting methods. In future work, we will explore more advanced sentence rewrit- ing methods. Furthermore, we also want to em- ploy sentence rewriting techniques for other chal- lenges in semantic parsing, such as the sponta- neous, unedited natural language input, etc.</p><p>Jonathan Berant and Percy Liang. 2015.
