				<p>Because word semantics can substantially change across communities and contexts, capturing domain-specific word semantics is an important challenge. Here, we propose SEMAXIS, a simple yet powerful framework to characterize word semantics using many semantic axes in word-vector spaces beyond sentiment. We demonstrate that SEMAXIS can capture nuanced semantic representations in multiple online communities. We also show that, when the sentiment axis is examined, SEMAXIS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in building domain-specific sentiment lexicons.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In lexicon-based text analysis, a common, tacit as- sumption is that the meaning of each word does not change significantly across contexts. This ap- proximation, however, falls short because context can strongly alter the meaning of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fischer, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hovy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hamilton et al., 2016b</ref>). For instance, the word kill may be used much more positively in the context of video games than it would be in a news story; the word soft may be used much more nega- tively in the context of sports than it is in the con- text of toy animals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016a</ref>). Thus, lexicon-based analysis exhibits a clear limitation when two groups with strongly dissimilar lexical contexts are compared.</p><p>Recent breakthroughs in vector-space repre- sentation, such as word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mikolov et al., 2013b)</ref>, provide new opportunities to tackle this challenge of context-dependence, because in these approaches, the representation of each word is learned from its context. For instance, a re- cent study shows that a propagation method on the vector space embedding can infer context- dependent sentiment values of words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016a</ref>). Yet, it remains to be seen whether it is possible to generalize this idea to general word semantics other than sentiment.</p><p>In this work, we propose SEMAXIS, a lightweight framework to characterize domain- specific word semantics beyond sentiment. SE- MAXIS characterizes word semantics with re- spect to many semantic perspectives in a domain- specific word-vector space. To systematically dis- cover the manifold of word semantics, we induce 732 semantic axes based on the antonym pairs from ConceptNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Speer et al., 2017)</ref>. We would like to emphasize that, although some of the in- duced axes can be considered as an extended ver- sion of sentiment analysis, such as an axis of 're- spectful' (positive) and 'disrespectful' (negative), some cannot be mapped to a positive and negative relationship, such as 'exogeneous <ref type="bibr">' and 'endogeneous,' and 'loose' and 'monogamous.</ref>' Based on this rich set of semantic axes, SEMAXIS captures nuanced semantic representations across corpora.</p><p>The key contributions of this paper are:</p><p>• We propose a general framework to charac- terize the manifold of domain-specific word semantics.</p><p>• We systematically identify semantic axes based on the antonym pairs in ConceptNet.</p><p>• We demonstrate that SEMAXIS can capture semantic differences between two corpora.</p><p>• We provide a systematic evaluation in comparison to the state-of-the-art, domain- specific sentiment lexicon construction methodologies. Although the idea of defining a semantic axis and assessing the meaning of a word with a vec- tor projection is not new, it has not been demon- strated that this simple method can effectively in-duce context-aware semantic lexicons. All of the inferred lexicons along with code for SEMAXIS and all methods evaluated are made available in the SEMAXIS package released with this paper 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>For decades, researchers have been developing computational techniques for text analysis, includ- ing: sentiment analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pang and Lee, 2004</ref>), stance detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Biber and Finegan, 1988)</ref>, point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wiebe, 1994)</ref>, and opinion mining ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pang and Lee, 2004</ref>). The practice of creating and shar- ing large-scale annotated lexicons also accelerated the research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stone et al., 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bradley and Lang, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pennebaker et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dodds et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mohammad et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mohammad et al., , 2017</ref>.</p><p>These approaches can be roughly grouped into two major categories: lexicon-based ap- proach <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Turney, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taboada et al., 2011</ref>) and classification-based approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pang et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Socher et al., 2013)</ref>. Although the recent advancement of neural networks in- creases the potential of the latter approach, the former has been widely used for its simplicity and transparency. ANEW <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bradley and Lang, 1999</ref>), LIWC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pennebaker et al., 2001</ref>), SO- CAL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taboada et al., 2011</ref>), SentiWordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006</ref>), and <ref type="bibr">LabMT (Dodds et al., 2011</ref>) are well-known lexicons.</p><p>A clear limitation of the lexicon-based approach is that it overlooks the context-dependent seman- tic changes. Scholars reported that the meaning of a word can be altered by context, such as com- munities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Yang and Eisenstein, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016a</ref>), diachronic changes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hamilton et al., 2016b</ref>) or demographic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Green, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hovy, 2015)</ref>, geography <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Trudgill, 1974)</ref>, political and cultural attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fischer, 1958)</ref> and personal variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yang and Eisenstein, 2017</ref>). Recently, a few studies have shown the importance of taking such context into ac- counts. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hovy et al. (2015)</ref> showed that, by including author demographics such as age and gender, the accuracy of sentiment anal- ysis and topic classification can be improved. It was also shown that, without domain-specific lex- icons, the performance of sentiment analysis can be significantly degraded ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>Building domain-specific sentiment lexicons 1 https://github.com/ghdi6758/SemAxis through human input (crowdsourcing or experts) requires not only significant resources but also careful control of biases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dodds et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mohammad and Turney, 2010)</ref>. The challenge is exacerbated because 'context' is difficult to con- cretely operationalize and there can be numer- ous contexts of interest. For resource-scarce lan- guages, such problems become even more crit- ical ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hong et al., 2013)</ref>. Automatically build- ing lexicons from web-scale resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Velikovich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al., 2014</ref>) may solve this problem but poses a severe risk of unintended bi- ases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Loughran and McDonald, 2011</ref>). Inducing domain-specific lexicons from the un- labeled corpora reduces the cost of dictionary building ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rothe et al., 2016)</ref>. Although earlier research utilize syntactic (grammatical) structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Widdows and Dorow, 2002</ref>), the approach of learning word- vector representations has gained a lot of momen- tum ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rothe et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Velikovich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fast et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The most relevant work is SENTPROP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hamilton et al., 2016a</ref>), which constructs domain- specific sentiment lexicons using graph propaga- tion techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Velikovich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rao and Ravichandran, 2009)</ref>. In contrast to SENTPROP's sentiment-focused approach, we provide a frame- work to understand the semantics of words with respect to 732 semantic axes based on Concept- Net ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Speer et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SEMAXIS Framework</head><p>Our framework, SEMAXIS, involves three steps: constructing a word embedding, defining a se- mantic axis, and mapping words onto the seman- tic axis. Although they seem straightforward, the complexities and challenges in each step can add up. In particular, we tackle the issues of treating small corpora and selecting pole words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Basics of SEMAXIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Building word embeddings</head><p>The first step in our approach is to obtain word vectors from a given corpus. In principle, any stan- dard method, such as Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI), Singular-Value Decomposi- tion (SVD), or word2vec, can be used. Here, we use the word2vec model because word2vec is easier to train and is known to be more robust than competing methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Levy et al., 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Defining a semantic axis and computing the semantic axis vector</head><p>A semantic axis is defined by the vector between two sets of 'pole' words that are antonymous to each other. For instance, a sentiment axis can be defined by a set of the most positive words on one end and the most negative words on the other end. Similarly, any antonymous word pair can be used to define a semantic axis (e.g., 'clean' vs. 'dirty' or 'respectful' vs. 'disrespectful').</p><p>Once two sets of pole words for the correspond- ing axis are chosen, we compute the average vec- tor for each pole. Then, by subtracting one vec- tor from the other, we obtain the semantic axis vector that encodes the antonymous relationship between two sets of words. More formally, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S + ={v + 1 , v + 2 , ..., v + n } and S − ={v − 1 , v − 2 , .</formula><p>.., v − m } be two sets of pole word vectors that have an antonym relationship. Then, the average vectors for each set are computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V + = 1 n n 1 v + i and V − = 1 m m 1 v − j .</formula><p>From the two average vectors, the semantic axis vector, V axis (from S − to S + ), can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V axis = V + − V − (1)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Projecting words onto a semantic axis</head><p>Once the semantic axis vector is obtained, we can compute the cosine similarity between the axis vector and a word vector. The resulting cosine similarity captures how closely the word is aligned to the semantic axis. Given a word vector v w for a word w, the score of the word w along with the given semantic axis, V axis , is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">score(w) V axis = cos(v w , V axis ) = v w · V axis v w V axis (2)</formula><p>A higher score means that the word w is more closely aligned to S + than S − . When V axis is a sentiment axis, a higher score is corresponds to more positive sentiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">SEMAXIS for Comparative Text Analysis</head><p>Although aforementioned steps are conceptually simple, there are two practical challenges: 1) deal- ing with small corpus and 2) finding good pole words for building a semantic axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Semantic relations encoded in word embeddings</head><p>Since semantic relations are particularly impor- tant in our method, we need to ensure that our word embedding maintains general semantic re- lations. This can be evaluated by analogy tasks. In particular, we use the Google analogy test dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikolov et al., 2013a)</ref>, which contains 19,544 questions -8,869 semantic and 10,675 syntactic questions -in 14 relation types, such as capital-world pairs and opposite relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Dealing with small corpus</head><p>As in other machine learning tasks, the amount of data critically influences the performance of word embedding methods. However, the corpora of our interest are often too small to facilitate the learning of rich semantic relationships therein. To mitigate this issue, we propose to pre-train a word embed- ding using a background corpus and update with the target corpora. In doing so, we capture the se- mantic changes while maintaining general seman- tic relations offered by the large reference model.</p><p>The vector-space embedding drifts from the ref- erence model as we train with the target corpus. If trained too much with the smaller target corpus, it will lose the 'good' initial embedding from the huge reference corpus. If trained too little, it will not be able to capture context-dependent semantic changes. Our goal is thus to minimize the loss in general semantic relations while maximizing the characteristic semantic relations in the new texts.</p><p>Consider a corpus of our interest C and a ref- erence corpus R. The model M is pre-trained on R, and then we start training it on C. We use the superscript e to represent the e-th epoch of train- ing. That is, M e C is the model after the e-th epoch trained on C. Then, we evaluate the model regard- ing two aspects: general semantic relations and context-dependent semantic relations. The former is measured by the overall accuracy of the anal- ogy test <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mikolov et al., 2013a</ref>). The latter is measured by tracking the semantic changes of the top k words in the given corpus C. The semantic changes of the words are measured by the changes in their scores, ∆, on a certain axis; for instance, a sentiment axis, between consecutive epochs. We stop learning when two conditions are satisfied: (1) When the accuracy of the analogy test drops by α; and (2) When ∆ is lower than β. In principle, the model can be updated with the target corpus as long as the accuracy does not drop. We then use β to control the epochs. When ∆ is low, the gain by updating the model becomes negligible compared to the cost and thus we can stop updating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Identifying rich semantic axes for SEMAXIS</head><p>The primary advantage of SEMAXIS is that it can be easily extended to examine diverse perspectives of texts as it is lightweight. Although the axis can be defined by any pair of words in principle, we propose a systematic way to define the axes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">732 Pre-defined Semantic Axes</head><p>We begin with a pair of antonyms, called initial pole words. For instance, a sentiment axis, which is a basis of sentiment analyses, can be defined by a pair of sentiment antonyms, such as 'good' and 'bad.' To build a comprehensive set of initial pole words, we compile a list of antonyms from Con- ceptNet 5.5, which is the latest release of a knowl- edge graph among concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Speer et al., 2017)</ref>. We extract all the antonym concepts marked as '/r/Antonym' edges. Then, we filter out non- English concepts and multi-word concepts. In ad- dition, we eliminate duplicated antonyms that in- volve synonyms. For instance, only one of the (empower, prohibit) and (empower, forbid) needs to be kept because 'prohibit' and 'forbid' are syn- onyms, marked as '/r/Synonym' in ConceptNet.</p><p>To further refine the antonym pairs, we cre- ate a crowdsourcing task on <ref type="figure">Figure Eight</ref>, for- merly known as CrowdFlower. Specifically, we ask crowdworkers: Do these two words have op- posite meanings? We include those word pairs that a majority of crowdworkers agree to have an op- posite meaning. The word pairs that the majority of crowdsource workers disagree were mostly er- roneous antonym pairs, such as '5' and '3', and 'have' and 'has.' We then filter out the antonyms that are highly similar to each other. For example, ('advisedly' and 'accidentally') and <ref type="bibr">('purposely' and 'accidentally')</ref> show the cosine similarity of 0.5148, while 'advisedly' and 'purposely' are not marked as synonyms in ConceptNet. Although we use the threshold of 0.4 in this work, a differ- ent threshold can be chosen depending on the pur- pose. Finally, we eliminate concepts that do not appear in the pre-trained Google News 100B word embeddings. As a result, we obtain 732 pairs of antonyms. Each pair of antonyms becomes initial pole words to define one of the diverse axes for SEMAXIS.</p><p>We assess the semantic diversity of the axes by computing cosine similarity between every possi- ble pair of the axes. The absolute mean value of the cosine similarity is 0.062, and the standard de- viation is 0.050. These low cosine similarity and standard deviation values indicate that the chosen axes have a variety of directions, covering diverse and distinct semantics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Augmenting pole words</head><p>We then expand the two initial pole words to larger sets of pole words, called expanded pole words, to obtain more robust results. If we use only two ini- tial pole words to define the corresponding axis, the result will be sensitive to the choice of those words. Since the initial pole words are not nec- essarily the best combinations possible, we would like to augment it so that it is more robust to the choice of the initial pole words.</p><p>To address this issue, we find the l closest words of each initial pole word in the word embedding. We then compute the geometric center (average vector) of l+1 words (including the initial pole word) and regard it as the vector representation of that pole of the axis. For instance, refining an axis representing a 'good' and 'bad' relation, we first find the l closest words for each of 'good' and 'bad' and then compute the geometric center of them. The newly computed geometric centers then become both ends of the axis representing a 'good' and 'bad' relation. We demonstrate how this approach improves the explanatory power of an axis describing a corresponding antonym rela- tion in Section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SEMAXIS Validation</head><p>In this section, we quantitatively evaluate our ap- proach using the ground-truth data and by com- paring our method against the standard baselines and state-of-the-art approaches. We reproduce the evaluation task introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al. (2016a)</ref>, recreating Standard English and Twitter sentiment lexicons for evaluation. We then com- pare the accuracy of sentiment classification with three other methods that generate domain-specific sentiment lexicons.</p><p>It is worth noting that we validate SEMAXIS based on a sentiment axis mainly due to the avail- ability of the well-established ground-truth data and evaluation process. Nevertheless, as the sen- timent axis in the SEMAXIS framework is not specifically or manually designed but established based on the corresponding pole words, the vali- dation based on the sentiment axis can be gener- alized to other axes that are similarly established based on other corresponding pole words. Standard English: We use well-known General Inquirer lexicon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stone et al., 1966</ref>) and contin- uous valence scores collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Warriner et al. (2013)</ref> to evaluate the performance of SEMAXIS compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We test all of the methods by using the off-the-shelf Google news embedding constructed from 10 11 tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Google, 2013)</ref>. Twitter: We evaluate our approach with the test dataset from the 2015 SemEval task 10E competi- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rosenthal et al., 2015</ref>) using the embedding constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rothe et al. (2016</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation Setup</head><p>We compare our method against state-of-the-art approaches that generate domain-specific senti- ment lexicons.</p><p>State-of-the-art approaches: Our baseline for the standard English is a WordNet-based method, which performs label propagation over a WordNet-derived graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(San Vicente et al., 2014</ref>). For Twitter, we use Sentiment140, a distantly su- pervised approach that uses signals from emoti- cons ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mohammad and Turney, 2010)</ref>. Moreover, on both datasets, we compare against two state-of- the-art sentiment induction methods: DENSIFIER, a method that learns orthogonal transformations of word vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rothe et al., 2016)</ref>, and SENTPROP, a method with a label propagation approach on word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton et al., 2016a</ref>). Seed words, which are called pole words in our work, are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Evaluation metrics: We evaluate the aforemen- tioned approaches according to (i) their binary classification accuracy (positive and negative), (ii) ternary classification performance (positive, neu- tral, and negative), and (iii) Kendall τ rank- correlation with continuous human-annotated po- larity scores. Since all methods result in senti- ment scores of words rather than assigning a class of sentiment, we label words as positive, neu- tral, or negative using the class-mass normaliza- tion method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhu et al., 2003)</ref>. This normaliza- tion uses knowledge of the label distribution of a test dataset and simply assigns labels to best match this distribution. For the implementation of other methods, we directly use the source code with- out any modification or tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(SocialSent, 2016)</ref> used in (Hamilton et al., 2016a).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>: Evaluation results. Our method performs best on both Standard English and Twitter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Sensitivity to Pole Words</head><p>As discussed in Section 3.3.2, because the axes are derived from pole words, the choice of the pole words can significantly affect the performance. We compare the robustness of three methods for selecting pole words: 1) using sentiment lexicons; 2) using two pole words only (initial pole words); and 3) using l closest words on the word2vec model as well as the two initial pole words (ex- panded pole words). For the first, we choose two sets of pole words that have the highest scores and the lowest scores in two widely used sentiment lexicons, ANEW <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bradley and Lang, 1999</ref>) and <ref type="bibr">LabMT (Dodds et al., 2011</ref>). Then, for the two pole words, we match 1-of-10 positive pole words and 1-of-10 negative pole words in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, result- ing in 100 pairs of pole words. For these 100 pairs, in addition to the two initial pole words, we then use the l closest words (l = 10) of each of them to evaluate the third method.</p><p>We compare these three methods by quantifying how well SEMAXIS performs for the evaluation task. The average AUC for the two pole words method is 78.2. We find that one of the 100 pairs -'good' and 'bad' -shows the highest AUC (92.4). However, another random pair ('happy' and 'evil') results in the worst performance with the AUC of 67.2. In other words, an axis de- fined by only two pole words is highly sensitive to the choice of the word pair. By contrast, when an axis is defined by aggregating l closest words, the average AUC increases to 80.6 (the minimum performance is above 71.2). Finally, using pre- established sentiment lexicons results in the worst performance (the AUC of 77.8 for ANEW and 67.5 for LabMT). These results show that identify- ing an axis is a crucial step in SEMAXIS, and using l closest words in addition to initial pole words is a more robust method to define the axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SEMAXIS in the Wild</head><p>We now demonstrate how SEMAXIS can be used in comparative text analysis to capture nuanced linguistic representations beyond the sentiment.</p><p>As an example, we use Reddit <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Reddit, 2005</ref>), one of the most popular online communities. Reddit is known to serve diverse sub-communities with different linguistic styles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. We focus on a few pairs of subreddits that are known to express different views. We also choose them to capture a wide range of topics from politics to reli- gion, entertainment, and daily life to demonstrate the broad applicability of SEMAXIS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Dataset, Pre-processing, Reference model, and Hyper-parameters</head><p>We use Reddit 2016 comment datasets that are publicly available (/u/Dewarim, 2017). We build a corpus from each subreddit by extracting all the comments posted on that subreddit. When the size of two corpora used for comparison is consider- ably different, we undersample the bigger corpus for a fair comparison. Every corpus then under- goes the same pre-processing, where we first re- move punctuation and stop words, then replace URLs with its domain name.</p><p>Reference model for Reddit data As we discussed earlier, many datasets of our in- terest are likely too small to obtain good vector representations. For example, two popular subreddits, /r/The Donald and /r/SandersForPresident 2 , show only 59.8% and 42.1% in analogy test, respectively. 3 Therefore, as we proposed, we first create a pre- trained word embedding with a larger background corpus and perform additional training with target subreddits. We sample 1 million comments from each of the top 200 subreddits, resulting in 20 million comments. Using this sample, we build a word embedding, denoted as Reddit20M, using the CBOW model with a window size of five, a minimum word count of 10, the negative sampling, and down-sampling of frequent terms as suggested in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Levy et al., 2015)</ref>. For the subsequent training with the target corpora, we train the model with a small starting learning rate, 0.005; Using different rates, such as 0.01 and 0.001, did not make much difference. We further tune the model with the dimension size of 300 and the number of the epoch of 100 using the analogy test results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Category Reddit20M Google300D</head><p>World   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows the results of the analogy test using our Reddit20M in comparison with Google300D, which is the Google News em- bedding used in previous sections. As one can expect, Reddit20M shows worse perfor- mance than Google300D. However, the four cat- egories (capital-common-countries, capital-world, currency, and city-in-state denoted by World), which require some general knowledge on the world, drive the 10% decrease in overall accu-racy. Other categories show comparable or even better accuracy. For example, Reddit20M outper- forms Google300D by 4.52% in the family cate- gory. Since Reddit is a US-based online commu- nity, the Reddit model may not be able to properly capture semantic relationships in World category. By contrast, for the categories for testing grammar (denoted by Gram1-9), Reddit20M shows compa- rable performances with <ref type="bibr">Google300D (70.21 vs. 73.4)</ref>. In this study, we use Reddit20M as a refer- ence model and update it with new target corpora. Updating the reference model As we explained in Section 3.2.2, we stop updating the reference model depending on the accuracy of the analogy test and semantic changes of the top 1000 words of the given corpus. In our experiments, we set α = 0.3 and β = 0.001. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the accuracy of the analogy test over epoch as a line plot and the semantic changes of words as a box plot for the model for /r/SandersForPresident. The model gradually loses general semantic rela- tion over epochs, and the characteristic semantic changes stabilize after about 10 epochs. Given the α and β, we use the embedding after 10 epochs of training with the target subreddit data. We note that the results are consistent when epoch is greater than 10. We choose the number of epoch for other corpora based on the same tactic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Confirming well-known language representations</head><p>Once we have word embeddings for given sub- reddits by updating the pre-trained model, we can compare the languages of two subreddits. As a case study, we compare supporters of Donald Trump (/r/The Donald) and Bernie Sanders (/r/SandersForPresident) 4 , and examine the semantic differences in diverse issues, such as gun and minority, based on different axes. This can be easily compared with our educated guess learned from the 2016 U.S. Election. Starting from a topic word (e.g., 'gun') and its closest word (e.g., 'guns'), we compute the aver- age vector of the two words. We then find the clos- est word from the computed average vector and repeat this process to collect 30 topical terms in each word embedding. Then, we remove words that have appeared less than n times in both cor- pora. The higher n leads to less coverage of top- ical terms but eliminate noise. We set n = 100 in the following experiments. We consider the re- maining words as topic words. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> compares how the minority-related terms are depicted in the two subreddits. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure</ref> 2(a) and 2(b) show how minority issues are perceived in two communities with respect to 'Sentiment' and 'Respect' . The x-axis is the value for each word on the Sentiment axis for Trump supporters, and the y-axis is the difference be- tween the value for Trump and Sanders supporters. If the y-value is greater than 0, then it means the word is more 'positive' among Trump supporters compared to that among Sanders supporters.</p><p>Some terms perceived more positively (e.g., 'immigration' and 'minorities') while other terms were perceived more negatively ('black', 'latino', 'hispanic') among Trump supporters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2(a)</ref>). As this positive perception on immigration and minorities is unexpected, we examine the actual comments. Through the manual inspection of rel- evant comments, we find that Trump supporters often mention that they 'agree' with or 'support' the idea of banning immigration, resulting in hav- ing a term 'immigration' as more positive than Sanders supporters. However, when examining those words on the 'Disrespect' vs. 'Respect' axis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2(b)</ref>), most of the minority groups are con- sidered disrespectful by Trump supporters com- pared to Sanders supporters, demonstrating a ben- efit of examining multiple semantic axes that can reflect rich semantics beyond basic sentiments.</p><p>Then, one would expect that 'Gun' would be more positively perceived for Trump supporters compared to for Sanders supporters. Beyond the sentiment, we examine how 'gun' is perceived in two communities for 'Arousal' and 'Safety' axes. We find that Trump supporters are generally posi- tive about gun-related issues, and Sanders support- ers associate 'gun' with more arousal and danger. We also examine two other subreddits: /r/atheism and /r/Christianity. As their names indicate, the former is the subreddit for atheists and the latter is the subreddit for Christians. We expect that the two groups would have different perspectives regarding 'god' and 'evolution.' When examining the four words 'god,' 'pray,' 'evolution,' and 'science' on the 'Unholy' vs. 'Holy' axis, 'god' and 'pray' appear to be more 'holy' in /r/Christianity while 'evolution' and 'science' appear more 'unholy' than in /r/Atheism, which fits in our intuition.</p><p>As another example, we examine the /r/PS4 and /r/NintendoSwitch subreddits. PS4 is a video game console released by Sony and Nin- tendo Switch is released by Nintendo. Although both video game consoles originated from Japan, Nintendo Switch targets more family (children) and casual gamers with more playful and eas- ier games while the games for PS4 target adult and thus tend to be more violent and more diffi- cult to play. We examine three terms ('Nintendo,' 'Mario,' and 'Zelda') from Nintendo Switch and three terms ('Sony,' 'Uncharted,' and 'Killzone') from Sony on the 'Casual' vs. 'Hardcore' axis. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We find that 'Mario' and 'Zelda' are perceived more casual in /r/PS4, and 'Uncharted' and 'Killzone' are more hardcore in /r/PS4 than /r/NintendoSwitch. Although both 'Nin- tendo' and 'Sony' have negative values, 'Nin-tendo' was considered more casual than 'Sony' in /r/PS4. Overall, our method effectively cap- tures context-dependent semantic changes beyond the basic sentiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Comparative Text Analysis with Diverse Axes</head><p>Let us show how SEMAXIS can find, for a given word, a set of the best axes that describe its seman- tic. We map the word on our predefined 732 axes, which are explained in Section 3.3.1, and rank the axes based on the projection values on the axes. In other words, the top axes describe the word with the highest strength. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(a) shows the top 20 axes with the largest projection values for 'Men' in /r/AskWomen and /r/AskMen, which are the subreddits where people expect replies from each gender. In /r/AskWomen, compared with /r/AskMen, 'Men' seems to be perceived as more vanishing, more established, less systematic, less monogamous, more enthusiastic, less social, more uncluttered, less vulnerable, and more un- apologetic. This observed perception of men from women's perspective seems to concur with the common gender stereotype, demonstrating strong potential of SEMAXIS.</p><p>Likewise, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(b), we examine how a word 'Mario' is perceived in two subred- dits /r/NintendoSwitch and /r/PS4. In /r/NintendoSwitch, 'Mario' is perceived, compared with /r/PS4, as more luxurious, fa- mous, unobjectionable, open, capable, likable, successful, loving, honorable, and controllable. On the other hand, users in /r/PS4 consider 'Mario' to be more virtual, creative, durable, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed SEMAXIS to examine a nu- anced representation of words based on diverse semantic axes. We have shown that SEMAXIS can construct good domain-specific sentiment lex- icons by projecting words on the sentiment axis. We have also demonstrated that our approach can reveal nuanced context-dependence of words through the lens of numerous semantic axes. There are two major limitations. First, we per- formed the quantitative evaluation only with the sentiment axis, even though we supplemented it with more qualitative examples. We used the sen- timent axis because it is better studied and more methods exist, but ideally it would be better to perform evaluation across many semantic axes. We hope that SEMAXIS can facilitate research on other semantic axes so that we will have labeled datasets for other axes as well. Secondly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gaffney and Matias (2018)</ref> recently reported the Reddit data used in this study is incomplete. The authors suggest using the data with caution, particularly when analyzing user interactions. Although our work examine communities in Reddit, we focus on the difference of the word semantics. Thus, we believe the effect of deleted comment would be marginal in our analyses.</p><p>Despite these limitations, we identify the fol- lowing key implications. First, SEMAXIS of- fers a framework to examine texts on diverse se- mantic axes beyond the sentiment axis, through the 732 systematically induced semantic axes that capture common antonyms. Our study may facil- itate further investigations on context-dependent text analysis techniques and applications. Sec- ond, the unsupervised nature of SEMAXIS pro- vides a powerful way to build lexicons of any semantic axis, including the sentiment axis, for non-English languages, particularly the resource- scarce languages.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Changes of word semantics (box plot) and accuracy (line graph) over epoch for the model for /r/SandersForPresident</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="7,72.00,226.41,218.25,119.16" type="bitmap" /></figure>
