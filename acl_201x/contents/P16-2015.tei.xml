				<p>Retrieving semantic similar short texts is a crucial issue to many applications, e.g., web search, ads matching, question-answer system, and so forth. Most of the traditional methods concentrate on how to improve the precision of the similarity measurement, while current real applications need to efficiently explore the top similar short texts semantically related to the query one. We address the efficiency issue in this paper by investigating the similarity strategies and incorporating them into the FAST framework (efficient FrAmework for semantic similar Short Texts retrieval). We conduct comprehensive performance evaluation on real-life data which shows that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper, we investigate the fast approach of short texts retrieval, which is important to many applications, e.g., web search, ads match- ing, question-answer system, etc. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Yu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hua et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Yang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Wang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wei et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cui et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Metzler et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ceccarelli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Radlinski et al., 2008)</ref>. The setting of the problem is that users always ask for those most semantically related to their queries from a huge text collection. A common solution is applying the state-of-the-art short texts similarity measure- ment techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Islam and Inkpen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mihalcea et al., 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sahami and Heilman, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Tsatsaronis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mohler et al., 2011;</ref>, and then return the top-k ones * Corresponding author.</p><p>by sorting them with regard to the similarity score. After surveying the previous approaches, we find that almost all the methods concentrate on how to improve the precision, i.e., effectiveness issue. In addition, the data collections which they con- ducted are rather small. However, the scale of the problem has dramatically increased and the cur- rent short texts similarity measurement techniques could not handle when the data collection size be- comes enormous. In this paper, we aim to address the efficiency issue in the literature while keeping their high precision. Moreover, we focus on the top-k issue because users commonly do not care about the individual similarity score but only the sorted results. Furthermore, most of the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Islam and Inkpen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Tsatsaronis et al., 2010;</ref>) need to set predefined threshold to filter out those dis- similar texts which is rather difficult to determine by users.</p><p>Different from long texts, short texts cannot al- ways observe the syntax of a written language and usually do not possess sufficient information to support statistical based text processing tech- niques, e.g., TF-IDF. This indicates that the tra- ditional NLP techniques for long texts may not be always appropriate to apply to short texts. The re- lated works on short texts similarity measurement can be classified into the following major cate- gories, i.e., (1) inner resource based strategy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Islam and Inkpen, 2008)</ref>; (2) outer resource based strategy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Tsatsaronis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mihalcea et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Islam and Inkpen, 2008;</ref>; and (3) hybrid based strat- egy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Islam and Inkpen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2006;</ref>.</p><p>Naively testing the candidate short texts for top- k similar short texts retrieval is inefficient when directly using these strategies. To tackle the effi- ciency problem, we propose an efficient strategy to evaluate as few candidates as possible. More- over, our fast algorithm aims to output the results progressively, i.e., the top-1 should be obtained instantly. This scheme meets the demand of the real world applications, especially for big data en- vironment. We list our contribution of this paper as follows: we propose a fast approach to tackle the efficiency problem for retrieving top-k seman- tic similar short texts; we present the optimized techniques and improve the efficiency which min- imizes the candidate number to be evaluated in our framework. The results of four different set- tings demonstrate that the efficiency of our fast approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while keeping effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preliminaries</head><p>Formally, for a given query short text q, retriev- ing a set of k short texts T s in a data collec- tion D s which are most semantically similar to q, i.e., ∀t ∈ T s and ∀r ∈ (D s − T s ) will yield sim(q, t) ≥ sim(q, r). To obtain the similarity score sim(q, t) between two short texts, we can apply the current state-of-the-art strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Tsatsaronis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mihalcea et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Islam and Inkpen, 2008;</ref>. In this pa- per, we judiciously select some similarity metrics which are assembled into a general framework to tackle the efficiency problem. Most of the exist- ing strategies of evaluating the similarity between short texts are based on word similarity, because of the intuitive idea that short text is composed of words. As a result, we introduce the representative word similarity in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Selected Representative Similarity Measurement Strategies</head><p>There are a number of semantic similarity strategies having been developed in the previous decades which are useful in some specific applica- tions of NLP tasks. Recently, outer resources are indispensable for short texts similarity measure- ment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Tsatsaronis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mihalcea et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Islam and Inkpen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hua et al., 2015)</ref>. After extensively investigating a number of similarity measurement strategies, we judiciously explore two representative word similarity measurement strategies which obtain the best performance compared with human judges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge based Strategy</head><p>Knowledge based strategy determines whether two words are semantically similar by measur- ing their shortest path in the predefined taxonomy.</p><p>The path between them can be calculated by ap- plying word thesauri, e.g., WordNet. In this paper, we take one representative metric which has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Leacock and Chodorow, 1998</ref>). Let's take two words w i ,w j as an example, the similarity is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Sim k (w i , w j ) = −ln path s (w i , w j ) 2 * D where path s (w i , w j )</formula><p>is the shortest path between two word concepts by using related strategy, e.g., node-counting strategy. D is the maximum depth of such taxonomy (D is with different size in either noun taxonomy or verb taxonomy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corpus based Strategy</head><p>Different from knowledge based strategy, corpus based strategy cannot form a new entity which means we can only apply statistical information to determine the similarity between two words. There are a few corpus based similarity measure- ment strategies, e.g., PMI, LSA, HAL, and so forth. In this paper, we select a representative strategy which applies Wiki encyclopedia to map Wiki texts into appropriate topics. Each Wiki topic is represented as an attribute vector. The words in the vector occur in the corresponding articles. En- tries of these vectors are assigned weight which quantifies the association between words and each Wiki topic after applying vector based scheme, e.g., TF-IDF. The similarity can be evaluated by aggregating each word distributing on these top- ics. In addition, a short text is a vector based on topics with weight of each topic T i formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∑ w i ∈Ts v i · d j ,</formula><p>where v i is TF-IDF weight of w i and d j which quantifies the degree of associ- ation of word w i with Wiki topic T j . Here, the Wiki topic could be concepts or topics generated by other techniques, e.g., LDA, LSA, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Semantic Similarity Measurement between Two Short Texts</head><p>Semantic similarity between two short texts can be measured by combining the words similarity in a general framework. Therefore, the method of combining the words similarities into a framework may affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the similarity score. In this paper, we integrate differ-ent similarity strategies linearly and this method has been proved that it has high precision by com- paring with human judges ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Islam and Inkpen, 2008)</ref>. The scheme measures each word pair of short texts and then constructs a sim- ilarity score matrix. Finally, the similarity score between two short texts is recursively executed by aggregating the representative words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A Fast Approach for Semantic Similar Short Texts Retrieval</head><p>We propose a fast approach for retrieving the top- k semantic similar short texts to a given query q in this section. The key idea of this scheme is to ac- cess a rather small size of candidates in the whole data collection. The scheme is conducted by build- ing appropriate indices in offline procedure, i.e., preprocessing procedure. We illustrate the whole framework in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The figure tells us, to ef- ficiently retrieve top-k similar short texts, our pro- posed strategy only accesses as small as possible part of candidates which are filled in grey color.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: The framework of proposed fast ap- proach</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Efficiently Aggregate Similarity Metrics</head><p>In this section, we present an efficient assembling strategy to hasten the process of retrieving top-k similar short texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Fagin et al., 2001)</ref>. A concrete example to illustrate our proposal is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. For example, let the query short text is: "Delicious lunch in Japan". After preprocess- ing (stemming and removing the stopwords), the query is: delicious lunch Japan. From <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we can see that there is a hierarchical structure in our framework. Suppose that if we want to retrieve top-1 short text from the whole data, the ranked list (i.e., order list) of knowledge based similarity and corpus based similarity are needed respectively. From the analysis on the property of threshold al- gorithm, the top-1 short text comes from these two ranked lists instantly. However, we cannot know such ranking directly because these two lists are texts layer but each list has its sub layer, i.e., word layer. In this paper, we apply two kinds of sim- ilarity metrics. Therefore, there are two assem- bling tasks, i.e., (1)assembling knowledge based and corpus based similarities; and (2)assembling words to texts. The words are query words and each query word corresponds to a list which can be found in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> also tells us for each word, it has the corresponding list in which all the words have been ranked based on the re- latedness with such word. Since each word may occur in several short texts, the proposed method here should take the ID of each short text into con- sideration (e.g., word "delicious" occurs T2, etc.). We apply threshold algorithm to obtain the top short texts based on each query word. Therefore, the top-1 result comes from these two ranked lists based on threshold algorithm. In this example, T2 is finally outputted as the top-1 value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Ranking list on Similarity Strategies</head><p>From the description in Section 3.1, we can see that the ranked list is crucial for using threshold algorithm to retrieve top-k short texts. In this section, we introduce the optimized method on each similarity metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ranking on Knowledge based strategy</head><p>Since WordNet is a representative knowledge base, we apply the Leacock and Chodorow strat- egy as a WordNet evaluator which optimized as an efficient technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Yang and Kitsuregawa, 2011</ref>).</p><p>Lemma 1 (Ordering in WordNet) Let q be the query. Let P and S be two candidates that exist in the same taxonomy of q, that is, T P and T q . The shortest path between q and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (or S) is L P in T P (or L S in T S ). The maximum depth of T P is D P (or D S of T S )</formula><p>. P is more similar to Q compared with S. Thus, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D P L P &gt; D S L S .</formula><p>The lemma tells us that the similarity ordering be- tween candidates in WordNet depends on the in- tegration of the shortest path and the maximum depth of the taxonomy. We access the related syn- onyms set between two taxonomies successively based on the value of D L and obtain the top-k re- sults in a progressive manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ranking on Corpus based Strategy</head><p>We measure the similarity between short texts by aggregating each word distribution on topics. A short text is a valued vector based on topics, where the weight of each topic T i calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∑ w i ∈Ts v i · k j ,</formula><p>where v i is TF-IDF weight of w i and k j which quantifies the strength of association of word w i with Wiki topic T j . Different from the traditional approaches, we first calculate all the similarity scores between each word in Wiki and that between topics in the data collection to ob- tain a set of lists during preprocessing. The topic could be generated either by ESA or by LDA. Af- ter that, we build a weighted inverted list where each list presents a word with sorted correspond- ing short texts according to the similarity score. Therefore, for a given query text q, each word in q corresponds to a list of short texts. As that, we apply the threshold algorithm retrieve the top-k re- sults by using this manner. This manner accesses a small size of components of the data without ne- cessity to evaluate every candidate short text.</p><p>After obtaining all the ranking lists, we can ap- ply the threshold algorithm aforementioned to ef- ficiently retrieve the top-k semantic similar short texts either by equal weight scheme or weight tun- ing strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we conduct on three different datasets to evaluate the performance of our ap- proach. To evaluate the effectiveness, we test the dataset which was used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2006</ref>). For ef- ficiency evaluation, we apply the BNC and MSC datasets which are extracted from British National Corpus and Microsoft Research Paraphrase Cor- pus respectively. The baseline strategy is imple- mented according to the state-of-the-art (linear as- sembling strategy as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Islam and Inkpen, 2008)</ref>). In our proposed strategy, we take four different settings: (1) FAST E is the one that we apply the ESA topic strategy; (2) FAST L employs the LDA topic strategy in corpus based similarity with equal weight; and (3) FAST Ew and FAST Lw are im- plemented based on the former two ones, respec- tively, with the tuned combinational weights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Efficiency Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the efficiency by using two real-life datasets which have been denoted as BNC and MSC. To test the effect of size of data collec- tion, we select different size of these two datasets. Firstly, we conducted experiments on the fixed size of data collection by using 4 settings of our proposed approach. The results show that com- paring with the baseline strategy, FAST E , FAST L , FAST Ew and FAST Lw have promotion at 75.34%, 74.68%, 75.31% and 74.59% respectively. The four settings have similar results which indicates that the weight is not the crucial factor in our proposed strategy. <ref type="table">Table.</ref> 1 tells us the number of candidates accessed. Our evaluation has been conducted on different data collection size to test the scalability of our proposed strategy. Since the baseline strategy should access all the short texts in each size of data collection, which means in 1k size of BNC data collection, the baseline strategy access all these 1k candidates. However, our pro- posed strategies under different settings only ac- cess small size candidates to obtain the results. From the table, we can see that, our proposed strat- egy can largely reduce the number of candidates accessed in both data collections. In addition, the number of candidates accessed has increases not quickly which indicate our proposed approach scales well. Therefore, the proposed strategy is ef- ficient than the baseline strategy.  We also evaluate the effect of k which is an important factor for evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. The experiments conducted on a fixed size of data collection which show that the top-1 value has been outputted instantly by ap- ply our proposed strategy while baseline strategy should access all candidates. For the query time of FAST E setting costs only 19.12s while base- line strategy costs 897.5s for obtaining the top-1 value. FAST L , FAST Es and FAST Lw cost 20.13s, 21.21s and 20.32s respectively which confirms that combinational weight is not an important fac- tor in our proposed strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Effectiveness Evaluation</head><p>We illustrate the results of the correlation coeffi- cient with human ratings in <ref type="table">Table.</ref> 2. Note here, the baseline strategy is composed by knowledge based strategy and corpus based strategy (ESA method) with equal weight. From the table we can see that, the FAST E has the same precision as the baseline because our proposed strategy only changes the order of the evaluated short texts but not the similarity strategy. FAST L has better pre- cision than FAST E because we select the best LDA topic size to form Wiki topic. FAST Ew and FAST Lw have dynamically changed the combina- tional weights and therefore, the performance of them has been improved.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a fast approach to tackle the efficiency problem of retrieving top-k similar short texts which has not been extensively studied before. We select two representative similarity metrics, i.e., knowledge based and corpus based similarity. Efficient strategies are introduced to test as few candidates as possible in the querying process. Four different settings have been proposed to improve the effectiveness.</p><p>The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques while keeping the high precision. In the future, we will investigate new methods to tackle efficiency issue and take effect semantic similarity strategies to obtain high performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2" validated="false"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>Number of candidates accessed in effi-
