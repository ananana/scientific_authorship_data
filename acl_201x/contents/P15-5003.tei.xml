<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Introduction</head><p>Over the last ten years, there has been an explosion in interest in sentiment analysis, with many interest- ing and impressive results. For example, the first twenty publications on Google Scholar returned for the Query "sentiment analysis" all date from 2003 or later, and have a total citation count of 12,140. The total number of publications is in the thousands. Partly, this interest is driven by the immediate com- mercial applications of sentiment analysis.</p><p>Sentiment is a "private state" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Wiebe, 1990)</ref>. However, it is not the only private state that has re- ceived attention in the computational literature; oth- ers include belief and intention. In this tutorial, we propose to provide a deeper understanding of what a private state is. We will concentrate on sentiment and belief. We will provide background that will al- low the tutorial participants to understand the notion of a private state as a cognitive phenomenon, which can be manifested linguistically in communication in various ways. We will explain the formalization in terms of a triple of state, source, and target. We will discuss how to model the source and the tar- get. We will then explain in some detail the annota- tions that have been made. The issue of annotation is crucial for private states: while the MPQA corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wilson, 2007)</ref> has been around for some time, most research using it does not make use of many of its features. We believe this is be- cause the MPQA annotation is quite complex and requires a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of "private state", which is what the annotation is getting at. Furthermore, there are currently several efforts underway of creating new versions of anno- tations, which we will also present.</p><p>The larger goal of this tutorial is to allow the tu- torial participants to gain a deeper understanding of the role of private states in human communication, and to encourage them to use this deeper under- standing in their computational work. The imme- diate goal of this tutorial is to allow the participants to make more complete use of available annotated resources. We propose to achieve these goals by concentrating on annotated corpora, since this will allow participants to both understand the underlying content (achieving the larger goal) and the technical details of the annotations (achieving the immediate goal).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Current Work on Annotating Sentiment</head><p>To date, the computational analyses of sentiment are often fairly superficial. Much work in sentiment analysis and opinion mining is at the document level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pang et al., 2002</ref>). There is increasing interest in more fine-grained levels: sentence-level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">McDonald et al., 2007)</ref>, phrase-level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Choi and Cardie, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al., 2009</ref>), aspect-level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hu and Liu, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Titov and McDonald, 2008)</ref>, etc. Sentiments toward entities and events ("eTargets") expressed in blogs, newswire, editorials, etc. are particularly im- portant. A system that could recognize sentiments toward entities and events would be valuable in an application such as Automatic Question Answer- ing, to support answering questions such as "Toward whom/what is X negative/positive?" "Who is neg- ative/positive toward X?" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Stoyanov et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>Or, to augment an automatic wikification system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ratinov et al., 2011</ref>), which could include informa- tion about whom or what the subject supports or op- poses. A recent NIST evaluation -The Knowledge Base Population (KBP) Sentiment track 1 -aims at using corpora to collect information regarding sen- timents expressed toward or by named entities. An- notated corpora of reviews ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hu and Liu, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Titov and McDonald, 2008)</ref>, widely used in NLP, often in- clude annotations of targets that are aspects of prod- ucts or services. As such, they are somewhat limited, excluding, e.g., events or agents of events.</p><p>A widely used corpus is Version 2 of the MPQA opinion annotated corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wilson, 2007)</ref>. It is entirely span-based, and contains no eTarget annotations. However, it provides an in- frastructure for sentiment annotation that is not pro- vided by other sentiment NLP corpora, and is much more varied in topic, genre, and publication source. MPQA 3.0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deng and Wiebe, 2015)</ref>, which was re- cently created, adds entity-and event-target (eTar- get) annotations to the MPQA 2.0 annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wilson, 2007</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The MPQA annotations consist of pri- vate states, states of a source holding an attitude, optionally toward a target. An important property of sources is that they are nested, reflecting the fact that private states and speech events are often em- bedded in one another. There are several types of at- titudes included in MPQA 2.0, including sentiment, arguing, and intention. The tutorial will focus on sentiments (while also discussing the others), which are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wilson, 2007)</ref> as positive and nega- tive evaluations, emotions, and judgements. In the future, eTargets may be added to private states with other types of attitudes.</p><p>This tutorial will present the original MPQA an- notation scheme (V2) and its recent extension to in- clude eTarget annotations (V3), which we believe is a valuable new resource for the community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Belief Annotations</head><p>Compared to sentiment, belief has received far less attention in the computational community. There have been several efforts at annotating belief re- cently. The most complete is FactBank <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009)</ref>, which represents the source of the belief, the target, the strength, and the polar- ity (using a system of 10 tags which cover strength and polarity). Following ( ), the sources are nested, reflecting the same nesting of private states we also observe for sentiment. Fact- Bank is a rich and complex annotation; the so-called LU corpus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Diab et al. (2009)</ref> was created inde- pendently, and represents a subset of the annotations of FactBank. The LU corpus annotates only the writer's belief in the propositions in the text, only distinguishes 3 types of belief, but does clearly rep- resent the target. Unlike FactBank, which is anno- tated on top of the Penn Treebank, the LU corpus represents a diverse set of texts. The recent annota- tions at the LDC for the DARPA DEFT project fol- low the simplicity of the LU corpus annotations, but extend the tagset of the LU corpus to four tags. An annotation effort in the spring of 2015 will include the source of the belief. The LDC effort is impor- tant since it covers a new domain -web discussion forums. Its size is an order of magnitude larger than that of FactBank or the LU corpus (about 800,000 words). This tutorial will discuss these resources and compare the annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Integration Issues</head><p>Sentiment and belief are very similar: most impor- tantly, they are both private states. They both in- volve a holder and a target, and within the broad categories of sentiment and belief there are subdi- visions, which can affect the strength of the private state. There is an important difference though: while the target of a sentiment can be an entity or an event (state of affairs), belief can only target a state of af- fairs. In addition to being similar types of phenom- ena, the same linguistic means can convey sentiment and belief at the same time: the utterance I regret that I am leaving tomorrow reveals both the utterer's sentiment and belief towards the leaving event. De- spite these interactions between sentiment and be- lief, there has been no attempt to jointly annotate or predict sentiment and belief. The tutorial will use examples to show the interaction between sentiment and belief, and discuss some issues that arise in joint annotation and tagging. 8 1. Introduction: an overview over the issue of pri- vate states, and how they relate to other well- known concepts such as the BDI (belief-desire- intention) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bratman, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bratman, 1987</ref>, related work in NLP (such as RST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mann and Thompson, 1987)</ref> and dialog act tagging), linguistic semantics (for example, the notion of veridicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Karttunen, 1971)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Wiebe, 1994)</ref>, and later in the context of recognizing sentiment in other genres such as news articles ). She has approached the area from the perspective of corpus annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Deng et al., 2013)</ref>, lexical se- mantics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006</ref>), and discourse ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Somasundaran et al., 2009)</ref>. In addition to contin- uing these lines of research, she has recently begun investigating implicatures in opinion analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Deng and Wiebe, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>She has received funding for her research from NSF, NIH, DARPA, ONR, NSA, ARDA, and Home- land Security. She was Program Chair of NAACL 2000 and Program Co-Chair of ACL-IJCNLP 2009. She has been on the editorial board of Computa- tional Linguistics and is currently an action editor for Transactions of the ACL. http://people. cs.pitt.edu/ ˜ wiebe/</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Janyce Wiebe is Professor of Computer Science and Professor and Co-Director of the Intelligent Sys- tems at the University of Pittsburgh.

2. Representing sentiment: a presentation of early 
work, of MPQA V2 (with nested sources, and 
attitude, expressive-subjective element, and tar-
get span annotations), and of MPQA Version 3 
(extension of MPQA V2 to eTargets). (45 min-
utes) 

3. Break (15 minutes) 

4. Representing belief: a presentation of Fact-
Bank, the LU corpus, and the ongoing LDC 
annotation under the DARPA DEFT program. 
(30 minutes) 

5. Integration and looking forward: a discussion 
of how sentiment and belief interact, and how 
we can integrate their annotations, including a 
discussion of a General Modality Annotation 
Scheme. (45 minutes)
