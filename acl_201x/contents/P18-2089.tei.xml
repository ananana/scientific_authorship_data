				<p>Word embeddings are crucial to many natural language processing tasks. The quality of embeddings relies on large non-noisy corpora. Arabic dialects lack large corpora and are noisy, being linguistically disparate with no standardized spelling. We make three contributions to address this noise. First, we describe simple but effective adaptations to word embedding tools to maximize the informative content leveraged in each training sentence. Second , we analyze methods for representing disparate dialects in one embedding space, either by mapping individual dialects into a shared space or learning a joint model of all dialects. Finally, we evaluate via dictionary induction, showing that two met-rics not typically reported in the task enable us to analyze our contributions&apos; effects on low and high frequency words. In addition to boosting performance between 2-53%, we specifically improve on noisy, low frequency forms without compromising accuracy on high frequency forms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many natural language processing tasks require word embeddings as inputs, yet quality embed- dings require large, non-noisy corpora. Dialectal Arabic (DA), the low register of highly diglossic Arabic <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ferguson, 1959)</ref>, is problematically noisy. While the high register, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), is uniform across educated circles in the Arab World, many varieties of DA are not even mutually intelligible ( <ref type="bibr">Chiang et al., 2006</ref>  Seldom written previously, DA is becoming the dominant form of Arabic on social media, yet an- notated data are still scarce <ref type="bibr">(Muhammad AbdulMageed and Elaraby, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Israa Alsarsour and Elsayed, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kareem Darwish and Kallmeyer, 2018)</ref>. While complex morphology contributes to sparsity in both MSA and DA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Habash, 2010)</ref>, noise from inter-dialect variation and unstandard- ized spelling further reduces token-to-type ratios in DA. This limits opportunities to learn accurate vector representations for any given word. <ref type="table">Table  2</ref> shows that the MSA token-to-type ratio is over three times larger than DA, controlling for corpus size. This is still not nearly as large as English due to English's morphological simplicity. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Further- more, the percentage of tokens belonging to low frequency types is three times greater in DA.</p><p>Many previous works ignore inter-dialect vari- ation, training dialect agnostic embeddings, yet we show that modeling dialects individually yields <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Examples are drawn from the MADAR lexicon ( .

To that end, we make three contributions. First, we de- scribe simple but effective adaptations to word embedding tools to maximize the informative con- tent leveraged in each training sentence. Second, we compare methods for representing disparate di- alects in one embedding space, by mapping in- dividual dialects into shared space or learning a joint model of all dialects. Finally, we evaluate our techniques via dictionary induction, showing that two metrics not typically reported are quite infor- mative. In addition to improving accuracy 2-53%, our adaptations specifically boost performance on noisy, low frequency forms without compromising accuracy on high frequency forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Common monolingual embedding models are trained to predict either the target word given the context (Continuous Bag of Words) or ele- ments of the context given the target (SkipGram) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mikolov et al., 2013a</ref>). These have been adapted to incorporate word order ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Trask et al., 2015)</ref> or subword information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bojanowski et al., 2016</ref>) to model syntax, morphology, etc. Bilingual embeddings are vector representa- tions of two languages mapped into shared space, such that translated word pairs have similar vec- tors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gouws et al., 2015;</ref>. They facilitate applications from parallel sentence extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Grover and Mitra, 2017</ref>) to machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cholakov and Kordoni, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Artetxe et al., 2017b</ref>) and can be used to improve monolingual embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Faruqui and Dyer, 2014</ref>). Bilingual embeddings are learned via one of three methods: mapping both spaces into a shared space ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>), mono- lingual adaptation of one language's embedding space into another's ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zou et al., 2013)</ref>, or bilin- gually training both embeddings simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(AP et al., 2014;</ref>. We com- pare implementations of two state-of-the-art mod- els for mapping embeddings that use the monolin- gual adaptation technique, as these best suited our data and resources: VECMAP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Artetxe et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Artetxe et al., , 2017a</ref>) and MUSE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Conneau et al., 2017)</ref>. Both are equipped to learn either via supervision or by iteratively mapping with little or no supervision. Recently, another unsupervised approach lever- aging local neighborhood structures was evalu- ated on French, English, and MSA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aldarmaki et al., 2017)</ref>. Such approaches address seed data scarcity, but have not previously been applied to sparse corpora lacking standardized spelling. While we address unstandardized spelling indi- rectly by learning better embeddings for low fre- quency types, , <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abidi and Smaïli (2018)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dasigi and Diab (2011)</ref> attempt to map DA spelling variants to each other.</p><p>We are the first to use embeddings for multiple specific DA dialects, though DA embeddings are often used for sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al Sallab et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Altowayan and Tao, 2016)</ref>. One such work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dahou et al. (2016)</ref>, uses pre-built dictionaries to deterministically identify phrases in mixed MSA- DA data before training embeddings. In MSA, embeddings have been used in additional tasks like morphological analysis <ref type="bibr">(Zalmout and Habash, 2017)</ref> and POS tagging ( <ref type="bibr">Darwish et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>We adopt Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011)'s 4-way coarse-grained dialect distinction of Gulf (GLF), Maghrebi (MAG), Egyptian (EGY), and Levantine (LEV). We collect corpora for each di- alect by concatenating the relevant dialect identi- fied portion of the following corpora: Almeman and Lee <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref>  spelling and internal domain inconsistency compounding scarcity with noise.</p><p>To map dialects' embeddings into shared spaces and evaluate dictionary induction, we generate seed and test dictionaries similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Artetxe et al. (2016)</ref>. We use MGIZA ( <ref type="bibr">Koehn et al., 2007)</ref> to align 8,000 sentences from 's travel corpus. It contains 12,000 five- way parallel sentences between the DA varieties of Beirut (LEV), Cairo (EGY), Doha (GLF), Tu- nis (MAG), and Rabat (MAG), but we collapse Tunis and Rabat to match Zaidan and Callison- Burch (2011)'s granularity and hold out 4,000 sentences for development on downstream tasks. After alignment, we extract unigram translations from 2,000 sentences to form a bidialectal evalu- ation dictionary. This yields between 2,500 and 4,000 word pairs, with 1.3 to 1.7 average trans- lations per word depending on the dialect pair. Lastly we realign the remaining 6,000 training sentences and extract a seed dictionary. Three an- notators jointly evaluated 400 unigram pairs from the LEV-EGY evaluation dictionary. 89% were ac- ceptable translations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Word Embedding Models</head><p>We consider the following models for training word embeddings:</p><p>FT refers to a FASTTEXT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bojanowski et al., 2016</ref>) implementation of SkipGram with 200 di- mensions and a context window of 5 tokens on ei- ther side of the target word. A word's vector is the sum of its SkipGram vector and that of all its com- ponent character n-grams between length 2 and 6. Since short vowels are not typically written in Ara- bic, many affixes only consist of a word start/end token and one character. Thus, these character n- gram parameters outperformed the range of 3 to 6 proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bojanowski et al. (2016)</ref> for other languages. In preliminary experiments, FT out- performed WORD2VEC models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mikolov et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr">ˇ Rehůřek and Sojka, 2010</ref>) which lack sub- word information and hence struggle with Ara- bic's morphological complexity. We also com- pared FT to variant implementations with larger and smaller context windows, though FT consis- tently performed the same or better.</p><p>EXT refers to an extended FT model where wide and narrow windowed embeddings, sizes 5 and 1 respectively, are trained separately. Resulting vec- tors are concatenated to build a 400 dimensional model. Given much work demonstrating that nar- row context windows capture more syntactic infor- mation and wide windows, semantic information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pennington et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Trask et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Goldberg, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tu et al., 2017)</ref></p><note type="other">, component vectors should complement each other, giving the concate- nated vector access to a wider range of linguistic information. To ensure that the improvement came from vector concatenation and not simply from having higher dimensional vectors, we built 400 dimension FT models to compare to EXT, but they did not outperform 200 dimensional FT, likely due to sparsity. PP+EXT refers to an EXT model trained on a preprocessed corpus where phrases have been probabilistically identified. To identify phrases, we recurse over each sentence R times, each time forming bigram phrases from component un- igrams (</note><p>which could have been longer n-grams in previous iterations) depending on the frequencies of the relevant unigrams and bigrams. We im- plement this step exactly as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mikolov et al. (2013c)</ref>, but then we copy each output sen- tence C times and probabilistically decompose the deterministically identified phrases into smaller n- grams. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> More precisely, for each deterministi- cally identified n-gram phrase, we progress from the first to the (n − 1) th gram, randomly splitting the phrase at that point with probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e n R r=1 e r .</formula><p>The final result of the probabilistic phrase iden- tification is C potentially unique copies of each sentence containing identified n-gram phrases of length n ≤ 2 R . We experimented with linear dis- tributions in addition to the exponential one used for phrase splitting, but the exponential performed better. The exponential distribution means that it is less likely to separate at any given potential break point in longer n-grams than in shorter ones.</p><p>Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mikolov et al. (2013c)</ref>'s deterministic identification of phrases, PP+EXT avoids training vectors on individual words in non-compositional phrases, yet PP+EXT's probabilistic nature lets the model learn from multiple perspectives of ev- ery word/phrase's context, with more informative phrase distributions more likely to appear more frequently. Interestingly, identifying phrases can be harmful, as our evaluation is performed on uni- grams. We implemented a deterministic version of PP+EXT but it did not outperform the baseline FT as too many unigrams were lost in longer phrases. Thus, identifying phrases probabilistically is cru- cial to PP+EXT's high performance.</p><p>In preliminary experiments, probabilistic phrase identification improved the FT model without ex- tending vectors, yet the performance did not ex- ceed EXT. Hence, we only report PP+EXT scores, as the technique is far more effective when cou- pled with EXT. The combination of techniques is actually designed to be complementary: FT lever- ages morphology, EXT combines syntax with se- mantics, and probabilistic phrase identification in- creases the number of meaningful contexts used for training. These enable the model to learn bet- ter representations for noisy, low frequency forms without requiring additional data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Multidialectal Embedding Space</head><p>We consider two options for generating multidi- alectal embeddings for DA: (a) a dialect agnostic model trained on all DA corpora, and (b) training individual dialect models separately before map- ping them into a shared embedding space. While (b) leverages less data per model, (a) is subject to more noise and ambiguity, as many words are unique to certain dialects or have disparate mean- ings in different dialects. (b) can be seeded with a bidialectal dictionary or parallel sentences. We found the dictionary approach to perform better.</p><p>ALLDA is a PP+EXT model trained on a com- bined corpus of all dialects. To avoid code switch- ing issues, ALLDA assigns words only to those di- alects for which its relative frequency in that di- alect's corpus is greater than 5% of its maximum relative frequency in any dialect. Thus, a word as- signed to multiple dialects will take the same vec- tor in each dialect and be its own nearest neighbor for any dialect pairs where it belongs to both.</p><p>VECMAP is <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Artetxe et al. (2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Artetxe et al. ( , 2017a</ref>)'s tool that uses a seed dictionary (or shared numerals) to learn a mapping function which minimizes dis- tances between seed dictionary unigram pairs. In data scarce settings, the function can be learned iteratively, inducing a larger seed dictionary each round, yet the noise in our DA corpora prevents this process from getting off the ground, produc- ing scores of zero after a few iterations.</p><p>MUSE is <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Conneau et al. (2017)</ref>'s tool, using adversarial learning (and optionally a seed) to identify similarly behaving high frequency anchor words, bootstrapping into fine tuning the mapping of less frequent words. MUSE is specifically de- signed for data scarce and unsupervised settings. It assumes shared embedding structures to be iden- tifiable, and the authors demonstrate that domain differences can strain this assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments and Results</head><p>To evaluate the quality of our DA word embed- dings, we use the task of dictionary induction. Given source dialect words from the evaluation dictionary, we attempt to recall appropriate trans- lations in the target dialect based on cosine dis- tance in multidialectal embedding space. The standard metric for this task is precision@k=1 (P@1) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Artetxe et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Artetxe et al., , 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Conneau et al., 2017)</ref>, measuring the fraction of source words in the evaluation dictionary for which the nearest tar- get dialect neighbor matches any of the possible translations in the evaluation dictionary.</p><p>We, however, are also concerned with how well multiple translations are recalled, as many words become polysemous in DA with short vow- els omitted and spelling not standardized. For this reason, many words appearing both in the seed and evaluation dictionaries do not map to the ex- act same set of possible translations in each. Thus, many precision errors may be forgiveable, so we focus on recall, reporting the metric recall@k=5 (R@5). Lastly, because types appear in a Zipfian distribution and type-based metrics disproportion- ately reflect accuracy in the tail, we report a fre- quency weighted recall@k=5 (WR@5) as well. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Considering both R@5 and WR@5 avoids the risk of improving performance on high or low fre- quency types at the expense of the other.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, models FT, EXT, and PP+EXT are trained on individual dialects, then mapped us- ing supervised SVECMAP into bidialectal embed- ding spaces. We experimented with all combina- tions of mapping algorithms and embedding mod- els, yet SVECMAP consistently outperformed the other mapping algorithms. We also report results for unsupervised UMUSE leveraging PP+EXT em- beddings. ID is an identity dictionary mapping  all source words to themselves, thus represent- ing dialect similarity. PP+EXT or EXT always outperform the baseline FT, with PP+EXT be- ing the best model in all but one instance ac- cording to WR@5 and R@5. PP+EXT success- fully addresses noise as its gains are larger on non-frequency weighted R@5 than WR@5; i.e., it improves on low frequency words without com- promising high frequency word accuracy. Addi- tionally, the consistency in results for WR@5 and R@5 as compared to P@1 suggests the small k is contributing to noise in the P@1 metric. While ALLDA generally performs worse than the supervised mapping approaches, it typically performs slightly better on words which were not found in their seed dictionaries according to R@5, likely because it can leverage more data to learn better representations for non-ambiguous, low fre- quency shared forms. Depending on the intended application, system combination could be ideal, querying ALLDA for low frequency forms appear- ing in multiple dialects, but not the seed.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Correlation between mapping perfor- mance and dialect similarity, i.e., the ID baseline, using PP+EXT embeddings.</p><p>As for supervised mapping algorithms, <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows that, depending on the dialect pair in ques- tion, SMUSE's adversarial learning approach cor- relates with ID's metric of dialect similarity 20- 30% more strongly than SVECMAP, which takes greater advantage of seed-evaluation domain sim- ilarity. Accordingly, SVECMAP beats SMUSE on in-seed forms by 3-23%. That said, SMUSE is more robust to seed coverage, slightly outperform- ing SVECMAP on out-of-seed forms and UMUSE successfully bootstraps without supervision, un- like UVECMAP. Still, the best performing option in the unsupervised set up is ALLDA. UMUSE's performance does not approach that of supervised alternatives as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Conneau et al. (2017)</ref>. This is likely because they (as do <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Artetxe et al. (2017a)</ref>) impose bilingual data scarcity constraints on high resource languages but do not consider the sparsity effects of noise common in low resource languages. They use large quantities of domain consistent, spelling standardized monolingual data which are not available for DA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We presented techniques for generating multidi- alectal word embeddings from noisy DA corpora. Due to linguistic differences, modeling dialects in- dependently and mapping embeddings into multi- dialectal space generally outperformed training di- alect agnostic embeddings on combined corpora. Our novel techniques include concatenating nar- row and wide windowed vectors and probabilis- tically identifying phrases before training embed- dings. These techniques improved performance on bidialectal dictionary induction 2-53% over a state-of-the-art baseline, with most of the im- provement realized on noisy, low frequency word forms. Our approach can easily be applied to other, similarly noisy corpora. In future work, we will improve the handling of orthographically am- biguous words, which are very prevalent in DA, and we will evaluate on the downstream appli- cations of machine translation and morphological disambiguation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>'s web crawl of forums, comments and blogs, Khalifa et al.
