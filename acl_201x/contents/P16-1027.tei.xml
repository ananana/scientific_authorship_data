				<p>There is a small but growing body of research on statistical scripts, models of event sequences that allow probabilistic inference of implicit events from documents. These systems operate on struc-tured verb-argument events produced by an NLP pipeline. We compare these systems with recent Recurrent Neural Net models that directly operate on raw tokens to predict sentences, finding the latter to be roughly comparable to the former in terms of predicting missing events in documents.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Statistical scripts are probabilistic models of event sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008)</ref>. A learned script model is capable of processing a document and inferring events that are probable but not explicitly stated. These models operate on automatically extracted structured events (for ex- ample, verbs with entity arguments), which are de- rived from standard NLP tools such as dependency parsers and coreference resolution engines.</p><p>Recent work has demonstrated that standard se- quence models applied to such extracted event sequences, e.g. discriminative language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rudinger et al., 2015)</ref> and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural nets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pichotta and Mooney, 2016)</ref>, are able to infer held-out events more accurately than previous approaches. These results call into question the extent to which statistical event inference systems require linguis- tic preprocessing and syntactic structure. In an at- tempt to shed light on this issue, we compare ex- isting script models to LSTMs trained as sentence- level language models which try to predict the sequence of words in the next sentence from a learned representation of the previous sentences using no linguistic preprocessing.</p><p>Some prior statistical script learning systems are focused on knowledge induction. These sys- tems are primarily designed to induce collections of co-occurring event types involving the same en- tities, and their ability to infer held-out events is not their primary intended purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ferraro and Van Durme, 2016</ref>, in- ter alia). In the present work, we instead investi- gate the behavior of systems trained to directly op- timize performance on the task of predicting sub- sequent events; in other words, we are investigat- ing statistical models of events in discourse.</p><p>Much prior research on statistical script learn- ing has also evaluated on inferring missing events from documents. However, the exact form that this task takes depends on the adopted definition of what constitutes an event: in previous work, events are defined in different ways, with differ- ing degrees of structure. We consider simply us- ing raw text, which requires no explicit syntactic annotation, as our mediating representation, and evaluate how raw text models compare to models of more structured events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref> introduced skip-thought vec- tor models, in which an RNN is trained to en- code a sentence within a document into a low- dimensional vector that supports predicting the neighboring sentences in the document. Though the objective function used to train networks max- imizes performance on the task of predicting sen- tences from their neighbors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref> do not evaluate directly on the ability of networks to predict text; they instead demonstrate that the intermediate low-dimensional vector embeddings are useful for other tasks. We directly evaluate the text predictions produced by such sentence-level RNN encoder-decoder models, and measure their utility for the task of predicting subsequent events.</p><p>We find that, on the task of predicting the text of held-out sentences, the systems we train to operate on the level of raw text generally outperform the systems we train to predict text mediated by auto- matically extracted event structures. On the other hand, if we run an NLP pipeline on the automat- ically generated text and extract structured events from these predictions, we achieve prediction per- formance roughly comparable to that of systems trained to predict events directly. The difference between word-level and event-level models on the task of event prediction is marginal, indicating that the task of predicting the next event, particularly in an encoder-decoder setup, may not necessarily need to be mediated by explicit event structures. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to evalu- ate sentence-level RNN language models directly on the task of predicting document text. Our re- sults show that such models are useful for pre- dicting missing information in text; and the fact that they require no linguistic preprocessing makes them more applicable to languages where quality parsing and co-reference tools are not available.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Statistical Script Learning</head><p>Scripts, structured models of stereotypical se- quences of events, date back to AI research from the 1970s, in particular the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schank and Abelson (1977)</ref>. In this concep- tion, scripts are modeled as temporally ordered sequences of symbolic structured events. These models are nonprobabilistic and brittle, and pose serious problems for automated learning.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing body of research into statistical script learning sys- tems, which enable statistical inference of im- plicit events from text. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chambers and Jurafsky (2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2009</ref>) describe a number of simple event co-occurrence based systems which infer (verb, dependency) pairs related to a particular discourse entity. For example, given the text:</p><p>Andrew Wiles won the 2016 Abel prize for proving Fermat's last theorem, such a system will ideally be able to infer novel facts like (accept, subject) or (publish, subject) for the entity Andrew Wiles, and facts like (accept, ob- ject) for the entity Abel prize. A number of other systems inferring the same types of pair events have been shown to provide superior performance in modeling events in documents ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jans et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rudinger et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pichotta and Mooney (2014)</ref> give a co- occurrence based script system that models and infers more complex multi-argument events from text. For example, in the above example, their model would ideally be able to infer a single event like accept(Wiles, prize), as opposed to the two simpler pairs from which it is composed. They provide evidence that modeling and inferring more complex multi-argument events also yields supe- rior performance on the task of inferring simpler (verb, dependency) pair events. These events are constructed using only coreference information; that is, the learned event co-occurrence models do not directly incorporate noun information.</p><p>More recently, Pichotta and Mooney (2016) presented an LSTM-based script inference model which models and infers multi-argument events, improving on previous systems on the task of in- ferring verbs with arguments. This system can in- corporate both noun and coreference information about event arguments. We will use this multi- argument event formulation (formalized below) and compare LSTM models using this event for- mulation to LSTM models using raw text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Recurrent Neural Networks</head><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are neu- ral nets whose computation graphs have cycles. In particular, RNN sequence models are RNNs which map a sequence of inputs x 1 , . . . , x T to a sequence of outputs y 1 , . . . , y T via a learned la- tent vector whose value at timestep t is a function of its value at the previous timestep t − 1.</p><p>The most basic RNN sequence models, so- called "vanilla RNNs" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Elman, 1990)</ref>, are de- scribed by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">z t = f (W i,z x t + W z,z z t−1 ) o t = g(W z,o z t )</formula><p>where x t is the vector describing the input at time t; z t is the vector giving the hidden state at time t; o t is the vector giving the predicted output at time t; f and g are element-wise nonlinear func- tions (typically sigmoids, hyperbolic tangent, or rectified linear units); and W i,z , W z,z , and W z,o are learned matrices describing linear transforma- tions. The recurrency in the computation graph arises from the fact that z t is a function of z t−1 .</p><p>The more complex Long Short-Term Mem- ory (LSTM) RNNs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Long Short-Term Memory unit at timestep t. The four nonlinearity nodes (i t , g t , f t , and o t ) all have, as inputs, x t and z t−1 . Small cir- cles with dots are elementwise vector multiplica- tions. 1997) have been shown to perform well on a wide variety of NLP tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Vinyals et al., 2015</ref>, inter alia). The LSTM we use is described by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i t = σ (W x,i x t + W z,i z t−1 + b i ) f t = σ (W x,f x t + W z,f z t−1 + b f ) o t = σ (W x,o x t + W h,i z t−1 + b o ) g t = tanh (W x,m x t + W z,m z t−1 + b g ) m t = f t • m t−1 + i t • g t z t = o t • tanh m t .</formula><p>The model is depicted graphically in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The memory vector m t is a function of both its previ- ous value m t−1 and the input x t ; the vector z t is output both to any layers above the unit (which are trained to predict the output values y t ), and is addi- tionally given as input to the LSTM unit at the next timestep t + 1. The W * , * matrices and b * vectors are learned model parameters, and u • v signifies element-wise multiplication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sentence-Level RNN Language Models</head><p>RNN sequence models have recently been shown to be extremely effective for word-level and character-level language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mikolov et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jozefowicz et al., 2016)</ref>. At each timestep, these models take a word or character as input, update a hidden state vector, and predict the next timestep's word or character. There is also a growing body of work on training RNN encoder- decoder models for NLP problems. These systems first encode the entire input into the network's hid- den state vector and then, in a second step, decode the entire output from this vector ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Vinyals et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Serban et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Sentence-level RNN language models, for ex- ample the skip-thought vector system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref>, conceptually bridge these two ap- proaches. Whereas standard language models are trained to predict the next token in the sequence of tokens, these systems are explicitly trained to pre- dict the next sentence in the sequence of sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref> train an encoder-decoder model to encode a sentence into a fixed-length vector and subsequently decode both the following and preceding sentence, using Gated Recurrent Units ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chung et al., 2014</ref>). In the present work, we train an LSTM model to predict a sentence's succes- sor, which is essentially the forward component of the skip-thought system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref> use the skip-thought system as a means of project- ing sentences into low-dimensional vector embed- dings, demonstrating the utility of these embed- dings on a number of other tasks; in contrast, we will use our trained sentence-level RNN language model directly on the task its objective function optimizes: predicting a sentence's successor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Narrative Cloze Evaluation</head><p>The evaluation of inference-focused statistical script systems is not straightforward. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chambers and Jurafsky (2008)</ref> introduced the Narrative Cloze evaluation, in which a single event is held out from a document and systems are judged by the ability to infer this held-out event given the remaining events. This evaluation has been used by a number of published script systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jans et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pichotta and Mooney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rudinger et al., 2015)</ref>. This automated evaluation measures systems' ability to model and predict events as they co-occur in text.</p><p>The exact definition of the Narrative Cloze evaluation depends on the formulation of events used in a script system. For example, Cham- bers and Jurafsky (2008), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jans et al. (2012)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rudinger et al. (2015)</ref> evaluate inference of held- out (verb, dependency) pairs from documents; Pi- chotta and Mooney (2014) evaluate inference of verbs with coreference information about multi- ple arguments; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pichotta and Mooney (2016)</ref> evaluate inference of verbs with noun informa- tion about multiple arguments. In order to gather human judgments of inference quality, the latter also learn an encoder-decoder LSTM network for transforming verbs and noun arguments into En- glish text to present to annotators for evaluation.</p><p>We evaluate instead on the task of directly in- ferring sequences of words. That is, instead of defining the Narrative Cloze to be the evaluation of predictions of held-out events, we define the task to be the evaluation of predictions of held-out text; in this setup, predictions need not be medi- ated by noisy, automatically-extracted events. To evaluate inferred text against gold standard text, we argue that the BLEU metric ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Papineni et al., 2002)</ref>, commonly used to evaluate Statistical Ma- chine Translation systems, is a natural evaluation metric. It is an n-gram-level analog to the event- level Narrative Cloze evaluation: whereas the Nar- rative Cloze evaluates a system on its ability to re- construct events as they occur in documents, BLEU evaluates a system on how well it reconstructs the n-grams.</p><p>This evaluation takes some inspiration from the evaluation of neural encoder-decoder translation models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>, which use similar architectures for the task of Machine Translation. That is, the task we present can be thought of as "translating" a sen- tence into its successor. While we do not claim that BLEU is necessarily the optimal way of eval- uating text-level inferences, but we do claim that it is a natural ngram-level analog to the Narrative Cloze task on events.</p><p>If a model infers text, we may also evaluate it on the task of inferring events by automatically ex- tracting structured events from its output text (in the same way as events are extracted from natural text). This allows us to compare directly to previ- ous event-based models on the task they are opti- mized for, namely, predicting structured events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Models</head><p>Statistical script systems take a sequence of events from a document and infer additional events that are statistically probable. Exactly what constitutes an event varies: it may be a (verb, dependency) pair inferred as relating to a particular discourse entity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rudinger et al., 2015</ref>), a simplex verb <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Orr et al., 2014)</ref>, or a verb with multi- ple arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pichotta and Mooney, 2014</ref>). In the present work, we adopt a representation of events as verbs with multiple arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Balasubramanian et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pichotta and Mooney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Modi and Titov, 2014</ref>). Formally, we define an event to be a variadic tuple (v, s, o, p * ), where v is a verb, s is a noun standing in subject relation to v, o is a noun standing as a direct object to v, and p * denotes an arbitrary number of (pobj, prep) pairs, with prep a preposition and pobj a noun re- lated to the verb v via the preposition prep. 1 Any argument except v may be null, indicating no noun fills that slot. For example, the text Napoleon sent the letter to Josephine would be represented by the event (sent, Napoleon, letter, (Josephine, to)).</p><p>We rep- resent arguments by their grammatical head words.</p><p>We evaluate on a number of different neural models which differ in their input and output. All models are LSTM-based encoder-decoder models. These models encode a sentence (either its events or text) into a learned hidden vector state and then, subsequently, decode that vector into its successor sentence (either its events or its text).</p><p>Our general system architecture is as follows. At each timestep t, the input token is repre- sented as a learned 100-dimensional embedding vector (learned jointly with the other parameters of the model), such that predictively similar words should get similar embeddings. This embedding is fed as input to the LSTM unit (that is, it will be the vector x t in Section 2.2, the input to the LSTM). The output of the LSTM unit (called z t in Section 2.2) is then fed to a softmax layer via a learned linear transformation.</p><p>During the encoding phase the network is not trained to produce any output. During the decod- ing phase the output is a one-hot representation of the subsequent timestep's input token (that is, with a V -word vocabulary, the output will be a V -dimensional vector with one 1 and V − 1 ze- ros). In this way, the network is trained to con- sume an entire input sequence and, as a second step, iteratively output the subsequent timestep's Figure 2: Encoder-Decoder setup predicting the text "Goodbye" from "Hello" input, which allows the prediction of full output sequences. This setup is pictured diagrammati- cally in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, which gives an example of in- put and output sequence for a token-level encoder- decoder model, encoding the sentence "Hello ." and decoding the successor sentence "Goodbye ." Note that we add beginning-of-sequence and end-of-sequence pseudo-tokens to sentences. This formulation allows a system to be trained which can encode a sentence and then infer a successor sentence by iteratively outputting next-input pre- dictions until the &lt;/S&gt; end-of-sentence pseudo- token is predicted. We use different LSTMs for encoding and decoding, as the dynamics of the two stages need not be identical.</p><note type="other">Hello ∅ &lt;/S&gt; ∅ &lt;S&gt; ∅ LSTM &lt;GEN&gt; &lt;S&gt; &lt;S&gt; Goodbye Goodbye &lt;/S&gt; &lt;/S&gt; ∅ Input Hidden (z t ) Output (y t ) Encoding</note><p>We notate the different systems as follows. Let s 1 be the input sentence and s 2 its successor sen- tence. Let t 1 denote the sequence of raw tokens in s 1 , and t 2 the tokens of s 2 . Further, let e 1 and e 2 be the sequence of structured events occurring in s 1 and s 2 , respectively (described in more detail in Section 4.1), and let e 2 [0] denote the first event of e 2 . The different systems we compare are named systematically as follows:</p><p>• The system t 1 t 2 is trained to encode a sentence's tokens and decode its successor's tokens.</p><p>• The system e 1 e 2 is trained to encode a sentence's events and decode its successor's events.</p><p>• The system e 1 e 2 t 2 is trained to en- code a sentence's events, decode its succes- sor's events, and then encode the latter and subsequently decode the successor's text.</p><p>We will not explicitly enumerate all systems, but other systems are defined analogously, with the schema X Y describing a system which is trained to encode X and subsequently decode Y , and X Y Z indicating a system which is trained to encode X, decode Y , and subsequently encode Y and decode Z. Note that in a system X Y Z, only X is provided as input.</p><p>We also present results for systems of the form X a Y , which signifies that the system is trained to decode Y from X with the addition of an atten- tion mechanism. We use the attention mechanism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Vinyals et al. (2015)</ref>. In short, these models have additional parameters which can learn soft alignments between positions of encoded inputs and positions in decoded outputs. Attention mech- anisms have recently been shown to be quite em- pirically valuable in many complex sequence pre- diction tasks. For more details on the model, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Vinyals et al. (2015)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> gives a diagrammatic representation of the different system setups. Text systems in- fer successor text and, optionally, parse that text and extract events from it; event sequences infer successor events and, optionally, expand inferred events into text.</p><p>Note that the system t 1 t 2 , in which both the encoding and decoding steps operate on raw text, is essentially a one-directional version of the skip-thought system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Fur- ther, the system e 1 e 2 t 2 , which is trained to take a sentence's event sequence as input, predict its successor's events, and then predict its succes- sor's words, is comparable to the event inference system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pichotta and Mooney (2016)</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Details</head><p>We train a number of LSTM encoder-decoder net- works which vary in their input and output. Mod- els are trained on English Language Wikipedia, with 1% of the documents held out as a validation set. Our test set consists of 10,000 unseen sen- tences (from articles in neither the training nor val- idation set). We train models with batch stochas- tic gradient descent with momentum, minimizing the cross-entropy error of output predictions. All models are implemented in <ref type="bibr">TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015)</ref>. We use a vocabulary of the 50,000 most frequent tokens, replacing all other tokens with an out-of-vocabulary pseudo-token. Learned word embeddings are 100-dimensional, and the la- tent LSTM vector is 500-dimensional. To extract events from text, we use the Stanford Dependency Parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(De Marneffe et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Socher et al., 2013)</ref>. We use the Moses toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Koehn et al., 2007</ref>) to calculate BLEU. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We evaluate the task of predicting held-out text with three metrics. The first metric is BLEU, which is standard BLEU (the geometric mean of modified 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-gram precision against a gold stan- dard, multiplied by a brevity penalty which pe- nalizes short candidates). The second metric we present, BLEU-BP, is BLEU without the brevity <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Via the script multi-bleu.pl. penalty: in the task of predicting successor sen- tences, depending on predictions' end use, on- topic brevity is not necessarily undesirable. Eval- uations are over top system inferences (that is, de- coding is done by taking the argmax). Finally, we also present values for unigram precision (1G P), one of the components of BLEU.</p><p>We also evaluate on the task of predicting held- out verb-argument events, either directly or via in- ferred text. We use two evaluation metrics for this task. First, the Accuracy metric measures the per- centage of a system's most confident guesses that are totally correct. That is, for each held-out event, a system makes its single most confident guess for that event, and we calculate the total percentage of such guesses which are totally correct. Some au- thors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jans et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pichotta and Mooney (2016)</ref>) present results on the "Recall at k" met- ric, judging gold-standard recall against a list of top k event inferences; this metric is equivalent to "Recall at 1." This is quite a stringent metric, as an inference is only counted correct if the verb and all arguments are correct. To relax this requirement, we also present results on what we call the Partial Credit metric, which is the percentage of held-out event components identical to the respective com- ponents in a system's top inference. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gives the results of evaluating predicted successor sentence text against the gold standard using BLEU.

Transformations written X a Y are, recall, encoder-decoder LSTMs with attention.</p><p>Note, first, that the text-level models outperform other models on BLEU. In particular, the two-step model e 1 e 2 t 2 (and comparable model with attention) which first predicts successor events and then, as a separate step, expands these events into text, performs quite poorly. This is perhaps due to the fact that the translation from text to events is lossy, so reconstructing raw sentence tokens is not straightforward.</p><p>The BLEU-BP scores, which are BLEU without the brevity penalty, are noticeably higher in the text-level models than the raw BLEU scores. This is in part because these models seem to produce shorter sentences, as illustrated below in section 4.4.</p><p>The attention mechanism does not obviously benefit either text or event level prediction encoder-decoder models. This could be because there is not an obvious alignment structure be- tween contiguous spans of raw text (or events) in natural documents.</p><p>These results provide evidence that, if the Nar- rative Cloze task is defined to evaluate prediction of held-out text from a document, then sentence- level RNN language models provide superior per- formance to RNN models operating at the event level. In other words, linguistic pre-processing does not obviously benefit encoder-decoder mod- els trained to predict succeeding text. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> gives results on the task of predicting the next verb with its nominal arguments; that is, whereas <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> gave results on a text analog to the Narrative Cloze evaluation (BLEU), <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> gives</p></div>

In the t 1 t 2 e 2 [0] system (and the comparable system with attention), events are ex- tracted from automatically generated text by pars- ing output text and applying the same event ex- tractor to this parse used to extract events from raw text. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The row labeled Most common in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Ta- ble 2</ref> gives performance for the baseline system which always guesses the most common event in the training set.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t 1 t 2 e 2 [0] 2.0 30.3 t 1 a t 2 e 2 [0] 2.0 27.7</formula><p>The LSTM models trained to directly predict events are roughly comparable to systems which operate on raw text, performing slightly worse on accuracy and slightly better when taking partial credit into account. As with the previous com- parisons with BLEU, the attention mechanism does not provide an obvious improvement when decod- ing inferences, perhaps, again, because the event inference problem lacks a clear alignment struc- ture.</p><p>These systems infer their most probable guesses of e 2 [0], the first event in the succeeding sentence. In order for a system prediction to be counted as correct, it must have the correct strings for gram- matical head words of all components of the cor- rect event. Note also that we judge only against a system's single most confident prediction (as op- posed to some prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jans et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pichotta and Mooney, 2014</ref>) which takes the top k predictions-the numbers presented here are therefore noticeably lower). We do this mainly for computational reasons: namely, a beam search over a full sentence's text would be quite compu- tationally expensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Adding Additional Context</head><p>The results given above are for systems which en- code information about one sentence and decode information about its successor. This is within the spirit of the skip-gram system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kiros et al. (2015)</ref>, but we may wish to condition on more of the document. To investigate this, we per- form an experiment varying the number of previ- ous sentences input during the encoding step of t 1 t 2 text-level models without attention. We train three different models, which take either one, three, or five sentences as input, respectively, and are trained to output the successor sentence.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> gives the results of running these mod- els on 10,000 sentences from the validation set. As can be seen, in the training setup we investigate, more additional context sentences have a mixed effect, depending on the metric. This is perhaps due in part to the fact that we kept hyperparam- eters fixed between experiments, and a different hyperparameter regime would benefit predictions from longer input sequences. More investigation could prove fruitful. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> gives some example automatic next- sentence text predictions, along with the input sen- tence and the gold-standard next sentence. Note that gold-standard successor sentences frequently introduce new details not obviously inferrable from previous text. Top system predictions, on the other hand, are frequently fairly short. This is likely due part to the fact that the cross-entropy loss does not directly penalize short sentences and part to the fact that many details in gold-standard successor text are inherently difficult to predict.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Discussion</head><p>The general low magnitude of the BLEU scores presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, especially in comparison to the scores typically reported in Machine Trans- lation results, indicates the difficulty of the task. In open-domain text, a sentence is typically not straightforwardly predictable from preceding text; if it were, it would likely not be stated.</p><p>On the task of verb-argument prediction in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Ta- ble 2</ref>, the difference between t 1 t 2 and e 1 e 2 [0] is fairly marginal. This raises the general question of how much explicit syntactic analysis is required for the task of event inference, partic- ularly in the encoder/decoder setup. These results provide evidence that a sentence-level RNN lan- guage model which operates on raw tokens can predict what comes next in a document as well or nearly as well as an event-mediated script model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Future Work</head><p>There are a number of further extensions to this work. First, in this work (and, more generally, Neural Machine Translation research), though generated text is evaluated using BLEU, systems are optimized for per-token cross-entropy error, which is a different objective ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Luong et al. (2016)</ref> give an example of a system which improves cross-entropy error but reduces BLEU score in the Neural Machine Translation context). Finding dif- ferentiable objective functions that more directly target more complex evaluation metrics like BLEU is an interesting future research direction.</p><p>Relatedly, though we argue that BLEU is a natural token-sequence-level analog to the verb- argument formulation of the Narrative Cloze task, it is not obviously the best metric for evaluat- ing inferences of text, and comparing these auto- mated metrics with human judgments is an im- portant direction of future work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pichotta and Mooney (2016)</ref> present results on crowdsourced human evaluation of script inferences that could be repeated for our RNN models.</p><p>Though we focus here on forward-direction models predicting successor sentences, bidirec- tional encoder-decoder models, which predict sen- tences from both previous and subsequent text, are another interesting future research direction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have given what we believe to be the first systematic evaluation of sentence-level RNN lan- guage models on the task of predicting held-out document text. We have found that models oper- ating on raw text perform roughly comparably to identical models operating on predicate-argument event structures when predicting the latter, and that text models provide superior predictions of raw text. This provides evidence that, for the task of held-out event prediction, encoder/decoder mod- els mediated by automatically extracted events may not be learning appreciably more structure than systems trained on raw tokens alone.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 4 :</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4: Sample next-sentence text predictions.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> This is essentially the event representation of Pichotta and Mooney (2016), but whereas they limited events to having a single prepositional phrase, we allow an arbitrary number, and we do not lemmatize words.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> The system of Kiros et al. (2015), in addition to being trained to predict the next sentence, also contains a backwarddirectional RNN trained to predict a sentence&apos;s predecessor; we condition only on previous text. Kiros et al. (2015) also use Gated Recurrent Units instead of LSTM.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> This metric was used in Pichotta and Mooney (2014), but there it was called Accuracy. In the present work, we use &quot;accuracy&quot; only to mean Recall at 1.</note>

We parse text using version 3.3.1 of the Stanford CoreNLP system. We use a vocab consisting of the 50,000 most common tokens, re- placing all others with an Out-of-vocabulary pseu- dotoken. We train using batch stochastic gradi- ent descent with momentum with a batch size of 10 sequences, using an initial learning rate of 0.1, damping the learning rate by 0.99 any time the previous hundred updates' average test error is greater than any of the average losses in the previ- ous ten groups of hundred updates. Our momen- tum parameter is 0.95. Our embedding vectors are 100-dimensional, and our LSTM hidden state is 500-dimensional. We train all models for 300k batch updates (with the exception of the models compared in §4.3, all of which we train for 150k batch updates, as training is appreciably slower with longer input sequences). Training takes ap- proximately 36 hours on an NVIDIA Titan Black GPU.</p></div>			</div>
