				<p>Semantic deficit is a symptom of language impairment in Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). We present a generalizable method for automatic generation of information content units (ICUs) for a picture used in a standard clinical task, achieving high recall, 96.8%, of human-supplied ICUs. We use the automatically generated topic model to extract semantic features, and train a random forest classifier to achieve an F-score of 0.74 in binary classification of controls versus people with AD using a set of only 12 features. This is comparable to results (0.72 F-score) with a set of 85 manual features. Adding semantic information to a set of standard lexicosyntactic and acoustic features improves F-score to 0.80. While control and dementia subjects discuss the same topics in the same contexts, controls are more informative per second of speech.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia, and affects more than 24.3 million people worldwide ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballard et al., 2011</ref>). Importantly, early detection en- ables some therapeutic intervention and disease- modifying treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sperling et al., 2011</ref>). Longitudinal studies of people with autopsy- confirmed AD indicate that linguistic changes are detectable in the prodromal stages of the disease; these include a decline in grammatical complexity, word-finding difficulties, and semantic content de- ficiencies, such as low idea density (i.e., the ratio of semantic units to the total number of words in a speech sample), and low efficiency (i.e., the rate of semantic units over the duration of the speech sample) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bayles and Kaszniak, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Snowdon et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Le et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahmed et al., 2013b</ref>). In the present study, we investigate methods of automatically assessing the semantic content of speech, and use it to distinguish people with AD from healthy older adults.</p><p>A standard clinical task for eliciting sponta- neous speech, with high sensitivity to language in early AD, is picture description. In it, a participant is asked to provide a free-form verbal description of a visual stimulus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bayles and Kaszniak, 1987)</ref>. The picture is asso- ciated with a set of human-supplied information content units (hsICUs) representing components of the image, such as subjects, objects, locations, and actions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Croisile et al., 1996</ref>). The semantic content of the elicited speech can then be scored by counting the hsICUs present in the descrip- tion. Previous studies found that, even in the earli- est stages, descriptions by those with AD are less informative compared to those of healthy older adults, producing fewer information units out of a pre-defined list of units, and having less relevant content and lower efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hier et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Croisile et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Giles et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmed et al., 2013a</ref>).</p><p>Using a pre-defined list of annotated hsICUs is subject to several limitations: (i) it is subjective - different authors use a different number of hsICUs for the same picture (e.g., from 7 to 25 for Cookie Theft in the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examina- tion (BDAE)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hier et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Croisile et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Forbes-McKay and Venneri, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lai et al., 2009)</ref>; (ii) it may not be optimal for detecting linguistic impairment -the manually-annotated hsICUs are neither exhaustive of all details present in the picture, nor necessarily reflective of the con- tent units which differ most across groups; (iii) it is not generalizable -hsICUs are specific to a particular picture, and new visual stimuli (e.g., required for longitudinal assessments) need to be annotated manually. In addition to requiring time and effort, this may result in inconsistencies, since the methodology for identifying hsICUs was never clearly defined in previous work.</p><p>Automatic scoring of semantic content in speech to detect cognitive impairment has so far required manual hsICUs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hakkani-TÃ¼r et al. (2010)</ref> used unigram recall among hsICUs in the Western Aphasia Battery's Picnic picture ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kertesz, 1982)</ref> and obtained a correlation of 0.93 with manual hsICU counts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pakhomov et al. (2010)</ref> counted N -grams (N = 1, 2, 3, 4) ex- tracted from a list of hsICUs for the Cookie Theft picture to assess semantic content in the speech of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.  counted instances of lexical to- kens extracted from a list of hsICUs, using depen- dency parses of Cookie Theft picture descriptions, and combined them with other lexicosyntactic and acoustic features to obtain classification accuracy of 81.9% in identifying people with AD from con- trols. While those automated methods for scor- ing the information content in speech used man- ual hsICUs, we have found none that attempted to produce ICUs automatically.</p><p>In this paper, we present a generalizable method for automatically generating information content units for any given picture (or spontaneous speech task), using reference speech. Since clinical data can be sparse, we present a method for building word vector representations using a large general corpus, then augment it with local context win- dows from a smaller clinical corpus. We eval- uate the generated ICUs by computing recall of hsICUs and use the constructed topic models to compare the speech of participants with and with- out dementia, and compute topic alignment. Sec- ond, we automatically score new picture descrip- tions by learning semantic features extracted from these generated ICU models, using a random for- est classifier; we assess performance with recall, precision, and F-score. Third, we propose a set of clinically-relevant features for identifying AD based on differences in topic, topic context, idea density and idea efficiency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data</head><p>DementiaBank is one of the largest public, lon- gitudinal datasets of spontaneous speech from in- dividuals with and without dementia. It was col- lected at the University of <ref type="bibr">Pittsburgh (Becker et al., 1994)</ref> and contains verbal descriptions of the standard Cookie Theft picture <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983)</ref>, along with manual transcriptions.</p><p>In our study, we use 255 speech samples from participants diagnosed with probable or possible AD (collectively referred to as the 'AD' class), and 241 samples from healthy controls (collectively referred to as the 'CT' class), see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We remove all CHAT-format annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(MacWhinney, 2015</ref>), filled pauses (e.g., 'ah' and 'um'), phonological fragments (e.g., 'b b boy' becomes 'boy'), repairs (e.g., 'in the in the kitchen' be- comes 'in the kitchen'), non-standard forms (e.g., 'gonna' becomes 'going to'), and punctuation (e.g., commas are removed). These corrections are all provided in the database. We ignore transcripts of the investigator's speech, as irrelevant. Subject data were randomly partitioned into training, vali- dation, and test sets using a 60-20-20 split. We combine all hsICUs in previous work for the Cookie Theft picture ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hier et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Croisile et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Forbes-McKay and Venneri, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lai et al., 2009</ref>) with hsICUs obtained from a speech language pathologist (SLP) at the Toronto Reha- bilitation Institute (TRI). The annotations of the SLP overlap completely with previously identified hsICUs, except for one (apron). The first three columns of <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarize these manually- produced hsICUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Automatic generation of ICUs</head><p>Our novel method of identifying ICUs is based on simple topic modelling using clusters of global word-vector representations from picture descrip- tions. First, we train a word-vector model on a large normative general-purpose corpus, allowing us to avoid sparsity in the clinical data's word- word co-occurrence matrix. Then, we extract the vector representations of words in the Dementia- <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Information units above the double line are human-supplied ICUs (hsICUs) found in previous work, except those marked with â  which were annotated by an SLP for this study; those below are ad- ditionally analyzed. Over 1,000 clustering configurations based on word vectors extracted from Control and Dementia reference transcriptions, Âµ is the mean of the scaled distance (Eq. 1) of each hsICU to its closest cluster centroid, Ï is the standard deviation, and Î´ = (Âµ dementia â Âµ control ). Statistical signifi- cance of Î´ was tested using an independent two-sample, two-tailed t-test; *** = p &lt; .001, ** = p &lt; .01, * = p &lt; .05, ns = not significant. Bank corpus, and optionally augment them with local context windows from the clinical dataset. We use GloVe v1. <ref type="bibr">2 (Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) to obtain embedded word representations and train on a combined corpus of Wikipedia 2014 1 + Gigaword 5 2 . The trained model consists of 400,000 word vectors, in 50 dimensions.</p><p>Transcriptions in DementiaBank are lowercased and tokenized using NLTK v3.1, and each word token is converted to its vector space representa- tion using the trained GloVe model. There are a total of 26,654 word vectors (1,087 unique vec- tors) in the control data, and 24,753 (1,131 unique) in the dementia data. Since we aim to con- struct a model of semantic content, only nouns and verbs are retained prior to clustering. The re- sulting dataset consists of 9,330 word vectors (801 unique vectors) in the control data, and 8,021 (843 unique) in the dementia data.</p><p>We use k-means clustering with whitening, ini- tialization with the Forgy method, and a distor- tion threshold of 10 â5 as the stopping condition, where distortion is defined as the sum of the dis- tances between each vector and its correspond- ing centroid. We train a control cluster model on the control training set (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> for a 2D pro- jection of cluster vectors using principal compo- nent analysis), and a dementia cluster model on the dementia training set. Clusters represent top- ics, or groups of semantically related word vec- tors, discussed by the respective group of subjects. While prior work is based on hsICUs that are ex- pected to be discussed by healthy speakers, we construct a separate cluster model for the control and dementia groups since it is unclear whether the topics discussed by both groups overlap. We vary k <ref type="bibr">(= 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50)</ref>, complet- ing 1,000 runs for each value, and use the Elbow method to select the optimal number of clusters on the respective validation set. The optimal setting, k = 10, optimizes the tradeoff between the per- centage of variance explained by the clusters, and their total number. The resulting clusters represent topics that can be compared against hsICUs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Recall of hsICUs</head><p>In order to assess (i) how well the automatically generated clusters match clinical hsICUs for this image, and (ii) how much the two generated topic models differ, we analyze the vector space dis- tance between each hsICU and its closest cluster centroid (d Euclidean ) in each of the control and de- mentia models. Since some clusters are more dis- persed than others, we need to scale the distance appropriately. To do so, for each cluster in each model, we compute the mean distortion, Âµ cl , of the vectors in the cluster, and the associated standard deviation Ï cl . For each hsICU vector, we com- pute the scaled distance between the vector and its closest cluster centroid in each generated model as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d scaled = (d Euclidean â Âµ cl ) Ï cl (1)</formula><p>The scaled distance is equivalent to the num- ber of standard deviations above the mean -a value below zero indicates hsICUs which are very close to an automatically generated cluster cen- troid, while a large positive value indicates hsICUs that are far from a cluster centroid. To account for the fact that k-means is a stochastic algorithm, we perform clustering multiple times and average the results. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the mean, Âµ, and standard deviation, Ï, of d scaled , for each hsICU, over 1,000 cluster configurations for each model.</p><p>To quantify the recall of hsICUs using each gen- erated cluster model, we consider hsICUs with Âµ â¤ 3.0 to be recalled (i.e., the distance to the assigned cluster centroid is not greater than those of 99.7% of the datapoints in the cluster, given a Gaussian distribution of distortion). The recall of hsICUs, for both the control and dementia mod- els, is 96.8%. Since the optimal number of gen- erated clusters is k = 10, while the number of hsICUs is 31, multiple hsICUs can be grouped in related themes (e.g., one automatically generated cluster corresponds to the description of animate subjects in the picture, capturing four hsICUs: S1- S4). Both the control and dementia models do not recall hsICU O6, dishcloth, which suggests that it is a topic that neither study group discusses. All remaining hsICUs are recalled by both the control and dementia models, indicating that the hsICU topics are discussed by both groups.</p><p>However, to assess whether they are discussed to the same extent, i.e. to evaluate whether the two topic models differ, we conducted an indepen- dent two-sample two-tailed t-test to compare the mean scaled distance, Âµ, of each hsICU to its clos- est cluster centroid, in each cluster model (see Î´ in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). As anticipated, since they involve infer- ence of attention, the control model is better at ac- counting for the topics of the overflowing sink and the mother's indifference: overflowing (t(1998) = â3.78, p &lt; .001); sink (t(1998) = â9.85, p &lt; .001); indifferent (t(1998) = â3.20, p &lt; .01). While there is no significant difference in the term woman between the two groups, the control model predicts the term mother better than the demen- tia model (t(1998) = â30.05, p &lt; .001). To investigate whether healthy participants are more likely to identify relations between the subjects than participants with cognitive impairment, we repeated the recall experiment with the following new hsICUs: brother, sister, son, daughter. In- terestingly, the dementia cluster model contains a cluster which aligns significantly more closely, than any in the control model, with all four of these relation words: brother (t(1998) = 19.53, p &lt; .001); sister (t(1998) = 8.93, p &lt; .001); son (t(1998) = 18.78, p &lt; .001). While the control participants mention relation words as often as the participants with dementia <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , the generated clus- ter models show that the ratio of relation words to non-relation words is higher for the dementia group 4 .</p><p>The new hsICU, apron, which was not identi- fied in previous literature but was labelled by an SLP for this study, is significantly more likely to be discussed by the control population (t(1998) = â12.46, p &lt; .001), suggesting at the impor- tance of details for distinguishing cognitively im- paired individuals. In a similar vein, control par- ticipants are significantly more likely to identify objects in the background of the scene, such as the window (t(1998) = â26.04, p &lt; .001), curtains (t(1998) = â24.54, p &lt; .001), cup- board (t(1998) = â3.03, p &lt; .01), or counter (t(1998) = â14.59, p &lt; .001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Cluster model alignment</head><p>While prior work counted the frequency with which fixed topics are mentioned, our data-driven cluster models allow greater exploration of dif- ferences between the set of topics discussed by each subject group, and the alignment between them. Since prior work has found that subjects with cognitive impairment produce more irrele- vant content, we quantify the amount of dispersion within each cluster through the standard deviation of its distortion and its type-to-token ratio (TTR), as shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Further, we compute direc- tional alignment between pairs of clusters in each model. For each cluster in one model, alignment is determined by computing the closest cluster in the other model for each vector, and taking the major- ity assignment label (see a in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). To quan- tify the alignment, the Euclidean distance of each vector to the assigned cluster in the other model is computed, scaled by the mean and standard de- viation of the cluster distortion; the mean of the scaled distance, Âµ a , is reported in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>To quantify the alignment of clusters in each model, we consider clusters to be recalled if their distance to the closest cluster in the other model is Âµ a â¤ 3. Notably, all control clusters (C0-C9) are recalled by the dementia model, while one de- mentia cluster, D7, is not recalled by the control model. This exemplifies the fact that while the dementia group mentions all topics discussed by controls, they also mention a sufficient number of extraneous terms which constitute a new heteroge- neous topic cluster, having the highest TTR. lower ratio (t(494) = â4.10, p &lt; .001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 3: Cluster statistics for control (C*) and dementia (D*) models, with computed cluster alignment.</head><p>Cluster words are the 5 most frequently occurring words. f vec is the fraction of all vectors which belong to the given cluster. Âµ cl and Ï cl are the mean and standard deviation of the cluster distortion. f n is the fraction of nouns among cluster vectors; (1 â f n ) is the fraction of verbs. TTR is the type-to-token ratio. a is the ID of the aligned cluster, and Âµ a is the mean scaled distance to the aligned cluster centroid. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Local context weighted vectors</head><p>Since there is significant overlap in the topics dis- cussed between the control and dementia groups, we proceed by investigating whether the overlap- ping topics are discussed in the same contexts. To this end, we augment the word vector represen- tations with local context windows from Demen- tiaBank. Each word vector is constructed using a linear combination of its global vector from the trained GloVe model, and the vectors of the Â±N surrounding context words, where each context word is weighted inversely to its distance from the central word:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ï w = v w + â1 i=âN Î± i Ã v i + N i=1 Î± i Ã v i<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, Ï w is the local-context-weighted vector for word w, v w is the GloVe vector for word w, v i is the GloVe vector for word i within the context of w, and Î± i is the weighting of word i, inversely and linearly proportional to the distance between con- text and central word. Following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fraser and Hirst, 2016)</ref>, we use a context window of size N = 3. We extract local-context-weighted vectors for all control and dementia transcripts, and construct two topic models as before.</p><p>To quantify whether the dementia contexts dif- fer significantly from the control contexts for the same word, we extract all word usages as local- context-weighted vectors, and find the centroid of the control usages, along with the mean and stan- dard deviation of the control vectors from their centroids. Then, we compute the average scaled Euclidean distance, d scaled , of the dementia vec- tors from the control centroid, as in Eq. 1. Words with d scaled &gt; 3 (i.e., where the dementia context vectors are further from the control centroid than the majority of control context vectors) are con- sidered to have different context usage across the control and dementia groups. Interestingly, all of the control cluster words are used in the same contexts by both healthy partici- pants and those with dementia. However, the aver- age number of times these words are used per tran- script is significantly higher in the control group (1.07, s.d. = 0.12) than in the dementia group (0.77, s.d. = 0.14; t(18) = 1.87, p &lt; .05).</p><p>While the two groups discuss the same topics generally and use the same words in the same con- texts, not all participants in the dementia group identify all of the control topics or discuss them with the same frequency. A contextual analy- sis reveals that certain words are discussed in a distinct number of limited contexts, while others are discussed in more varied contexts. For in- stance, while we identified a control cluster as- sociated with the topic of the cookie in Section 3.2, there are two clearly distinct contexts in which this word is used, by both groups, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. The two clusters in context space corre- spond to: (i) the usage of cookie in the compound noun phrase cookie jar, and (ii) referring to a sin- gle cookie, e.g. reaching for a cookie, hand her a cookie, getting a cookie.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Classification</head><p>To classify speakers as having AD or not, we extract the following types of features from our automatically-generated cluster models: (i) distance-based metrics for each of the control model clusters, C0-C9, (ii) distance-based metrics for each of the dementia model clusters, D0-D9, (iii) idea density, and (iv) idea efficiency. Given the vectors associated with a transcript's nouns and verbs, feature C i (and equivalently, D i ) is computed by finding the average scaled distance, d scaled (Eq. 1), of all vectors assigned to cluster C i . A feature value below zero indicates that the transcript words assigned to the cluster are very well predicted by it (i.e., their distance from the cluster centroid is less than the average cluster distortion). Conversely, clusters which represent topics not discussed in the transcript have large positive feature values. We chose these distance- based metrics to evaluate topic recall in the tran- script since a continuous measure is more appro- priate for modelling the non-discrete nature of lan- guage and semantic similarity. We compute idea density as the number of expected topics men- tioned 5 divided by the total number of words in the transcript, and idea efficiency as the number of expected topics mentioned divided by the total duration of the recording (in seconds). The ex- pected topics used for computation of idea den- sity and idea efficiency are the ICUs from the automatically-produced cluster models.</p><p>We perform classification using a random for- est, whose parameters are optimized on the valida- tion set, and performance reported on the test set. We vary the following experimental settings: clus- ter model (control; dementia; combined), feature set (distance-based; distance-based + idea density + idea efficiency), and context (no context; context with N = 3). A three-way ANOVA is conducted to examine the effects of these settings on average test F-score. There is a significant interaction be- tween feature set and context, F (1, 110) = 9.07, p &lt; 0.01. Simple main effect analysis shows that when using the extended feature set, vectors constructed without local context windows from the clinical dataset yield significantly better results than those with context (p &lt; 0.001), but there is no effect when using only distance-based fea- tures (p = 0.87). There is no main effect of clus- ter model on test performance, F (2, 117) = 2.30, p = 0.11, which is expected since cluster align- ment revealed significant overlap between the top- ics discussed by the control and dementia groups (Section 3.2). Notably, there is a significant effect of feature set on test performance, whereby adding the idea density and idea efficiency features results in significantly higher F-scores, both when using local context for vector construction (p &lt; 0.05), and otherwise (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>As a baseline, we use a list of hsICUs extracted by  in a state-of-the-art au- tomated method for separating AD and control speakers in DementiaBank. These features consist of (i) counts of lexical tokens representing hsICUs (e.g., boy, son, and brother are used to identify whether hsICU S1 <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref> was discussed, and (ii) Boolean values which indicate whether each hsICU was mentioned or not. Overall, this consti- tutes 85 features. Additionally,  identified a list of lexicosyntactic and acoustic (LS&amp;A) features which are indicative of cogni- tive impairment. We compute the performance of each set of features independently, and then com- <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Binary classification (AD:CT) using a random forest classifier, with 10-fold cross-validation. All cluster models are trained on vectors with no local context. LS&amp;A are lexicosyntactic and acoustic features as described by .

Our 12 automatically generated features (i.e., the combined set of distance-based measures, idea density, and idea efficiency) re- sult in higher F-scores (0.74) than using 85 manu- ally generated hsICUs (0.72); a two-sample paired t-test shows no difference (using control cluster model: t(9) = 1.10, p = 0.30; using dementia cluster model: t(9) = 0.74, p = 0.48) indicating the similarity of our method to the manual gold standard. Furthermore, we match state-of-the-art results (F-score of 0.80) when we augment the set of LS&amp;A features with our automatically gener- ated semantic features.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>We demonstrated a method for generating topic models automatically within the context of clinical assessment, and confirmed that low idea density and low idea efficiency are salient indicators of cognitive impairment. In our data, we also found that speakers with and without Alzheimer's dis- ease generally discuss the same topics and in the same contexts, although those with AD give more spurious descriptions, as exemplified by the irrel- evant topic cluster D7 <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. Using a fully automated topic generation and feature extraction pipeline, we found a small set of features which perform as well as a large set of manually constructed hsICUs in binary classifica- tion experiments, achieving an F-score of 0.80 in 10-fold cross-validation on DementiaBank. The features which correlate most highly with class include: idea efficiency (Pearson's r = â0.41), which means that healthy individuals discuss more topics per unit time; distance from cluster C4 (r = 0.34), which indicates that speakers with AD focus less on the topic of the three-legged stool; and idea density (r = â0.26), which shows that healthy speakers need fewer words to express the same number of topics.</p><p>While we anticipated that combining a large normative corpus with local context windows from a clinical corpus would produce optimal vectors, using the former exclusively actually performs better. This phenomenon is being investigated. This implies that word-vector representations do not need to be adapted with context windows in specific clinical data in order to be effective.</p><p>A limitation of the current work is its re- quirement of high-quality transcriptions of speech, since high word-error rates (WERs) could com- promise semantic information. We are therefore generating automatic transcriptions of the Demen- tiaBank audio using the Kaldi speech recogni- tion toolkit <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . So far, a triphone model with the standard insertion penalty (0) and language model scale (20) on DementiaBank gives the best average WER of 36.7Â±3.6% with 10-fold cross-validation. Continued optimization is the subject of ongoing research but preliminary experiments with these transcriptions indicate significantly lower perfor-mance of the baseline model (0.68 F-score; t(9) = 3.52, p &lt; 0.01). While the eventual aim is a com- pletely automatic system, our methodology over- comes several major challenges in the manual se- mantic annotation of clinical images for cogni- tive assessment, even with manual transcriptions. Specifically, our methodology is fully objective, sensitive to differences between groups, and gen- eralizable to new stimuli which is especially im- portant if longitudinal analysis is to avoid the so- called 'practice effect' by using multiple stimuli.</p><p>Across many domains, to extract useful seman- tic features (such as idea density and idea effi- ciency), one needs to first identify information content units in speech or text. Our method can be applied to any picture or contentful stimuli, given a sufficient amount of normative data, with no mod- ification. Although we apply this generalizable method to a single (albeit important) image used in clinical practice in this work, we note that we obtain better accuracies with this completely auto- mated method than a completely manual alterna- tive.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Control cluster model.
