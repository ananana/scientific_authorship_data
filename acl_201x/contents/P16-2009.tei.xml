				<p>We consider two graph models of semantic change. The first is a time-series model that relates embedding vectors from one time period to embedding vectors of previous time periods. In the second, we construct one graph for each word: nodes in this graph correspond to time points and edge weights to the similarity of the word&apos;s meaning across two time points. We apply our two models to corpora across three different languages. We find that semantic change is linear in two senses. Firstly, today&apos;s embedding vectors (= meaning) of words can be derived as linear combinations of embedding vectors of their neighbors in previous time periods. Secondly, self-similarity of words decays linearly in time. We consider both findings as new laws/hypotheses of semantic change.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Meaning is not uniform, neither across space, nor across time. Across space, different languages tend to exhibit different polysemous associations for corresponding terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Eger et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kulkarni et al., 2015b</ref>). Across time, several well- known examples of meaning change in English have been documented. For example, the word gay's meaning has shifted, during the 1970s, from an adjectival meaning of cheerful at the beginning of the 20 th century to its present meaning of homo- sexual ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kulkarni et al., 2015a</ref>). Similarly, techno- logical progress has led to semantic broadening of terms such as transmission, mouse, or apple.</p><p>In this work, we consider two graph models of semantic change. Our first model is a dy- namic model in that the underlying paradigm is a (time-)series of graphs. Each node in the se- ries of graphs corresponds to one word, associ- ated with which is a semantic embedding vec- tor. We then ask how the embedding vectors in one time period (graph) can be predicted from the embedding vectors of neighbor words in previous time periods. In particular, we postulate that there is a linear functional relationship that couples a word's today's meaning with its neighbor's mean- ings in the past. When estimating the coefficients of this model, we find that the linear form ap- pears indeed very plausible. This functional form then allows us to address further questions, such as negative relationships between words -which indicate semantic differentiation over time -as well as projections into the future. We call our second graph model time-indexed self-similarity graphs. In these graphs, each node corresponds to a time point and the link between two time points indicates the semantic similarity of a spe- cific word across the two time points under con- sideration. The analysis of these graphs reveals that most words obey a law of linear semantic 'de- cay': semantic self-similarity decreases linearly over time.</p><p>In our work, we capture semantics by means of word embeddings derived from context-predicting neural network architectures, which have be- come the state-of-the-art in distributional seman- tics modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baroni et al., 2014</ref>). Our approach and results are partly independent of this repre- sentation, however, in that we take a structural- ist approach: we derive new, 'second-order em- beddings' by modeling the meaning of words by means of their semantic similarity relations to all other words in the vocabulary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">de Saussure, 1916;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rieger, 2003)</ref>. Thus, future research may in prin- ciple substitute the deep-learning architectures for semantics considered here by any other method capable of producing semantic similarity values between lexical units. This work is structured as follows. In §2, we discuss related work. In §3.1 and 3.2, respectively, we formally introduce the two graph models out- lined. In §4, we detail our experiments and in §5, we conclude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Broadly speaking, one can distinguish two recent NLP approaches to meaning change analysis. On the one hand, coarse-grained trend analyses com- pare the semantics of a word in one time pe- riod with the meaning of the word in the preced- ing time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Jatowt and Duh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kulkarni et al., 2015a</ref>). Such coarse-grained mod- els, by themselves, do not specify in which re- spects a word has changed (e.g., semantic broad- ening or narrowing), but just aim at capturing whether meaning change has occurred. In con- trast, more fine-grained analyses typically sense- label word occurrences in corpora and then in- vestigate changes in the corresponding meaning distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rohrdantz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mitra et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Plitz et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al., 2015</ref>). Sense-labeling may be achieved by clustering of the context vectors of words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Neelakantan et al., 2014</ref>) or by applying LDA-based techniques where word con- texts take the roles of documents and word senses take the roles of topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rohrdantz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lau et al., 2012</ref>). Finally, there are studies that test particular meaning change hypotheses such as whether similar words tend to diverge in mean- ing over time (according to the 'law of differentia- tion') ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xu and Kemp, 2015)</ref> and papers that intend to detect corresponding terms across time (words with similar meanings/roles in two time periods but potentially different lexical forms) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al., 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Graph models</head><p>Let V = {w 1 , . . . , w |V | } be the common vocabu- lary (intersection) of all words in all time periods t ∈ T . Here, T is a set of time indices. Denote an embedding of a word w i at time period t as w i (t) ∈ R d . Since embeddings w i (s), w i (t) for two different time periods s, t are generally not comparable, as they may lie in different coordi- nate systems, we consider the vectors˜wvectors˜ vectors˜w i (t) = sim(w i (t), w 1 (t)), . . . , sim(w i (t), w |V | (t))</p><p>, <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> each of which lies in R |V | and where sim is a similarity function such as the cosine. We note that our structuralist definition of˜wof˜ of˜w i (t) is not un- problematic, since the vectors w 1 (t), . . . , w |V | (t) tend to be different across t, by our very postu- late, so that there is non-identity of these 'refer- ence points' over time. However, as we may as- sume that the meanings of at least a few words are stable over time, we strongly expect the vec- tors˜wtors˜ tors˜w i (t) to be suitable for our task of analysis of meaning changes. 1 For the remainder of this work, for convenience, we do not distinguish, in terms of notation, between w i (t) and˜wand˜ and˜w i (t).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">A linear model of semantic change</head><p>We postulate, and subsequently test, the follow- ing model of meaning dynamics which describes meaning change over time for words w i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w i (t) = p n=1 w j ∈V ∩N (w i ) α n w j w j (t − n) (2)</formula><p>where α n w j ∈ R, for n = 1, . . . , p, are coeffi- cients of meaning vectors w j (t − n) and p ≥ 1 is the order of the model. The set N (w i ) ⊆ V de- notes a set of 'neighbors' of word w i . <ref type="bibr">2</ref> This model says that the meaning of a word w i at some time t is determined by reference to the meanings of its 'neighbors' in previous time periods, and that the underlying functional relationship is linear.</p><p>We remark that the model described by Eq. (2) is a time-series model, and, in particular, a vector-autoregressive (VAR) model with special structure. The model may also be seen in the socio-economic context of so-called "opin- ion dynamic models" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Golub and Jackson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acemoglu and Ozdaglar, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eger, 2016)</ref>. There it is assumed that agents are situated in network structures and continuously update their opinions/beliefs/actions according to their ties with other agents. Model (2) substitutes multi-dimensional embedding vectors for one- dimensional opinions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Time-indexed self-similarity graphs</head><p>We track meaning change by considering a fully connected graph G(w) for each word w in V . The nodes of G(w) are the time indices T , and there is an undirected link between any two s, t ∈ T whose weight is given by sim(w(s), w(t)). We call the graphs G(w) time-indexed self-similarity (TISS) graphs because they indicate the (seman- tic) similarity of a given word with itself across different time periods. Particular interest may lie in weak links in these graphs as they indicate low similarity between two different time periods, i.e., semantic change across time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Data As corpus for English, we use the Corpus of Historical American (COHA). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This covers texts from the time period 1810 to 2000. We extract two slices: the years 1900-2000 and 1810-2000. For both slices, each time period t is one decade, e.g., T = {1810, 1820, 1830, . . .}. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For each slice, we only keep words associated to the word classes nouns, adjectives, and verbs. For computational and estimation purposes, we also only consider words that occur at least 100 times in each time period. To induce word embeddings w ∈ R d for each word w ∈ V , we use word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>) with default parametrizations. We do so for each time period t ∈ T independently. We then use these embeddings to derive the new em- beddings as in Eq. (1). Throughout, we use cosine similarity as sim measure. For German, we con- sider a proprietary dataset of the German newspa- per SZ 5 for which T = {1994, 1995, . . . , 2003}.</p><p>We lemmatize and POS tag the data and likewise only consider nouns, verbs and adjectives, mak- ing the same frequency constraints as in English. Finally, we use the PL (Migne, 1855) as data set for Latin. Here, T = {300, 400, . . . , 1300}. We use the same preprocessing, frequency, and word class constraints as for English and German.</p><p>Throughout, our datasets are well-balanced in terms of size. For example, the English COHA datasets contain about 24M-30M tokens for each decade from 1900 to 2000, where the decades 1990 and 2000 contain slighly more data than the earlier decades. The pre-1900 decades contain 18- 24M tokens, with only the decades 1810 and 1820 containing very little data (1M and 7M tokens, respectively). The corpora are also balanced by genre.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">TISS graphs</head><p>We start with investigating the TISS graphs. Let   The values D t 0 as a function of t 0 are aver- ages over all words. Thus, it might be possible that the average word's meaning decays linearly in time, while the semantic behavior, over time, of a large fraction of words follows different trends. To investigate this, we consider the distribution of</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D t 0 (w) = 1 C ′ |s−t|=t 0 sim(w(s), w(t)) over fixed words w. Here C ′ = |{(s, t) | |s − t| = t 0 }|.</formula><p>We consider the regression models</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D t 0 (w) = α · t 0 + const.</formula><p>for each word w independently and assess the dis- tribution of coefficients α as well as the goodness- of-fit values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows -exemplarily for the English 1900-2000 COHA data -that the co- efficients α are negative for almost all words. In fact, the distribution is left-skewed with a mean of around −0.4%. Moreover, the linear model is always a good to very good fit of the data in that R 2 values are centered around 85% and rarely fall below 75%. We find similar patterns for all other datasets considered here. This shows that not only the average word's meaning decays linearly, but almost all words' (whose frequency mass exceeds a particular threshold) semantics behaves this way.</p><p>Next, we use our TISS graphs for the task of finding words that have undergone meaning change. To this end, we sort the graphs G(w) by the ratios R G(w) = maxlink minlink , where maxlink de- notes maximal weight of a link in graph G(w) and minlink is the minimal weight of a link in graph G(w). We note that weak links may indi- cate semantic change, but the stated ratio requires that 'weakness' is seen relative to the strongest se- mantic links in the TISS graphs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>  selected words that have highest values R G(w) . <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We omit a fine-grained semantic change analysis, bush (1), web (2), alan (3), implement (4) jeff (5), gay (6), program (7), film (8), focus (9), terrific (16), axis (36)  <ref type="bibr">1900-2000.</ref> In brackets are the ranks of words, i.e., bush has the highest value R G(w) , web the 2nd highest, etc. which could be conducted via the methods out- lined in §2, but notice a few cases. 'Terrific' has a large semantic discrepancy between the 1900s and the 1970s, when the word probably (had) changed from a negative to a more positive meaning. The largest discrepancy for 'web' is between the 1940s and the 2000s, when it probably came to be mas- sively used in the context of the Internet. The high R G(w) value for w = 'axis' derives from compar- ing its use in the 1900s with its use in the 1940s, when it probably came to be used in the context of Nazi Germany and its allies. We notice that the presented method can account for gradual, accu- mulating change, which is not possible for models that compare two succeeding time points such as the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kulkarni et al. (2015a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Meaning dynamics network models</head><p>Finally, we estimate meaning dynamics models as in Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, i.e., we estimate the coefficients α n w j from our data sources. We let the neighbors N (w) of a word w as in Eq. (2) be the union (w.r.t. t) over sets N t (w; n) denoting the n ≥ 1 semantically most similar words (estimated by cosine similar- ity on the original word2vec vectors) of word w in time period t ∈ T . <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, we indicate two measures: adjusted R 2 , which indicates the goodness-of-fit of a model, and prediction error. By prediction error, we measure the average Eu- clidean distance between the true semantic vec- tor of a word in the final time period t N vs. the predicted semantic vector, via the linear model in Eq. (2), estimated on the data excluding the fi- nal period. The indicated prediction error is the average over all words. We note the following: R 2 values are high (typically above 95%), indi- cating that the linear semantic change model we have suggested fits the data well. Moreover, R 2 values slightly increase between order p = 1 and p = 2; however, for prediction error this trend is reversed. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We also include a strong baseline that claims that word meanings do not change in the fi- nal period t N but are the same as in t N −1 . We note that the order p = 1 model consistently improves upon this baseline, by as much as 18%, depending upon parameter settings.</p><p>Negative relationships Another very interest-   ing aspect of the model in Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> is that it allows for detecting words w j whose embeddings have negative coefficients α w j for a target word w i (we consider p = 1 in the remainder). Such nega- tive coefficients may be seen as instantiations of the 'law of differentiation': the two words' mean- ings move, over time, in opposite directions in se- mantic space. We find significantly negative re- lationships between the following words, among others: summit ↔ foot, boy ↔ woman, vow ↔ belief, negro ↔ black. Instead of a detailed anal- ysis, we mention that the Wikipedia entry for the last pair indicates that the meanings of 'negro' and 'black' switched roles between the early and late 20 th century. While 'negro' was once the "neu- tral" term for the colored population in the US, it acquired negative connotations after the 1960s; and vice versa for 'black'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Concluding remarks</head><p>We suggested two novel models of semantic change. First, TISS graphs allow for detecting gradual, non-consecutive meaning change. They enable to detect statistical trends of a possibly general nature. Second, our time-series models allow for investigating negative trends in mean- ing change ('law of differentiation') as well as forecasting into the future, which we leave for fu- ture work. Both models hint at a linear behav- ior of semantic change, which deserves further in- vestigation. We note that this linearity concerns the core vocabulary of languages (in our case, words that occurred at least 100 times in each time period), and, in the case of TISS graphs, is an average result; particular words may have dras- tic, non-linear meaning changes across time (e.g., proper names referring to entirely different enti- ties). However, our analysis also finds that most core words' meanings decay linearly in time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>D t 0 represent how semantically similar a word is across two time periods, on average, when the distance between time periods is t 0 : D t 0 = 1 C w∈V |s−t|=t 0 sim(w(s), w(t)), where C = |V | · |{(s, t) | |s − t| = t 0 }| is a normalizer.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> An alternative to our second-order embeddings is to project vectors from different time periods in a common space (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Faruqui and Dyer, 2014), which requires to find corresponding terms across time. Further, one could also consider a &apos;core&apos; vocabulary of semantically stable words, e.g., in the spirit of Swadesh (1952), instead of using all vocabulary words as reference. 2 We also constrain the vectors wi(t), for all wi ∈ V , to contain non-zero entries only for words in N (wi).</note>
