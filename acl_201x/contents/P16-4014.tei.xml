				<p>Current education standards in the U.S. require school students to read and understand complex texts from different subject areas (e.g., social studies). However, such texts usually contain figurative language, complex phrases and sentences, as well as unfamiliar discourse relations. This may present an obstacle to students whose native language is not English-a growing sub-population in the US. 1 One way to help such students is to create classroom activities centered around linguistic elements found in subject area texts (DelliCarpini, 2008). We present a web-based tool that uses NLP algorithms to automatically generate customizable linguistic activities that are grounded in language learning research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Recent educational standards adopted by several states in the U.S. (CCSSO, 2010) explicitly em- phasize the need for students to read progressively more complex texts in different subject areas, to prepare for college and careers. However, to accom- plish this, learners need to have a grasp of linguistic features related to vocabulary, word senses, figura- tive language, English conventions, and discourse structures.</p><p>English language learners (ELLs) generally struggle to acquire English language skills: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. These learners could be disadvantaged further if there were simply an increase in the complexity of texts without con- current scaffolding to help them with the demands likely to enter the curriculum as a result of the new Standards ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coleman and Goldenberg, 2012)</ref>. This suggests the need for subject area teachers to incorporate a more linguistically-based approach to support content comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Christie, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Christie, 1999</ref>). Yet, teachers often lack the train- ing necessary to identify English language features that may challenge diverse groups of ELLs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Slavin and Cheung, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Walqui and Heritage, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present Language Muse, an open-access, web-based tool that can address these needs. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Specifically, Language Muse can help subject area teachers support ELLs by automat- ically generating customizable activities derived from actual texts used in their classrooms. The activities are generated using several existing NLP algorithms and are designed to help ELLs with mul- tiple aspects of language learning needed to support content comprehension: vocabulary, grammatical structures, and discourse &amp; text organization.</p><p>Although Language Muse is related to existing work in the NLP literature on automatic question generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mitkov and Ha, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heilman and Smith, 2010)</ref>, it can generate multiple activities for teachers' own texts, cover a significantly larger set of language constructs, and offer teachers much more customizability.</p><p>In subsequent sections, we first provide a de- scription of the Language Muse NLP. Next, we describe how teachers interact with the backend and create activities. Finally, we present the results of a survey conducted with actual ELL teachers, and conclude with future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">NLP Backend</head><p>Language Muse relies on a backend that uses NLP techniques and resources to identify a variety of linguistic features contained in an input text. The features being identified can be categorized as: (a) lexical entities (single word and multi-word expres- sions), (b) syntactic structure, and (c) rhetorical Generated using an algorithm that first over-generates variants using rules and then filters using co-occurrence statistics computed over Gigaword. Synonyms Generated using a thresholded combination of WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fellbaum, 1998</ref>), a distributional thesaurus <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lin, 1998)</ref>, and SMT-based paraphrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005</ref>). Antonyms Generated using WordNet. Homonyms Generated using a manually-created list ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burstein et al., 2004</ref>).</p><p>(b) Syntactic Structure Note: All modules below use regular expressions on constituency parses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relative Clauses</head><p>Sentences containing an explicit relative clause.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1+ Clauses</head><p>Sentences containing 1 independent clause and &gt;= 1 one dependent clause. Note that this can also include sentences with relative clauses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complex NPs</head><p>Noun phrases with a hyphenated adjective or a prepositional phrase modifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complex Verbs</head><p>Verb phrases with &gt;= 2 verb forms, e.g., will have gone, plans to leave (c) Rhetorical and Discourse Relations Note: All modules below use an adapted rule-based discourse analyzer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burstein et al., 1998</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cause-Effect</head><p>Terms indicating a cause-effect relation between text segments, e.g., "</p><p>The discovery of fossils of tropical plants in Antarctica led to the hypothesis that . . . " Compare-Contrast Terms indicating a comparison or contrast between text segments, e.g., "He was a wise and patient leader; however, his son . . . " Evidence &amp; Details Terms indicating specific evidence or details between text segments, e.g., "Re- cent theories, such as the influence of plate tectonics on the movement of continents, have . . . " <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: The inventory of features provided by the backend NLP engine in Language Muse. and discourse relations. Before we describe each category in detail, it is important to note that since the primary use case for Language Muse is to help teachers plan appropriate classroom activities for ELLs, it is important for the automatically gener- ated activities to be as accurate as possible. There- fore, for many of the features, we rely on manually crafted resources, either directly or indirectly as a filter for a noisier statistical approach. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the linguistic features that our system can identify in the three aforementioned categories and provides a brief description of the backend module is used to generate it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Activity Generation</head><p>In this section, we describe how users interact with Language Muse, i.e., how they can automatically generate linguistic activities for any text and cus- tomize them to their own liking. Language Muse is completely free to use for all teachers. Teachers request an account using the form on the web site and receive their login information via email.</p><p>Once a teacher logs into Language Muse, she can get started either by choosing one of the 33 texts that we provide across three different content areas (English Language Arts, Science, and So- cial Studies), or by uploading her own classroom text (in plain text/.doc/.docx formats). The system currently limits the texts to 5000 words. All texts uploaded by a teacher are saved into her personal library for later re-use.</p><p>The text is then sent to the NLP backend for pro- cessing, which returns a JSON object containing all identified (or generated) linguistic features. At that point, the teacher can generate any of the avail- able linguistic activities, each of which is based on one of the linguistic features. All activities were designed based on input from ELL content-area teachers. There are a total of 24 activities, grouped according to whether an activity is word-based, sentence-based, or paragraph-based. This form of hierarchical grouping is based on ELL litera- ture which suggests that each level in the hierarchy presents distinct challenges and opportunities for language learning. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows a few of the available activities and provides a brief description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Recommended Activities</head><p>Based on the number of feature instances detected by the backend, Language Muse may recommend certain activities over others to the teacher. For example, if there were more words with synonyms but only a few cause-effect terms, it might recom- mend the Synonyms in Paragraphs activity but not the Cause/Effect Relationships activity. Some ac- tivities may also be unavailable since no instances of the corresponding linguistic feature could be detected by the backend. Language Muse makes a visual distinction between recommended activi- ties, possible activities, and unavailable activities as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Clicking on an activity shows its description and a sample question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Same Feature, Multiple Activities</head><p>Some activities are based on the same underlying linguistic feature but use it differently, depending on their level. For example, a word-level activity asks students to match words in one list to words in another list based on how similar they are in meaning. That activity uses automatically gener- ated synonyms for the words in the text and then automatically populates the two lists -one with the original words and the other with the generated synonyms. There is a similar paragraph-level cloze activity that shows students a paragraph from the text and asks them to replace pre-identified words with their synonyms such that the meaning is un- changed. This activity uses the same underlying feature -automatically generated synonyms - but presents it differently. This exposes ELLs to a different part of the language construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Automatically-generated Answers</head><p>The questions for all activities are automatically generated based on linguistic features in the text. However, for 15 of those activities, Language Muse also automatically populates an answer key for the teacher. For example, for the word-based syn- onym activity described in §3.2, we know which pairs of words in the two lists match each other since the synonyms were automatically generated. Automatically-generated answers reduce the time that a teacher needs to edit an activity for her class- room. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> for additional examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Customizability</head><p>It is impossible for Language Muse to always pro- vide exactly what every teacher is looking for. Therefore, almost all aspects of the activities it gen- erates can be customized to suit a teacher's needs. Among other things, the teacher can choose to:</p><p>• edit the instructions shown to the students, • hide any or all automatically chosen words/sentences/paragraphs, Sentence activities Multiple Clause Sentences. Shows multi-clause sentences and asks students to break them up into two or more shorter sentences. Although the sentences for the activity are identified automatically in the text, the answers are not generated automatically. Example: Organelles are structures visible within a cell that have their own structure. ⇒ (1) Organelles are structures visible within a cell. (2) Organelles have their own structure. Cause/Effect Relationships. Shows sentences containing causal relationships and asks students to identify the cause, the effect, and the connector word that denotes the causal relationship. The sentences with causal relationships in the text are identified automatically but only the connector word part of the answer is automatically generated. Example: Off the coast of Canada, commercial cod fishing had to stop because the population of cod collapsed. ⇒ The population of cod collapsed off the coast of Canada (cause), Commercial cod fishing had to stop (effect), because (connector). Homonyms in Sentences. Shows sentences with blanks and asks students to fill in the right word from a list that contains homonyms as distractors. Examples can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Paragraph activities Variant Word Forms in Paragraphs. Uses inflectional and derivational word variants gener- ated by the backend. Shows students a paragraph of text with blanks and asks them to fill in the right morphological variant. Answers and distractors are automatically generated. Example: Scientists suspect that there are more than 10 million (different/difference) types of life forms on Earth. Phrasal Verbs. Asks students to pick the correct preposition to complete the phrasal verbs found in the paragraph. Answers and distractors are automatically generated. Example: People usually think (at/on/of) the heart, lungs and brain as vital organs.    • edit the automatically generated answers or add her own, and • edit the list of automatically generated distrac- tors for multiple choice questions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Teacher Survey</head><p>We wanted to evaluate whether activities generated by Language Muse are useful to teachers. To do this, we worked with seventeen 6th-8th grade teach- ers who taught English language arts, science, and social studies. Four teachers had been teaching for two years or less, five for 3-9 years, and the rest for &gt; 10 years. All but two currently had responsibil- ity for teaching ELLs and eight had been teaching ELLs for &gt; 5 years. We asked them to examine 9 different activities from Language Muse and tell us whether they would consider using them in their classrooms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the results of our sur- vey which are encouraging for a first version. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions &amp; Future Work</head><p>We presented Language Muse, an open-access, web-based tool that can help content-area teachers support ELL students with content comprehension. We are currently working on the next version which will allow students to log into Language Muse to complete any activities assigned to them by their teachers and also receive feedback. All develop- ment on Language Muse continues to be informed by frequent and detailed interactions with teachers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Activities where 5 or more questions can be generated are recommended by Language Muse and marked with a star.
