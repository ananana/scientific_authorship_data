				<p>Slot filling aims to extract the values (slot fillers) of specific attributes (slots types) for a given entity (query) from a large-scale corpus. Slot filling remains very challenging over the past seven years. We propose a simple yet effective unsuper-vised approach to extract slot fillers based on the following two observations: (1) a trigger is usually a salient node relative to the query and filler nodes in the dependency graph of a context sentence; (2) a relation is likely to exist if the query and candidate filler nodes are strongly connected by a relation-specific trigger. Thus we design a graph-based algorithm to automatically identify triggers based on per-sonalized PageRank and Affinity Propagation for a given (query, filler) pair and then label the slot type based on the identified triggers. Our approach achieves 11.6%-25% higher F-score over state-of-the-art English slot filling methods. Our experiments also demonstrate that as long as a few trigger seeds, name tagging and dependency parsing capabilities exist, this approach can be quickly adapted to any language and new slot types. Our promising results on Chinese slot filling can serve as a new benchmark.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The goal of the Text Analysis Conference Knowl- edge Base Population (TAC-KBP) Slot Filling (SF) task <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(McNamee and Dang, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ji et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ji et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Surdeanu and Ji, 2014</ref>) is to extract the values (fillers) of specific attributes (slot types) for a given entity (query) from a large- scale corpus and provide justification sentences to support these slot fillers. KBP defines 25 slot types for persons (e.g., spouse) and 16 slots for organizations (e.g., founder). For example, given a person query "Dominich Dunne" and slot type spouse, a SF system may extract a slot filler "Ellen Griffin" and its justification sentence E1 as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Slot filling remains a very challenging task. The two most successful state-of-the-art techniques are as follows.</p><p>(1) Supervised classification. Considering any pair of query and candidate slot filler as an instance, these approaches train a classifier from manually labeled data through active learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angeli et al., 2014b</ref>) or noisy labeled data through distant supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angeli et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Surdeanu et al., 2010)</ref> to predict the existence of a specific relation between them.</p><p>(2) Pattern matching. These approaches extract and generalize lexical and syntactic patterns auto- matically or semi-automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hong et al., 2014</ref>). They usually suffer from low recall due to nu- merous different ways to express a certain relation type ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Surdeanu and Ji, 2014</ref>). For example, none of the top-ranked patterns ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2012</ref>) based on dependency paths in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> can capture the spouse slot in E1.   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Dependency patterns for slot spouse.</p><p>Both of the previous methods have poor porta- bility to a new language or a new slot type. Furthermore, both methods focus on the flat re- lation representation between the query and the candidate slot filler, while ignoring the global graph structure among them and other facts in the context.</p><p>When multiple facts about a person entity are presented in a sentence, the author (e.g., a news reporter or a discussion forum poster) often uses explicit trigger words or phrases to indicate their relations with the entity. As a result, these inter- dependent facts and query entities are strongly connected via syntactic or semantic relations.</p><p>Many slot types, especially when the queries are person entities, are indicated by such triggers. We call these slots trigger-driven slots. In this paper, we define a trigger as the smallest extent of a text which most clearly indicates a slot type. For example, in E1, "divorced" is a trigger for spouse while "died" is a trigger for death-related slots.</p><p>Considering the limitations of previous flat rep- resentations for the relations between a query (Q) and a candidate slot filler (F ), we focus on analyz- ing the whole dependency tree structure that con- nects Q, F and other semantically related words or phrases in each context sentence. Our main observation is that there often exists a trigger word (T ) which plays an important role in connecting Q and F in the dependency tree for trigger-driven slots. From the extended dependency tree shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we can clearly see that "divorced" is most strongly connected to the query mention ("he") and the slot filler ("Ellen Griffin Dunne"). Therefore we can consider it as a trigger word which explicitly indicates a particular slot type.</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose a novel and effective unsupervised graph mining approach for person slot filling by deeply explor- ing the structures of dependency trees. It consists of the following three steps:</p><p>• Step 1 -Candidate Relation Identification:</p><p>Construct an extended dependency tree for each sentence including any mention referring to the query entity. Identify candidate slot fillers based on slot type constraints (e.g., the spouse fillers are limited to person entities) (Section 2).</p><p>• Step 2 -Trigger Identification: Measure the importance of each node in the extended depen- dency tree relative to Q and F , rank them and select the most important ones as the trigger set (Section 3).</p><p>• Step 3 -Slot Typing: For any given new slot type, automatically expand a few trigger seeds using the Paraphrase Database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013</ref>). Then we use the expanded trigger set to label the slot types of identified triggers (Section 4).</p><p>This framework only requires name tagging and dependency parsing as pre-processing, and a few trigger seeds as input, and thus it can be easily adapted to a new language or a new slot type. Experiments on English and Chinese demonstrate that our approach dramatically advances state-of- the-art results for both pre-defined KBP slot types and new slot types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Candidate Relation Identification</head><p>We first present how to build an extended de- pendency graph for each evidence sentence (Sec- tion 2.1) and generate query and filler candidate mentions (Section 2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Extended Dependency Tree Construction</head><p>Given a sentence containing N words, we con- struct an undirected graph G = (V, E), where V = {v 1 , . . . , v N } represents the words in a sentence, E is an edge set, associated with each edge e ij representing a dependency relation be- tween v i and v j . We first apply a dependency parser to generate basic uncollapsed dependencies by ignoring the direction of edges. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the dependency tree built from the example sentence. In addition, we annotate an entity, time or value mention node with its type. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, "Ellen Griffin Dunne" is annotated as a person, and "1997" is annotated as a year. Finally we perform co-reference resolution, which introduces implicit links between nodes that refer to the same entity. We replace any nominal or pronominal entity mention with its coreferential name mention. For example, "he" is replaced by "Dominick Dunne" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Formally, an extended dependency tree is an annotated tree of entity mentions, phrases and their links.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Query Mention and Filler Candidate Identification</head><p>Given a query q and a set of relevant documents, we construct a dependency tree for each sentence. We identify a person entity e as a query mention if e matches the last name of q or e shares two or more tokens with q. For example, "he/Dominick Dunne" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is identified as a mention referring to the query Dominick Dunne. For each sentence which contains at least one query men- tion, we regard all other entities, values and time expressions as candidate fillers and generate a set of entity pairs (q, f ), where q is a query mention, and f is a candidate filler. In Example E1, we can extract three entity pairs (i.e., {Dominick Dunne} × {Ellen <ref type="bibr">Griffin Dunne, 1997</ref>). For each entity pair, we represent the query mention and the filler candidate as two sets of nodes Q and F respectively, where Q, F ⊆ V .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Trigger Identification</head><p>In this section, we proceed to introduce an unsu- pervised graph-based method to identify triggers for each query and candidate filler pair. We rank all trigger candidates (Section 3.1) and then keep the top ones as the trigger set (Section 3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Trigger Candidate Ranking</head><p>As we have discussed in Section 1, we can con- sider trigger identification problem as finding the important nodes relative to Q and F in G. Al- gorithms such as Pagerank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Page et al., 1999</ref>) are designed to compute the global importance of each node relative to all other nodes in a graph. By redefining the importance according to our preference toward F and Q, we can extend PageRank to generate relative importance scores. We use the random surfer model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Page et al., 1999</ref>) to explain our motivation. Suppose a ran- dom surfer keeps visiting adjacent nodes in G at random. The expected percentage of surfers visiting each node converges to the PageRank s- core. We extend PageRank by introducing a "back probability" β to determine how often surfers jump back to the preferred nodes (i.e., Q or F ) so that the converged score can be used to estimate the relative probability of visiting these preferred nodes.</p><p>Given G and a set of preferred nodes R where R ⊆ V , we denote the relative importance for all v ∈ V with respect to R as I(v | R), following the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">White and Smyth (2003)</ref>.</p><p>For a node v k , we denote N (k) as the set of neighbors of v k . We use π(k), the k-th com- ponent of the vector π, to denote the stationary distribution of v k where 1 ≤ k ≤ |V |. We define a preference vector p R = {p 1 , ..., p |V | } such that the probabilities sum to 1, and p k denotes the relative importance attached to v k . p k is set to 1/|R| for v k ∈ R, otherwise 0. Let A be the matrix corresponding to the graph G where A jk = 1/|N (k)| and A jk = 0 otherwise.</p><p>For a given p R , we can obtain the personalized PageRank equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Jeh and Widom, 2003</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">π = (1 − β)Aπ + βp R (1)</formula><p>where β ∈ [0, 1] determines how often surfers jump back to the nodes in R. We set β = 0.3 in our experiment. The solution π to Equation 1 is a steady-state importance distribution induced by p R . Based on a theorem of Markov Theory, a solution π with |V | k=1 π(k) = 1 always exists and is unique <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Motwani and Raghavan, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>We define relative importance scores based on the personalized ranks described above, i.e., I(v | R) = π(v) after convergence, and we compute the importance scores for all the nodes in V relative to Q and F respectively.</p><p>A query mention in a sentence is more likely to be involved in multiple relations while a filler is usually associated with only one slot type. Therefore we combine two relative importance scores by assigning a higher priority to I(v | F ) as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I(v | {Q, F }) = I(v | F ) + I(v | F ) · I(v | Q)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We discard a trigger candidate if it is (or part of) an entity which can only act as a query or a slot filler. We assume a trigger can only be a noun, verb, adjective, adverb or preposition. In addition, verbs, nouns and adjectives are more informative to be triggers. Thus, we remove any trigger candi- date v if it has a higher I(v | {Q, F }) than the first top-ranked verb/noun/adjective trigger candidate.</p><p>For example, we rank the candidate triggers based on the query and slot filler pair ("Dominick Dunne", "Ellen Griffin Dunne") as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure</ref>   <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Importance scores of trigger candidates relative to query and filler in E1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Trigger Candidate Selection</head><p>Given Q and F , we can obtain a relative im- portance score I(v | {Q, F }) for each candidate trigger node v in V as shown in Section 3.1.</p><p>We denote the set of trigger candidates as T = {t 1 , · · · , t n } where n ≤ |V |.</p><p>Since a relation can be indicated by a single trigger word, a trigger phrase or even multiple non-adjacent trigger words, it is difficult to set a single threshold even for one slot type. Instead, we aim to automatically classify top ranked candi- dates into one group (i.e., a trigger set) so that they all have similar higher scores compared to other candidates.</p><p>Therefore, we define this problem as a clus- tering task. We mainly consider clustering algo- rithms which do not require pre-specified number of clusters.</p><p>We apply the affinity propagation approach to take as input a collection of real-valued similarity scores between pairs of candidate triggers. Real- valued messages are exchanged between candi- date triggers until a high-quality set of exemplars (centers of clusters), and corresponding clusters gradually emerges <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Frey and Dueck, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>There are two kinds of messages exchanged between candidate triggers: one is called responsi- bility γ(i, j), sent from t i to a candidate exemplar t j ; the other is availability α(i, j), sent from the candidate exemplar t j to t i .</p><p>The calculation of each procedure iterates until convergence. To begin with, the availabilities are initialized to zero: α(i, j) = 0. Then the responsibilities are computed using the following rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">γ(i, j) ← s(i, j) − max j s.t.j =j {α(i, j ) + s(i, j )}<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the similarity score s(i, j) indicates how well t j is suited to be the exemplar for t i . Whereas the above responsibility update lets all candidate exemplars compete for the ownership of a trig- ger candidate t i , the following availability update gathers evidence from trigger candidates as to whether each candidate exemplar would make a good exemplar:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">α(i, j) ← min 0, γ(j, j) + i s.t.i / ∈{i,j} max{0, γ(i , j)}<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Given T , we can generate an n × n affinity matrix M which serves as the input of the affinity propagation. M ij represents the negative squared difference in relative importance score between t i and t j (Equation 5).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Mij = −(I(i | {Q, F }) − I(j | {Q, F })) 2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We compute the average importance score for all the clusters after convergence and keep the one with the highest average score as the trigger set. For example, given the query and slot filler pair in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, we obtain trigger candidates T = {died, divorced, f rom, in, in} and their corresponding relative importance scores. After the above clustering, we obtain three clusters and choose the cluster {divorced} with the highest average relative importance score (0.128) as the trigger set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Slot Type Labeling</head><p>In this section, we will introduce how to label the slot type for an identified relation tuple (Q, T, F ). The simplest solution is to match T against exist- ing trigger gazetteers for certain types of slots. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows how we label the relation as a spouse slot type. In fact, some trigger gazetteers have already been constructed by previous work such as ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yu et al., 2015)</ref>. However, manual construction of these triggers heavily rely upon labeled training data and high-quality patterns, which would be unavailable for a new language or a new slot type.</p><note type="other">E1: Ellen Griffin Dunne, from whom he was divorced in 1965, died in 1997. Ellen Griffin Dunne Dominick Dunne Person | Filler Person | Query divorced wife husband divorce marry … Trigger Gazetteer for</note><p>Inspired by the trigger-based event extraction work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bronstein et al., 2015)</ref>, we propose to ex- tract trigger seeds from the slot filling annotation guideline 1 and then expand them by paraphrasing techniques. For each slot type we manually select two trigger seeds from the guideline and then use the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pavlick et al., 2015</ref>) to expand these seeds. Specifically, we select top-20 lexical paraphrases based on similarity scores as our new triggers for each slot type. Some examples are shown in  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Filler Validation</head><p>After we label each relation tuple, we perform the following validation steps to filter noise and remove redundancy. For many slot types, there are some specific constraints on entity types of slot fillers defined in the task specification. For ex- ample, employee or member of fillers should be either organizations or geopolitical entities, while family slots (e.g., spouse and children) expect person entities. We apply these constraints to further validate all relation tuples. Moreover, single-value slots can only have a single filler (e.g., date of birth), while list- value slots can take multiple fillers (e.g., cities of residence). However, we might extract conflicting relation tuples from multiple sentences and sources. For each relation tuple, it can also be extracted from multiple sentences, and thus it may receive multiple relative importance scores. We aim to keep the most reliable relation tuple for a single-value slot.</p><p>For a single-value slot, suppose we have a collection of relation tuples R which share the same query. Given r ∈ R with a set of relative importance scores I = {i 1 , i 2 , · · · , i n }, we can regard the average score of I as the credibility score of r. The reason is that the higher the relative importance score, the more likely the tuple is to be correct. In our experiments, we use the weighted arithmetic mean as follows so that higher scores can contribute more to the final average:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">¯ i = n k=1 w k · i k n k=1 w k<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where w k denotes the non-negative weight of i k . When we regard the weight w k equal to the score i k , Equation 6 can be simplified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">¯ i = n k=1 w 2 k n k=1 w k<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We calculate the weighted mean ¯ i for each r ∈ R and keep the relation tuple with the highest ¯ i.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Data and Scoring Metric</head><p>In order to evaluate the quality of our proposed framework and its portability to  We only test our method on 18 trigger-driven person slot types shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. Some other slot types (e.g., age, origin, religion and title) do not rely on lexical triggers in most cases; instead the query mention and the filler are usually adjacent or seperated by a comma. In addition, we do not deal with the two remaining trigger- driven person slot types (i.e., cause of death and charges) since these slots often expect other types of concepts (e.g., a disease or a crime phrase).</p><p>We use the official TAC-KBP slot filling eval- uation scoring metrics: Precision (P ), Recall (R) and F-score (F 1 ) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ji et al., 2010</ref>) to evaluate our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">English Slot Filling</head><p>We apply Stanford CoreNLP ( ) for English part-of-speech (POS) tagging, name tagging, time expression extraction, depen- dency parsing and coreference resolution. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> we compare our approach with two state- of-the-art English slot filling methods: a distant supervision method ( ) and a hy- brid method that combines distant and partial su- pervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angeli et al., 2014b</ref>). Our method out- performs both methods dramatically. KBP2015 English cold start slot filling is a task which combines entity mention extraction and slot fil- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Surdeanu and Ji, 2014</ref>  is significantly better than state-of-the-art ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angeli et al., 2015)</ref> on the same set of news documents <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 4</ref>). Compared to the previous work, our method discards a trigger-driven relation tuple if it is not supported by triggers. For example, "Poland" is mistakenly extracted as the country of residence of "Mandelbrot" by distant supervision ) from the following sentence:</p><p>A professor emeritus at Yale University, Man- delbrot was born in Poland but as a child moved with his family to France where he was educated. maybe because the relation tuple (Mandelbrot, live in, Poland) indeed exists in external knowl- edge bases. Given the same entity pair, our method identifies "born" as the trigger word and labels the slot type as country of birth.</p><p>When there are several triggers indicating d- ifferent slot types in a sentence, our approach performs better in associating each trigger with the filler it dominates by analyzing the whole dependency tree. For example, given a sentence:</p><p>Haig is survived by his wife of 60 years, Patri- cia; his children Alexander, Brian and Barbara; eight grandchildren; and his brother, the Rev. Francis R. Haig.</p><p>(Haig, sibling, Barbara) is the only relation tuple extracted from the above sentence by the previous method. Given the entity pair (Haig, Bar- bara), the relative importance score of "children" (0.1) is higher than the score of "brother" (0.003), and "children" is kept as the only trigger candidate after clustering. Therefore, we extract the tuple (Haig, children, Barbara) instead. In addition, we successfully identify the missing fillers for other slot types: spouse (Patricia), children (Alexander, Brian and Barbara) and siblings (Francis R. Haig) by identifying their corresponding triggers.</p><p>In addition, flat relation representations fail to extract the correct relation (i.e., alternate names) between "Dandy Don" and "Meredith" since "brother" is close to both of them in the following sentence:</p><p>In high school and at Southern Methodist U- niversity, where, already known as Dandy Don (a nickname bestowed on him by his brother) , Meredith became an all-American.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Adapting to New Slot Types</head><p>Our framework can also be easily adapted to new slot types. We evaluate it on three new person list-value slot types: friends, colleagues and collaborators.</p><p>We use "friend" as the slot-specific trigger for the slot friends and "colleague" for the slot col- leagues. "collaborate", "cooperate" and "part- ner" are used to type the slot collaborators.</p><p>We manually annotate ground truth for evalua- tion. It is difficult to find all the correct fillers for a given query from millions of documents. There- fore, we only calculate precision. Experiments show we can achieve 56.3% for friends, 100% for colleagues and 60% for collaborators (examples shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Impact of Trigger Mining</head><p>In Section 3.2, we keep top-ranked trigger can- didates based on clustering rather than threshold tuning. We explore a range of thresholds for comparison, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Our approach achieves 57.4% F-score, which is comparable to the highest F-score 58.1% obtained by threshold tuning.</p><p>We also measure the impact of the size of the trigger gazetteer. We already outperform state-of- the-art by using PPDB to expand triggers mined from guidelines as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref>. As the size of the trigger gazetteer increases, our method (marked with a ) achieves better performance.</p></div>

To explore the impact of the quality of annotation resources, we also use a Chinese language analysis tool: Language Technology Platform (LTP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Che et al., 2010)</ref>. We use the full set of Chinese trigger gazetteers published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yu et al. (2015)</ref>.

About 20% and 16% queries cannot be recognized by CoreNLP and LTP respectively. One reason is that many Chinese names are also common words.

Un- fortunately, a high-quality parser for a new lan- guage is often not available because of language- specific features. For example, in Chinese a single sentence about a person's biography often contains more than five co-ordinated clauses, each of which includes a trigger. Therefore a dependen- cy parser adapted from English often mistakenly identifies one of the triggers as a main predicate of the sentence.</p><p>In addition, Chinese is a very concise language.   Finally, compared to English, Chinese tends to have more variants for some types of triggers (e.g., there are at least 31 different titles for "wife"in Chinese). Some of them are implicit and require shallow inference. For example, "投奔"(to seek shelter or asylum) indicates a residence relation in most cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Besides the methods based on distant supervision (e.g., ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Surdeanu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angeli et al., 2014b)</ref>) discussed in Section 6.2, pattern-based methods have also been proven to be effective in SF in the past years <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yu et al., 2013)</ref>. Dependency-based patterns achieve better performance since they can capture long-distance relations. Most of these approaches assume that a relation exists between Q and F if there is a dependency path connecting Q and F and all the words on the path are equally regarded as trigger candidates. We explore the complete graph structure of a sentence rather than chains/subgraphs as in previous work. Our pre- vious research focused on identifying the relation between F and T by extracting filler candidates from the identified scope of a trigger (e.g., ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yu et al., 2015)</ref>). We found that each slot-specific trigger has its own scope, and corresponding fillers seldom appear outside its scope. We did not compare with results from this previous approach which did not consider redundancy removal re- quired in the official evaluations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Soderland et al. (2013)</ref> built their SF system based on Open Information Extraction (IE) tech- nology. Our method achieves much higher recall since dependency trees can capture the relations among query, slot filler and trigger in more com- plicated long sentences. In addition, our triggers are automatically labeled so that we do not need to design manual rules to classify relation phrases as in Open IE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of deep mining of dependency structures for slot filling. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art and can be rapidly portable to a new language or a new slot type, as long as there exists capabilities of name tagging, POS tagging, dependency parsing and trigger gazetteers.</p><p>In the future we aim to label slot types based on contextual information as well as sentence structures instead of trigger gazetteers only. There are two primary reasons. First, a trigger can serve for multiple slot types. For example, slot children and its inverse slot parents share a subset of triggers. Second, a trigger word can have multiple different meanings. For example, a sibling trigger word "sister" can also represent a female member of a religious community. We attempt to combine multi-prototype approaches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Reisinger and Mooney, 2010)</ref>) to better disambiguate senses of trigger words.</p><p>Besides considering the cross-sentence conflict- s, we also want to investigate the within-sentence conflicts caused by the competition of triggers. A trigger identified by our approach is the most important node in the dependency tree relative to the given entity pair. However, this trigger might be more important to another entity pair, which shares the same filler, in the same sentence. A promising solution is to rank all the entities in the sentence based on their importance relative to the identified trigger and the filler candidate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Extended dependency tree for E1.</figDesc></figure>
