			<abstract>
				<p>Traditionally, compound splitters are evaluated intrinsically on gold-standard data or extrinsically on the task of statistical machine translation. We explore a novel way for the extrinsic evaluation of compound splitters, namely recognizing tex-tual entailment. Compound splitting has great potential for this novel task that is both transparent and well-defined. Moreover , we show that it addresses certain aspects that are either ignored in intrinsic evaluations or compensated for by task-internal mechanisms in statistical machine translation. We show significant improvements using different compound splitting methods on a German textual entailment dataset.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Closed compounding, i.e., the formation of a one- word unit composing several lexemes, is a com- mon linguistic phenomenon in several languages such as German, Dutch, Greek, and Finnish. The goal of compound splitting is to obtain the con- stituents of a compound to increase its semantic transparency. For example, for the German com- pound Apfelsaft 'apple 1 juice 2 ' the desired output of a compound splitter is Apfel 1 Saft 2 .</p><p>Intrinsic evaluation of compound splitting mea- sures the correctness of the determined split point ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Riedl and Biemann, 2016)</ref> and the resulting lem- mas by means of precision, recall, F 1 -score and accuracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Koehn and Knight (2003)</ref>). In ex- trinsic evaluation setups, compound splitting is applied to the input data of an external natural lan- guage processing (NLP) task that benefits from split compounds. As closed compounding intro- duces semantic opaqueness and vastly increases the vocabulary size of a language, many NLP tasks benefit from compound splitters. Still, previous work that evaluates compound splitting with ex- trinsic evaluation methods mostly focuses on sta- tistical machine translation (SMT) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Nießen and Ney (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Koehn and Knight (2003)</ref>). Some other external tasks such as information re- trieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1998</ref>) or speech recognition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Larson et al., 2000</ref>) have been shown to benefit from prior compound splitting, yet these works have not compared the extrinsic perfor- mance of different compound splitting methods.</p><p>Interestingly, the performance found in in- trinsic evaluations does not automatically propa- gate to performance in downstream evaluations as shown in <ref type="bibr">(Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010)</ref> for SMT, where oversplit compounds are simply learned as phrases <ref type="bibr">(Dyer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Weller et al., 2014</ref>). Over- splitting is an example of a feature that might not be measured in intrinsic evaluations, because some available gold standards contain positive ex- amples only <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ziering and van der Plas, 2016)</ref>. It is highly relevant to increase the number of extrin- sic tasks for the evaluation of compound splitting to be able to evaluate features that intrinsic evalu- ations and known extrinsic evaluations ignore.</p><p>In this paper we investigate the suitability of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) for the task of compound splitting, inspired by the fact that previous work in RTE underlined the potential benefits of compound splitting for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Zeller, 2016)</ref>. Textual Entailment (TE) is a directional relationship between an entailing text fragment T and an entailed hypothesis, H, saying that the meaning of T entails (or implies) the meaning of H. This relation holds if 'typically, a human, read- ing T, would infer that H is most likely true' <ref type="bibr">(Dagan et al., 2006</ref>). The following is an example of an entailing T-H pair:</p><p>T: Yoko Ono unveiled a bronze statue of her late husband, John Lennon. H: Yoko Ono is John Lennon's widow.</p><p>We opted for exploring the use of RTE as an ex- trinsic evaluation for compound splitting for three main reasons: first, in contrast to SMT systems, most RTE systems are less complex. In fact, we deliberately chose an RTE system that reaches good performance with a method that is transpar- ent, i.e., a method that allows for exploring the ef- fect of compounding. 1 It is not our goal to reach state-of-the-art performance for the RTE task. We aim to find a suitable alternative extrinsic eval- uation for compound splitting. Second, human agreement on the binary RTE decisions is very high, e.g., on the dataset used in our experiments, an average agreement rate of 87.8% with a κ level of 0.75 was reported ( <ref type="bibr">Giampiccolo et al., 2007)</ref>. Third, the potential benefits for RTE are large. According to <ref type="bibr">Zeller (2016, p. 182</ref>) the number of T/H pairs in their phenomenon-specific RTE dataset would rise by about 16 percentage points by compound splitting. In the dataset we use in our experiments, about three-quarters of the T-H pairs contain at least one closed compound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Relevance of Compound Splitting for RTE</head><p>The approach to RTE taken in this paper fol- lows the Lexical Overlap Hypothesis (LOH), which states that the higher the number of lex- ical matches between T and H, the more likely the T-H pair is entailing rather than non-entailing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Zeller, 2016)</ref>. In other words, H is more likely to be entailed by T if most of its lexical content also occurs in T. While this hypothesis is a simpli- fication of the TE problem, it has been shown to perform reasonably well for some datasets . We argue that the brittleness of the chosen LOH-based RTE system may actually be a strength in terms of evaluation, since it will penal- ize oversplitting more severely than, e.g., an RNN- based RTE system or a phrase-based MT method that can recover from systematic oversplitting by chunking the splits. Under the LOH, the problem caused by the opacity of closed compounds becomes evident. As shown in the example below, missing informa- tion on the constituents of closed compounds hin- ders the matching of words from T in H1. Con- versely, compound splitting also helps to detect non-entailing T-H pairs. By compound splitting, we increase the number of uncovered tokens in H2, which makes a non-entailment decision more likely 2 .</p><p>T: Kinder lieben Fruchtsäfte 1 aus¨Apfelnaus¨ aus¨Apfeln 2 'Chil- dren love fruit juices 1 made of apples 2 ' H1: Peters Sohn liebt Apfel 3 saft 4 'Peter's son loves apple 3 juice 4 ' H2: Peters Sohn liebt Apfel 5 kuchen 6 stückest¨stücke <ref type="bibr">7</ref> 'Peter's son loves pieces 7 of apple 5 pie 6 '</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Materials and Methods</head><p>In this section we explain the splitters and the RTE framework used in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Inspected Compound Splitters</head><p>Our proposed extrinsic evaluation approach for compound splitting is language-independent as we do not use any language-specific parameters. However, in the present work we test it on the most prominent closed-compounding language, German (Ziering and van der Plas, 2014). We in- spect the impact of three different types of auto- matic compound splitting 3 methods that follow a generate-and-rank principle, where the candidate splits are ranked according to the geometric mean of the constituents' frequencies in a given training corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Koehn and Knight, 2003)</ref>. FF2010 The compound splitter by Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) relies on the output of the German morphological analyzer SMOR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Schmid et al., 2004</ref>) to generate several plausible com- pound splits (e.g., due to word sense ambiguity).</p><p>WH2012 As an alternative method, we use the statistical approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Weller and Heid (2012)</ref> for German compound splitting. In- stead of using the knowledge-rich SMOR, it in- cludes an extensive list of hand-crafted transfor- mation rules that allows to map constituents to corpus lemmas (e.g., by truncating linking mor- phemes) to generate all possible splits with up to four constituents per compound. Moreover, mis- leading lemmas are removed from the training cor- pus using hand-crafted filters. ZvdP2016 Finally, the method using least language-specific knowledge was proposed by Ziering and van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Plas (2016)</ref>. Instead of us- ing a morphological analyzer or manually com- piling a hand-crafted list of rules, they recursively generate all possible binary splits by learning con- stituent transformations from regular inflection de- rived from a monolingual lemmatized corpus, e.g., the s-suffix in the case of a genitive marker is often used as linking morpheme. The recursion stops if a non-splitting (atomic) analysis is ranked highest.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">RTE Framework</head><p>We conduct our RTE experiments using the open- source Excitement Open Platform (EOP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Magnini et al., 2014)</ref>, which provides comprehensive implementations of algorithms and lexical resources for textual inference. We use the alignment-based algorithm P1EDA ( ) in all our experiments as it has been shown to be simple and transparent while yielding rela- tively good results. P1EDA is based on the LOH for RTE explained in Section 2. The algorithm works in three steps: First, it extracts all possible alignments between sequences of identical lem- mas in T and H. Then, it extracts various fea- tures 4 from the alignments. Finally, these fea- tures are given as input to a multinomial logis- tic regression classifier which is trained on anno- tated data. For the sake of simplicity, for now we only use one basic aligner which aligns (se- quences of) words in T and H that consist of iden- tical lemmas. We will investigate the impact of prior compound splitting given additional lexical resources (such as a derivational morphology lex-icon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Zeller et al., 2013)</ref>) in future work. We use TreeTagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Schmid, 1995)</ref> as integrated in EOP to provide tokenization, lemmatization and Part- of-Speech tagging as linguistic preprocessing.</p><p>We train and evaluate all models on the Ger- man translation of the RTE-3 dataset ( <ref type="bibr">Dagan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Magnini et al., 2014</ref>). The training and test dataset contain 800 T-H pairs each. In both sets, entailing and non-entailing T-H pairs are equally distributed (chance baseline of 50% accuracy).</p><p>We apply a compound splitter on the RTE train- ing and test dataset before we input the data to the EOP pipeline. We replace all compounds by their constituents, separated by white-space. Thus, they are subsequently treated as individual words by EOP and the lexical aligner can benefit from the increased transparency of the compounds. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows accuracy, precision, recall and F 1 - score for the entailment and non-entailment class on the RTE-3 dataset. As reflected in the results, reducing the opacity of compounds via the appli- cation of a compound splitter improves the subse- quent RTE performance. This holds for all com- pound splitters that we used in our experiments. It is also noticeable that the different compound splitters yield different results in the downstream task, with FF2010 being the most beneficial and significantly <ref type="bibr">5</ref> outperforming the initial RTE setup without prior compound splitting (INIT) by up to four percentage points in accuracy and F 1 -score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussion</head><p>As expected, manual splitting performs best overall. The performance difference with FF2010 is however not statistically significant. This is not surprising because FF2010 reaches an accuracy of around 90% in intrinsic evaluations (Ziering and van der Plas, 2016) and the small underperfor-mance is leveled out by the small size of the test set. Moreover, manual inspections revealed that FF2010 has a higher recall than manual splitting in the non-entailment class due to its undersplit- ting which results in less lexical overlap between T and H, pointing to the non-entailment class.</p><p>When we compare these results from the ex- trinsic evaluation with intrinsic evaluation results (in terms of splitting accuracy) reported in Zier- ing and van der Plas (2016), we see the same per- formance ordering with respect to the three com- pound splitters, while the current extrinsic evalua- tion on RTE differentiates between the best system (FF2010) and the two others in that only the for- mer reached statistically significant improvements over the INIT baseline.</p><p>To analyze the possible causes of difference in performance between the systems and to see the benefits of using RTE for compound splitting evaluation we performed a manual error analysis. First, we examined all entailment classifications that were correct using FF2010 and incorrect when using the INIT baseline. Using FF2010, the classi- fier was able to correctly classify an additional 36 entailing and 25 non-entailing T-H pairs. As ex- pected, most of the hypotheses in these pairs con- tained correctly split compounds where the RTE system could benefit from the increased trans- parency. Conversely, we also examined the 28 T-H pairs that the classifier missed to identify as entail- ing while they were correct in INIT. Most of the examples were cases in which there was almost no lexical overlap between T and H even with com- pound splitting.</p><p>Furthermore, we compared the correct entail- ment classifications of FF2010 with the other two splitters. For ZvdP2016, most errors can be at- tributed to oversplitting. Precisely, 25 out of its 37 (67.5%) misclassifications compared to FF2010 can be attributed to this problem. For exam- ple, ZvdP2016 oversplit the name Landowska into Line Dow Ska 6 that appeared in both T and H in an non-entailing pair, which artificially increased the coverage ratio of words in H and therefore pointed to the incorrect entailment classification. For WH2012, oversplitting is also a major con- tributor of RTE errors, however it appeares not as predominant as for ZvdP2016. 10 out of its 29 (34.5%) misclassifications compared to FF2010 can be attributed to oversplitting, while 4 (13.8%) missclassifications are due to undersplitting. For example, in an entailing T-H pair WH2012 cor- rectly split Amazonas-Regenwald 'Amazon rain- forest' in H into Amazonas Regen Wald, however it oversplit Amazonas in T into Amazon As 'Amazon ace' and thus, Amazonas in H remained unaligned. To the contrary, FF2010 did not split Amazonas in T, which lead to a higher token coverage ratio in H. Again, in the H Die EU senkt die Fangquoten 'The EU lowers the fishing quota' of another entailing T-H pair, WH2010 correctly split Fang 1 quoten 2 'fishing quota' in H into fangen 1 Quote 2 but failed to split EU-Quote in T, failing to cover both EU and Quote in H.</p><p>Our closer inspections also showed that com- pound splitting does not always suffice to reveal a lexical match between T and H as shown in the following example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T: Ben fährt 1 einen Mercedes 2 'Ben drives 1 a Mercedes 2 ' H: Ben ist Auto 3 fahrer 4 'Ben is a car 3 driver 4 '</formula><p>Given a correct splitting of Autofahrer to Auto Fahrer, a derivational morphology resource ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Zeller et al., 2013)</ref> would be required to discover the relationship between fahren and Fahrer and a synonym database to find that Mercedes is a hy- ponym of Auto. This does not weaken the claim that RTE is useful for evaluating compound split- ters. It just shows that deeper, semantic compound analysis could improve RTE further.</p><p>Besides, the error analysis shed some light on the treatment of compound heads and modifiers. It seems advisable to weight the compound head and modifiers differently when computing the ratio of aligned tokens in H. As illustrated by the follow- ing example, coverage of the head should be more important for the entailment decision than of the modifiers. Given a correct split of Kinder 1 buch 2 into Kind 1 Buch 2 , H1 and H2 have the same token coverage ratio while only H1 is entailed by T. It should be noted that the transparency gain us- ing compound splitting is limited to closed com- pounds that are compositional with respect to at least one constituent. Splitting compounds in H that are fairly non-compositional with respect to all constituents (e.g., Maulwurf 'mole' (lit. 'mouth throw')) is counterproductive. However, since most compounds (in particular ad-hoc pro- ductions) are compositional, this is only a side is- sue. In fact, we did not observe any cases of non- compositional compounds in the course of our er- ror analysis.</p><p>In summary, compound splitting is a complex task that comprises many subtasks. The multiple evaluation methods available, both intrinsic and extrinsic, vary in their suitability to evaluate them. One of these subtasks concerns the ability of com- pound splitters to determine whether to split or not, which is an integral part of compound anal- ysis. While aspects such as oversplitting were not consistently evaluated in previous intrinsic evalu- ations, or compensated for by task-internal mech- anisms in SMT, RTE proved more strict in this re- spect. Moreover, the transparency of the models made it possible to better estimate the impact of splitting. Despite the small size of the dataset, we were able to show significant differences, partly due to the clear definition of this binary classifica- tion task.</p><p>On a side note, to the best of our knowledge, the result we obtained using the FF2010 com- pound splitter is the best result on the German RTE-3 dataset that has been reported using EOP. Notably, we obtain an accuracy which is almost three percentage points higher than the results of , although they include further (language-specific) linguistic knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Inspired by the potential benefits of compound splitting from the RTE literature and supported by the transparency of the models and the clear defi- nition of this binary classification task, we set out to explore whether RTE is a suitable method to ex- trinsically evaluate the performance of compound splitting. We compared several compound split- ters on a German textual entailment dataset and found that compound splitting is helpful for RTE across the board. More importantly, we found that certain aspects of compound splitters, neglected in previous evaluations, such as oversplitting, had a large impact on this task and nicely differentiated the systems tested. We conclude that RTE repre- sents a suitable alternative to SMT for the extrinsic evaluation of compound splitters.</p><p>In future work, we would like to investigate the interaction between additional lexical resources (such as GermaNet <ref type="bibr">(Hamp and Feldweg, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010)</ref> or <ref type="bibr">DErivBase (Zeller et al., 2013)</ref>) and compound splitting, and the im- pact on the RTE performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>T</head><label></label><figDesc>: Yuki kauft ein Kinder 1 buch 2 'Yuki buys a children's 1 book 2 ' H1: Yuki kauft ein Buch 'Yuki buys a book' H2: Yuki ist ein Kind 'Yuki is a child'</figDesc></figure>
