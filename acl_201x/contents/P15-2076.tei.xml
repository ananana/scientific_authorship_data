				<p>Data-driven representation learning for words is a technique of central importance in NLP. While indisputably useful as a source of features in downstream tasks, such vectors tend to consist of uninter-pretable components whose relationship to the categories of traditional lexical semantic theories is tenuous at best. We present a method for constructing interpretable word vectors from hand-crafted linguistic resources like WordNet, FrameNet etc. These vectors are binary (i.e, contain only 0 and 1) and are 99.9% sparse. We analyze their performance on state-of-the-art evaluation methods for distributional models of word vectors and find they are competitive to standard distributional approaches.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Distributed representations of words have been shown to benefit a diverse set of NLP tasks in- cluding syntactic parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lazaridou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bansal et al., 2014</ref>), named entity recognition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Guo et al., 2014</ref>) and sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Socher et al., 2013)</ref>. Additionally, because they can be induced directly from unannotated corpora, they are likewise available in domains and languages where traditional linguistic resources do not ex- haust. Intrinsic evaluations on various tasks are helping refine vector learning methods to discover representations that captures many facts about lex- ical semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Turney, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Turney and Pantel, 2010</ref>).</p><p>Yet induced word vectors do not look anything like the representations described in most lexi- cal semantic theories, which focus on identifying classes of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Levin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schuler, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Miller, 1995)</ref>. Though expensive to construct, conceptualizing word meanings sym- bolically is important for theoretical understand- ing and interpretability is desired in computational models.</p><p>Our contribution to this discussion is a new technique that constructs task-independent word vector representations using linguistic knowledge derived from pre-constructed linguistic resources like WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Miller, 1995)</ref>, FrameNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al., 1998</ref>), Penn Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Marcus et al., 1993)</ref> etc. In such word vectors every dimension is a lin- guistic feature and 1/0 indicates the presence or absence of that feature in a word, thus the vec- tor representations are binary while being highly sparse (≈ 99.9%). Since these vectors do not en- code any word cooccurrence information, they are non-distributional. An additional benefit of con- structing such vectors is that they are fully inter- pretable i.e, every dimension of these vectors maps to a linguistic feature unlike distributional word vectors where the vector dimensions have no in- terpretability.</p><p>Of course, engineering feature vectors from lin- guistic resources is established practice in many applications of discriminative learning; e.g., pars- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">McDonald and Pereira, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nivre, 2008)</ref> or part of speech tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ratnaparkhi, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collins, 2002</ref>). However, despite a certain com- mon inventories of features that re-appear across many tasks, feature engineering tends to be seen as a task-specific problem, and engineered feature vectors are not typically evaluated independently of the tasks they are designed for. We evaluate the quality of our linguistic vectors on a number of tasks that have been proposed for evaluating dis- tributional word vectors. We show that linguistic word vectors are comparable to current state-of- the-art distributional word vectors trained on bil- lions of words as evaluated on a battery of seman- tic and syntactic evaluation benchmarks. <ref type="bibr">1</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lexicon</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Linguistic Word Vectors</head><p>We construct linguistic word vectors by extracting word level information from linguistic resources. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the size of vocabulary and number of features induced from every lexicon. We now describe various linguistic resources that we use for constructing linguistic word vectors.</p><p>WordNet. WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Miller, 1995)</ref> is an En- glish lexical database that groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and records a num- ber of relations among these synsets or their members. For a word we look up its synset for all possible part of speech (POS) tags that it can assume. For example, film will have SYNSET.FILM.V.01 and SYNSET.FILM.N.01 as features as it can be both a verb and a noun. In ad- dition to synsets, we include the hyponym (for ex. HYPO.COLLAGEFILM.N.01), hypernym (for ex. HYPER:SHEET.N.06) and holonym synset of the word as features. We also collect antonyms and pertainyms of all the words in a synset and include those as features in the linguistic vector.</p><p>Supsersenses. WordNet partitions nouns and verbs into semantic field categories known as supsersenses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ciaramita and Altun, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nastase, 2008</ref>). For example, lioness evokes the su- persense SS.NOUN.ANIMAL. These supersenses were further extended to adjectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Tsvetkov et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We use these supsersense tags for nouns, verbs and adjectives as features in the lin- guistic word vectors.</p><p>FrameNet. FrameNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fillmore et al., 2003</ref>) is a rich linguistic resource that contains information about lexical and predicate- argument semantics in English. Frames can be realized on the surface by many different word types, which suggests that the word types evok- ing the same frame should be semantically related.</p><p>For every word, we use the frame it evokes along with the roles of the evoked frame as its features. Since, information in FrameNet is part of speech (POS) disambiguated, we couple these feature with the corresponding POS tag of the word. For example, since appreciate is a verb, it will have the following features: VERB.FRAME.REGARD, VERB.FRAME.ROLE.EVALUEE etc.</p><p>Emotion &amp; Sentiment. Mohammad and Turney (2013) constructed two different lexicons that as- sociate words to sentiment polarity and to emo- tions resp. using crowdsourcing. The polar- ity is either positive or negative but there are eight different kinds of emotions like anger, an- ticipation, joy etc. Every word in the lexicon is associated with these properties. For example, cannibal evokes POL.NEG, EMO.DISGUST and EMO.FEAR. We use these properties as features in linguistic vectors.</p><p>Connotation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Feng et al. (2013)</ref> construct a lex- icon that contains information about connotation of words that are seemingly objective but often allude nuanced sentiment. They assign positive, negative and neutral connotations to these words. This lexicon differs from Mohammad and Tur- ney <ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref> in that it has a more subtle shade of sentiment and it extends to many more words. For example, delay has a negative connotation CON.NOUN.NEG, floral has a positive connota- tion CON.ADJ.POS and outline has a neutral con- notation CON.VERB.NEUT.</p><p>Color. Most languages have expressions involv- ing color, for example green with envy and grey with uncertainly are phrases used in English. The word-color associtation lexicon produced by Mo- hammad <ref type="formula">(2011)</ref>   <ref type="table">love  1  1  1  1  0  1  hate  0  0  1  1  0  0  ugly  0  0  0  0  1  0  beauty  1  1  0  0  0  1  refundable  0  0  0  0  0  1</ref>  </p><note type="other">POL.POS COLOR.PINK SS.NOUN.FEELING PTB.VERB ANTO.FAIR · · · CON.NOUN.POS</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>We first briefly describe the evaluation tasks and then present results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Evaluation Tasks</head><p>Word Similarity. We evaluate our word repre- sentations on three different benchmarks to mea- sure word similarity. The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Finkelstein et al., 2001</ref>), which contains 353 pairs of English words that have been assigned similarity ratings by humans. The second is the RG-65 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965)</ref> of 65 words pairs. The third dataset is SimLex ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hill et al., 2014</ref>) which has been constructed to overcome the shortcomings of WS-353 and contains 999 pairs of adjectives, nouns and verbs. Word similarity is computed using cosine similarity between two words and Spearman's rank correlation is reported between the rankings produced by vector model against the human rankings. Sentiment Analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Socher et al. (2013)</ref> cre- ated a treebank containing sentences annotated with fine-grained sentiment labels on phrases and sentences from movie review excerpts. The coarse-grained treebank of positive and negative classes has been split into training, development, and test datasets containing 6,920, 872, and 1,821 sentences, respectively. We use average of the word vectors of a given sentence as features in an 2 -regularized logistic regression for classifica- tion. The classifier is tuned on the dev set and ac- curacy is reported on the test set.</p><p>NP-Bracketing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lazaridou et al. (2013)</ref> con- structed a dataset from the Penn TreeBank <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Marcus et al., 1993)</ref> of noun phrases (NP) of length three words, where the first can be an adjective or a noun and the other two are nouns. The task is to predict the correct bracketing in the parse tree for a given noun phrase. For example, local (phone company) and (blood pressure) medicine exhibit left and right bracketing respectively. We append the word vectors of the three words in the NP in or- der and use them as features in an 2 -regularized logistic regression classifier. The dataset contains 2,227 noun phrases split into 10 folds. The clas- sifier is tuned on the first fold and cross-validation accuracy is reported on the remaining nine folds.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Performance of different type of word vectors on evaluation tasks reported by Spearman's correlation (first 3 columns) and Accuracy (last 2 columns).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors</head><p>In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors, we perform singular value decompostion (SVD) on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality. If L ∈ {0, 1} N ×D is the lin- guistic matrix with N word types and D linguistic features, then we can obtain U ∈ R N ×K from the SVD of L as follows: L = UΣV , with K being the desired length of the lower dimensional space. We compare both sparse and dense linguistic vectors to three widely used distributional word vector models. The first two are the pre-trained Skip-Gram ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and Glove ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) 6 word vectors each of length 300, trained on 300 billion and 6 billion words respectively. We used latent semantic anal- ysis (LSA) to obtain word vectors from the SVD decomposition of a word-word cooccurrence ma- trix <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Turney and Pantel, 2010)</ref>. These were trained on 1 billion words of Wikipedia with vector length 300 and context window of 5 words. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the performance of different word vector types on the evaluation tasks. It can be seen that although Skip-Gram, Glove &amp; LSA perform better than linguistic vectors on WS-353, the lin- guistic vectors outperform them by a huge mar- gin on SimLex. Linguistic vectors also perform better at RG-65. On sentiment analysis, linguis- tic vectors are competitive with Skip-Gram vec- tors and on the NP-bracketing task they outper- form all distributional vectors with a statistically significant margin (p &lt; 0.05, McNemar's test <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dietterich (1998)</ref>). We append the sparse linguis- tic vectors to Skip-Gram vectors and evaluate the resultant vectors as shown in the bottom row of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The combined vector outperforms Skip-Gram on all tasks, showing that linguistic vectors contain useful information orthogonal to distribu- tional information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results</head><p>It is evident from the results that linguistic vec- tors are either competitive or better to state-of-the- art distributional vector models. Sparse linguis- tic word vectors are high dimensional but they are also sparse, which makes them computationally easy to work with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>Linguistic resources like WordNet have found ex- tensive applications in lexical semantics, for ex- ample, for word sense disambiguation, word simi- larity etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Resnik, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agirre et al., 2009</ref>). Re- cently there has been interest in using linguistic resources to enrich word vector representations. In these approaches, relational information among words obtained from WordNet, Freebase etc. is used as a constraint to encourage words with sim- ilar properties in lexical ontologies to have simi- lar word vectors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yu and Dredze, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fried and Duh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Faruqui et al., 2015a</ref>). Distributional represen- tations have also been shown to improve by us- ing experiential data in addition to distributional context ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews et al., 2009</ref>). We have shown that simple vector concatenation can likewise be used to improve representations (further confirm- ing the established finding that lexical resources and cooccurrence information provide somewhat orthogonal information), but it is certain that more careful combination strategies can be used.</p><p>Although distributional word vector dimensions cannot, in general, be identified with linguistic properties, it has been shown that some vector construction strategies yield dimensions that are relatively more interpretable ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Murphy et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fyshe et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fyshe et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Faruqui et al., 2015b)</ref>. However, such analysis is difficult to generalize across models of representation. In constrast to distributional word vectors, linguistic word vectors have interpretable dimensions as ev- ery dimension is a linguistic property.</p><p>Linguistic word vectors require no training as there are no parameters to be optimized, meaning they are computationally economical. While good quality linguistic word vectors may only be ob- tained for languages with rich linguistic resources, such resources do exist in many languages and should not be disregarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a novel method of constructing word vector representations solely using linguistic knowledge from pre-existing linguistic resources. These non-distributional, linguistic word vectors are competitive to the current models of distribu- tional word vectors as evaluated on a battery of tasks. Linguistic vectors are fully interpretable as every dimension is a linguistic feature and are highly sparse, so they are computationally easy to work with.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2" validated="false"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>resources described above we obtain lin- guistic word vectors of length 172,418 dimen- sions.

Synonymy &amp; Antonymy. We use Roget's the-
saurus (Roget, 1852) to collect sets of synony-
mous words. 3 For every word, its synonymous 
word is used as a feature in the linguistic vec-
tor. For example, adoration and affair have 
a feature SYNO.LOVE, admissible has a fea-
ture SYNO.ACCEPTABLE. The synonym lexi-
con contains 25,338 words after removal of mul-
tiword phrases. In a similar manner, we also 
use antonymy relations between words as fea-
tures in the word vector. The antonymous words 
for a given word were collected from Ordway 
(1913). 4 An example would be of impartial-
ity, which has features ANTO.FAVORITISM and 
ANTO.INJUSTICE. The antonym lexicon has 
10,355 words. These features are different from 
those induced from WordNet as the former en-
code word-word relations whereas the latter en-
code word-synset relations.
