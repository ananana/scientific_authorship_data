				<p>We develop a semantic parsing framework based on semantic similarity for open domain question answering (QA). We focus on single-relation questions and decompose each question into an entity mention and a relation pattern. Using convo-lutional neural network models, we measure the similarity of entity mentions with entities in the knowledge base (KB) and the similarity of relation patterns and relations in the KB. We score relational triples in the KB using these measures and select the top scoring relational triple to answer the question. When evaluated on an open-domain QA task, our method achieves higher precision across different recall points compared to the previous approach , and can improve F 1 by 7 points.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Open-domain question answering (QA) is an im- portant and yet challenging problem that remains largely unsolved. In this paper, we focus on an- swering single-relation factual questions, which are the most common type of question observed in various community QA sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fader et al., 2013)</ref>, as well as in search query logs. We assumed such questions are answerable by issuing a single- relation query that consists of the relation and an argument entity, against a knowledge base (KB). Example questions of this type include: "Who is the CEO of Tesla?" and "Who founded Paypal?"</p><p>While single-relation questions are easier to handle than questions with more complex and multiple relations, such as "When was the child of the former Secretary of State in Obama's admin- istration born?", single-relation questions are still far from completely solved. Even in this restricted domain there are a large number of paraphrases of the same question. That is to say that the problem of mapping from a question to a particular relation and entity in the KB is non-trivial.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a semantic parsing framework tailored to single-relation questions. At the core of our approach is a novel semantic similarity model using convolutional neural net- works. Leveraging the question paraphrase data mined from the WikiAnswers corpus by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fader et al. (2013)</ref>, we train two semantic similarity mod- els: one links a mention from the question to an entity in the KB and the other maps a relation pat- tern to a relation. The answer to the question can thus be derived by finding the relation-entity triple r(e 1 , e 2 ) in the KB and returning the entity not mentioned in the question. By using a general se- mantic similarity model to match patterns and re- lations, as well as mentions and entities, our sys- tem outperforms the existing rule learning system, PARALEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fader et al., 2013)</ref>, with higher pre- cision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set. The highest achiev- able F 1 score of our system is 0.61, versus 0.54 of PARALEX.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We first survey related work in Sec. 2, followed by the problem definition and the high-level descrip- tion of our approach in Sec. 3. Sec. 4 details our semantic models and Sec. 5 shows the experimen- tal results. Finally, Sec. 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Semantic parsing of questions, which maps nat- ural language questions to database queries, is a critical component for KB-supported QA. An early example of this research is the semantic parser for answering geography-related questions, learned using inductive logic programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zelle and Mooney, 1996)</ref>. Research in this line origi- nally used small, domain-specific databases, such as GeoQuery ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tang and Mooney, 2001;</ref>. Very recently, researchers have started developing semantic parsers for large, general- domain knowledge bases like Freebase and DB- pedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cai and Yates, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berant et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kwiatkowski et al., 2013)</ref>. Despite significant progress, the problem remains challenging. Most methods have not yet been scaled to large KBs that can support general open-domain QA. In con- trast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fader et al. (2013)</ref> proposed the PARALEX system, which targets answering single-relation questions using an automatically created knowl- edge base, <ref type="bibr">ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011</ref>). By applying simple seed templates to the KB and by leveraging community-authored paraphrases of questions from WikiAnswers, they successfully demonstrated a high-quality lexicon of pattern- matching rules can be learned for this restricted form of semantic parsing.</p><p>The other line of work related to our approach is continuous representations for semantic simi- larity, which has a long history and is still an active research topic. In information retrieval, TF-IDF vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Salton and McGill, 1983)</ref>, latent semantic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Deerwester et al., 1990</ref>) and topic models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003</ref>) take the bag-of- words approach, which captures well the contex- tual information for documents, but is often too coarse-grained to be effective for sentences. In a separate line of research, deep learning based techniques have been proposed for semantic un- derstanding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mesnil et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Huang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Shen et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Tur et al., 2012</ref>). We adapt the work of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Huang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Shen et al., 2014b</ref>) for mea- suring the semantic distance between a question and relational triples in the KB as the core compo- nent of our semantic parsing approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Problem Definition &amp; Approach</head><p>In this paper, we focus on using a knowledge base to answer single-relation questions. A single- relation question is defined as a question com- posed of an entity mention and a binary rela- tion description, where the answer to this ques- tion would be an entity that has the relation with the given entity. An example of a single-relation question is "When were DVD players invented?" The entity is dvd-player and the relation is be-invent-in. The answer can thus be de- scribed as the following lambda expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">λx. be-invent-in(dvd-player, x) Q → RP ∧ M (1) RP → when were X invented (2) M → dvd players (3)</formula><p>when were X invented</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">→ be-invent-in (4)</formula><p>dvd players → dvd-player (5) <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: A potential semantic parse of the ques- tion "When were DVD players invented?"</p><p>A knowledge base in this work can be simply viewed as a collection of binary relation instances in the form of r(e 1 , e 2 ), where r is the relation and e 1 and e 2 are the first and second entity arguments.</p><p>Single-relation questions are perhaps the easiest form of questions that can directly be answered by a knowledge base. If the mapping of the re- lation and entity in the question can be correctly resolved, then the answer can be derived by a sim- ple table lookup, assuming that the fact exists in the KB. However, due to the large number of para- phrases of the same question, identifying the map- ping accurately remains a difficult problem.</p><p>Our approach in this work can be viewed as a simple semantic parser tailored to single-relation questions, powered by advanced semantic similar- ity models to handle the paraphrase issue. Given a question, we first separate it into two disjoint parts: the entity mention and the relation pattern. The entity mention is a subsequence of consecutive words in the question, where the relation pattern is the question where the mention is substituted by a special symbol. The mapping between the pattern and the relation in the KB, as well as the mapping between the mention and the entity are determined by corresponding semantic similarity models. The high-level approach can be viewed as a very simple context-free grammar, which is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The probability of the rule in (1) is 1 since we assume the input is a single-relation ques- tion. For the exact decomposition of the ques- tion (e.g., (2), (3)), we simply enumerate all com- binations and assign equal probabilities to them. The performance of this approach depends mainly on whether the relation pattern and entity mention can be resolved correctly (e.g., (4), <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>500</head><p>Figure 2: The CNNSM maps a variable-length word sequence to a low-dimensional vector in a latent semantic space. A word contextual window size (i.e., the receptive field) of three is used in the illustration. Convolution over word sequence via learned matrix W c is performed implicitly via the earlier word hashing layer's mapping with a local receptive field. The max operation across the se- quence is applied for each of 500 feature dimen- sions separately.</p><p>mine the probabilities of such mappings, we pro- pose using a semantic similarity model based on convolutional neural networks, which is the tech- nical focus in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Convolutional Neural Network based Semantic Model</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collobert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Shen et al., 2014b</ref>), we develop a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based semantic model (CNNSM) for semantic parsing. The CNNSM first uses a convolutional layer to project each word within a context window to a local contextual feature vec- tor, so that semantically similar word-n-grams are projected to vectors that are close to each other in the contextual feature space. Further, since the overall meaning of a sentence is often determined by a few key words in the sentence, CNNSM uses a max pooling layer to extract the most salient lo- cal features to form a fixed-length global feature vector. The global feature vector can be then fed to feed-forward neural network layers to extract non-linear semantic features. The architecture of the CNNSM is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In what fol- lows, we describe each layer of the CNNSM in detail, using the annotation illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>In our model, we leverage the word hash- ing technique proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Huang et al., 2013)</ref> where we first represent a word by a letter- trigram count vector. For example, given a word (e.g., cat), after adding word boundary sym- bols (e.g., #cat#), the word is segmented into a se- quence of letter-n-grams (e.g., letter-trigrams: #- c-a, c-a-t, a-t-#). Then, the word is represented as a count vector of letter-trigrams. For exam- ple, the letter-trigram representation of "cat" is:</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the word hashing matrix W f de- notes the transformation from a word to its letter- trigram count vector, which requires no learning. Word hashing not only makes the learning more scalable by controlling the size of the vocabulary, but also can effectively handle the OOV issues, sometimes due to spelling mistakes. Given the letter-trigram based word representation, we rep- resent a word-n-gram by concatenating the letter- trigram vectors of each word, e.g., for the t-th word-n-gram at the word-n-gram layer, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">l t = f T t−d , · · · , f T t , · · · , f T t+d T , t = 1, · · · , T</formula><p>where f t is the letter-trigram representation of the t-th word, and n = 2d + 1 is the size of the con- textual window. The convolution operation can be viewed as sliding window based feature extrac- tion. It captures the word-n-gram contextual fea- tures. Consider the t-th word-n-gram, the convo- lution matrix projects its letter-trigram representa- tion vector l t to a contextual feature vector h t . As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, h t is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">h t = tanh(W c · l t ), t = 1, · · · , T</formula><p>where W c is the feature transformation matrix, as known as the convolution matrix, which are shared among all word n-grams. The output of the con- volutional layer is a sequence of local contextual feature vectors, one for each word (within a con- textual window). Since many words do not have significant influence on the semantics of the sen- tence, we want to retain in the global feature vector only the salient features from a few key words. For this purpose, we use a max operation, also known as max pooling, to force the network to retain only the most useful local features produced by the con- volutional layers. Referring to the max-pooling layer of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v(i) = max t=1,··· ,T {f t (i)}, i = 1, · · · , K</formula><p>where v(i) is the i-th element of the max pool- ing layer v, h t (i) is the i-th element of the t-th local feature vector h t . K is the dimensionality of the max pooling layer, which is the same as the dimensionality of the local contextual feature vectors {h t }. One more non-linear transformation layer is further applied on top of the global feature vector v to extract the high-level semantic repre- sentation, denoted by y. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we have y = tanh(W s · v), where v is the global fea- ture vector after max pooling, W s is the semantic projection matrix, and y is the vector representa- tion of the input query (or document) in latent se- mantic space. Given a pattern and a relation, we compute their relevance score by measuring the cosine similarity between their semantic vectors. The semantic relevance score between a pattern Q and a relation R is defined as the cosine score of their semantic vectors y Q and y R . We train two CNN semantic models from sets of pattern-relation and mention-entity pairs, respec- tively. <ref type="bibr">Following (Huang et al., 2013)</ref>, for every pattern, the corresponding relation is treated as a positive example and 100 randomly selected other relations are used as negative examples. The set- ting for the mention-entity model is similar.</p><p>The posterior probability of the positive relation given the pattern is computed based on the cosine scores using softmax:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (R + |Q) = exp(γ · cos(y R + , y Q )) R exp(γ · cos(y R , y Q ))</formula><p>where γ is a scaling factor set to 5. Model train- ing is done by maximizing the log-posteriori us- ing stochastic gradient descent. More detail can be found in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Shen et al., 2014a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In order to provide a fair comparison to previ- ous work, we experimented with our approach using the PARALAX dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fader et al., 2013)</ref>, which consists of paraphrases of questions mined from WikiAnswers and answer triples from Re- Verb. In this section, we briefly introduce the dataset, describe the system training and evalua- tion processes and, finally, present our experimen- tal results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data &amp; Model Training</head><p>The PARALEX training data consists of ap- proximately 1.8 million pairs of questions and single-relation database queries, such as "When were DVD players invented?", paired with be-invent-in(dvd-player,?). For eval- uation, the authors further sampled 698 questions that belong to 37 clusters and hand labeled the an- swer triples returned by their systems.</p><p>To train our two CNN semantic models, we derived two parallel corpora based on the PAR- ALEX training data. For relation patterns, we first scanned the original training corpus to see if there was an exact surface form match of the entity (e.g., dvd-player would map to "DVD player" in the question). If an exact match was found, then the pattern would be derived by replacing the mention in the question with the special symbol. The corre- sponding relation of this pattern was thus the rela- tion used in the original database query, along with the variable argument position (i.e., 1 or 2, indicat- ing whether the answer entity was the first or sec- ond argument of the relation). In the end, we de- rived about 1.2 million pairs of patterns and rela- tions. We then applied these patterns to all the 1.8 million training questions, which helped discover 160 thousand new mentions that did not have the exact surface form matches to the entities.</p><p>When training the CNNSM for the pattern- relation similarity measure, we randomly split the 1.2 million pairs of patterns and relations into two sets: the training set of 1.19 million pairs, and the validation set of 12 thousand pairs for hyper- parameter tuning. Data were tokenized by re- placing hyphens with blank spaces. In the ex- periment, we used a context window (i.e., the re- ceptive field) of three words in the convolutional neural networks. There were 15 thousand unique letter-trigrams observed in the training set (used for word hashing). Five hundred neurons were used in the convolutional layer, the max-pooling layer and the final semantic layer, respectively. We used a learning rate of 0.002 and the train- ing converged after 150 iterations. A similar set- ting was used for the CNNSM for the mention- entity model, which was trained on 160 thousand mention-entity pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results</head><p>We used the same test questions in the PARALEX dataset to evaluate whether our system could find  Given a question, the system first enumerated all possible decompositions of the mentions and patterns, as described earlier. We then computed the similarity scores between the pattern and all relations in the KB and retained 150 top-scoring relation candidates. For each selected relation, the system then checked all triples in the KB that had this relation and computed the similarity score be- tween the mention and corresponding argument entity. The product of the probabilities of these two models, which are derived from the cosine similarity scores using softmax as described in Sec. 4, was used as the final score of the triple for ranking the answers. The top answer triple was used to compute the precision and recall of the sys- tem when reporting the system performance. By limiting the systems to output only answer triples with scores higher than a predefined threshold, we could control the trade-off between recall and pre- cision and thus plot the precision-recall curve. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the performance in F 1 , preci- sion, recall and mean average precision of our sys- tems and PARALEX. We provide two variations here. CNNSM pm is the full system and consists of two semantic similarity models for pattern- relation and mention-entity. The other model, CNNSM p , only measures the similarity between the patterns and relations, and maps a mention to an entity when they have the same surface form.</p><p>Since the trade-off between precision and re- call can be adjusted by varying the threshold, it is more informative to compare systems on the precision-recall curves, which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig- ure 3</ref>. As we can observe from the figure, the precision of our CNNSM pm system is consistently higher than PARALEX across all recall regions. The CNNSM m system also performs similarly to CNNSM pm in the high precision regime, but is in- ferior when recall is higher. This is understandable since the system does not match mentions with entities of different surface forms (e.g., "Robert Hooke" to "Hooke"). Notice that the highest F 1 values of them are 0.61 and 0.56, compared to 0.54 of PARALEX. Tuning the thresholds using a validation set would be needed if there is a metric (e.g., F 1 ) that specifically needs to be optimized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we propose a semantic parsing framework for single-relation questions. Com- pared to the existing work, our key insight is to match relation patterns and entity mentions using a semantic similarity function rather than lexical rules. Our similarity model is trained using convo- lutional neural networks with letter-trigrams vec- tors. This design helps the model go beyond bag- of-words representations and handles the OOV is- sue. Our method achieves higher precision on the QA task than the previous work, PARALEX, con- sistently at different recall points. Despite the strong empirical performance, our system has room for improvement. For in- stance, due to the variety of entity mentions in the real world, the parallel corpus derived from the WikiAnswers data and ReVerb KB may not contain enough data to train a robust entity link- ing model. Replacing this component with a dedicated entity linking system could improve the performance and also reduce the number of pattern/mention candidates when processing each question. In the future, we would like to extend our method to other more structured KBs, such as Freebase, and to explore approaches to extend our system to handle multi-relation questions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
