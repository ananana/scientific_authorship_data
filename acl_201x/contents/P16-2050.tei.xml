				<p>We automatically predict properties of wines on the basis of smell and flavor descriptions from experts&apos; wine reviews. We show wine experts are capable of describing their smell and flavor experiences in wine reviews in a sufficiently consistent manner, such that we can use their descriptions to predict properties of a wine based solely on language. The experimental results show promising F-scores when using lexical and semantic information to predict the color, grape variety, country of origin, and price of a wine. This demonstrates, contrary to popular opinion, that wine ex-perts&apos; reviews really are informative.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Describing smells and flavors is something the av- erage person is not particularly good at. If people are asked to identify familiar smells such as cinna- mon and chocolate, they are only able to correctly name the smell around 50% of the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cain, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Olofsson and Gottfried, 2015)</ref>. In compari- son to the elaborate vocabulary we have for visual and auditory phenomena, English and other lan- guages spoken in Western societies appear to have few words to describe smells and flavors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Levinson and Majid, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Majid and Burenhult, 2014</ref>). Instead, speakers often refer to the source as the name of the smell ('it smells like banana').</p><p>Flavor is a complex experience that combines the multisensory sensations of taste, touch and smell. Flavor descriptions contain basic taste de- scriptors (e.g., sweet, sour, salty, bitter), with metaphorical (e.g., 'elegant') and source-based terminology (e.g., 'it tastes buttery').</p><p>The lack of vocabulary for smells and flavors contrasts starkly with the interest people in the West have for flavors and fragrances, and what they are willing to spend on such products. The flavor and fragrance industry is estimated to be worth over $20 billion in 2015 <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . In this context, experts' recommendations are used by the pub- lic in order to help them make decisions about purchases. But are the expert recommendations meaningful, given the limitations of language for smells and flavors?</p><p>We are interested in the relation between lan- guage and sensory information, and how this in- formation is put into words. We focus on de- scriptions produced by a select group of people who have considerable experience naming smells and flavors, i.e., sommeliers and wine journalists. Through their descriptions, wine experts can in- fluence consumers' purchasing patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(McCoy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Horverak, 2009)</ref>, suggesting their descrip- tions are written in an informative manner. In this paper we aim to discover whether we can extract the properties of a wine based on the tasting notes written by a wine expert. This should be possible if wine experts are capable of translating their sen- sory experiences into words in a consistent man- ner.</p><p>Previous experimental studies provide a mixed picture as to whether wine experts' language is consistent. Some studies find similar levels of agreement in smell descriptions generated by wine experts and those generated by novices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lawless, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Parr et al., 2002</ref>), and wine experts use more metaphorical descriptions to describe wine <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Caballero and Su√°rez-Toste, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Paradis and EegOlofsson, 2013)</ref>, which potentially are not as in- formative about properties of the wine itself. In contrast, others find wine experts use more spe- cific vocabulary <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Zucco et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sezille et al., 2014)</ref>, and find that wine experts are, in fact, more consistent than non-experts, when they describe wines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Croijmans and Majid, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We examined the following wine properties and aimed to predict these solely on the basis of the re- view content: color, grape variety, price, and coun- try of origin. The outcomes of this investigation are interesting for two reasons. First, we test the ability of experts to review wines with consistent language using naturalistic materials. Most pre- vious studies about wine experts and their review- ing consistency are performed in experimental set- tings and cover some dozens of wine reviews (see for example ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gawel and Godden, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hopfer and Heymann, 2014)</ref>). With automatic analysis we are able to scale up to a much larger and more representative set of reviews.</p><p>Second, we gather new insights into the specific vocabulary and type of lexical descriptors used to describe smells and flavors, and what words are most distinctive for different wine characteristics. Market analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Vigar-Ellis et al., 2015)</ref> show that consumers increasingly select wines based on information provided by experts, for example through expert descriptions and recommender sys- tems, and that wine apps become ever more pop- ular. This is a positive development, as research suggests that informed consumers are able to ben- efit more from the loose relationship between price and quality in wine <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Oczkowski and Doucouliagos, 2014</ref>).</p><p>In the long run, as we are training automatic systems to predict wine properties, we could use such systems for automatic metadata prediction and error correction in wine review databases. These systems are also a first step towards a recommender system for wines based on review content and flavor descriptions. Current recom- mender systems such as the mobile apps Vivino 2 or Delectable <ref type="bibr">3</ref> work with metadata and user-based filtering, i.e. the principle of 'other users also bought . . .'. So there is potential here for content- based recommender systems to be developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The relationship between wines and wine reviews has been studied from many different perspec- tives, aside from those discussed in the previous section. Economically, the relationship between price, wine quality and wine ratings is interesting as a high rating by a famous wine expert can make a substantial difference to product sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(McCoy, 2006</ref>). Goldstein and colleagues <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref> inves- tigated whether a jury of wine experts vs non- experts can taste the difference between expen- sive and cheap wines, and found while wine ex- perts could distinguish the difference, non-experts could not. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lecocq and Visser (2006)</ref> investigated what wine properties determine wine prices. They showed wine experts based their overall wine quality ratings on sensory information, and that expert ratings together with features such as re- gion, vintage and designation explained price dif- ferences for a subset of French red wines. The relationship between the chemical substances in a wine and wine quality have also been the focus of research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cortez et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>Brochet and Dubourdieu <ref type="formula">(2001)</ref> conducted a lexical analysis of four corpora of wine reviews from a cognitive linguistic perspective and con- cluded wine reviews are not only describing sen- sory properties of the wine, but also include ideal- istic and hedonistic information from wine proto- types based on previous experiences. Anthropolo- gists have noted that wine experts form their own discourse community with a particular style and vocabulary <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Silverstein, 2006</ref>). In this research we aim to discover stylistic and lexical patterns with which we can relate wine reviews to wine proper- ties automatically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data set</head><p>The website http://www.winemag.com/, owned by Wine Enthusiast Companies, hosts a substantial catalog of wine descriptions. We downloaded the available reviews <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and gathered a total of 76,585 wine reviews. The catalog data is structured and contains information about the wine such as the producer, appellation region and country, grape variety, color, alcohol percentage, price, and where to buy it. The expert who writes the wine review also rates the wine by assigning it a score between 80 and 100. The reviews are writ-ten by 33 different experts, and can be considered concise, with an average length of 39 words.</p><p>Wine reviews have a distinct style and vocabu- lary, which tends to focus on smell and flavor de- scriptions, as shown in example reviews 1 and 2 from our data. As noted previously, wine experts use creative metaphors to characterize the smell and flavor of a wine, as well as source-based de- scriptions. The metaphors perhaps add variation to otherwise dull or repetitive descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Paradis and Eeg-Olofsson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Su√°rez Toste, 2007</ref>).</p><p>1. There is not a great deal of dolcetto grown in the North- west, but this is the best version I've yet seen. Its vivid, spicy fruit core expresses the soil, the plant and the grape in equal proportion. Sappy flavors of spiced plum and wild berry hold the fort; it's built like a race car, sleek and stylish, with a powerful, tannic frame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Here's a fragrant and very aromatic Grillo with cheerful notes of peach, passion fruit and mango. The wine has an easy approach and would pair perfectly with appetizers or finger foods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methodology</head><p>In our classification experiments, we evaluated the viability of predicting the following four wine properties: color, grape variety, price, and country of origin. Wines can be categorized into three dif- ferent colors: white, red and ros√©. The database of winemag.com is not complete in all metadata fields. We excluded reviews with missing meta- data from our experiments, and performed this se- lection separately for each metadata field. For in- stance, we excluded 5,328 wines without a color label in the color labeling experiment. For grape variety we only considered those wines that were produced from a single grape and for which we had at least 200 reviews in the training set, leading to 33 categories. We disre- garded all wines with grape blends, as these can have different ratios of different grape varieties. When different names were used for the same grape, we normalized these to the same category; e.g., Pinot Gris (French) and Pinot Grigio (Italian) were mapped together manually.</p><p>The sample contained wines from 47 different countries, ranging from South Korea (3 wines) to USA (31,401 wines). Even though price itself is an objective value, a division into cheap and expensive prices is a rather subjective choice. We tested two alternatives: a discretization where cheap wine costs less than $10 and expensive wine at least $100; and a more relaxed version where cheap means less then $15 and expensive at least $50. Wines between these prices were left out in both price experiments.</p><p>We pre-processed the data set automatically with the Stanford toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Manning et al., 2014</ref>): we tokenized, PoS-tagged and lemmatized the re- views. For the classification experiments, we split the randomized data set into an 80% training and 20% test set. As information sources, we use both lexical and semantic features. A first experimen- tal setup merely uses a bag-of-words (BoW) repre- sentation of the wine reviews. To construct these BoW features, we lowercased all lemmas in the review and selected only the content words (PoS- tag noun, verb or adjective) that occurred at least twice in the training set.</p><p>As the reviews are short and only contain about 23 content words on average, we decided to also add semantic features to reduce data sparsity. As shown by <ref type="bibr">Kusner and colleagues (2015)</ref>, seman- tic representations such as Latent Semantic In- dexing and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can outperform a BoW representation. For our sec- ond experimental setup, we combined our set of BoW features with (1) 100 topics generated with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei, 2012), and (2) 100 clusters based on word embeddings gener- ated with Word2Vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>). We ran initial experiments with exemplar-based clas- sification and experimented with different cluster (Word2Vec) and topic (LDA) sizes of 100, 500, 1000, 2000 on the training set. For LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McCallum, 2002</ref>), we also varied the threshold to assign a topic only to a text when it covered 1%, 2%, or 5% of the text. The best results were obtained with 100 topics and a proportion threshold of 1%. We used these settings throughout our experiments. Two examples of LDA topics are shown here:</p><p>LDA42 color ros√© strawberry raspberry pink flavor aroma wine light red cherry pale rise dry fresh LDA49 flavor acidity wine crisp dry clean lime peach citrus lemon fruit pineapple white vanilla</p><p>To create the word embeddings we ran Word2Vec on the training corpus, applying the BoW model, a context size of 8, and a word vec- tor dimensionality of 200 features. In a next step, K-means clustering (with k = 100) was applied on the resulting word vectors. As an example, we show part of the terms contained by cluster 20, which all have the connotation of "dark/intense": The Word2Vec clusters were then implemented as binary features, meaning that for each instance containing a word occurring in one of the clusters, the respective cluster is coded by "1" in the feature vector, while the other cluster features are coded as "0".</p><p>As a classifier, we used LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), with the RBF kernel and optimized pa- rameters c and g per prediction task. The parame- ters for SVM were optimized by means of a Grid search on a randomized subset (5,000 instances) of the training data, resulting in the following pa- rameter settings:</p><p>‚Ä¢ color: c = 8.0, g = 0.0078125 ‚Ä¢ variety: c =8.0, g =0.0078125</p><p>‚Ä¢ country: c =32.0, g=0.00048828125 ‚Ä¢ price big difference: c =8.0, g=0.03125 ‚Ä¢ price small difference: c =8.0, g=0.0078125 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the classification results per wine property for three system flavors: (1) feature vec- tors including BoW, (2) feature vectors combin- ing BoW features, LDA and Word2Vec clusters, and (3) combined feature vectors trained with an SVM classifier with optimized hyperparameters c and g. The results confirm the initial hypothesis that adding semantic information helps the classi- fier. In addition, optimizing the c and g parameters for the LIBSVM RBF kernel results in markedly higher classification scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>To get some insight into what terms are impor- tant for these classification results, we computed chi-square feature weights on the training set of examples for the different tasks. The top-10 fea- tures with highest chi-square values are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>   The classifier for color achieves a rather high F- score, as illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The ros√© category is the odd one out with a markedly lower F-score. There are two main reasons for this. First, ros√© is a low-frequency class compared to the other two classes. Second, ros√© wine is made from red grapes, but the grapes are processed in a differ- ent way to red wines. Therefore, we expect to find a certain amount of overlap between red and ros√©. When we examine the confusion matrix of the classifiers' predictions on the test set, we see that, indeed, most errors are due to misclassifying ros√© as red wine.</p><p>One could argue color prediction from wine re- views is trivial where the wine color is actually mentioned in the review. Therefore, we also per- formed an additional experiment with a BoW fea- ture set (with optimized SVM parameters) where the words red, white, and ros√© were removed. This affected the overall F-score by 2.2 points, with the color ros√©, cherry, tannin, apple, peach, citrus, pear, blush, black, pineapple, chardonnay variety aglianico, barbera, prosecco, viognier, moscato, malbec, sirah, carmen√®re, chenin, zin, franc country korea, jiri, rose-like, meoru, morocco, serbian, yves, calatrasus, chocolate-cherry, prokupac price year, tannin, age, rich, blackberry, black, vineyard, cellar, currant, vintage, simple  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Results with optimized and combined SVM for color classification on the test set.</p><p>decrease due mostly to the performance drop of the ros√© class from an F-score of 76.0 to 31.7.</p><p>For the property country we see that more train- ing material has a positive effect on the individual scores, as visualized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>For grape varieties we find individual F-scores varying between 82.4 (Chardonnay grape) and 30.8 (Grenache). The Tempranillo grape, for ex- ample, is known for its rather neutral profile, and as a consequence it is often used in blends. The classifier could only distinguish the Tem- panillo variety at a moderate rate (F-score 47.5), and the confusion matrix showed it is confused with Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Pinot Noir, and Syrah. Varieties that were relatively easy to predict were Gr√ºner Veltliner (F-score 74.3) and Nebbiolo (F-score 78.6). These grapes are rather strictly bound to geographic areas (Nebbiolo is from the region Piemonte, Italy and Gr√ºner Velt- liner is a typical Austrian grape). Cabernet Sauvi- gnon (F-score 68.4) and Syrah (F-score 65.2) are common grapes for which we had many training examples, but they were often wrongly predicted as labels, leading to low precision. We are aware the location of wineries can strongly influence the sensory properties of a wine. The higher scores for grape varieties which are clearly tied to a par- ticular region further confirms this.</p><p>With regard to the price, the more relaxed ver- sion (price big difference) does not seem to bene- fit from adding semantic features. An analysis of the classification output revealed the trained SVM model nearly always predicts the majority class for both the BoW and combined features, whereas the optimised version predicts both classes with an F- score of 94.6%. In future research, we intend to recast the price classification as a regression task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We have demonstrated that wine experts are capa- ble of describing wines in a sufficiently consistent manner that we can use their descriptions to pre- dict the properties of a wine based solely on its review. Using existing NLP tools and techniques, we were able to produce classifiers that could pre- dict the color, grape variety, price and country of origin of thousands of wines with high F-scores.</p><p>This study is a first step in a larger investiga- tion into the relationship between expert language and sensory descriptions. We are particularly in- terested in lexical descriptors used for smells and flavors, and aim to study the specific terminology at the phrase level. It would also be informative to know to what extent the wines were classified on the basis of smell and flavor descriptions per se, as opposed to other information provided in the reviews, such as vineyard or producer descrip- tions, for example. The present models cannot ad- dress this. In addition, it is interesting to investi- gate questions of genre and style. For example, we could ask to what extent does the writing style of an author, or the wine ratings, affect these results. Finally, we expect there are differences in the way wines are described in different countries and dif- ferent languages. Ultimately a multilingual, multi- national comparison of wine reviews could un- cover further insights into the human linguistic po- tential for describing complex smells and flavors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>5 .</figDesc></figure>
