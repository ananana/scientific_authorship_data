				<p>We present the Siamese Continuous Bag of Words (Siamese CBOW) model, a neural network for efficient estimation of high-quality sentence embeddings. Averaging the embeddings of words in a sentence has proven to be a surprisingly successful and efficient way of obtaining sentence embeddings. However, word em-beddings trained with the methods currently available are not optimized for the task of sentence representation, and, thus, likely to be suboptimal. Siamese CBOW handles this problem by training word em-beddings directly for the purpose of being averaged. The underlying neural network learns word embeddings by predicting , from a sentence representation, its surrounding sentences. We show the ro-bustness of the Siamese CBOW model by evaluating it on 20 datasets stemming from a wide variety of sources.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Word embeddings have proven to be beneficial in a variety of tasks in NLP such as machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zou et al., 2013)</ref>, parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen and Manning, 2014</ref>), semantic search ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Reinanda et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Voskarides et al., 2015)</ref>, and tracking the meaning of words and concepts over time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kim et al., 2014;</ref>). It is not evi- dent, however, how word embeddings should be combined to represent larger pieces of text, like sentences, paragraphs or documents. Surprisingly, simply averaging word embeddings of all words in a text has proven to be a strong baseline or feature across a multitude of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Faruqui et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gershman and Tenenbaum, 2015;</ref>.</p><p>Word embeddings, however, are not optimized specifically for representing sentences. In this pa- per we present a model for obtaining word embed- dings that are tailored specifically for the task of averaging them. We do this by directly including a comparison of sentence embeddings-the aver- aged embeddings of the words they contain-in the cost function of our network.</p><p>Word embeddings are typically trained in a fast and scalable way from unlabeled training data. As the training data is unlabeled, word embeddings are usually not task-specific. Rather, word embed- dings trained on a large training corpus, like the ones from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Collobert and Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mikolov et al., 2013b</ref>) are employed across different tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Socher et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hu et al., 2014</ref>). These two qualities-(i) being trainable from large quantities of unlabeled data in a reasonable amount of time, and (ii) robust performance across different tasks-are highly de- sirable and allow word embeddings to be used in many large-scale applications. In this work we aim to optimize word embeddings for sentence representations in the same manner. We want to produce general purpose sentence embeddings that should score robustly across multiple test sets, and we want to leverage large amounts of unla- beled training material.</p><p>In the word2vec algorithm, Mikolov et al. (2013a) construe a supervised training criterion for obtaining word embeddings from unsupervised data, by predicting, for every word, its surround- ing words. We apply this strategy at the sentence level, where we aim to predict a sentence from its adjacent sentences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hill et al., 2016)</ref>. This allows us to use unlabeled training data, which is easy to obtain; the only restriction is that documents need to be split into sentences and that the order between sentences is preserved.</p><p>The main research question we address is whether directly optimizing word embeddings for the task of being averaged to produce sentence em- beddings leads to word embeddings that are better suited for this task than word2vec does. There- fore, we test the embeddings in an unsupervised learning scenario. We use 20 evaluation sets that stem from a wide variety of sources (newswire, video descriptions, dictionary descriptions, mi- croblog posts). Furthermore, we analyze the time complexity of our method and compare it to our baselines methods. Summarizing, our main contributions are: • We present Siamese CBOW, an efficient neural network architecture for obtaining high-quality word embeddings, directly optimized for sen- tence representations; • We evaluate the embeddings produced by Siamese CBOW on 20 datasets, originating from a range of sources (newswire, tweets, video descriptions), and demonstrate the robust- ness of embeddings across different settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Siamese CBOW</head><p>We present the Siamese Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model, a neural network for efficient estimation of high-quality sentence embeddings. Quality should manifest itself in embeddings of semantically close sentences being similar to one another, and embeddings of semantically different sentences being dissimilar. An efficient and sur- prisingly successful way of computing a sentence embedding is to average the embeddings of its constituent words. Recent work uses pre-trained word embeddings (such as word2vec and GloVe) for this task, which are not optimized for sentence representations. Following these approaches, we compute sentence embeddings by averaging word embeddings, but we optimize word embeddings directly for the purpose of being averaged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Training objective</head><p>We construct a supervised training criterion by having our network predict sentences occurring next to each other in the training data. Specifically, for a pair of sentences (s i , s j ), we define a proba- bility p(s i , s j ) that reflects how likely it is for the sentences to be adjacent to one another in the train- ing data. We compute the probability p(s i , s j ) us- ing a softmax function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p θ (s i , s j ) = e cos(s θ i ,s θ j ) s ∈S e cos(s θ i ,s θ ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where s θ x denotes the embedding of sentence s x , based on the model parameters θ. In theory, the summation in the denominator of Equation 1 should range over all possible sentences S, which is not feasible in practice. Therefore, we replace the set S with the union of the set S + of sentences that occur next to the sentence s i in the training data, and S − , a set of n randomly chosen sen- tences that are not observed next to the sentence s i in the training data. The loss function of the network is categorical cross-entropy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L = − s j ∈{S + ∪ S − } p(s i , s j ) · log(p θ (s i , s j )),</formula><p>where p(·) is the target probability the network should produce, and p θ (·) is the prediction it es- timates based on parameters θ, using Equation 1. The target distribution simply is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p(s i , s j ) = 1 |S + | , if s j ∈ S + 0, if s j ∈ S − .</formula><p>I.e., if there are 2 positive examples (the sen- tences preceding and following the input sentence) and 2 negative examples, the target distribution is (0.5, 0.5, 0, 0). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the architecture of the proposed Siamese CBOW network. The input is a projec- tion layer that selects embeddings from a word embedding matrix W (that is shared across inputs) for a given input sentence. The word embeddings are averaged in the next layer, which yields a sen- tence representation with the same dimensionality as the input word embeddings (the boxes labeled average i in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The cosine similarities be- tween the sentence representation for sentence i and the other sentences are calculated in the penul- timate layer and a softmax is applied in the last layer to produce the final probability distribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Training</head><p>The weights in the word embedding matrix are the only trainable parameters in the Siamese CBOW network. They are updated using stochastic gradi- ent descent. The initial learning rate is monoton- ically decreased proportionally to the number of training batches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Setup</head><p>To test the efficacy of our siamese network for producing sentence embeddings we use multiple  test sets. We use Siamese CBOW to learn word embeddings from an unlabeled corpus. For every sentence pair in the test sets, we compute two sen- tence representations by averaging the word em- beddings of each sentence. Words that are miss- ing from the vocabulary and, hence, have no word embedding, are omitted. The cosine similarity be- tween the two sentence vectors is produced as a final semantic similarity score.</p><p>As we want a clean way to directly evalu- ate the embeddings on multiple sets we train our model and the models we compare with on ex- actly the same training data. We do not com- pute extra features, perform extra preprocessing steps or incorporate the embeddings in supervised training schemes. Additional steps like these are very likely to improve evaluation scores, but they would obscure our main evaluation purpose in this paper, which is to directly test the embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data</head><p>We use the Toronto Book Corpus 1 to train word embeddings. This corpus contains 74,004,228 already pre-processed sentences in total, which are made up of 1,057,070,918 tokens, originating from 7,087 unique books. In our experiments, we consider tokens appearing 5 times or more, which leads to a vocabulary of 315,643 words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Baselines</head><p>We employ two baselines for producing sentence embeddings in our experiments. We obtain simi- larity scores between sentence pairs from the base- lines in the same way as the ones produced by Siamese CBOW, i.e., we calculate the cosine sim- ilarity between the sentence embeddings they pro- duce. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The corpus can be downloaded from http://www. cs.toronto.edu/ ˜ mbweb/; cf. ( ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word2vec</head><p>We average word embeddings trained with word2vec. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We use both architec- tures, Skipgram and CBOW, and apply default settings: minimum word frequency 5, word embedding size 300, context window 5, sample threshold 10 -5 , no hierarchical softmax, 5 negative examples.</p><p>Skip-thought As a second baseline we use the sentence representations produced by the skip- thought architecture ( . <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Skip- thought is a recently proposed method that learns sentence representations in a different way from ours, by using recurrent neural networks. This al- lows it to take word order into account. As it trains sentence embeddings from unlabeled data, like we do, it is a natural baseline to consider.</p><p>Both methods are trained on the Toronto Book Corpus, the same corpus used to train Siamese CBOW. We should note that as we use skip- thought vectors as trained by , skip-thought has an advantage over both word2vec and Siamese CBOW as the vocabulary used for encoding sentences contains 930,913 words, three times the size of the vocabulary that we use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluation</head><p>We use 20 SemEval datasets from the SemEval se- mantic textual similarity task in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agirre et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">Agirre et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agirre et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Agirre et al., 2015</ref>), which con- sist of sentence pairs from a wide array of sources (e.g., newswire, tweets, video descriptions) that have been manually annotated by multiple human assessors on a 5 point scale (1: semantically unre- lated, 5: semantically similar). In the ground truth, the final similarity score for every sentence pair is <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Results on SemEval datasets in terms of Pearson's r (Spearman's r). Highest scores, in terms of Pearson's r, are displayed in bold. Siamese CBOW runs statistically significantly different from the word2vec CBOW baseline runs are marked with a †. See §3.3 for a discussion of the statistical test used. the mean of the annotator judgements, and as such can be a floating point number like 2.685. The evaluation metric used by SemEval, and hence by us, is Pearson's r. As Spearman's r is often reported as well, we do so too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset</head><p>Statistical significance To see whether Siamese CBOW yields significantly different scores for the same input sentence pairs from word2vec CBOW-the method it is theoretically most sim- ilar to-we compute Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistics between all runs on all evaluation sets. Runs are considered statistically significantly dif- ferent for p-values &lt; 0.0001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Network</head><p>To comply with results reported in other research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mikolov et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kusner et al., 2015</ref>) we fix the embedding size to 300 and only consider words appearing 5 times or more in the training corpus. We use 2 negative examples (see §4.2.2 for an analysis of different settings). The embed- dings are initialized randomly, by drawing from a normal distribution with µ = 0.0 and σ = 0.01. The batch size is 100. The initial learning rate α is 0.0001, which we obtain by observing the loss on the training data. Training consists of one epoch.</p><p>We use Theano (Theano Development Team, 2016) to implement our network. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We ran our ex- periments on GPUs in the DAS5 cluster ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bal et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>In this section we present the results of our ex- periments, and analyze the stability of Siamese CBOW with respect to its (hyper)parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Main experiments</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the results of Siamese CBOW on 20 SemEval datasets are displayed, together with the results of the baseline systems. As we can see from the table, Siamese CBOW outperforms the baselines in the majority of cases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(14 out of 20)</ref>. The very low scores of skip-thought on MSRpar appear to be a glitch, which we will ignore.</p><p>It is interesting to see that for the set with the highest average sentence length (2013 SMT, with 24.7 words per sentence on average) Siamese CBOW is very close to skip-thought, the best per- forming baseline. In terms of lexical term over- lap, unsurprisingly, all methods have trouble with the sets with little overlap <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(2013</ref><ref type="bibr">( FNWN, 2015</ref> answers-forums, which both have 7% lexical over- lap). It is interesting to see, however, that for the next two sets (2015 belief and 2012 MSRpar, 11% and 14% overlap respectively) Siamese CBOW manages to get the best performance. The high- est performance on all sets is 0.7315 Pearson's r of Siamese CBOW on the 2014 tweet-news set. This figure is not very far from the best perform- ing SemEval run that year which has 0.792 Pear- son's r. This is remarkable as Siamese CBOW is completely unsupervised, while the NTNU system which scored best on this set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lynum et al., 2014</ref>) was optimized using multiple training sets.</p><p>In recent work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hill et al. (2016)</ref> present Fast- Sent, a model similar to ours (see §5 for a more elaborate discussion); results are not reported for all evaluation sets we use, and hence, we compare the results of FastSent and Siamese CBOW sepa- rately, in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>FastSent and Siamese CBOW each outperform the other on half of the evaluation sets, which clearly suggests that the differences between the two methods are complementary. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analysis</head><p>Next, we investigate the stability of Siamese CBOW with respect to its hyper-parameters. In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Results on SemEval 2014 datasets in terms of Pearson's r (Spearman's r). Highest scores (in Pearson's r) are displayed in bold.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Performance across iterations</head><p>Ideally, the optimization criterion of a learning al- gorithm ranges over the full domain of its loss function. As discussed in §2, our loss function only observes a sample. As such, convergence is not guaranteed. Regardless, an ideal learning sys- tem should not fluctuate in terms of performance relative to the amount of training data it observes, provided this amount is substantial: as training proceeds the performance should stabilize. To see whether the performance of Siamese CBOW fluctuates during training we monitor it during 5 epochs; at every 10,000,000 examples, and at the end of every epoch. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> displays the results for all 20 datasets. We observe that on the majority of datasets the performance shows very little variation. There are three exceptions. The performance on the 2014 deft-news dataset steadily decreases while the performance on 2013 OnWN steadily increases, though both seem to stabilize at the end of epoch 5. The most no- table exception, however, is 2012 MSRvid, where the score, after an initial increase, drops consis- tently. This effect might be explained by the fact that this evaluation set primarily consists of very short sentences-it has the lowest average sen- tence length of all set: 6.63 with a standard de- viation of 1.812. Therefore, a 300-dimensional representation appears too large for this dataset; this hypothesis is supported by the fact that 200- dimensional embeddings work slightly better for this dataset (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Number of negative examples</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the results of Siamese CBOW in terms of Pearson's r are plotted for different numbers of negative examples. We observe that on most sets, the number of negative examples has lim- ited effect on the performance of Siamese CBOW. Choosing a higher number, like 10, occasionally leads to slightly better performance, e.g., on the 2013 FNWN set. However, a small number like 1 or 2 typically suffices, and is sometimes markedly better, e.g., in the case of the 2015 belief set. As a high number of negative examples comes at a substantial computational cost, we conclude from the findings presented here that, although Siamese CBOW is robust against different settings of this parameter, setting the number of negative exam- ples to 1 or 2 should be the default choice.  100) invariably leads to inferior results. As, sim- ilar to a higher number of negative examples, a higher embedding dimension leads to higher com- putational costs, we conclude from these findings that a moderate number of dimensions (200 or 300) is to be preferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Number of dimensions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Time complexity</head><p>For learning systems, time complexity comes into play in the training phase and in the prediction phase. For an end system employing sentence em- beddings, the complexity at prediction time is the most crucial factor, which is why we omit an anal- ysis of training complexity. We focus on compar- ing the time complexity for generating sentence embeddings for Siamese CBOW, and compare it to the baselines we use.</p><p>The complexity of all algorithms we consider is O(n), i.e., linear in the number of input terms. As in practice the number of arithmetic operations is the critical factor in determining computing time, we will now focus on these.</p><p>Both word2vec and the Siamese CBOW com- pute embeddings of a text T = t 1 , . . . , t |T | by av- eraging the term embeddings. This requires |T |−1 vector additions, and 1 multiplication by a scalar value (namely, 1/|T |). The skip-thought model is a recurrent neural network with GRU cells, which computes a set of equations for every term t in T , which we reprint for reference ( :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">r t = σ(Wrx t + Urh t−1 ) z t = σ(Wzx t + Uzh t−1 ) h t = tanh(Wx t + U(r t h t−1 )) h t = (1 − z t ) h t−1 + z t h t</formula><p>As we can see from the formulas, there are 5|T | vector additions (+/-), 4|T | element-wise multipli- cations by a vector, 3|T | element-wise operations and 6|T | matrix multiplications, of which the lat- ter, the matrix multiplications, are most expensive.</p><p>This considerable difference in numbers of arithmetic operations is also observed in practice. We run tests on a single CPU, using identical code for extracting sentences from the evaluation sets,  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1200d)</ref> 98,804.0 5.6 for every method. The sentence pairs are pre- sented one by one to the models. We disregard the time it takes to load models. Speedups might of course be gained for all methods by presenting the sentences in batches to the models, by com- puting sentence representations in parallel and by running code on a GPU. However, as we are inter- ested in the differences between the systems, we run the most simple and straightforward scenario. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> lists the number of seconds each method takes to generate and compare sentence embed- dings for an input sentence pair. The difference between word2vec and Siamese CBOW is because of a different implementation of word lookup. We conclude from the observations presented here, together with the results in §4.1, that in a set- ting where speed at prediction time is pivotal, sim- ple averaging methods like word2vec or Siamese CBOW are to be preferred over more involved methods like skip-thought.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Qualitative analysis</head><p>As Siamese CBOW directly averages word em- beddings for sentences, we expect it to learn that words with little semantic impact have a low vec- tor norm. Indeed, we find that the 10 words with lowest vector norm are to, of, and, the, a, in, that, with, on, and as. At the other side of the spec- trum we find many personal pronouns: had, they, we, me, my, he, her, you, she, I, which is natural given that the corpus on which we train consists of fiction, which typically contains dialogues.</p><p>It is interesting to see what the differences in related words are between Siamese CBOW and word2vec when trained on the same corpus. For example, for a cosine similarity &gt; 0.6, the words related to her in word2vec space are she, his, my and hers. For Siamese CBOW, the only closely related word is she. Similarly, for the word me, word2vec finds him as most closely related word, while Siamese CBOW comes up with I and my. It seems from these few examples that Siamese CBOW learns to be very strict in choosing which words to relate to each other.</p><p>From the results presented in this section we conclude that optimizing word embeddings for the task of being averaged across sentences with Siamese CBOW leads to embeddings that are ef- fective in a large variety of settings. Furthermore, Siamese CBOW is robust to different parameter settings and its performance is stable across itera-tions. Lastly, we show that Siamese CBOW is fast and efficient in computing sentence embeddings at prediction time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>A distinction can be made between supervised approaches for obtaining representations of short texts, where a model is optimised for a specific scenario, given a labeled training set, and unsu- pervised methods, trained on unlabeled data, that aim to capture short text semantics that are robust across tasks. In the first setting, word vectors are typically used as features or network initialisations (Kenter and de <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Severyn and Moschitti, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yin and Schütze, 2015)</ref>. Our work can be classified in the latter category of unsupervised approaches.</p><p>Many models related to the one we present here are used in a multilingual setting <ref type="bibr">(Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermann and Blunsom, 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lauly et al., 2014</ref>). The key difference between this work and ours is that in a multilingual setting the goal is to predict, from a distributed represen- tation of an input sentence, the same sentence in a different language, whereas our goals is to predict surrounding sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wieting et al. (2016)</ref> apply a model similar to ours in a related but different setting where ex- plicit semantic knowledge is leveraged. As in our setting, word embeddings are trained by av- eraging them. However, unlike in our proposal, a margin-based loss function is used, which involves a parameter that has to be tuned. Furthermore, to select negative examples, at every training step, a computationally expensive comparison is made between all sentences in the training batch. The most crucial difference is that a large set of phrase pairs explicitly marked for semantic similarity has to be available as training material. Obtaining such high-quality training material is non-trivial, expensive and limits an approach to settings for which such material is available. In our work, we leverage unlabeled training data, of which there is a virtually unlimited amount.</p><p>As detailed in §2, our network predicts a sen- tence from its neighbouring sentences. The no- tion of learning from context sentences is also ap- plied in ( , where a recurrent neural network is employed. Our way of aver- aging the vectors of words contained in a sen- tence is more similar to the CBOW architecture of word2vec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mikolov et al., 2013a)</ref>, in which all context word vectors are aggregated to predict the one omitted word. A crucial difference between our approach and the word2vec CBOW approach is that we compare sentence representations di- rectly, rather than comparing a (partial) sentence representation to a word representation. Given the correspondence between word2vec's CBOW model and ours, we included it as a baseline in our experiments in §3. As the skip-gram architec- ture has proven to be a strong baseline too in many settings, we include it too.</p><p>Yih et al. (2011) also propose a siamese ar- chitecture. Short texts are represented by tf-idf vectors and a linear combination of input weights is learnt by a two-layer fully connected network, which is used to represent the input text. The co- sine similarity between pairs of representations is computed, but unlike our proposal, the differences between similarities of a positive and negative sen- tence pair are combined in a logistic loss function.</p><p>Finally, independently from our work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hill et al. (2016)</ref> also present a log-linear model. Rather than comparing sentence representations to each other, as we propose, words in one sentence are compared to the representation of another sen- tence. As both input and output vectors are learnt, while we tie the parameters across the en- tire model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hill et al. (2016)</ref>'s model has twice as many parameters as ours. Most importantly, how- ever, the cost function used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hill et al., 2016)</ref> is crucially different from ours. As words in sur- rounding sentences are being compared to a sen- tence representation, the final layer of their net- work produces a softmax over the entire vocabu- lary. This is fundamentally different from the fi- nal softmax over cosines between sentence repre- sentations that we propose. Furthermore, the soft- max over the vocabulary is, obviously, of vocab- ulary size, and hence grows when bigger vocabu- laries are used, causing additional computational cost. In our case, the size of the softmax is the number of positive plus negative examples (see §2.1). When the vocabulary grows, this size is un- affected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented Siamese CBOW, a neural net- work architecture that efficiently learns word em- beddings optimized for producing sentence repre- sentations. The model is trained using only unla-beled text data. It predicts, from an input sentence representation, the preceding and following sen- tence.</p><p>We evaluated the model on 20 test sets and show that in a majority of cases, 14 out of 20, Siamese CBOW outperforms a word2vec base- line and a baseline based on the recently pro- posed skip-thought architecture. As further analy- sis on various choices of parameters show that the method is stable across settings, we conclude that Siamese CBOW provides a robust way of generat- ing high-quality sentence representations.</p><p>Word and sentence embeddings are ubiquitous and many different ways of using them in su- pervised tasks have been proposed. It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a comprehen- sive analysis of all supervised methods using word or sentence embeddings and the effect Siamese CBOW would have on them. However, it would be interesting to see how Siamese CBOW embed- dings would affect results in supervised tasks.</p><p>Lastly, although we evaluated Siamese CBOW on sentence pairs, there is no theoretical limitation restricting it to sentences. It would be interesting to see how embeddings for larger pieces of texts, such as documents, would perform in document clustering or filtering tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Siamese CBOW network architecture.
