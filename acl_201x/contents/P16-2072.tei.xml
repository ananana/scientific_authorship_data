				<p>Using corpus data of spoken dialogue, we examine the convergence of syntactic complexity levels between interlocutors in natural conversations, as it occurs within spans of topic episodes. The findings of general convergence in the Switchboard and BNC corpora are compatible with an information-theoretic model of dialogue and with Interactive Alignment Theory.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>According to Interactive Alignment theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pickering and Garrod, 2004</ref>), mutual understanding in dialogue is helped by a variety of intercon- nected adaptation processes. Over the course of a conversation, interlocutors' linguistic productions assimilate at multiple levels, such as phonemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pardo, 2006</ref>), lexical choice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Garrod and Anderson, 1987)</ref>, syntactic structures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pickering and Branigan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Branigan et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Reitter et al., 2006</ref>) and so on. The alignment at these levels contributes to the establishment of aligned situation models between speakers, which is the ultimate goal of a successful conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pickering and Garrod, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moore, 2007, 2014</ref>).</p><p>Alignment does not only refer to the mimicking and repetition of particular linguistic structures; it also includes the convergence at the statistical and ensemble level, which is known as distribu- tional matching ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abney et al., 2014</ref>). Speech rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Webb, 1969)</ref>, probability distributions over syn- tactic forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jaeger and Snider, 2008)</ref>, power law distributions of acoustic onset events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abney et al., 2014)</ref>, and social intent of the speech act ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang et al., 2015)</ref> were all found to match between in- terlocutors.</p><p>An aspect of accommodation that presumably very much helps dialogue partners understand each other's language is syntactic complexity. De- spite rich investigation of alignment in conversa- tion, this property has been largely overlooked in the analysis of dialogue.</p><p>The general concept of syntactic complexity has, of course, been addressed in various ways. In educational psychology and applied linguistics, it is often defined as the degree of sophistication of language forms. It has broad application in the assessment of second language acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ortega, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lu, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lu, , 2011</ref>), the readability test <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(MacGinitie and Tretiak, 1971)</ref>, and elementary education ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abedi and Lord, 2001</ref>). In computa- tional linguistics, previous studies have shown that the syntactic complexity of a sentence is closely related to the amount of information being trans- mitted ( <ref type="bibr">Charniak, 2002, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jaeger and Levy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jaeger, 2010)</ref>. However, as far as we know, syntactic complexity as a high level feature of language production has not been inves- tigated under the theoretical lens of the Interactive Alignment Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pickering and Garrod, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the focus of this study is to track the syntactic complexity of different interlocutors as the conversation develops. A convergence of sen- tence complexity between interlocutors would be compatible with two pertinent theories. The first is the Interactive Alignment Model. The second is the Uniform Information Density hypothesis (Jaeger and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Levy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jaeger, 2010)</ref>, as it applies to syntactic structure. It postulates that speakers will strive to keep information density approxi- mately constant. In other words, if one interlocu- tor decreased their rate of information transmis- sion, the other one would increase it in response. As far as syntactic complexity is proportional to the amount of information, this would imply that if one interlocutor changes their syntactic complex- The tree depth of (a) is 4, while the value of (b) is 7. The branching factor of (a) is 1.38, while the value of (b) is 1.48 ity, their dialogue partner is likely to make the op- posite change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Corpus data</head><p>We use the Switchboard corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Godfrey et al., 1992</ref>) and the British National Corpus (BNC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(BNC, 2007)</ref> in this study. Switchboard contains 1126 conversations over the telephone, where each conversation features exactly two native American English speakers. From the BNC, we use only a subset of the data that contains spoken conversa- tions with exactly two participants so that the dia- logue structures are consistent with Switchboard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Metrics of syntactic complexity</head><p>We consider three candidate statistics to measure the syntactic complexity of a sentence: sentence length (number of words in a sentence), tree depth, and branching factor. The first two are straight- forward: syntactically complex sentences are typ- ically used to express complex meanings, and thus are more likely to contain more words than simple ones. More complex syntactic structures, such as relative clauses and noun clauses, also have deeper parse trees (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The third statistic, branching factor, is defined as the average number of children of all non-leaf nodes in the parse tree of a sentence. In contrast to tree depth, it measures the width of a tree struc- ture, thus a sentence with a larger branching factor looks flatter.</p><p>These three statistics are inter-correlated. For instance, tree depth has an almost linear corre- lation with sentence length. To come up with a measure that solely characterizes the complexity of a sentence in terms of its tree structure, we nor- malize tree depth and branching factor by exclud- ing the effect of sentence length. We adopt the method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Genzel and Charniak (2002)</ref>. Let f be a complexity measure of a sentence (tree depth or branching factor). We compute the aver- age measure ¯ f (n) for sentences of the same length n (n = 1, 2, . . . ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">¯ f (n) = 1 /|S(n)| s∈S(n) f (s) (1)</formula><p>where s denotes a sentence, and S(n) = {s|l(s) = n} is the set of sentences of length n. The normalized complexity measure is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (s) = f (s) ¯ f (n)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This normalized measure f is not sensitive to sentence length. This gives us five metrics of com- plexity: sentence length (SL), tree depth (TD), branching factor (BF), normalized tree depth (NTD), and normalized branching factor (NBF).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Topic segmentation and speaker role assignment</head><p>To verify the hypothesized convergence of a cer- tain statistic between two speakers in dialogue, one possible method is to measure whether the difference in that statistic becomes smaller as the conversation progresses. However, this design is overly simplistic in this case for several reasons. For instance, previous studies have found that sen- tence complexity in written text increases with its position <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Genzel and Charniak, 2003)</ref>; thus even if we observed that the difference of complexity be- comes smaller, a ceiling effect could be a simpler explanation. Additionally, the syntactic complexity of a sen- tence largely depends on the amount of meaning that is conveyed. Intuitively, when a speaker has a large amount of information to express, she tends to use more sophisticated syntactic constructions Linking this consideration to another very com- mon scenario in dialogue: one interlocutor leads the conversation by steering the on-going topics,  while the other participant follows along. Here, we are not talking about the turn-taking mech- anism in dialogue, which describes the shift at the utterance level. Rather, we are describing the shift at a higher level in conversation, the topic level, which is formally referred to as topic shift in Conversation Analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ng and Bradac, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Linell, 1998</ref>). According to these related theories, a complete conversation consists of several topic episodes. Some speakers play a more active role in leading the unfolding of new topic episodes, while others play a more passive role by follow- ing the topic shift. Beginning a new topic means bringing in new information, thus it is reasonable to infer that the interlocutor's syntactic complex- ity would partially depend on whether he is play- ing the leader or the follower. Considering the fact that the leader vs. follower roles are not fixed among interlocutors (a previous leader could be a follower later and vise versa), we should not exam- ine the convergence of syntactic complexity within the whole conversation. Rather, we want to zoom in to the finer scale of topic episodes, in which the interlocutors' roles are relatively stable. Based on these considerations, we use the Text- Tiling algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hearst, 1997)</ref> to segment the conversation into several topic episodes. This is a sufficient topic segmentation method for our re- search questions, though it is less sophisticated compared to Bayesian models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008)</ref> or Hidden Markov Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blei and Moreno, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Within each topic episode that resulted from the segmentation operation, we assign roles to the two speakers. This is based on which of the interlocu- tors is leading this topic episode, as previously ex- plained. We use two rules to determine this leader and follower differentiation:</p><p>Rule I: If the topic episode starts in the middle of the speaking turn of speaker A, then let A be the leader of this topic.</p><p>Rule II: If the topic episode starts with a com- plete speaking turn, then let the first speaker who contributes a sentence greater than N words in length in this episode be the leader.</p><p>Note that the purpose of Rule II is to select the most probable topic leader, based on the intuition that longer sentences are more likely to initiate a new topic. Thus the determination of the N words threshold here is totally empirical. We use N = 5 as the final threshold, because for N ≥ 5 our experiments draw similar results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>For each sentence in conversation, we compute the five earlier-discussed metrics of syntactic com- plexity: SL, TD, BF, NTD, and NBF.</p><p>For the first three metrics, SL, TD and BF, we observe convergence between topic leaders and followers, for both corpora <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Basi- cally, topic leaders have higher syntactic complex- ity measures at the early stage of a topic episode, which drops gradually as the topic develops. The converse holds for topic followers. We fit 12 linear <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: β coefficients of the fixed effect (within-topic position) of the linear mixed models.  Within−topic position of sentence mixed models (3 metrics × 2 roles × 2 corpora) using metrics as the respective response variables, the within-topic position as a fixed effect, and a random intercept grouped by individual speakers. We find a positive effect of within-topic position for leaders, and a reliably negative effect for fol- lowers (except SL of BNC follower), which con- firms the observation of convergence trend (See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>For NTD and NBF, we observe convergence patterns in Switchboard, but not reliably in BNC <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref>. Linear mixed models are fit in sim- ilar ways, and the β coefficients are: for NTD, β leader = −2.2 × 10 −5 , β follower = 9.7 × 10 −4 * * * ; for NBF, β leader = 6.8 × 10 −5 * , β follower = −2.9 × 10 −4 * * * (*** indicates p &lt; 0.001, and * indicates p &lt; 0.05). Thus, a general trend seems supported. As NBF is the only metric that is lower in leaders and higher in followers, it could actually be an index for syntactic simplicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>By segmenting a conversation into several topic episodes, and then differentiating the interlocutors in terms of their roles in initiating the topic, leader or follower, we show that the syntactic complex- ity of the two interlocutors converges within topic episodes. The syntactic complexity of the topic leader decreases, while the complexity of the topic follower increases.</p><p>From an information-theoretical point of view, the syntactic complexity of a sentence is closely related to its amount of lexical information or neg- ative entropy <ref type="bibr">Charniak, 2002, 2003)</ref>. By starting a new topic in conversation, the lead- ing speaker brings novelty to the existing con- text, which often involves relatively long and com- plex utterances. On the other hand, the follow- ing speaker has to accommodate this change of context, by first producing short acknowledging phrases at the early stage, and gradually increase his contribution as the topic develops. Therefore, the convergence of syntactic complexity within a topic episode is a reflection of the process in which two interlocutors contribute jointly to build up common ground <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clark and Brennan, 1991)</ref> with respect to a certain topic.</p><p>We find our results explained the theoretical frameworks of common ground <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark, 1996)</ref> and the Interactive Alignment Model <ref type="bibr">(IAM, Pickering and Garrod, 2004</ref>), models which are some- times characterized as opposing accounts of coor- dination in dialogue. From the common-ground perspective of language-as-activity, interlocutors play different roles in dialogue, and the coordi- nation between these roles facilitates the success- ful unfolding of dialogue. Our account identifies two such macro-level roles: topic leader vs. fol- lower. From the perspective of Interactive Align- ment, interactions between interlocutors in a di- alogue are accompanied by the alignment of lin- guistic elements at multiple levels, including syn- tactic rules. Thus, the micro-level convergence of syntactic complexity is predicted by the IAM. Therefore, our findings point to the possibility of a unified perspective that combines the two theo- ries.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that we present some novel ideas about the scope of convergence. Ex- isting studies focus on the alignment effect that is observable throughout the whole conversation. In our case, the convergence of syntactic complexity occurs within smaller scope: the topic episodes. Note that the direction of convergence is dynamic: a speaker of higher complexity in one episode might be of lower complexity in the next episode, depending on her role. The next questions aris- ing from these patterns mirror those asked of other types of alignment: is complexity alignment pur- poseful, is it controlled by individual differences or situational goals, and can it predict task suc- cess? We leave these questions for future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Contrast the syntactic complexity of a simple sentence (a) vs. a complex sentence (b).
