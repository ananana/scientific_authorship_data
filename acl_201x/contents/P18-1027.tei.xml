				<p>We know very little about how neural language models (LM) use prior linguistic context. In this paper, we investigate the role of context in an LSTM LM, through ablation studies. Specifically, we analyze the increase in perplexity when prior context words are shuffled, replaced, or dropped. On two standard datasets, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2, we find that the model is capable of using about 200 tokens of context on average, but sharply distinguishes nearby context (recent 50 tokens) from the distant history. The model is highly sensitive to the order of words within the most recent sentence, but ignores word order in the long-range context (beyond 50 tokens), suggesting the distant past is modeled only as a rough semantic field or topic. We further find that the neural caching model (Grave et al., 2017b) especially helps the LSTM to copy words from within this distant context. Overall, our analysis not only provides a better understanding of how neural LMs use their context, but also sheds light on recent success from cache-based models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language models are an important component of natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation and summarization. They use context (a sequence of words) to estimate a probability distribution of the upcoming word. For several years now, neural language models (NLMs) <ref type="bibr">(Graves, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jozefowicz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Grave et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dauphin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Melis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yang et al., 2018</ref>) have consistently outperformed classical n-gram models, an im- provement often attributed to their ability to model long-range dependencies in faraway context. Yet, how these NLMs use the context is largely unex- plained.</p><p>Recent studies have begun to shed light on the information encoded by Long Short-Term Mem- ory (LSTM) networks. They can remember sen- tence lengths, word identity, and word order ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adi et al., 2017)</ref>, can capture some syntactic structures such as subject-verb agreement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Linzen et al., 2016)</ref>, and can model certain kinds of semantic compositionality such as negation and intensifica- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Li et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>However, all of the previous work studies LSTMs at the sentence level, even though they can potentially encode longer context. Our goal is to complement the prior work to provide a richer un- derstanding of the role of context, in particular, long-range context beyond a sentence. We aim to answer the following questions: (i) How much context is used by NLMs, in terms of the number of tokens? (ii) Within this range, are nearby and long-range contexts represented differently? (iii) How do copy mechanisms help the model use dif- ferent regions of context?</p><p>We investigate these questions via ablation stud- ies on a standard LSTM language model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Merity et al., 2018</ref>) on two benchmark language modeling datasets: Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. Given a pretrained language model, we perturb the prior context in various ways at test time, to study how much the perturbed information affects model per- formance. Specifically, we alter the context length to study how many tokens are used, permute to- kens to see if LSTMs care about word order in both local and global contexts, and drop and re- place target words to test the copying abilities of LSTMs with and without an external copy mech- anism, such as the neural cache ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Grave et al., 2017b</ref>). The cache operates by first recording tar-get words and their context representations seen in the history, and then encouraging the model to copy a word from the past when the current con- text representation matches that word's recorded context vector.</p><p>We find that the LSTM is capable of using about 200 tokens of context on average, with no observ- able differences from changing the hyperparame- ter settings. Within this context range, word or- der is only relevant within the 20 most recent to- kens or about a sentence. In the long-range con- text, order has almost no effect on performance, suggesting that the model maintains a high-level, rough semantic representation of faraway words. Finally, we find that LSTMs can regenerate some words seen in the nearby context, but heavily rely on the cache to help them copy words from the long-range context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Language Modeling</head><p>Language models assign probabilities to se- quences of words. In practice, the probability can be factorized using the chain rule P (w 1 , . . . , w t ) = t Y i=1 P (w i |w i1 , . . . , w 1 ), and language models compute the conditional probability of a target word w t given its preced- ing context, w 1 , . . . , w t1 .</p><p>Language models are trained to minimize the negative log likelihood of the training corpus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">NLL = 1 T T X t=1</formula><p>log P (w t |w t1 , . . . , w 1 ), and the model's performance is usually evaluated by perplexity (PP) on a held-out set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">PP = exp(NLL).</formula><p>When testing the effect of ablations, we focus on comparing differences in the language model's losses (NLL) on the dev set, which is equivalent to relative improvements in perplexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head><p>Our goal is to investigate the effect of contextual features such as the length of context, word or- der and more, on LSTM performance. Thus, we use ablation analysis, during evaluation, to mea- sure changes in model performance in the absence of certain contextual information. <ref type="table">Dev  Test  Dev  Test   # Tokens  73,760 82,430 217,646 245,569  Perplexity (no cache) 59.07 56.89</ref> 67.29 64.51 Avg.

In this study, we observe the change in perplexity or NLL when the model is fed a perturbed context (w t1 , . . . , w 1 ), at test time. refers to the perturbation function, and we experiment with perturbations such as dropping tokens, shuffling/reversing tokens, and replacing tokens with other words from the vocabulary. 1 It is important to note that we do not train the model with these perturbations. This is because the aim is to start with an LSTM that has been trained in the standard fashion, and discover how much context it uses and which features in nearby vs. long-range context are important. Hence, the mismatch in training and test is a necessary part of experiment design, and all measured losses are upper bounds which would likely be lower, were the model also trained to handle such perturbations.</p><p>We use a standard LSTM language model, trained and finetuned using the Averaging SGD optimizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Merity et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We also augment the model with a cache only for Section 6.2, in order to investigate why an external copy mech- anism is helpful. A short description of the ar- chitecture and a detailed list of hyperparameters is listed in Appendix A, and we refer the reader to the original paper for additional details.</p><p>We analyze two datasets commonly used for language modeling, Penn Treebank (PTB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Marcus et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mikolov et al., 2010)</ref> and Wikitext-2 (Wiki) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Merity et al., 2017)</ref>. PTB consists of Wall Street Journal news articles with 0.9M tokens for training and a 10K vocabulary. Wiki is a larger and more diverse dataset, con- taining Wikipedia articles across many topics with 2.1M tokens for training and a 33K vocabulary. Additional dataset statistics are provided in <ref type="table">Ta-ble 1</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present results only on the dev sets, in order to avoid revealing details about the test sets. However, we have confirmed that all re- sults are consistent with those on the test sets. In addition, for all experiments we report averaged results from three models trained with different random seeds. Some of the figures provided con- tain trends from only one of the two datasets and the corresponding figures for the other dataset are provided in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">How much context is used?</head><p>LSTMs are designed to capture long-range depen- dencies in sequences (Hochreiter and <ref type="bibr">Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>). In practice, LSTM language models are provided an infinite amount of prior context, which is as long as the test sequence goes. How- ever, it is unclear how much of this history has a direct impact on model performance. In this sec- tion, we investigate how many tokens of context achieve a similar loss (or 1-2% difference in model perplexity) to providing the model infinite context. We consider this the effective context size.</p><p>LSTM language models have an effective con- text size of about 200 tokens on average. We determine the effective context size by varying the number of tokens fed to the model. In particular, at test time, we feed the model the most recent n tokens:</p><p>truncate (w t1 , . . . , w 1 ) = (w t1 , . . . , w tn ), (1) where n &gt; 0 and all tokens farther away from the target w t are dropped. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We compare the dev loss (NLL) from truncated context, to that of the infinite-context setting where all previous words are fed to the model. The resulting increase in loss indicates how important the dropped tokens are for the model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref> shows that the difference in dev loss, between truncated-and infinite-context variants of the test setting, gradually diminishes as we in- crease n from 5 tokens to 1000 tokens. In particu- lar, we only see a 1% increase in perplexity as we move beyond a context of 150 tokens on PTB and 250 tokens on Wiki. Hence, we provide empirical evidence to show that LSTM language models do, in fact, model long-range dependencies, without help from extra context vectors or caches.</p><p>Changing hyperparameters does not change the effective context size. NLM performance has been shown to be sensitive to hyperparame- ters such as the dropout rate and model size <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Melis et al., 2018)</ref>. To investigate if these hyperpa- rameters affect the effective context size as well, we train separate models by varying the follow- ing hyperparameters one at a time: (1) number of timesteps for truncated back-propogation (2) dropout rate, (3) model size (hidden state size, number of layers, and word embedding size). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>, we show that while different hyperpa- rameter settings result in different perplexities in the infinite-context setting, the trend of how per- plexity changes as we reduce the context size re- mains the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Do different types of words need different amounts of context?</head><p>The effective context size determined in the pre- vious section is aggregated over the entire cor- pus, which ignores the type of the upcoming word. Boyd-Graber and Blei (2009) have previously in- vestigated the differences in context used by dif- ferent types of words and found that function words rely on less context than content words. We investigate whether the effective context size varies across different types of words, by catego- rizing them based on either frequency or parts-of- speech. Specifically, we vary the number of con- text tokens in the same way as the previous sec- tion, and aggregate loss over words within each class separately.</p><p>Infrequent words need more context than fre- quent words. We categorize words that appear at least 800 times in the training set as frequent, and the rest as infrequent. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref> shows that the loss of frequent words is insensitive to missing context beyond the 50 most recent tokens, which holds across the two datasets. Infrequent words, on the other hand, require more than 200 tokens.</p><p>Content words need more context than function words. Given the parts-of-speech of each word, we define content words as nouns, verbs and adjec- tives, and function words as prepositions and de- terminers. 4 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1d</ref> shows that the loss of nouns and verbs is affected by distant context, whereas when the target word is a determiner, the model only relies on words within the last 10 tokens.  Discussion. Overall, we find that the model's ef- fective context size is dynamic. It depends on the target word, which is consistent with what we know about language, e.g., determiners require less context than nouns <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2009)</ref>. In addition, these findings are consistent with those previously reported for different lan- guage models and datasets ( <ref type="bibr">Hill et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wang and Cho, 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Nearby vs. long-range context</head><p>An effective context size of 200 tokens allows for representing linguistic information at many lev- els of abstraction, such as words, sentences, top- ics, etc. In this section, we investigate the impor- tance of contextual information such as word order and word identity. Unlike prior work that studies LSTM embeddings at the sentence level, we look at both nearby and faraway context, and analyze how the language model treats contextual informa- tion presented in different regions of the context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Does word order matter?</head><p>Adi et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2017)</ref> have shown that LSTMs are aware of word order within a sentence. We investi- gate whether LSTM language models are sensitive to word order within a larger context window. To determine the range in which word order affects model performance, we permute substrings in the context to observe their effect on dev loss com- pared to the unperturbed baseline. In particular, we perturb the context as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">permute (w t1 , . . . , w tn ) = (w t1 , .., ⇢(w ts 1 1 , .., w ts 2 ), .., w tn )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ⇢ 2 {shu✏e, reverse} and (s 1 , s 2 ] denotes the range of the substring to be permuted. We re- fer to this substring as the permutable span. For  the following analysis, we distinguish local word order, within 20-token permutable spans which are the length of an average sentence, from global word order, which extends beyond local spans to include all the farthest tokens in the history. We consider selecting permutable spans within a con- text of n = 300 tokens, which is greater than the effective context size.</p><p>Local word order only matters for the most re- cent 20 tokens. We can locate the region of con- text beyond which the local word order has no rel- evance, by permuting word order locally at various points within the context. We accomplish this by varying s 1 and setting s 2 = s 1 + 20. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2a</ref> shows that local word order matters very much within the most recent 20 tokens, and far less be- yond that.</p><p>Global order of words only matters for the most recent 50 tokens. Similar to the local word or- der experiment, we locate the point beyond which the general location of words within the context is irrelevant, by permuting global word order. We achieve this by varying s 1 and fixing s 2 = n. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 2b</ref> demonstrates that after 50 tokens, shuffling or reversing the remaining words in the context has no effect on the model performance.</p><p>In order to determine whether this is due to in- sensitivity to word order or whether the language model is simply not sensitive to any changes in the long-range context, we further replace words in the permutable span with a randomly sampled sequence of the same length from the training set. The gap between the permutation and replacement curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2b</ref> illustrates that the identity of words in the far away context is still relevant, and only the order of the words is not.</p><p>Discussion. These results suggest that word or- der matters only within the most recent sentence, beyond which the order of sentences matters for 2-3 sentences (determined by our experiments on global word order). After 50 tokens, word or- der has almost no effect, but the identity of those words is still relevant, suggesting a high-level, rough semantic representation for these faraway words. In light of these observations, we define 50 tokens as the boundary between nearby and long- range context, for the rest of this study. Next, we investigate the importance of different word types in the different regions of context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Types of words and the region of context</head><p>Open-class or content words such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, contribute more to the semantic context of natural language than func- tion words such as determiners and prepositions. Given our observation that the language model represents long-range context as a rough seman- tic representation, a natural question to ask is how important are function words in the long-range <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Effect of dropping content and function words from 300 tokens of context relative to an un- perturbed baseline, on PTB. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Dropping both content and function words 5 tokens away from the target results in a nontrivial increase in loss, whereas be- yond 20 tokens, only content words are relevant.</p><p>context? Below, we study the effect of these two classes of words on the model's performance. Function words are defined as all words that are not nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs.</p><p>Content words matter more than function words. To study the effect of content and func- tion words on model perplexity, we drop them from different regions of the context and compare the resulting change in loss. Specifically, we per- turb the context as follows, drop (w t1 , . . . , w tn ) = (w t1 , .., w ts 1 , f pos (y, (w ts 1 1 , .., w tn )))</p><p>where f pos (y, span) is a function that drops all words with POS tag y in a given span. s 1 denotes the starting offset of the perturbed subsequence.</p><p>For these experiments, we set s 1 2 {5, 20, 100}. On average, there are slightly more content words than function words in any given text. As shown in Section 4, dropping more words results in higher loss. To eliminate the effect of dropping differ- ent fractions of words, for each experiment where we drop a specific word type, we add a control experiment where the same number of tokens are sampled randomly from the context, and dropped. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows that dropping content words as close as 5 tokens from the target word increases model perplexity by about 65%, whereas dropping the same proportion of tokens at random, results in a much smaller 17% increase. Dropping all func- tion words, on the other hand, is not very differ- ent from dropping the same proportion of words at random, but still increases loss by about 15%. This suggests that within the most recent sentence, content words are extremely important but func- tion words are also relevant since they help main- tain grammaticality and syntactic structure. On the other hand, beyond a sentence, only content words have a sizeable influence on model performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">To cache or not to cache?</head><p>As shown in Section 5.1, LSTM language models use a high-level, rough semantic representation for long-range context, suggesting that they might not be using information from any specific words lo- cated far away. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adi et al. (2017)</ref> have also shown that while LSTMs are aware of which words ap- pear in their context, this awareness degrades with increasing length of the sequence. However, the success of copy mechanisms such as attention and caching ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahdanau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hill et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Merity et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grave et al., 2017a,b)</ref> suggests that information in the distant context is very use- ful. Given this fact, can LSTMs copy any words from context without relying on external copy mechanisms? Do they copy words from nearby and long-range context equally? How does the caching model help? In this section, we investi- gate these questions by studying how LSTMs copy words from different regions of context. More specifically, we look at two regions of context, nearby (within 50 most recent tokens) and long- range (beyond 50 tokens), and study three cate- gories of target words: those that can be copied from nearby context (C near ), those that can only be copied from long-range context (C far ), and those that cannot be copied at all given a limited context (C none ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Can LSTMs copy words without caches?</head><p>Even without a cache, LSTMs often regenerate words that have already appeared in prior context. We investigate how much the model relies on the previous occurrences of the upcoming target word, by analyzing the change in loss after dropping and replacing this target word in the context.  Replacing the target word with other tokens from vocabulary hurts more than dropping it from the context, for words that can be copied from nearby context, but has no effect on words that can only be copied from far away.</p><p>of target word occurrences in context, we experi- ment with dropping all the distant context versus dropping only occurrences of the target word from the context. In particular, we compare removing all tokens after the 50 most recent tokens, (Equa- tion 1 with n = 50), versus removing only the target word, in context of size n = 300:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">drop (w t1 , . . . , w tn ) = f word (w t , (w t1 , . . . , w tn )),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where f word (w, span) drops words equal to w in a given span. We compare applying both perturba- tions to a baseline model with unperturbed context restricted to n = 300. We also include the target words that never appear in the context (C none ) as a control set for this experiment.</p><p>The results show that LSTMs rely on the rough semantic representation of the faraway context to generate C far , but direclty copy C near from the nearby context. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4a</ref>, the long-range con- text bars show that for words that can only be copied from long-range context (C far ), removing all distant context is far more disruptive than re- moving only occurrences of the target word (12% and 2% increase in perplexity, respectively). This suggests that the model relies more on the rough semantic representation of faraway context to pre- dict these C far tokens, rather than directly copy- ing them from the distant context. On the other hand, for words that can be copied from nearby context (C near ), removing all long-range context has a smaller effect (about 3.5% increase in per- plexity) as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4a</ref>, compared to remov- ing the target word which increases perplexity by almost 9%. This suggests that these C near tokens are more often copied from nearby context, than inferred from information found in the rough se- mantic representation of long-range context.</p><p>However, is it possible that dropping the tar- get tokens altogether, hurts the model too much by adversely affecting grammaticality of the con- text? We test this theory by replacing target words in the context with other words from the vocab- ulary. This perturbation is similar to Equation 4, except instead of dropping the token, we replace it with a different one. In particular, we exper- iment with replacing the target with &lt;unk&gt;, to see if having the generic word is better than not having any word. We also replace it with a word that has the same part-of-speech tag and a simi- lar frequency in the dataset, to observe how much this change confuses the model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4b</ref> shows that replacing the target with other words results in up to a 14% increase in perplexity for C near , which suggests that the replacement token seems to confuse the model far more than when the to- ken is simply dropped. However, the words that rely on the long-range context, C far , are largely unaffected by these changes, which confirms our conclusion from dropping the target tokens: C far witnesses in the morris film &lt;/s&gt; served up as a solo however the music lacks the UNK provided by a context within another medium &lt;/s&gt; UNK of mr. glass may agree with the critic richard UNK 's sense that the NUM music in twelve parts is as UNK and UNK as the UNK UNK &lt;/s&gt; but while making the obvious point that both UNK develop variations from themes this comparison UNK the intensely UNK nature of mr. glass &lt;/s&gt; snack-food UNK increased a strong NUM NUM in the third quarter while domestic profit increased in double UNK mr. calloway said &lt;/s&gt; excluding the british snack-food business acquired in july snack-food international UNK jumped NUM NUM with sales strong in spain mexico and brazil &lt;/s&gt; total snack-food profit rose NUM NUM &lt;/s&gt; led by pizza hut and UNK bell restaurant earnings increased about NUM NUM in the third quarter on a NUM NUM sales increase &lt;/s&gt; UNK sales for pizza hut rose about NUM NUM while UNK bell 's increased NUM NUM as the chain continues to benefit from its UNK strategy &lt;/s&gt; UNK bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its UNK &lt;/s&gt; same UNK for kentucky fried chicken which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products rose only NUM NUM &lt;/s&gt; the operation which has been slow to respond to consumers ' shifting UNK away from fried foods has been developing a UNK product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year &lt;/s&gt; the new product has performed well in a market test in las vegas nev. mr. calloway send a delegation of congressional staffers to poland to assist its legislature the UNK in democratic procedures &lt;/s&gt; senator pete UNK calls this effort the first gift of democracy &lt;/s&gt; the poles might do better to view it as a UNK horse &lt;/s&gt; it is the vast shadow government of NUM congressional staffers that helps create such legislative UNK as the NUM page UNK reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the united states &lt;/s&gt; maybe after the staffers explain their work to the poles they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the american people &lt;/s&gt; UNK UNK plc a financially troubled irish maker of fine crystal and UNK china reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to NUM million irish punts $ NUM million from NUM million irish punts a year earlier &lt;/s&gt; the results for the half were worse than market expectations which suggested an interim loss of around NUM million irish punts &lt;/s&gt; in a sharply weaker london market yesterday UNK shares were down NUM pence at NUM pence NUM cents &lt;/s&gt; the company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of NUM million irish sim has set a fresh target of $ NUM a share by the end of &lt;/s&gt; reaching that goal says robert t.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">How does the cache help?</head><p>If LSTMs can already regenerate words from nearby context, how are copy mechanisms help- ing the model? We answer this question by ana- lyzing how the neural cache model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Grave et al., 2017b</ref>) helps with improving model performance. The cache records the hidden state h t at each timestep t, and computes a cache distribution over the words in the history as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P cache (w t |w t1 , . . . , w 1 ; h t , . . . , h 1 ) / t1 X i=1 [w i = w t ] exp(✓h T i h t ),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where ✓ controls the flatness of the distribution. This cache distribution is then interpolated with the model's output distribution over the vocabu- lary. Consequently, certain words from the history are upweighted, encouraging the model to copy them.</p><p>Caches help words that can be copied from long-range context the most. In order to study the effectiveness of the cache for the three classes of words (C near , C far , C none ), we evaluate an LSTM language model with and without a cache, and measure the difference in perplexity for these words. In both settings, the model is pro- vided all prior context (not just 300 tokens) in or- <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Model performance relative to using a cache. Error bars represent 95% confidence inter- vals. Words that can only be copied from the dis- tant context benefit the most from using a cache.</p><p>der to replicate the <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Grave et al. (2017b)</ref> setup. The amount of history recorded, known as the cache size, is a hyperparameter set to 500 past timesteps for PTB and 3,875 for Wiki, both values very sim- ilar to the average document lengths in the respec- tive datasets. We find that the cache helps words that can only be copied from long-range context (C far ) more than words that can be copied from nearby (C near ). This is illustrated by <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> where with- out caching, C near words see a 22% increase in perplexity for PTB, and a 32% increase for Wiki, whereas C far see a 28% increase in perplexity for PTB, and a whopping 53% increase for Wiki. Thus, the cache is, in a sense, complementary to the standard model, since it especially helps regen- erate words from the long-range context where the latter falls short. However, the cache also hurts about 36% of the words in PTB and 20% in Wiki, which are words that cannot be copied from context (C none ), as illustrated by bars for "none" in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. We also provide some case studies showing success <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref> and failure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 6</ref>) modes for the cache. We find that for the successful case, the cache distribution is concentrated on a single word that it wants to copy. However, when the target is not present in the history, the cache distribution is more flat, illustrating the model's confusion, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>. This suggests that the neural cache model might benefit from having the option to ignore the cache when it cannot make a confi- dent choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>The findings presented in this paper provide a great deal of insight into how LSTMs model con- text. This information can prove extremely use- ful for improving language models. For instance, the discovery that some word types are more im- portant than others can help refine word dropout strategies by making them adaptive to the different word types. Results on the cache also show that we can further improve performance by allowing the model to ignore the cache distribution when it is extremely uncertain, such as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>. Dif- ferences in nearby vs. long-range context suggest that memory models, which feed explicit context representations to the LSTM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ghosh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lau et al., 2017)</ref>, could benefit from representa- tions that specifically capture information orthog- onal to that modeled by the LSTM.</p><p>In addition, the empirical methods used in this study are model-agnostic and can generalize to models other than the standard LSTM. This opens the path to generating a stronger understanding of model classes beyond test set perplexities, by com- paring them across additional axes of information such as how much context they use on average, or how robust they are to shuffled contexts. Given the empirical nature of this study and the fact that the model and data are tightly coupled, separating model behavior from language charac- teristics, has proved challenging. More specifi- cally, a number of confounding factors such as vo- cabulary size, dataset size etc. make this separa- tion difficult. In an attempt to address this, we have chosen PTB and Wiki -two standard lan- guage modeling datasets which are diverse in con- tent (news vs. factual articles) and writing style, and are structured differently (eg: Wiki articles are 4-6x longer on average and contain extra informa- tion such as titles and paragraph/section markers). Making the data sources diverse in nature, has pro- vided the opportunity to somewhat isolate effects of the model, while ensuring consistency in re- sults. An interesting extension to further study this separation would lie in experimenting with differ- ent model classes and even different languages.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chelba et al. (2017)</ref>, in proposing a new model, showed that on PTB, an LSTM lan- guage model with 13 tokens of context is similar to the infinite-context LSTM performance, with close to an 8% 5 increase in perplexity. This is compared to a 25% increase at 13 tokens of con- text in our setup. We believe this difference is attributed to the fact that their model was trained with restricted context and a different error propa- gation scheme, while ours is not. Further investi- gation would be an interesting direction for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this analytic study, we have empirically shown that a standard LSTM language model can effec- tively use about 200 tokens of context on two benchmark datasets, regardless of hyperparame- ter settings such as model size. It is sensitive to word order in the nearby context, but less so in the long-range context. In addition, the model is able to regenerate words from nearby context, but heavily relies on caches to copy words from far away. These findings not only help us better un- derstand these models but also suggest ways for improving them, as discussed in Section 7. While observations in this paper are reported at the to- ken level, deeper understanding of sentence-level interactions warrants further investigation, which we leave to future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Effects of varying the number of tokens provided in the context, as compared to the same model provided with infinite context.
