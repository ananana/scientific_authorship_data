				<p>In this paper, we present a test collection for mathematical information retrieval composed of real-life, research-level mathematical information needs. Topics and relevance judgements have been procured from the on-line collaboration website MathOverflow by delegating domain-specific decisions to experts on-line. With our test collection, we construct a baseline using Lucene&apos;s vector-space model implementation and conduct an experiment to investigate how prior extraction of technical terms from mathematical text can affect retrieval efficiency. We show that by boosting the importance of technical terms, statistically significant improvements in retrieval performance can be obtained over the baseline.</p>

Like many general-purpose, domain- specific IR test collections, the NTCIR collection is composed of broad queries intended to test sys- tems over a wide spectrum of query complexity.</p><p>In this paper we present a test collection composed of real-life, research-level mathemat- ical topics and associated relevance judgements procured from the online collaboration web-site MathOverflow <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . The resulting test collection con- 1 http://mathoverflow.net/ tains 160 atomic questions -material derived from 120 MathOverflow discussion threads.</p><p>Topics in our test collection capture specialised information needs that are complex to resolve and often demand collective effort from multiple do- main experts. For example 2 :</p><p>The "most symmetric" Mukai-Umemura 3-fold with automorphism group P GL(2, C) admits Due to their specialised nature, our topics have a relatively small number of relevant documents. Fortunately, there is precedent of this from IR tasks such as QA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ishikawa et al., 2010)</ref> and known-item search ( <ref type="bibr">Craswell et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>With our test collection, we construct a baseline using Lucene's default implementation of the vec- tor space model (VSM). Additionally, we conduct an experiment designed to investigate the hypoth- esis that technical terms in mathematics have ele- vated retrieval significance.</p><p>Information in mathematics is communicated by defining, manipulating and otherwise operat- ing on mathematical structures and objects which can be instantiated in the mathematical discourse. In this sense, technical terminology in mathemat- ics has an elevated role. This hypothesis stems from the observation that the mathematical dis- course is dense with named mathematical objects, structures, properties and results.</p><p>In the next section, we present our test collec- tion and discuss the procedure for its construction from crowd-sourced expertise on MathOverflow. In section 3, we discuss related material in the lit- erature and compare it to our work. Our experi- mental setup and results are discussed in section 4, with a brief summary of our work presented in section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Test Collection</head><p>The main motivation behind this work comes from our long-term goal to develop and evalu- ate MIR models intended to satisfy research-level mathematical information needs. Evaluation is an important final step in the development of IR mod- els and is preconditioned on the availability of a test collection.</p><p>A test collection is a resource composed of (1) a document collection (or corpus) with uniquely identifiable documents (e.g., scientific papers, news articles), (2) a set of topics from which search queries can be produced and (3) a set of relevance judgements: pairs connecting individual topics to documents (in the corpus) known to sat- isfy the corresponding information need.</p><p>General-purpose MIR test collections, such as the one produced for NTCIR-10 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aizawa et al., 2013)</ref>, are expected to contain both broad and nar- row topics capturing a wide range of retrieval com- plexity. In contrast, we require a collection of topics characterised by a higher lower bound on topic complexity with individual topics capturing highly-specialised, real-world information needs.</p><p>Unfortunately, research-level mathematical in- formation needs are hard to source from docu- ments in a way that would not render them arti- ficial. Furthermore, manual construction of topics and relevance judgements is unrealistic due to the large number of experts required to cover the var- ious specialised sub-fields of mathematics. This, coupled with limited access to numerous MIR sys- tems, makes TREC-like pooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Harman, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Voorhees and Harman, 2005</ref>) impractical.</p><p>We propose that topics and relevance judge- ments be procured from the on-line collaboration website MathOverflow (MO), an online QA site for research mathematicians. A user (informa- tion seeker) can post a question on the site, usu- ally relating to a small niche field in mathemat- ics. Colleagues can either post a candidate answer, comment on the question, comment on and/or up- Prelude 1) Apparently, physicist can calculate the GW invariants of quintic CY 3-fold up to genus 51. 2) For each genus g, there is a lower bound d(g) such that for every d &lt; d(g), all genus g degree d invariants of quintic are zero. MT-1 I am looking for a reference that has a table of these number for some low degrees (say up to degree 5) and low genera (at least until g = 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MT-2</head><p>Where can I found this lower bound? <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: MO post 14655, prelude and micro-topics vote existing answers. Ultimately, the information seeker decides which answer satisfies the underly- ing information need by marking it as "accepted". Material on MO is closely aligned with our re- quirements. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tausczik et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Martin and Pease (2013)</ref> agree that MO ques- tions (information needs) arise from doing mathe- matics research and are novel to the mathemati- cian involved. The authors conclude that, hav- ing been produced by experts, MO answers are authoritative and partially credit the website's re- ward system for their strong reliability.</p><p>MO questions often have multiple sub-parts, which we refer to as micro-topics since they en- code atomic information needs. Furthermore, in- formation in MO questions is carried by two types of sentences: prelude sentences, which are used to set the mathematical context (introduce mathemat- ical constructs and results) and query sentences, which transcribe the information need itself and are semantically bound to the accompanying pre- lude.</p><p>As the underlying document collection, we have used the Mathematical Retrieval Corpus (MREC) 3 (Líška et al., 2011), which contains more than 439,000 mathematical publications, complete with mathematical formulae converted to machine- readable MathML. Similarly, we have made math- ematical expressions in our topics accessible to MIR systems by converting all L A T E X embedded in MO questions into MathML using the LaTeXML tool-kit.</p><p>For the purpose of constructing our test collec- tion we have adopted a multi-step process. All steps in the process are systematically applicable regardless of the subject material of the topic be- ing considered for inclusion. As such, our test collection can be as diverse, in terms of mathe- matical subject and sub-fields, as MathOverflow.</p><p>Decisions relating to relevance of material to a given topic (MO question) are delegated to experts on the website. However, the information seeker (MO user posting the question) remains the ulti- mate judge of relevance. This authority is typi- cally exercised by either accepting an answer di- rectly or, by explicitly commenting on the rele- vance of posted material.</p><p>In the first step, all MO discussion threads 4 with at least one citation to the MREC in their accepted answer were collected. Each identified thread was examined by one of the authors for conformance to two ideal-standard criteria: (1) Useful MO ques- tions should not be too broad or vague but rather express an information need that is clear and can be satisfied by describing objects or properties, stating conditions and/or producing examples or counter-examples. (2) MREC documents cited in MO accepted answers should address all sub-parts of the question in a manner that requires minimal deduction and do not synthesise mathematical re- sults from multiple resources.</p><p>Subsequently, relevance of documents for each micro-topic is decided using two criteria: totality and directness. A cited resource is total if it con- tains all necessary information to derive the an- swer for the micro-topic and partial if it only ad- dresses a special case. A cited resource is also said to be direct, if the answer can be derived with lit- tle intellectual effort from its text, or indirect if the same information requires considerable effort (such as mathematical deduction or reasoning) for the information seeker to reproduce.</p><p>Making these determinations involves matching the language of arguments and the symbolic con- text of the answer to the cited resource. As part of this step, we also examine the post-answer (PA) comments for expressions of confirmation of the usefulness of a cited resource from the informa- tion seeker.</p><p>The completed test collection contains 160 micro-topics with 184 associated relevance judge- ments (involving 224 unique MREC documents) organised in 120 topics. Topic text in our test collection is sentence tokenised, with relevance judgements being represented conceptually as tu- ples of the form:</p><p>( T o p i c ID , s e n t e n c e I D , Micro−t o p i c ID , r e l e v a n t MREC document ID )</p><p>From </p><note type="other">Micro-topics 1 2 3 ≥ 4 Instances (topics) 88 24 8 0 Percentage</note><p>73.33% 20.00 % 6.67% 0% <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>: Topic/Micro-topic break-down topics (93.33%) have either 1 or 2 micro-topics, with the average being close to 1 (1.33). The ma- jority of topics (97,80.83%) have only one rele- vant document while a further 21 (17.5%) have two relevant documents. Two topics have more than 2 relevant documents: one with 3 and an- other with 4. In terms of micro-topics, this cor- responds to 140 micro-topics (87.50%) with 1 rel- evant document, 17 (10.625%) with 2, 2 micro- topics (1.25%) with 3 and just one (0.625%) with 4 relevant documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Test collections over scientific publications were first introduced for the Cranfield experiments <ref type="bibr">(Cleverdon, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cleverdon, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cleverdon et al., 1966a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cleverdon et al., 1966b</ref>). Despite crit- icism for sourcing queries from collection docu- ments, the Cranfield experiments highlighted the importance of jointly reporting recall and preci- sion, pioneered the practice of using authors and citations for augmenting relevance judgements and established the test collection paradigm.</p><p>Expert citations have already been exploited for procuring relevance judgements. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ritchie et al. (2006)</ref> elicited relevance judgements for citations in papers accepted in a scientific con- ference from their authors and used these judge- ments as part of their test collection of scientific publications.</p><p>In terms of domain, our work is related to the NTCIR-10 Math IR test collection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aizawa et al., 2013</ref>). Furthermore, the topics in our collec- tion are analogous to those in the NTCIR full-text search, in the sense that they take the form of co- herent text interspersed with mathematical expres- sions. Rather than being focused on accommodat- ing information needs of varying complexity, how- ever, our test collection has been designed to facil- itate retrieval of highly specialised, mathematical information needs of uniformly high complexity.</p><p>Similar use of crowd-sourced expertise has been proposed in the context of QA. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gyongyi et al. (2008)</ref>, examined 10 months-worth of "Yahoo! Answers" material as part of an investi- gation of QA data, which was later used for the NTCIR-8 Community QA pilot task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ishikawa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Sakai et al., 2011</ref>). Characterisation of crowd-sourced answers in terms of totality (sec- tion 2) has also been considered in the context of QA. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Sakai et al. (2011)</ref> describe a relevance grading scheme of crowd-sourced an- swers based on the total/partial/irrelevant scale, but highlight that answers on "Yahoo! Answers" vary in quality (e.g., due to instances of bias or obscenity).</p><p>Finally, the idea of sourcing relevance judge- ments from expert citations is an established prac- tice in IR. In the context of patent search, for ex- ample, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Graf and Azzopardi (2008)</ref> utilised cita- tions in patent office expert reports as relevance judgements, while <ref type="bibr">Fujii et al. (2006)</ref> automatically extracted patent office expert citations used to re- ject patent applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In this section we conduct an experiment to demonstrate the usefulness of our test collection by investigating the impact of terminology boost- ing on MIR effectiveness. An important assump- tion of this experiment is that the retrieval of each micro-topic is dependent only on the attached pre- lude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>We first produced a Lucene index over all docu- ments in the MREC. In order to normalise process- ing of XHTML+MathML, topics and MREC doc- uments were passed through the Tika framework 5 . Lucene's StandardAnalyzer was modified to preserve stop-words since frequent words such as the preposition "of" can be important parts of technical terms (e.g., "set of vectors"). The ana- lyzer was also modified to preserve dashes, which are common in technical terms (e.g., "Calabi-Yau manifold"). This analyzer is used during both in- dexing and query processing for consistency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Building Queries</head><p>For each micro-topic in a given topic, we emit a query string by concatenating all sentences in the prelude with sentences associated with the micro- topic. For example, query string for micro-topic MT-1 in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> is generated by concatenating its text with that of the prelude. Using this strat- egy, consistency with the assumption outlined at <ref type="bibr">5</ref> https://tika.apache.org/ the beginning of the section is achieved since no overlap beyond the prelude is introduced between queries generated for micro-topics attached to a given topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Systems</head><p>Using Lucene as the indexing and searching back- end, we compare the performance of two retrieval methods. Underpinning both methods is Lucene's default similarity <ref type="bibr">(project, 2013)</ref>, which is based on cosine similarity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">sim(q, d) = V (q).V (d) |V (q)||V (d)|</formula><p>where V (q) and V (d) are weighted vectors for the query and candidate document respectively. As a performance measure, we use mean average pre- cision (MAP):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M AP (Q) = 1 |Q| |Q| j=1 1 m j m j k=1 P recision(R jk )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Baseline</head><p>Lucene's VSM implementation with default TF- IDF weighting and scoring is used as the baseline. This is intended to emulate a general-purpose in- formation retrieval scenario, which is the motiva- tion behind the design of Lucene's default config- uration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Boosted Technical Terms</head><p>The alternative model is designed to give more weight to technical terminology common to both documents and queries. In order to construct this model, all technical terms are extracted from the document collection using an implementation of the C-Value multi-word technical term extraction method ( <ref type="bibr">Frantzi et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frantzi et al., 1998)</ref>. Given an input corpus, the C-Value method ex- tracts multi-word terms by making use of a lin- guistic and a statistical component. The linguistic component is responsible for eliminating multi-term strings that are unlikely to be technical terms through the use of a stop-list (composed of high-frequency corpus terms) and linguistic filters (regular expressions) applied on sequences of part-of-speech tags. The statistical component assigns a "termhood" score to a candi- date term sequence based on corpus-wide statisti- cal characteristics of the sequence itself and those of term sequences that contain it.

In total, 3 mil- lion classes of technical terms have been detected in the MREC. Using Lucene's positional index- ing mechanism, we retrieved the position of each technical term (all forms), recorded its term fre- quency (TF) and produced a new technical term index. This technical term index contains 426 mil- lion tuple entries of the form The same re-indexing process is repeated for the queries and the result is stored in a separate query table (10,433 entries). Subsequently, the indexed document and query term vectors were modified by (1) adding new to- kens to represent technical term phrases and (2) re- attributing the TF of component terms to the term vector of the phrase.</p><p>Finally, the text for each MREC document and query is re-generated from the term vectors and stored in a "delta index". At this stage, the num- ber of technical term instances emitted is twice that recorded by the original term vector. This has the effect of boosting the significance of technical terms and phrases. An example of the application of this process, from original text to delta index generation is presented in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Rankings for the alternative model can be obtained by search- ing the delta index using the re-generated query.</p></div>

We observe that the difference in MAP is in favour of the alternative model. This difference is statistically significant at α = 0.05 using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p &lt; 0.05). Therefore, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that, in the context of the VSM, boosting techni- cal terms improves retrieval efficiency of research mathematics.</p><p>When compared to MAP scores produced by the same systems in more traditional IR tasks, the scores in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> may seem poor. We attribute this phenomenon to the fact that sense in written math- ematics is communicated via a complex interac- tion of text and mathematical expressions and is thus hard to extract using shallow methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Further Work</head><p>We have constructed a Math IR test collection for real-life, research-level mathematical information needs. As part of the work of constructing our test collection, we have developed a methodology for compiling domain-specific test collections that re- quires minimal expertise in the domain itself.</p><p>Using 160 micro-topics in our test collection, we have shown experimentally that the perfor- mance of VSM-based retrieval models with re- search mathematics can be improved by boosting the importance of technical terminology. Further- more, our experimental work suggests that our test collection can be used to identify statistically sig- nificant differences between MIR systems. It is our intention to make our collection available to the IR community.</p><p>As part of on-going and future work, we will be incorporating additional retrieval models, such as the Okapi BM25, in our evaluation framework. In addition, we are looking into investigating the sta- tistical properties of our test collection along the lines of Harman (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Soboroff et al.
