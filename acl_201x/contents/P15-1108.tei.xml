				<p>Complex conjunctions and determiners are often considered as pretokenized units in parsing. This is not always realistic, since they can be ambiguous. We propose a model for joint dependency parsing and multiword expressions identification, in which complex function words are represented as individual tokens linked with morphological dependencies. Our graph-based parser includes standard second-order features and verbal subcategoriza-tion features derived from a syntactic lexicon .We train it on a modified version of the French Treebank enriched with morphological dependencies. It recognizes 81.79% of ADV+que conjunctions with 91.57% precision, and 82.74% of de+DET determiners with 86.70% precision.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Standard NLP tool suites for text analysis are of- ten made of several processes that are organized as a pipeline, in which the input of a process is the output of the preceding one. Among these processes, one commonly finds a tokenizer, which segments a sentence into words, a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, which associates to every word a part-of-speech tag, and a syntactic parser, which builds a parse tree for the sentence <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . These three processes correspond to three formal operations on the string: segmentation into linguistically rel- evant units (words), tagging the words with POS tags and linking the (word, POS) pairs by means of syntactic dependencies.</p><p>This setup is clearly not ideal, as some decisions are made too early in the pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Branco and Silva, 2003)</ref>. More specifically, some tokenization and tagging choices are difficult to make without taking syntax into account. To avoid the pitfall of premature decisions, probabilistic tokenizers and taggers can produce several solutions in the form of lattices ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Green and Manning, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Goldberg and Elhadad, 2011</ref>). Such approaches usually lead to severe computational overhead due to the huge search space in which the parser looks for the opti- mal parse tree. Besides, the parser might be biased towards short solutions, as it compares scores of trees associated to sequences of different lengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De La Clergerie, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>This problem is particularly hard when parsing multiword expressions (MWEs), that is, groups of tokens that must be treated as single units <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baldwin and Kim, 2010)</ref>. The solution we present in this paper is different from the usual pipeline. We propose to jointly parse and tokenize MWEs, transforming segmentation decisions into linking decisions. Our experiments concentrate on two difficult tokenization cases. Hence, it is the parser that will choose, in such cases, whether to group or not several tokens.</p><p>Our first target phenomenon is the family of ADV+que constructions, a type of complex con- junction in French. They are formed by adverbs like bien (well) or ainsi (likewise) followed by the subordinative conjunction que (that). They func- tion like English complex conjunctions so that and now that. Due to their structure, ADV+que con- structions are generally ambiguous, like in the fol- lowing examples:</p><p>1. Je mange bien que je n'aie pas faim I eat although I am not hungry 2. Je pense bien que je n'ai pas faim I think indeed that I am not hungry</p><p>In example 1, the sequence bien que forms a complex conjunction (although) whereas in exam- ple 2, the adverb bien (indeed) modifies the verb pense (think), and the conjunction que (that) intro- duces the sentential complement je n'ai pas faim (I am not hungry). In treebanks, the different read- ings are represented through the use of words- with-spaces in the case of complex conjunctions.</p><p>Our second target phenomenon is the family of partitive articles which are made of the preposition de (of ) followed by the definite determiner le, la, l' or les 2 (the). These de+DET constructions are ambiguous, as shown in the following examples:</p><p>3. Il boit de la bì ere He drinks some beer 4. Il parle de labì ere I talks about the beer</p><p>In example 3, the sequence de la forms a deter- miner (some) whereas in example 4, de is a prepo- sition (about) and la is the determiner (the) of the nounbì ere bì ere).</p><p>We focus on these constructions for two rea- sons. First, because they are extremely frequent. For instance, in the frWaC corpus, from a total of 54.8M sentences, 1.15M sentences (2.1%) contain one or more occurrences of our target ADV+que constructions and 26.7M sentences (48.6%) con- tain a de+DET construction (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 1 and 2)</ref>. Moreover, in a corpus of 370 M words in French, 3 des is the 7 th most frequent word. Second, be- cause they are perfect examples of phenomena which are difficult to process by a tokenizer. In or- der to decide, in example 1, that bien que is a com- plex subordinate conjunction, non-trivial morpho- logical, lexical and syntactic clues must be taken into account, such as the subcategorization frame of the verb of the principal clause and the mood of the subordinate clause. All these clues are difficult to take into account during tokenization, where the syntactic structure of the sentence is not yet ex- plicit.</p><p>Ask the parser to perform tokenization will not always solve the problem. Even state-of-the-art parsers can fail to predict the right structure for the cases we are dealing with. The main reason is that they are trained on treebanks of limited size, and some lexico-syntactic phenomena can- not be well modeled. This brings us to the sec- ond topic of this paper, which is the integration of external linguistic resources in a treebank-trained probabilistic parser. We show that, in order to cor- 2 Sequences de le and de les do not appear as such in French. They have undergone a morpho-phonetic process known as amalgamation and are represented as tokens du and des. In our pipeline, they are artificially detokenized.</p><p>3 Newspaper Le Monde from 1986 to 2002.</p><p>rectly solve the two problems at hand, the parser must have access to lexico-syntactic information that can be found in a syntactic lexicon. We pro- pose a simple way to introduce such information in the parser by defining new linguistic features that blend smoothly with treebank features used by the parser when looking for the optimal parse tree. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de- scribes related work on MWE parsing. Section 3 proposes a way to represent multiword units by means of syntactic dependencies. In Section 4, we briefly describe the parser that has been used in this work, and in Section 5, we propose a way to integrate a syntactic lexicon into the parser. Sec- tion 6 describes the data sets used for the experi- ments, which results are presented and discussed in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The famous "pain-in-the-neck" article by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sag et al. (2002)</ref> discusses MWEs in parsers, contrasting two representation alternatives in the LinGO ERG HPSG grammar of English: compositional rules and words-with-spaces. The addition of composi- tional rules for flexible MWEs has been tested in a small-scale experiment which showed significant coverage improvements in HPSG parsing by the addition of 21 new MWEs to the grammar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Villavicencio et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that pre-grouping MWEs as words-with-spaces can improve the per- formance of shallow parsing for English <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Korkontzelos and Manandhar, 2010)</ref>. Nivre and Nils- son (2004) obtained similar results for dependency parsing of Swedish. They compare models trained on two representations: one where MWEs are linked by a special ID dependency, and another one based on gold pre-tokenization. Their results show that the former model can recognize MWEs with F1=71.1%, while the latter can significantly improve parsing accuracy and robustness in gen- eral. However, the authors admit that "it remains to be seen how much of theoretically possible im- provement can be realized when using automatic methods for MWU recognition".</p><p>Several methods of increasing complexity have been proposed for fully automatic MWE tokeniza- tion: simple lexicon projection onto a corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kulkarni and Finlayson, 2011</ref>), synchronous lex- icon lookup and parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wehrli et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Seretan, 2011</ref>), token-based classifiers trained using association measures and other contextual features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Vincze et al., 2013a</ref>), or contextual sequence models like conditional random fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Constant and Sigogne, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Constant et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vincze et al., 2013b</ref>) and structured perceptron ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al., 2014</ref>). In theory, compound function words like ADV+que and de+DET allow no inter- nal variability, thus they should be represented as words-with-spaces. However, to date no satisfac- tory solution has been proposed for automatically tokenizing ambiguous MWEs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Green et al. (2013)</ref> propose a constituency pars- ing model which, as a by-product, performs MWE identification. They propose a flat representation for contiguous expressions in which all elements are attached to a special node, and then they com- pare several parsing models, including an origi- nal factored-lexicon PCFG and a tree substitution grammar. These generic parsing models can be used for parsing in general, but they have inter- esting memorization properties which favor MWE identification. Their experiments on French and Arabic show that the proposed models beat the baseline in MWE identification while producing acceptable general parsing results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Candito and Constant (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Vincze et al. (2013c)</ref> present experiments on dependency pars- ing for MWE identification which are the closest to our settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Vincze et al. (2013c)</ref> focus on light verb constructions in Hungarian. They propose distinguishing regular verbal dependencies from light verbs and their complements through four special labels prefixed by LCV-. Then, they train the Bohnet parser (Bohnet, 2010) using standard parameters and features, and evaluate on a gold test set. They report no significant changes in at- tachment scores, whereas F1 for light verb iden- tification is 75.63%, significantly higher than the baseline methods of lexicon projection (21.25%) and classification (74.45%).</p><p>Candito and Constant (2014) compare several architectures for dependency parsing and MWE identification in French. For regular MWEs like noun compounds, they use regular expressions to automatically generate an internal syntactic struc- ture, combining standard and MWE-dedicated de- pendency labels. Irregular expressions like com- plex conjunctions are represented as separate to- kens, with a special DEP CPD dependency that links all tokens to the first MWE word <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Constant et al., 2013a</ref>). They compare different architec- tures for MWE identification before, during and after parsing, showing that the best architecture depends on whether the target MWEs are regular or irregular.</p><p>Similarly to these two papers, we use a special dependency to model MWEs and evaluate pars- ing and identification accuracy. Our work departs from theirs on three important aspects. First, we concentrate on syntactically irregular compounds, that we represent with a new kind of dependency. Second, we integrate into the parser a syntactic lexicon in order to help disambiguate ADV+que and de+DET constructions. Third, we built a spe- cific evaluation corpus to get a better estimation of the performances of our model on ADV+que and de+DET constructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The MORPH Dependency</head><p>In order to let the parser take the tokenization de- cisions, we propose not to group sequences of to- kens of the form ADV+que and de+DET at tok- enization time. Instead, we transform the task of segmentation decision into a parsing decision task.</p><p>We associate a syntactic structure to ADV+que and de+DET constructions by introducing a new type of dependency that we call MORPH. It is not a standard syntactic dependency, but a reminiscent of the morphological dependencies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mel'ˇ cuk (1988)</ref>, similar to the DEP CPD label proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Candito and Constant (2014)</ref> or the ID depen- dency of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nivre and Nilsson (2004)</ref>, except that we focus on syntactically-motivated MWEs, propos- ing a regular structure for them.</p><p>The syntactic structures of examples 1 and 2, introduced in Section 1, are represented below <ref type="bibr">4</ref>  In example 1, the complex conjunction bien que is represented by the presence of the MORPH de- pendency, whereas, in example 2, the adverb bien modifies the verb pense and que introduces its ob- ject. From an NLP perspective, the two readings are treated the same way by the tokenizer and the tagger. It is only at parsing time that the presence of the complex conjunction is predicted.</p><p>The syntactic structures of examples 3 and 4 are represented below. In example 3, the partitive ar- ticle de la is represented by means of the MORPH dependency. Example 4 exhibits a standard prepo- sitional phrase structure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Parsing</head><p>The parser used in this study is a second-order graph-based parser <ref type="bibr">(Kübler et al., 2009)</ref>. Given a sentence W = w 1 . . . w l , the parser looks for the dependency treê T of W that maximizes the score s:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ˆ T = arg max T ∈T (W ) F ∈F (T ) s(F )</formula><p>where T (W ) is the set of all possible depen- dency trees for sentence W and F(T ) is the set of all relevant subparts, called factors, of tree T and s(F ) is the score of factor F . The values of these scores are parameters estimated during training.</p><p>We can define different models of increasing complexity depending on the decomposition of the tree into factors. The most simple one is the arc- factored or first-order model, which simply de- composes a tree into single dependencies and as- signs them a score, independently of their context. We used a second-order parser which decomposes a tree into factors of three types:</p><p>1. first-order factors, made of one dependency; 2. sibling factors, made of two dependencies sharing a common governor;</p><p>3. grandchildren factors, made of two depen- dencies where the dependent of one of them is the governor of the other one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Integration with a Syntactic Lexicon</head><p>Although this kind of parsers achieve state-of-the- art performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bohnet, 2010)</ref>, their predictions are limited to the phenomena that occur in the tree- banks they are trained on. In particular, they of- ten fail at correctly distinguishing elements that are subcategorized by a verb (henceforth comple- ments) from others (modifiers). This is due to the fact that the nature and number of the comple- ments is specific to each verb. If the verb did not occur, or did not occur often enough, in the tree- bank, the nature and number of its complements will not be correctly modeled by the parser. A precise description of verb complements plays an important role in the task of predicting the MORPH dependency, as we illustrate in exam- ple 1. In this example, the verb manger (eat) does not accept an object introduced by the subordinate conjunction que (that) . This is a vital information in order to predict the correct syntactic structure of the sentence. If the parser cannot link the con- junction que to the verb manger with an OBJ de- pendency, then it has to link it with a MOD depen- dency (it has no other reasonable solution). But que by itself cannot be a MOD of the verb unless it is a complex conjunction. The parser has therefore no other choice than linking que with the adverb using a MORPH dependency.</p><p>In order to help the parser build the right solution in such cases, we have introduced infor- mation derived from a syntactic lexicon in the parser. The syntactic lexicon associates, each verb lemma, the features +/-QUE and +/-DE, that indicate respectively if the verb accepts an object introduced by the subordinating conjunction que and by the preposition de. The verbs of our examples would have the following values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">manger -QUE -DE penser +QUE -DE boire -QUE -DE parler -QUE +DE</formula><p>We will call such features subcat features (SFs). The semantics of positive feature values are quite different from the semantics of negative ones. The former indicates that a verb may (but does not need to) license a complement introduced by the con- junction que or the preposition de, whereas the latter indicates that the verb cannot license such a complement. Negative feature values have, there- fore, a higher predictive power.</p><p>Every verbal lemma occurrence in the treebank is enriched with subcat features and three new fac- tor templates have been defined in the parser in or- der to model the co-occurrence of subcat features and some syntactic configurations. These tem- plates are represented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The first one is a first-order template and the others are grandchil- dren templates. In the template description, G, D and GD stand respectively for governor, dependent and grand-dependent. SF, POS, FCT and LEM re- spectively stand for subcat feature, part of speech, syntactic function and lemma. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 G.SF G.POS D.FCT D.POS 2 G.SF G.POS D.FCT D.POS GD.POS 3 G.SF G.POS D.FCT D.LEM GD.POS</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experimental Setup</head><p>We test the proposed model to verify the linguistic plausibility and computational feasibility of using MORPH links to represent syntactically idiosyn- cratic MWEs in a dependency parser enriched with subcat features. Therefore, we train a prob- abilistic dependency parsing model on modified treebank, representing ADV+que and de+DET con- structions using this special syntactic relation in- stead of pretokenization. Furthermore, in addition to regular features learned from the treebank, we also introduce and evaluate subcat features based on a lexicon of verbal valency, which helps iden- tifying subordinative clauses and de prepositional phrases (see Section 5). We evaluate parsing pre- cision and MWE identification on a test treebank and, more importantly, on a dataset built specifi- cally to study the representation of our target con- structions. All experiments used the NLP tool suite MACAON 5 , which comprises a second-order graph-based parser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Data Sets and Resources</head><p>French Treebank (FTB) The parser was trained on the French Treebank, a syntactically annotated corpus of news articles from Le Monde ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abeillé et al., 2003</ref>). We used the version which was trans- formed into dependency trees by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Candito et al. (2009)</ref>, and which was also used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Candito and Constant (2014)</ref> for experiments on MWE pars- ing. We used a standard split of 9,881 sentences (278K words) for training and 1,235 sentences for test (36K words). We applied simple rules to transform the flat representation of ADV+que and de+DET constructions into MORPH-linked individ- ual tokens. All other MWEs are kept unchanged in training and test data. They are represented as sin- gle tokens, not decomposed into individual words.</p><p>MORPH Dataset The test portion of the FTB contains relatively few instances of our target con- structions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Tables 4 and 6</ref>). Thus, we have created two specific data sets to evaluate the pre- diction of MORPH links. As for ADV+que con- structions, we manually selected the 7 most po- tentially ambiguous combinations from the top-20 most frequent combinations in the French Web as Corpus -frWaC ( <ref type="bibr">Baroni and Bernardini, 2006</ref>). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> As for de+DET constructions, we selected all 4 possible combinations. For each target ADV+que and de+DET construction, we randomly selected 1,000 sentences from the frWaC based on two cri- teria: (1) sentences should contain only one oc- currence of the target construction and (2) sen- tences should have between 10 and 20 words, to avoid distracting the annotators while still provid- ing enough context. Additionally, for de+DET we selected only sentences in which a verb preceded the construction, in order to minimize the occur-   rence of nominal complements (président de la république -president of the republic) and focus on the determiner/preposition ambiguity. Two ex- pert French native speakers annotated around 100 sentences per construction. Malformed or am- biguous sentences were discarded. Disagreements were either discussed and resolved or the sentence was discarded. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We can see in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> that ADV+que construc- tions are highly ambiguous, with 56.4% of the cases being complex conjunctions. However, they also present high variability: even though they share identical syntactic behavior, some of them tend to form complex conjunctions very often (alors) while others occur more often in other syn- tactic configurations (tant and encore). As one can see in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, de+DET sequences tend to function as prepositions followed by a determiner with the notable exception of de les. The reason is that de les (actually the amalgame des) is actually the plu- ral of the indefinite article (un), used with any plu- ral noun, while the other determiners are partitives that tend to be used only with massive nouns. The last column of these tables shows the number of occurrences of each construction in the frWaC cor- pus. We can see that they are very recurrent com- binations, specially de+DET constructions, which account for 3.7% of the total number of bigrams in the corpus. This underlines the importance of correctly predicting their syntactic structure in a parser.</p><p>DicoValence Lexicon DicoValence (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eynde and Mertens, 2003</ref>) is a lexical resource which lists the subcategorization frames of more than 3, 700 French verbs. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> It describes more specifically the number and nature of the verbs' complements. Dicovalence gives a more fine- grained description of the complements than what is needed in our feature templates. We have only kept, as described in Section 5, the subcat features -QUE, +QUE, -DE and +DE of each verb.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate our models on two aspects: parsing quality and MWE identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nivre and Nilsson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Vincze et al., 2013c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Candito and Constant, 2014</ref>). First, we use standard parsing at- tachment scores to verify whether our models im- pact parsing performance in general. We compare the generated dependency trees with the reference in the test portion of the FTB, reporting the pro- portion of matched links, both in terms of struc- ture -unlabeled attachment score (UAS) -and of labeled links -labeled attachment score (LAS). Since our focus is on MWE parsing, we are also interested in MWE identification metrics. We fo- cus on words whose dependency label is MORPH and calculate the proportion of correctly predicted MORPH links among those in the parser output (precision), among those in the reference (recall) and the F1 average. Since some of the phenomena are quite rare in the FTB test portion, we focus on the MORPH dataset, which contains around 100 instances of each target construction. We compare our approach with two simple baselines. The first one consists in pretokenizing ADV+que systematically as a single token, while de+DET is systematically left as two separate to- kens. This baseline emulates the behavior of most parsing pipelines, which deal with functional com- plex words during tokenization. This corresponds to choosing the majority classes in the last row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 1 and 2</ref>. For ADV+que, the precision of the baseline is 56.4%. If we assume recall is 100%, this yields an F1 score of 72.2%. For de+DET, however, recall is 0% since no MORPH link is pre- dicted at all. Therefore, we only look at the base- line's precision of 63.5%. A second, slightly more sophisticated baseline, consists in choosing the majority class for each individual construction and average precisions over the constructions. In this case, the average precision is 75.3% for ADV+que and 76.6% for de+DET.</p><p>We compare our model to the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Green et al. (2013)</ref>. We used the pretrained model available as part of the Stanford parser 9 . Their model outputs constituent trees, which were automatically converted to unlabeled dependency structures. We ignore the nature of the dependency link, only checking whether the target construction elements are linked in the correct order.</p><p>Our experiments use the MACAON tool suite. For the FTB, gold POS and gold lemmas are given as input to the parser. In the case of the MORPH dataset, for which we do not have gold POS and lemmas, they are predicted by MACAON. The first best prediction is given as input to the parser.   <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. It is therefore difficult draw clear conclusions concern- ing the task of predicting the MORPH dependency. The precision and recall have nevertheless been re- ported. The recall is perfect (all MORPH depen- dencies have been predicted) and the the precision is reasonable (the parser overpredicts a little). The table also shows that the use of subcat features is not beneficial, as attachment scores as well as pre- cision decrease. The decrease of precision is mis- leading, though, due to the small number of occur- rences it has been computed on. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref> displays the precision, recall and F1 of the prediction of the MORPH dependency on the 730 ADV+que sentences of the MORPH dataset, without and with the use of subcat features. The scores obtained are lower than the same experi- ments on the FTB.Precision is higher than recall, which indicates that the parser has a tendency to underpredict. We also present the precision of the two baselines described in Section 6.2. Only in two cases the per-construction majority base- line (indiv.) outperforms our parser without sub- cat features. These two constructions do not tend to form complex conjunctions, that is, the parser overgenerates MORPH dependencies. Here, subcat features help increasing precision, systematically outperforming the baselines.</p></div>

Overall, our models are more precise than the Stanford parser at predict- ing MORPH links, specially for bien que and en-   <ref type="table">The table also</ref> shows an important variety among the seven com- plex conjunctions studied. Some of them are very well predicted (F1 = 93.5) while others are poorly predicted (F1 = 75.67). This is partly due to the tendency of some ADV+que sequences to be part of larger frozen or semi-frozen constructions and to be used with a different semantico-syntactic be- havior. An error analysis performed on the tant que sequence revealed that 40% of the errors were due to the occurrence of tant que as part of the larger en tant que expression, while 20% of the errors were due to the usage of tant que as a com- parative expression.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 6</ref> reports the results of the same experi- ments on de+DET constructions. It shows that the frequency of de+DET constructions is higher than ADV+que constructions. It also shows that the in- troduction of subcat features has a positive impact on the prediction of the MORPH dependency, but a negative effect on the attachment scores. <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 7</ref> reveals that the prediction of the correct structure of de+DET constructions is more difficult than that of ADV+que constructions for the parser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">de+DET</head><p>Here, not only the majority class is the non-MWE analysis (63.5%), but also there is higher ambigu- ity because of nominal and adverbial complements that have the same structure. This impacts the per- formance of the Stanford parser, which overgener- ates MORPH links, achieving the lowest precision for all constructions except for des. Results also show that the introduction of subcat features has an important impact on the quality of the predic- tion (F1 jumps from 75% to 84.67%). The use of subcat features slightly improves the identifi- cation of de les, which is a determiner most of the time. On the other hand, it greatly improves F1 for other constructions, which appear less of- ten as determiners. We believe that the higher im- pact of subcat frames on de+DET is mainly due to the fact that the number of verbs licensing comple- ments introduced by the preposition de is higher than the number of verbs licensing complements introduced by the conjunction que (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>). Therefore, the parser trained without subcat fea- tures can only rely on the examples present in the FTB which are proportionally smaller in the first case than in the second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>This paper introduced and evaluated a joint pars- ing and MWE identification model that can ef- fectively detect and represent ambiguous com- plex function words. The difficulty of process- ing such expressions is underestimated because of their limited variability. They often are pre- grouped as words-with-spaces in many parsing ar- chitectures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sag et al., 2002</ref>). However, we did not use gold tokenization, unrealistic for ambigu- ous MWEs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nivre and Nilsson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Korkontze-Baseline prec. Green et Without SF With SF de+DET global indiv. al. (2013</ref>   <ref type="bibr">, 2010)</ref>. We proposed to deal with these constructions during parsing, when the required syntactic infor- mation to disambiguate them is available. Thus, we trained a graph-based dependency parser on a modified treebank where complex function words were linked with a MORPH dependency. Our re- sults demonstrate that a standard parsing model can correctly learn such special links and predict them for unseen constructions. Nonetheless, the model is more accurate when we integrate exter- nal information from a syntactic lexicon. This improved precision for ADV+que and specially de+DET constructions. For the latter, F1 improved in almost 10%, going from 75% to 84.61%.</p><p>This study raised several linguistic and compu- tational questions. Some complex function words include more than two elements, like si bien que (so much that) and d'autant (plus) que (especially as). Moreover, they may contain nested expres- sions with different meanings and structures, e.g. tant que (as long as) is a conjunction but en tant que (as) is a preposition. The same applies for quantified partitive determiners, like beaucoup de (much) and un (petit) peu de (a (little) bit of ). Their identification and representation is planned as a future extension to this work.</p><p>We also would like to compare our approach to sequence models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schneider et al., 2014</ref>). Care- ful error analysis could help us understand in which cases syntactic features can help. More- over, different variants of the syntactic features and more sophisticated representation for syntac- tic lexicons can help improve MWE parsing fur- ther. For instance, we represent the subcat fea- tures of pronominal verbs and their simple ver- sions with the same features, but they should be distinguished, e.g. se rappeler (remember) is +DE but rappeler (remind) is -DE.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Factor templates modeling the cooccurrence of subcat features and syntactic configurations. Two factors, of the types 1 and 3, have been represented in Figure 2. The first one models the cooccurrence of subcat feature-QUE and an object introduced by a subordinating conjunction. Such feature will receive a negative score at the end of training, since a verb having the-QUE feature should not license a direct object introduced by a subordinating conjunction. The second feature models the co-occurrence of the feature-QUE and a modifier introduced by the subordinating conjunction QUE and having an adverb as a dependent. Such a feature will receive a positive score. 1-QUE VRB OBJ</figDesc></figure>
