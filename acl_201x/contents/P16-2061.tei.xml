			<abstract>
				<p>We describe the Iraq Body Count Corpus (IBC-C) dataset, the first substantial armed conflict-related dataset which can be used for conflict analysis. IBC-C provides a ground-truth dataset for conflict specific named entity recognition, slot filling, and event de-duplication. IBC-C is constructed using data collected by the Iraq Body Count project which has been recording incidents from the ongoing war in Iraq since 2003. We describe the dataset&apos;s creation, how it can be used for the above three tasks and provide initial baseline results for the first task (named entity recognition) using Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, and Recursive Neural Networks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many reports about armed conflict related inci- dents are published every day. However, these re- ports on the deaths and injuries of civilians and combatants often get forgotten or go unnoticed for long periods of time. Automatically extracting ca- sualty counts from such reports would help better track ongoing conflicts and understand past ones.</p><p>One popular approach of discovering incidents is to identify them from textual reports and extract casualty, and other, information from them. This can either be done by hand or automatically. The Iraq Body Count (IBC) project has been directly recording casualties since 2003 for the ongoing conflict in Iraq <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(IBC, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hicks et al., 2011</ref>). IBC staff collect reports, link them to unique in- cidents, extract casualty information, and save the information on a per incident basis as can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Direct recording by hand is a slow process and notable efforts to do so have tended to lag behind the present. Information extraction systems capa- ble of automating this process must explicitly or implicitly successfully solve three tasks: (1) find and extract casualty information in reports (2) de- tect events mentioned in reports (3) deduplicate detected events into unique events which we call incidents. The three tasks correspond to named entity recognition, slot filling, and <ref type="bibr">de-duplication.</ref> In this work we introduce the report based IBC- C dataset. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Each report can contain one or more sections; each section, one or more sentences; each sentence, one or more words. Each word is tagged with one of nine entity tags in the inside- outside-beginning (IOB) style. A visual represen- tation of the dataset can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> and its statistics in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge apart from the significantly smaller MUC-3 and MUC-4 datasets (which aren't casualty-specific) there are no other publicly available datasets made specifically for tasks (1), (2) or (3). The IBC-C dataset can be used to train supervised models for all three tasks.</p><p>We provide baseline results for task (1) which we posit as a sequence-classification problem and solve using an HMM, a CRF, and an RNN.</p><p>Since the 1990s the conflict analysis and NLP/IE communities have diverged. With the IBC-C dataset we hope to bring the two commu- nities closer again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Extracting information from conflict related re- ports has been a topic of interest at various times for both the conflict analysis, information extrac- tion, and natural language processing communi-  The IBC-C dataset visualised. A re- port is split into one or more non overlapping sec- tions. A section is comprised of sentences which are comprised of words. Each section is linked to exactly one incident which in turn can be linked to one or more sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ties.</head><p>The 1990s saw a series of message understand- ing conferences (MUCs) of which MUC-3 and MUC-4 are closely related to our work and contain reports of terrorist incidents in Central and South America. MUC data is most often used for slot filling and although MUC-3 and MUC-4 contain more slots than IBC-C they are at the same time much smaller (MUC4 contains 1,700 reports) and cannot be used for incident de-duplication.</p><p>Although various ACE, CoNNL, and TAC-KBP tasks contain within them conflict-related reports, none of them are specific to conflict and haven't been studied for conflict-related information ex- traction specifically.</p><p>Studies more directly related to our dataset in- clude work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tanev and Piskorski (Tanev et al., 2008</ref>) who use pattern matching to count casu- alties. They report a 93% accuracy on count- ing the wounded. However, they have access to only 29 unique conflict events. Other non-casualty conflict-related work in the domain also suffers from a lack of data, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(King and Lowe, 2003)</ref> only deal with 711 reports.</p><p>Despite work in the NLP and IE communities, the conflict analysis community is still reliant on  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">GTD, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge there are no efforts to fully automate casualty counting. However, ef- forts using NLP/IE tools to automate incident de- tection do exist but their ability to de-deduplicate incidents has been called into question <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Weller and McCubbins, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Three notable such efforts originating in the conflict analysis community are GDELT (Lee- taru and Schrodt, 2013), ICEWS <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Obrien, 2010)</ref>, and OEDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Schrodt, 2016)</ref>. All three use pat- tern matching software such as TABARI <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Schrodt, 2001</ref>) and to categorise reports using the CAMEO coding scheme ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Schrodt et al., 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Creating the IBC-C Dataset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preprocessing</head><p>The Iraq Body Count project (IBC) has been recording conflict-related incidents from the Iraq war since 2003. An incident is a unique event re- lated to war or other forms of violence which led to the death or injury of people. An example can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The recording of incidents by the IBC works as follows: IBC staff first collect relevant reports before highlighting sections of them which they deem relevant to individual incidents. Parts of the report outside the highlighted sections are dis- carded. Sections can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. Because of the way IBC staff highlight sections there are no overlapping sections in the IBC-C dataset. Events are then recognised from the highlighted sections and de-duplicated into incidents. A final descrip-  tion of the incident (e.g. death and injury counts, location and date) is agreed upon after multiple rounds of human checking.</p><p>In the preprocessing step we gathered all inci- dents which occurred between March 20th, 2003 and December 31st, 2013. We removed spuri- ous incidents (e.g. where the minimum number killed is larger than the maximum number killed) and cleaned the section text by removing all for- matting and changing all written-out numbers into their numeric form (e.g. 'three' to 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Annotation</head><p>Using the information extracted by the IBC (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>) we annotated each section word with one of ten tags: KNUM and INUM for numbers repre- senting the number killed and injured respectively; KSUB and ISUB for named individuals were killed or injured; KOTHER and IOTHER for unnamed people who were killed or injured (for example "The doctor was injured yesterday."); LOCATION for the location in which an incident occurred; WEAPON for any weapons used in an attack; DATE for words which identify when the incident happened; and, O for all other words.</p><p>Our data generation process can be thought of as a form of distant supervision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mintz et al., 2009</ref>) where we use agreed upon knowledge about an incident to label words contained within its sections instead of having hand-labeled individual words. This inevitably introduces errors which we try to mitigate using a filtration step where we re- move ambiguous data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Filtration</head><p>Simply annotating words based on the information in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> can lead to wrong annotations. For ex- ample, if two people were recorded as having died in an incident, then, if another number two appears in the same sentence, this might lead to a wrong annotation. The sentence, "2 civilians were killed after 2 rockets hit the compound" could lead to the second '2' being annotated as a KNUM. The ac- tual cardinality of a number makes little difference to a sequence classifier compared to the difference a misannotated number would make. To min- imise such misannotations we remove sentences and reports which do not pass all filtration criteria. Our filtration criteria consist of boolean functions over sentences, sections and incidents which re- turn false if a test isn't passed.</p><p>The goal of filtration is to remove as much am- biguously labelled data as possible without bias- ing against any particular set of linguistic forms. There is thus a tradeoff which must be struck be- tween linguistic richness and the quality of anno- tation.</p><p>In our case we found that simple combinations of pattern matching and semantic functions, as in 3, worked well. No syntactic functions were used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Incident Filtration</head><p>Incidents are filtered using a single criterion: if the minimum number of people killed or injured does not equal the maximum number of people killed or injured, respectively, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2</ref>) then the inci- dent is removed. We do this so as to minimise any ambiguity in our named entity tagging (the only task for which we provide baseline results). This has the adverse effect of removing any incidents where reports mention different casualty counts. To compile a dataset which disregards this crite- rion, or considers a permissible window of casual-h a s K N U M i s K i l l S e n t e n c e h a s O n e T a g g e d A  ties, a parameter in our dataset generating program may be changed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Sentence Filtration</head><p>Filtering sentences is by far the hardest step. It is here where we must be careful to not bias against any linguistic forms. A separate set of boolean functions are applied to each sentence for the KNUM and INUM entity tags. An example for the KNUM tag can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. Every sen- tence passes through four boolean functions (the first four columns) and is then labeled as either having passed or failed the test (fifth column). The fifth column was decided upon by us in advance.</p><p>In the case of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>: hasKNUM indicates whether the sentence contains a word tagged as KNUM; isKillSentence indicates whether any of its words are connected to death or killing (by matching them against a list of predefined words); hasOneTaggedAsKNUM indicates whether the number '1' is tagged as a KNUM (remember that we convert written out numbers such as 'three' to '3' and that 'one', and thus '1', can also be a pronoun); hasNumber indicates whether a sen- tence has a number; and, otherKNUMsInSection indicates whether there are other words tagged as KNUM in the section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Report Filtration</head><p>Report filtering is simple and again done using only one rule. If any sentence a report contains fails to pass a single sentence-level test, then the whole report is removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Tasks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Named Entity Recognition</head><p>Each word in the IBC-C dataset is tagged with one of nine (excluding O) entity tags as can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> which can be thought of as subsets of more common named entity tags such as person or loca- tion. The dataset can be used to train a supervised NER model for conflict-specific named entity tags. This is important for relationship extraction which relies on good named entity tags.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Slot Filling and Relationship Extraction</head><p>Each IBC-C event can be thought of as a 9-slot event template where each slot is named after an entity tag. The important thing to keep in mind is that a report may contain more than one section so just correctly recognising the entities isn't enough to solve the slot filling task. Instead, if a report mentions two events then two separate templates must be created and their slots filled.</p><p>A common sub-problem of slot filling is rela- tionship extraction. Because we know which in- cident every section refers to, generating ground- truth relationships is trivial because we may be sure that an entity which appears in one of the sections is related to every other entity in that same section. For example, finding a KSUB and a LOCATION means that we can build a killed in(KSUB, LOCATION) relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Event De-duplication</head><p>Since the IBC-C dataset preserves the links be- tween sections and incidents it may be used as a ground-truth training set for training event de- duplication models.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Baseline results were computed for the named en- tity recognition task using an 80:20 tag split across sentences (we ignore report or section bound- aries). We compare three different sequence- classification models as seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>: a Hid- den Markov Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Zhou and Su, 2002</ref>), a Con- ditional Random Field <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(McCallum and Li, 2003)</ref>, and a Elman-style Recursive Neural Network sim- ilar to the one used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Mesnil et al., 2013)</ref>. For the HMM we use bigram features in combi- nation with the current word and the current base named entity features 2 . We trained the HMM in CRF form using LBFGS.</p><p>For the CRF we find that using bigram fea- tures and a 13-word window, across words and base named entities, gives us the best result. We train the CRF using LBFGS. All CRF training, including the HMM, was done using CRFSuite <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Okazaki, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>For the Elman-style recurrent network we use randomly initialised 100 dimensional word vec- tors as input, the network has 100 hidden units, and we use a 13-word context window again. The RNN was implemented using Theano ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bastien et al., 2012</ref>). We train the RNN using stochastic gra- dient descent on a single GPU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation</head><p>The first thing which strikes us is how low the ISUB scores are. The CRF returns a recall score of 0.24. At the same time, the precision is relatively high at 0.89. Low recall indicates a lot of false negative classifications -i.e. there were many in- jured people who were mistakingly tagged as un- injured. A high precision rate means a low false <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Base named entities such as PERSON and LOCATION were found using Stanford's named entity recogniser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Finkel et al., 2005).</ref> positive rate -i.e. most uninjured people were cor- rectly tagged as uninjured. In short, the classifier was too generous with tagging people as having been injured. Looking at the dataset we realise that in contrast to KSUBS, words which we asso- ciate with injury such as "wounded" or "injured" are often very far away from an ISUB. Increasing the window size with the CRF didn't help (such large features are often never expressed during the test phase).</p><p>Low recall scores across multiple tags indi- cate that long-distance dependencies determine a word's classification. K/INUM recall is excep- tionally high because K/INUMs are usually sur- rounded by words such as "killed". We were sur- prised to see the RNN perform relatively poorly and expected it to be able to factor in long-distance dependencies. We believe this has more to do with our hyper-parameter settings than deficiencies in the actual model.</p></div>
