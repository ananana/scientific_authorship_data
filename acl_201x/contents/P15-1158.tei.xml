				<p>We propose a language production model that uses dynamic discourse information to account for speakers&apos; choices of referring expressions. Our model extends previous rational speech act models (Frank and Goodman, 2012) to more naturally distributed linguistic data, instead of assuming a controlled experimental setting. Simulations show a close match between speakers&apos; utterances and model predictions, indicating that speakers&apos; behavior can be modeled in a principled way by considering the probabilities of referents in the discourse and the information conveyed by each word.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Discourse information plays an important role in various aspects of linguistic processing, such as predictions about upcoming words <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nieuwland and Van Berkum, 2006</ref>) and scalar implicature process- ing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Breheny et al., 2006</ref>). The relationship be- tween discourse information and speakers' choices of referring expression is one of the most studied problems. Speakers' choices of referring expres- sions have long been thought to depend on the salience of entities in the discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Givón, 1983)</ref>. For example, speakers normally do not choose a pronoun to refer to a new entity in the discourse, but are more likely to use pronouns for referents that have been referred to earlier in the discourse. A number of grammatical, semantic, and distribu- tional factors related to salience have been found to influence choices of referring expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnold, 2008)</ref>. While the relationship between discourse salience and speakers' choices of referring expres- sions is well known, there is not yet a formal ac- count of why this relationship exists.</p><p>In recent years, a number of formal models have been proposed to capture inferences between speak- ers and listeners in the context of Gricean prag- matics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grice, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frank and Goodman, 2012</ref>). These models take a game theoretic approach in which speakers optimize productions to convey in- formation for listeners, and listeners infer meaning based on speakers' likely productions. These mod- els have been argued to account for human commu- nication <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jager, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frank and Goodman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bergen et al., 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith et al., 2013)</ref>, and stud- ies report that they robustly predict various linguis- tic phenomena in experimental settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goodman and Stuhlmüller, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Degen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kao et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nordmeyer and Frank, 2014</ref>). However, these models have not yet been applied to language produced outside of the laboratory, nor have they incorporated measures of discourse salience that can be computed over corpora.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to explain speakers' choices of referring expres- sions based on discourse salience. Our model ex- tends the rational speech act model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frank and Goodman (2012)</ref> to incorporate updates to lis- teners' beliefs as discourse proceeds. The model predicts that a speaker's choice of referring expres- sions should depend directly on the amount of in- formation that each word carries in the discourse. Simulations probe the contribution of each model component and show that the model can predict speakers' pronominalization in a corpus. These results suggest that this model formalizes underly- ing principles that account for speakers' choices of referring expressions.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant studies on choices of referring ex- pressions. Section 3 describes the details of our model. Section 4 describes the data, preprocessing and annotation procedure. Section 5 presents simu- lation results. Section 6 summarizes this study and discusses implications and future directions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Discourse salience</head><p>Speakers' choices of referring expressions have long been an object of study. Pronominalization has been examined particularly often in both theo- retical and experimental studies. Discourse theories predict that speakers use pronouns when they think that a referent is salient in the discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Givón, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ariel, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gundel et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Grosz et al., 1995)</ref>, where salience of the referent is influ- enced by various factors such as grammatical posi- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brennan, 1995)</ref>, recency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chafe, 1994)</ref>, top- icality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnold, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">), competitors (Fukumura et al., 2011</ref>), visual salience ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vogels et al., 2013b)</ref>, and so on.</p><p>Discourse theories have characterized the link between referring expressions and discourse salience by stipulating constructs such as a scale of topicality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Givón, 1983)</ref>, accessibility hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ariel, 1990)</ref>, or implicational hierarchy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gundel et al., 1993</ref>). All of these assume fixed form-salience correspondences in that a certain referring expres- sion encodes a certain degree of salience. However, it is not clear how this form-salience mapping holds nor why it should be.</p><p>There is also a rich body of research that points to the importance of production cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rohde et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bergen et al., 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Degen et al., 2013</ref>) and listener models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bard et al., 2004</ref>; Van der Wege, 2009; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Galati and Brennan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fukumura and van Gompel, 2012</ref>) in language production. These studies suggest that only considering dis- course salience of the referent may not precisely capture speakers' choices of referring expressions, and it is necessary to examine discourse salience in relation to these other factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Formal models</head><p>Computational models relevant to speakers' choices of referring expressions have been pro- posed, but there is a gap between questions that previous models have addressed and the questions that we have raised above. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grüning and Kibrik (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Khudyakova et al. (2011)</ref> examine the significance of various fac- tors that might influence choices of referring ex- pressions by using machine learning models such as neural networks, logistic regression and decision trees. Although these models qualitatively show some significant factors, they are data-driven rather than being explanatory, and have not focused on why and how these factors result in the observed referring choices.</p><p>Formal models that go beyond identifying super- ficial factors focus on only pronouns rather than accounting for speakers' word choices per se. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kehler et al. (2008)</ref> formalize a relation- ship between pronoun comprehension and produc- tion using Bayes' rule to account for comprehen- der's semantic bias in experimental data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rij et al. (2013)</ref> use ACT-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson, 2007)</ref> to examine the effects of working memory load in pronoun interpretation. These models show how certain fac- tors influence pronoun production/interpretation, but it is not clear how these models would predict speakers' choices of referring expressions.</p><p>Relevant formal models in computational lin- guistics include Centering theory ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Grosz et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Poesio et al., 2004</ref>) and Referring Expres- sion Generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Krahmer and Van Deemter, 2012</ref>). These models propose deterministic constraints governing when pronouns are preferred in local dis- course, but it is not clear how these would account for speakers' choices of referring expressions, nor it is clear why there should be such deterministic constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Uniform Information Density</head><p>One potential formal explanation for the relation between discourse salience and speakers' choices of referring expressions is the Uniform Informa- tion Density hypothesis (UID) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Levy and Jaeger, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tily and Piantadosi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jaeger, 2010)</ref>. UID states that speakers prefer to smooth the in- formation density distribution of their utterances over time to achieve optimal communication. This theory predicts that speakers should use pronouns instead of longer forms (e.g., the president) when a referent is predictable in the context, whereas they should use longer forms for unpredictable referents that carry more information <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jaeger, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Tily and Piantadosi (2009) empirically exam- ined the relationship between predictability of a referent and choice of referring expressions. They found that predictability is a significant predictor of writers' choices of referring expressions, in that pronouns are used when a referent is predictable.</p><p>While these results appear to support UID, there are several inconsistencies with previous UID ac- counts. Information content of words has been estimated using an n-gram language model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Levy and Jaeger, 2007)</ref>, a verb's subcategorization fre- quency <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jaeger, 2010)</ref>, and so on, whereas here the information content is that of referents with respect to discourse salience. In addition, selecting between a pronoun and a more specified referring expression involves deciding how much informa- tion to convey, whereas previous applications of UID ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Levy and Jaeger, 2007</ref>) have been concerned with deciding between different ways of expressing the same information content. We show in the next section that we can derive predictions about refer- ring expressions directly from a model of language production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Summary</head><p>Previous linguistic studies have focused on identi- fying factors that might influence choices of refer- ring expressions. However, it is not clear from this previous work how and why these factors result in the observed patterns of referring expressions. Where formal models relevant to this topic do exist, they have not been built to explain why there is a relation between discourse salience and speakers' choices of referring expressions. Even UID, which relates predictability to word length, is not set up to account for the choice between words that vary in their information content.</p><p>In the next section, we propose a speaker model that formalizes the relation between discourse salience and speakers' choices of referring expres- sions, considering production cost and speakers' inference about listeners in a principled and ex- planatory way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Speaker model 3.1 Rational speaker-listener model</head><p>We adopt the rational speaker-listener model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frank and Goodman (2012)</ref> and extend this model to predict speakers' choices of referring expres- sions using discourse information.</p><p>The main idea of Frank and Goodman's model is that a rational pragmatic listener uses Bayesian inference to infer the speaker's intended referent r s given the word w, their vocabulary (e.g., 'blue', 'circle'), and shared context that consists of a set of objects O (e.g., visual access to object referents) as in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, assuming that a speaker has chosen the word informatively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (r s |w, O) = P S (w|r s , O)P (r s ) Σ r ∈O P (w|r , O)P (r )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>While our work does not make use of this pragmatic listener, it does build on the speaker model assumed by the pragmatic listener. This speaker model (the likelihood term in the listener model) is defined using an exponentiated utility function as in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P S (w|r s , O) ∝ e αU (w;rs,O)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The utility</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U (w; r s , O) is defined as I(w; r s , O) − D(w)</formula><p>, where I(w; r s , O) represents informative- ness of word w (quantified as surprisal) and D(w) represents its speech cost. If a listener interprets word w literally and cost D(w) is constant, the ex- ponentiated utility function can be reduced to <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> where |w| denotes the number of referents that the word w can be used to refer to.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P S (w|r s , O) ∝ 1 |w| (3)</formula><p>Thus, the speaker model chooses a word based on its specificity. We show in the next section that this corresponds to a speaker who is optimizing informativeness for a listener with uniform beliefs about what will be referred to in the discourse.</p><p>The assumption of uniform discourse salience works well in a simple language game where there are a limited number of referents that have roughly equal salience, but we show that a model that lacks a sophisticated notion of discourse falls short in more realistic settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Incorporating discourse salience</head><p>To extend Frank and Goodman's model to a natu- ral linguistic situation, we assume that the speaker estimates the listener's interpretation of a word (or referring expression) w based on discourse informa- tion. We extend the speaker model from (3) by as- suming that a speaker S chooses w to optimize a lis- tener's belief in speaker's intended referent r rela- tive to the speaker's own speech cost C w . This cost is another factor in the speaker model, roughly cor- responding to utterance complexity such as word length. 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P S (w|r) ∝ P L (r|w) · 1 C w (4)</formula><p>The term P L (r|w) in <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> represents informative- ness of word w: the speaker chooses w that most helps a listener L to infer referent r. The term C w in (4) is a cost function: the speaker chooses w that is least costly to speak. The speaker's listener model, P L (r|w), infers referent r that is referred to by word w according to Bayes' rule as in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P L (r|w) = P (w|r)P (r) Σ r P (w|r )P (r )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The first term in the numerator, P (w|r), is a word probability: the listener in the speaker's mind guesses how likely the speaker would be to use w to refer to r. The second term in the numerator, P (r), is the discourse salience (or predictability) of refer- ent r. The denominator Σ r P (w|r )P (r ) is a sum of potential referents r that could be referred to by word w. The terms in this sum are non-zero only for referents that are compatible with the meaning of the word. If there are many potential referents that could be referred to by word w, that word would be more ambiguous thus less informative. The whole of the right side in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref> repre- sents the speaker's assumption about the listener: given word w the listener would infer referent r that is salient in a discourse and less ambiguously referred to by word w. If P (r) is uniform over referents and P (w|r) is constant across words and referents, this listener model reduces to 1 |w| . Thus, Frank and Goodman (2012)'s speaker model in (3) is a special case of our speaker model in (4) that assumes uniform discourse salience and constant cost.</p><p>Our model predicts that the speaker's probability of choosing a word for a given referent should depend on its cost relative to its information content. To see this, we combine (4) and (5), yielding</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P S (w|r) ∝ P (w|r)P (r) r P (w|r )P (r ) · 1 C w<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Because the speaker is deciding what word to use for an intended referent, and the term P (r) denotes the probability of this referent, P (r) is constant in the speaker model and does not affect the relative probability of a speaker producing different words. We further assume for simplicity that P (w|r) is constant across words and referents. This means that all referents have about the same number of words that can be used to refer to them, and that all words for a given referent are equally probable for a naive listener. In this scenario, the speaker's probability of choosing a word is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P S (w|r) ∝ 1 r P (r ) · 1 C w (7)</formula><p>where the sum denotes the total discourse probabil- ity of the referents referred to by that word. The information content of an event is defined as the negative log probability of that event. In this scenario, the information conveyed by a word is the logarithm of the first term in <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>, − log r P (r ). This means that in deciding which word to use, the highest cost a speaker should be willing to pay for a word should depend directly on that word's information content.</p><p>This relationship between cost and information content allows us to derive the prediction tested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tily and Piantadosi (2009)</ref> that the use of referring expressions should depend on the predictability of a referent. For referents that are highly pre- dictable from the discourse, different referring ex- pressions (e.g., pronouns and proper names) will have roughly equal information content, and speak- ers should choose the referring expression that has the lowest cost. In contrast, for less predictable ref- erents, proper names will carry substantially more information than pronouns, leading speakers to pay a higher cost for the proper names. These are the same predictions that have been discussed in the context of UID, but here the predictions are derived from a principled model of speakers who are try- ing to provide information to listeners. The extent to which our model can also capture other cases that have been put forward as evidence for the UID hypothesis remains a question for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Predicting behavior from corpora</head><p>The model described in Section 3.2 is fully general, applying to arbitrary word choices, discourse prob- abilities, and cost fuctions. As an initial step, our simulations focus on the choice between pronouns and proper names. Our work tests the speaker model from (4) directly, asking whether it can pre- dict the referring expressions from corpora of writ-ten and spoken language. Implementing the model requires computing word probabilities P (w|r), dis- course salience P (r), and word costs C w .</p><p>We simplify the word probability P (w|r) in the speaker's listener model as in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(8)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P (w|r) = 1 V<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the count V is the number of words that can refer to referent r. We assume that V is constant across all referents. Our reasoning is as follows.</p><p>There could be many ways to refer to a single entity. For example, to refer to entity Barack Obama, we could say 'he', 'The U.S. president', 'Barack', and so on. We assume that there are the same number of referring expressions for each entity and that each referring expression is equally probable under the listener's likelihood model. In our simulations, we assume that a speaker is choosing between a proper name and a pronoun. For example, we assume that an entity Barack Obama has one and only one proper name 'Barack Obama', and this entity is unambiguously associ- ated with male and singular. Although we use an example with two possible referring expressions, as long as P (w|r) is constant across all referents and words, it does not make a difference to the computation in (5) how many competing words we assume for each referent.</p><p>To estimate the salience of a referent, P (r), our framework employs factors such as referent fre- quency or recency. Although there are other impor- tant factors such as topicality of the referent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Orita et al., 2014</ref>) that are not incorporated in our sim- ulations, this model sets up a framework to test the role and interaction of various potential factors suggested in the discourse literature.</p><p>Salience of the referent is computed differently depending on its information status: old or new. The following illustrates the speaker's assumptions about the listener's discourse model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">For each referent r ∈ [1, R d ]:</formula><p>1. If r = old, choose r in proportion to N r (the number of times referent r has been referred to in the preceding discourse). 2. Otherwise, r = new with probability propor- tional to α (a hyperparameter that controls how likely the speaker is to refer to a new referent).</p><p>3. If r = new, sample that new referent r from the base distribution over entities with proba- bility 1 U· (count U · denotes a total number of unseen entities that is estimated from a named entity list ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bergsma and Lin, 2006</ref>)).</p><p>The above discourse model is frequency-based. We can replace the term N r for the old referent with f (d i,j ) = e −d i,j /a that captures recency, where the recency function f (d i,j ) decays exponentially with the distance between the current referent r i and the same referent r j that has previously been referred to. This framework for frequency and recency of new and old referents exactly corresponds to pri- ors in the Chinese Restaurant Process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Teh et al., 2006</ref>) and the distance-dependent Chinese Restau- rant Process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blei and Frazier, 2011</ref>).</p><p>The denominator in (5) represents the sum of potential referents that could be referred to by word w. We assume that a pronoun can refer to a large number of unseen referents if gender and number match, but a proper name cannot. For example, 'he' could refer to all singular and male referents, but 'Barack Obama' can only refer to Barack Obama. This assumption is reflected as a probability of unseen referents for the pronoun as illustrated in (10) below.</p><p>In our simulations, the speaker's cost function C w is estimated based on word length as in (9). We assume that longer words are costly to produce.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C w = length(w)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Suppose that the speaker is considering using 'he' to refer to Barack Obama, which has been referred to N O times in the preceding discourse, and there is another singular and male entity, Joe Biden, in the preceding discourse that has been referred to N B times. In this situation, the model computes the probability that the speaker uses 'he' to refer to Barack Obama as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P S ('he'|Obama) ∝ P L (Obama|'he') · 1 C 'he' = P ('he'|Obama)P (Obama) Σ r P ('he'|r )P (r ) · 1 C 'he' = 1 V ·N O ( 1 V ·N O )+( 1 V ·N B )+( 1 V ·α· U sing&amp;masc U· ) · 1 C 'he'<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where count U sing&amp;masc in the denominator of the last line denotes the number of unseen singular &amp; male entities that could be referred to by 'he'. We estimate this number for each type of pronoun we evaluate (singular-female, singular-male, singular- neuter, and plural) based on the named entity list in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bergsma and Lin (2006)</ref>. The term</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">( 1 V · α · U sing&amp;masc U·</formula><p>) is the sum of probabilities of unseen referents that could be referred to by the pronoun 'he'. The unseen referents can be interpreted as a penalty for the inexplicitness of pronouns. In the case of proper names, the denominator is always the same as the numerator, under the assumption that each entity has one unique proper name.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Corpora</head><p>Our model was run on both adult-directed speech and child-directed speech. We chose to use the SemEval-2010 Task 1 subset of OntoNotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Recasens et al., 2011</ref>), a corpus of news text, as our corpus of adult-directed speech. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gleason et al. (1984)</ref> subset of CHILDES <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacWhinney, 2000</ref>) was chosen as our corpus of child-directed speech.</p><p>The model requires coreference chains, agree- ment information, grammatical position, and part of speech. These were extracted from each corpus, either manually or automatically. The coreference chains let us easily count how many times/how recently each referent is mentioned in the dis- course, which is necessary for computing discourse salience. The agreement information (gender and number of each referent) is required so that the model can identify all possible competing refer- ents for pronouns. For instance, Barack Obama will be ruled out as a possible competitor for the pronoun she. The grammatical position that each proper name occupies 2 determines the form of the alternative pronoun that could be used there. For example, the difference between he and him is the grammatical position that each can appear in. The part of speech is used to identify the form of the referring expression (pronouns and proper names), which is what our model aims to predict. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> OntoNotes includes information about corefer- ence chains, part of speech, and grammatical de- pendencies. Gleason CHILDES has parsed part of speech and grammatical dependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sagae et al., 2010</ref>), but it does not have coreference chains.</p><p>Neither corpus has agreement information. The fol- lowing section describes manual annotations that we have done for this study. Due to time constraints, we annotated only a part of the CHILDES Gleason corpus, 9 out of 70 scripts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Mention annotation</head><p>We considered only maximally spanning noun phrases as mentions, ignoring nested NPs and nested coreference chains. For the sentence "Both Al Gore and George W. Bush have different ideas on how to spend that extra money" from OntoNotes, the extracted NPs are Both Al Gore and George W. Bush and different ideas about how to spend that extra money.</p><p>These maximally spanning NPs were automati- cally extracted from the OntoNotes data, but were manually annotated for the CHILDES data using brat ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Stenetorp et al., 2012</ref>) by two annotators. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Agreement annotation</head><p>Many mentions (46,246 out of 56,575 mentions in OntoNotes and 10,141 out of 10,530 mentions in CHILDES Gleason) were automatically annotated using agreement information from the named entity list in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bergsma and Lin (2006)</ref>, leaving 10,329 to be manually annotated from OntoNotes (about 18%) and 389 from CHILDES (about 4%). <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The guidelines we followed for this manual agreement annotation were largely based on pro- noun replacement tests. NPs that referred to a sin- gle man and could be replaced with he or him were labeled 'male singular', NPs that could be replaced by it, such as the comment, were labeled 'neuter singular', and so on. NPs that could not be replaced with a pronoun, such as about 30 years earnings for the average peasant, who makes $145 a year, were excluded from the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Coreference annotation</head><p>We used the provided coreference chains for the OntoNotes data, but for the CHILDES data, it was necessary to do this manually using brat.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>Our experiments are designed to quantify the contri- butions of the various components of the complete model described in Section 3.2 that incorporates discourse salience, cost, and unseen referents. We contrast the complete model with three impover- ished models that lack precisely one of these com- ponents. The comparison model without discourse uses a uniform discourse salience distribution. The model without cost uses constant speech cost. The model without good estimates of unseen referents always assigns probability 1 V · α · 1 C· to unseen referents in the denominator of <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref>, regardless of whether the word is a proper name or pronoun. In other words, this model does not have good esti- mates of unseen referents like the complete model does.</p><p>We use the adult-and child-directed corpora to examine to what extent each model captures speak- ers' referring expressions. We selected pronouns and proper names in each corpus according to sev- eral criteria. First, the referring expression had to be in a coreference chain that had at least one proper name, in order to facilitate computing the cost of the proper name alternative. Second, pro- nouns were only included if they were third person pronouns in subject or object position, and index- icals and reflexives were excluded. Finally, for the CHILDES corpus, children's utterances were excluded.</p><p>After filtering pronouns and proper names ac- cording to these criteria, 553 pronouns and 1,332 proper names (total 1,885 items) in the OntoNotes corpus, and 165 pronouns and 149 proper names (total 314 items) in the CHILDES Gleason corpus remained for use in the analysis.</p><p>Each model chooses referring expressions given information extracted from each corpus as de- scribed in Section 4.1. For evaluation, we com- puted accuracies (total, pronoun, and proper name) and model log likelihood (summing log P S (w|r) for the words in the corpus) for each model. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the results of each model with the OntoNotes and CHILDES datasets. The new referent hyperparameter α and the decay parameter for discourse recency salience were fixed at 0.1 and 3.0, respectively. 7</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">News</head><p>Overall, the recency salience measure provides a better fit than the frequency salience measure with respect to accuracies, suggesting that recency bet- ter captures speakers' representations of discourse salience that influence choices of referring expres- sions. On the other hand, the models with fre- quency discourse salience have higher model log likelihood than the models with recency do. This is because of the peakiness of the recency models. Model log likelihood computed over pronouns and proper names (complete model) were -1022.33 and -222.76, respectively, with recency, and -491.81 and -467.06 with frequency. The recency model tends to return a higher probability for a proper name than the frequency model does. Some pronouns receive a very low probability for this reason, and this lowers the model log likelihood.</p><p>The model without discourse and the model with- out cost consistently failed to predict pronouns (these models predicted all proper names). This happens because in the model without discourse, the information content of pronouns is extremely low due to the large number of consistent unseen referents. In the model without cost, pronouns are disfavored because they always convey less infor- mation than proper names. The log likelihoods of these models were also below that of the complete model. These results show that pronominalization depends on subtle interaction between discourse salience and speech cost. Neither of them is suf- ficient to explain the distribution of pronouns and nouns on its own.</p><p>The total accuracy of the model without good estimates of unseen referents was the worst among the four models, but this model did predict pro- nouns to some extent. Because the number of proper names is larger than the number of pronouns in this dataset, the difference in total accuracies be- tween the model without good estimates of unseen referents and the models without discourse or cost reflects this asymmetry. Comparison between the complete model and the model without good esti- mates of unseen referents also suggests that having knowledge of unseen referents helps correctly pre-  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Accuracies and model log-likelihood dict the use of proper names in the first mention of a referent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Child-directed speech</head><p>Unlike the adult-directed news text, neither recency nor frequency discourse salience provides a good fit to the data. The low accuracies of pronouns and the high accuracies of proper names in all models indicate that the models are more likely to predict proper names than pronouns. There are several possible reasons for this. First, the CHILDES tran- scripts involve long conversations in a natural set- tings. Compared to the news, interlocutors are not focusing on a specific topic, but rather they often switch topics (e.g., a child interrupts her parents' conversation about her father's coworker to talk about her eggs). This topic switching makes it dif- ficult for the model to estimate discourse salience using simple frequency or recency measures. Sec- ond, interlocutors are a family and they share a good deal of common knowledge/background (e.g., a mother said she as the first mention of her child's friend's mother). The current model is not able to incorporate this kind of background knowledge. Third, many referents are visually available. The current model is not able to use visual salience. In general, these problems arise due to our impover- ished estimates of salience, and we would expect a more sophisticated discourse model that accurately measured salience to show better performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Summary</head><p>Experiments with the adult-directed news corpus show a close match between speakers' utterances and model predictions. On the other hand, exper- iments with child-directed speech show that the models were more likely to predict proper names where pronouns were used, suggesting that the esti- mates of discourse salience using simple measures were not sufficient to capture a conversation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>This paper proposes a language production model that extends the rational speech act model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frank and Goodman (2012)</ref> to incorporate updates to listeners' beliefs as discourse proceeds. We show that the predictions suggested from UID in this do- main can be derived from our speaker model, pro- viding an explanation from first principles for the relation between discourse salience and speakers' choices of referring expressions. Experiments with an adult-directed news corpus show a close match between speakers' utterances and model predic- tions, and experiments with child-directed speech show a qualitatively similar pattern. This suggests that speakers' behavior can be modeled in a princi- pled way by considering the probabilities of refer- ents in the discourse and the information conveyed by each word. A controversial issue in language production is to what extent speakers consider a listener's dis- course model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fukumura and van Gompel, 2012)</ref>. By incorporating an explicit model of listeners, our model provides a way to explore this question. For example, the speaker's listener model P L (r|w) in (4) might differ between contexts and could also be extended to sum over possible listener identity q in mixed contexts, as in (11). P L (r|w) = Σ q P (r|w, q)P (q)</p><p>This provides a way to probe speakers' sensitiv- ity to differences in listener characteristics across situations.</p><p>Although the simulations in this paper employed simple measures for discourse salience (referent frequency and recency), the discourse models used by speakers are likely to be more complex. Stud- ies show that semantic information that cannot be captured with these simple measures, such as topi- cality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Orita et al., 2014</ref>) and animacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Vogels et al., 2013a</ref>), affects speakers' choices of referring expressions. Future work will test to what extent this latent discourse information could affect the model predictions.</p><p>Our model predicts a tight coupling between the probability of a referent being mentioned, p(r), and the choice of referring expression. However, these two quantities appear to be dissociated in some cases. For example, Fukumura and Van Gom- pel <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref> show that semantic bias (as a measure of predictability) affects what to refer to (i.e., the referent), but not how to refer (i.e., the referring expression), while grammatical position does af- fect how you refer. One way of dissociating the probability of mention from the choice of referring expression in our model would be through the likeli- hood term, the word probability p(w|r). While we have assumed this word probability to be constant across words and referents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kehler et al. (2008)</ref> use grammatical position to define this probability and show that their model captures experimental data. Syntactic constraints (such as Binding principles) also influence form choices, and this kind of knowl- edge may also be reflected in the word probability. Examining the role of the word probability p(w|r) more closely would allow us to further explore these issues.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our model provides a principled explanation for speakers' choices of referring expressions. In future work we hope to look at a broader range of referring expressions, such as null pronouns and definite descriptions, and to explore the extent to which our model can be applied to other linguistic phenomena that rely on discourse information.</p></div>
