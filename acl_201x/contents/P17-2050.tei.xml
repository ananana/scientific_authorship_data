				<p>We design and release BONIE, the first open numerical relation extractor, for extracting Open IE tuples where one of the arguments is a number or a quantity-unit phrase. BONIE uses bootstrapping to learn the specific dependency patterns that express numerical relations in a sentence. BONIE&apos;s novelty lies in task-specific cus-tomizations, such as inferring implicit relations , which are clear due to context such as units (for e.g., &apos;square kilometers&apos; suggests area, even if the word &apos;area&apos; is missing in the sentence). BONIE obtains 1.5x yield and 15 point precision gain on numerical facts over a state-of-the-art Open IE system.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Open Information Extraction (Open IE) systems extract relational tuples from text, without re- quiring a pre-specified vocabulary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Etzioni et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mausam, 2016)</ref>, by constructing the rela- tion phrases and arguments from within the sen- tences themselves. Early works on Open IE such as REVERB ) extract verb- mediated relations via a handful of human-defined patterns. OLLIE improves recall by learning de- pendency patterns, using bootstrapping over RE- VERB extractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mausam et al., 2012</ref>). Open IE 4.2, a state-of-the-art open information extrac- tor, is based on a combination of SRLIE, a verb- mediated extractor over SRL frames ), and RELNOUN 2.0, which performs special linguistic processing for extraction from complex noun phrases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pal and Mausam, 2016</ref> In this work, we present and release 2 the first system for open numerical extraction, which we name BONIE for Bootstrapping-based Open Numerical Information Extractor. It is important to note that existing Open IE systems, like Open IE 4.2, may also extract numerical facts. How- ever, they are oblivious to the presence of numbers in arguments. Therefore, they may miss important extractions and may not always output the best nu- merical facts. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> compares extractions gener- ated by Open IE 4.2 and BONIE on some of the sample sentences.</p><p>At a high level BONIE follows OLLIE's de- sign of identifying seed facts, constructing training data by bootstrapping sentences that may mention a seed fact, pattern learning and ranking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Madaan et al (2016)</ref> note that bootstrapping for numerical IE is challenging; it can lead to high noise and missed recall, since numbers can easily match out of context, and numbers may not match due to ap- proximations. In response, similar to most previ- ous works (e.g., LUCHS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hoffmann et al., 2010)</ref>) BONIE matches a number if it is within a percent- age threshold. Additionally, BONIE uses a quan- tity extractor <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Roy et al., 2015)</ref>, which provides the units mentioned in the sentence -BONIE bootstraps a sentence only when the units match.</p><p>When compared to OLLIE, BONIE contributes several numerical IE specific customizations. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> Since no open facts are available for this task, we first manually define a set of high-precision seed patterns, which are run over a large corpus to gen- erate seed facts. (2) Not all seeds are fit for boot- strapping -many don't even have an entity as first argument. We develop heuristics to identify an in- formative subset from these. After bootstrapping and pattern learning, we find that we are miss- ing important tuples. E.g., sentence #3 in <ref type="table">Table  1</ref> above has no explicit relation word -the rela- tion "has length of" is implicit via the adjective 'long'. And, sentence #5 expresses the relation 'area' via the units. (3) BONIE identifies implicit relations using additional processing of units and adjectives. (4) Finally, BONIE can tag a quantity as count and prepends "number of" in the relation phrase (sentence #2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>One of the first Open IE systems to obtain sub- stantial recall is OLLIE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mausam et al., 2012)</ref>, which is a pattern learning approach based on a bootstrapped training data using high precision verb-based extractions. Other methods augment the linguistic knowledge in the systems -Exem- plar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">de Sá Mesquita et al., 2013)</ref> adds new rules over dependency parses, SRLIE develops extrac- tion logic over SRL frames ). Several works identify clauses and op- erate over restructured sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Schmidek and Barbosa, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Corro and Gemulla, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bast and Haussmann, 2013</ref>). Other approaches use tree kernels ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Xu et al., 2013)</ref>, qualia-based patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Xavier et al., 2015)</ref>, and simple within-sentence inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bast and Haussmann, 2014</ref>). However, none of them handle numbers specifically, and hence do not work for our problem.</p><p>Numerical Relations: Numbers play an impor- tant role in extracting information from text. Early works have seen people working on understanding numbers that express temporal information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ling and Weld, 2010)</ref>. More recently, the focus has been on numbers that express physical quantities or measures, either mentioned in text <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chaganty and Liang, 2016)</ref> or in the context of web tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ibrahim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Neumaier et al., 2016)</ref>, or on numbers that represent cardinalities of relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mirza et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>One of the prior works that applies to generic numerical relations is LUCHS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hoffmann et al., 2010</ref>), where the system uses distant supervision to create 5,000 relation extractors, which included numerical relations as well. Researchers have also specifically developed numerical relation extrac- tors to extract those relations where one of the ar- guments is a quantity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Vlachos and Riedel, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Intxaurrondo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Madaan et al., 2016)</ref>. However, all of them extract only an ontology rela- tion, and hence are not directly applicable to Open IE. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Open Numerical Relation Extraction</head><p>The goal of Open Numerical Relation Extraction is to process a sentence that has a quantity mention in it, and extract any tuple of the form (Arg1, rela- tion phrase, Arg2) where Arg2 (or Arg1) is a quan- tity. As a first step, BONIE learns patterns where Arg2 is a quantity, as most English sentences tend to express numerical facts in active voice. Fig- ure 1 outlines BONIE's algorithm, which operates in two phases: training and extraction. BONIE's training includes creation of seed facts, genera- tion of training data via bootstrapping, and pat- tern learning over dependency parses. In the ex- traction phrase, BONIE performs pattern match- ing and parse-based expansion to construct numer- ical tuples. These numerical tuples are made more coherent by a novel relation construction step.</p><p>As an example, the sentence "India has a pop- ulation of 1.2 billion" matches seed pattern #2 (from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) to create a seed fact (India; pop- ulation; 1.2 billion; null). This 'null' represents that the quantity needs no unit. While bootstrap- ping, this seed fact may match a sentence "India is the second most populous country in the world, with a population of 1.25 billion." in the corpus.  <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This pattern, when applied to the sentence "Microsoft Windows is the most popular operat- ing system, with a customer base of 300 million users", will extract (Microsoft Windows; has cus- tomer base of; 300 million users).</p><p>While BONIE's skeleton broadly resembles that of OLLIE's ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mausam et al., 2012)</ref>, it brings in customizations specific to the problem of numeri- cal extraction such as a modified pattern language, heuristics for generating high quality seed set and training data, special processing for non-noun re- lations, and a novel relation construction step. We now describe BONIE's algorithm in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Generation of Seed Facts</head><p>Since open numerical facts are not readily avail- able, we first write a handful of high-precision dependency patterns (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> for a list). Each dependency pattern encodes the minimal sub-tree of the dependency parse connecting the relation, quantity and argument in that sen- tence. BONIE encodes a node in a pattern via '&lt;depLabel&gt;#&lt;word&gt;#&lt;POSTag&gt;', where 'depLabel' is the edge connecting the node to its parent, 'word' is the word at the node, 'POSTag' is its part of speech tag; '#' is a delimiter separat- ing them. {rel}, {arg} and {quantity} in the pat- terns are placeholders for relation, argument and quantity headwords, respectively. BONIE gener- ates seed facts by parsing the corpus and match- ing seed patterns with the parse. In case of a suc- cessful match, a seed fact of the form (arg head- word; relation headword; quantity; unit) is gen- erated. Argument and relation headwords are ex- tracted directly from the parse. For the other two, it uses Illinois Quantifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Roy et al., 2015)</ref>, which returns both the quantity and unit separately.</p><p>Since seed facts form the basis of our training task, they must be as clean as possible -BONIE adds several filters to reduce noise. It considers a seed fact as valid only when the quantity node in the pattern is within some quantity span given by Illinois Quantifier. It also rejects any fact whose argument is not a proper noun.</p><p>After these filters it gets high-precision extrac- tions, but not necessarily good seeds -many seeds are generic, which may easily match unrelated sentences. E.g., (Michael; drove; 20; kms) isn't a good seed, since 'Michael' isn't specific, and could erroneously match sentences mentioning an- other Michael with some unrelated reference of a 20 km drive. To improve the set, BONIE checks for the presence of a seed fact in Yago KB ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hoffart et al., 2013</ref>) and keeps only those that are com- mon. Since Yago has many numerical facts for height, area, latitude, GDP, etc., this gives BONIE a diverse set of clean facts for further training.</p><p>Finally, some numerical facts may be expressed without using a nominal relation word. BONIE uses WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Miller, 1995)</ref> to generate new seeds from such seed facts using the derivation- ally related noun form of the relation headword. For example, (Brown ; tall ; 13 ; inches) gets trans- formed to (Brown; height; 13; inches), which gets added as a seed fact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Bootstrapping</head><p>Similar to OLLIE, BONIE finds sentences that contain all words in a seed fact and generates (sen- tence, fact) pairs. But unlike OLLIE, BONIE has quantities and units, and matching them as words isn't appropriate. Illinois Quantifier performs an internal normalization for both, e.g, changes 'dol- lars' and '$' to 'US$', and '%' to 'percent'. Since seed facts also have normalized units, we run Illi- nois quantifier on candidate sentences and match normalized units directly. Moreover, BONIE maintains a percentage threshold δ to control the amount of allowed difference between quantities in the sentence and seed fact. Once all constituents of a fact match with a sentence, BONIE generates the (sentence, fact) pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Open Pattern Learning</head><p>For each (sentence, fact) pair, BONIE parses the sentence, and replaces the argument and relation words of the fact with '{arg}' and '{rel}' place- holders. For quantity and unit words, BONIE replaces the one at a higher level in the parse with '{quantity}'. The minimal path containing '{arg}', '{rel}' and '{quantity}' is learned as a pattern. Since quantity and unit are typically ex- pected to remain close to each other in a sentence, BONIE rejects all such patterns where the distance between them exceeds a certain threshold value.</p><p>Some patterns are learned with specific words such as 'contains' in example (partial) &lt;(#contains#verb)&lt;(dobj#{quantity}#.+)&lt;... We believe that this pattern should work with all inflections and synonyms of 'contain', BONIE uses WordNet to expand the pattern by including all inflections and synset synonyms. Each pattern is scored based on the number of times it is learned from the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Constructing Extractions</head><p>After matching a pattern to a new sentence, sim- ilar to OLLIE, arg/rel phrases are completed by expanding the extracted headnouns on poss, det, num, neg, amod, quantmod, nn, and pobj edges. If one of the children of the argument headword is a prep, rcmod or partmod edge, the whole sub- tree under that is extracted. Quantity phrase is extracted by Illinois quantifier, but if any sibling node of the quantity node is connected by a prep edge, with the word 'of', BONIE expands the en- tire subtree below it. This allows "10 percent of 100 dollars" to be included in the quantity phrase. Relation Phrase Construction: Whenever the relation headword is an adjective or an adverb, BONIE uses WordNet to get its derivationally re- lated noun form and that becomes the new rela- tion. This transforms the tuple (Donald Trump ; old ; about 70 years) to (Donald Trump ; has age of ; about 70 years).</p><p>Sometimes, sentences don't use a numerical re- lation word -it is obvious from the units. E.g., sentence #4 on page 1 expresses the 'area' relation implicitly. BONIE infers these implicit relations using the unit analysis in <ref type="bibr">UnitTagger (Sarawagi and Chakrabarti, 2014)</ref>. Whenever BONIE sees a unit (sq kms) getting mistreated as a relation it uses UnitTagger to infer relations from units and postprocesses the extraction accordingly. The ex- traction, as a result changes from (James Valley; has sq kms of ; 5 of fruit orchards) to (James Val- ley ; has area of fruit orchards ; 5 sq kms).</p><p>Finally, in cases when a plural noun relation word also appears as a unit in the quantifier, BONIE hypothesizes that it is a count extraction, and prepends 'number of' to the relation headword and removes the unit from the quantity phrase. E.g., (Microsoft; has employees; 100,000 employ- ees) from sentence #2 becomes (Microsoft; has number of employees; 100,000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We build BONIE over data from ClueWeb12, 4 fil- tered so as to keep only the sentences that contain numbers. We further remove those where quantity represents a date, time, or duration, and where the quantity is accompanied by document words like 'Section', ' <ref type="table">Table'</ref>, or ' <ref type="figure">Figure'</ref>. We use the depen- dency parser from ClearNLP 5 . We generate about 21,000 seed facts from roughly 20 million numeri- cal sentences. These are matched against 7 million numerical sentences obtaining about 18,500 (sen- tence, fact) pairs.</p><p>We tried different values of δ (the matching threshold) and found results to not be sensitive as long as δ varies in the range of 2% to 5%. So we set δ=2% during the final evaluation. The distance threshold between the quantity and unit mentioned in Section 2.3 is set to 3 and is based on our gen- eral understanding of parse trees.</p><p>BONIE learns around 7,000 new patterns. Since pattern frequency is a good indicator of pattern quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wu and Weld, 2010)</ref>, we rank the patterns on the basis of frequency and take the top 1,000 patterns for further analysis. We find that almost all patterns beyond the top 1,000 are learned only once or twice on our training set. Our decision to ignore all patterns beyond the top 1,000 is so that we have a support of at least three for each pattern.</p><p>We sample a random testset of 2,000 numeri- cal sentences from ClueWeb12 (not used in train- ing). Two annotators with NLP experience anno- tate each extraction for correctness. We obtain an inter-annotator agreement of 97%, and report the results on the subset where both annotators agree.</p><p>Since there are no open numerical extractors available, we compare BONIE against an Open IE system and another closed numerical IE system.    We also perform additional ablation study to evaluate the value of each component. Just the seed patterns themselves have a significantly higher precision but much smaller yield. This is expected, since the seeds must be highly precise for bootstrapping. If Yago matching and other seed filtering heuristics are turned off, the preci- sion of the system goes down drastically due to a very noisy bootstrapped set. If the post-processing of relation phrase construction is turned off, there is a 5 point precision loss and about 7% yield reduction due to some incorrect extracted tuples, which are corrected by post-processing. Finally, Wordnet-based expansion has marginal increase in yield and slight precision loss.</p><p>Open IE 4.2 associates a confidence value with each extraction -ranking against which generates a precision-yield curve. For BONIE, we rank the patterns in such a way that the seed patterns are at the top, followed by the learned patterns. The learned patterns are ordered based on their fre- quencies. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> reports the curves for both the systems and we find that BONIE has a larger area under the curve as compared to Open IE 4.2.</p><p>Estimating recall in Open IE is difficult since it requires annotators to exhaustively tag all open extractions in a sentence. To get an estimate, an author manually tagged 100 sentences with all nu- merical extractions. We find that BONIE's recall is about 48%. Two-thirds of missed recall is be- cause of missing conjuncts. E.g., it misses the tu- ple relating retirement age with 68 years in "The retirement age for men is 65 years and 68 years for women." Other missed recall is due to complexity of sentences or inaccuracy of parsers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We release BONIE <ref type="bibr">8</ref> , the first open numerical re- lation extractor and other resources for further re- search. BONIE is based on bootstrapping and pat- tern learning and follows previous similar works such as OLLIE. However, for effective bootstrap- ping and training, it implements various cus- tomizations specific to numerical relations in cu- ration of seed fact set, matching of sentences, and construction of relation phrase at the time of ex- traction. BONIE significantly outperforms both open non-numerical IE, and closed numerical IE systems with 1.5x yield and 15 point precision gain over a state-of-the-art Open IE system. We find that better conjunction processing is an im- portant future step for improving BONIE's recall even further.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: BONIE flow diagram</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,307.28,232.86,226.77,159.74" type="bitmap" /></figure>
