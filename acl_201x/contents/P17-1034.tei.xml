				<p>Solving the cold-start problem in review s-pam detection is an urgent and significant task. It can help the on-line review web-sites to relieve the damage of spammers in time, but has never been investigated by previous work. This paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam for the cold-start problem, by learning to represent the new reviewers&apos; review with jointly embedded textual and behav-ioral information. Experimental results prove the proposed model achieves an effective performance and possesses preferable domain-adaptability. It is also applicable to a large-scale dataset in an unsu-pervised way.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the rapid growth of products reviews at the web, it has become common for people to read reviews before making a purchase decision. The reviews usually contain abundant consumers' per- sonal experiences. It has led to a significant in- fluence on financial gains and fame for business- es. Existing studies have shown that an extra half- star rating on Yelp causes restaurants to sell out 19% points more frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson and Magruder, 2012</ref>), and a one-star increase in Yelp rat- ing leads to a 5-9 % increase in revenue <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Luca, 2011)</ref>. This, unfortunately, gives strong incentives for imposters (called spammers) to game the sys- tem. They post fake reviews or opinions (called review spam) to promote or to discredit some tar- geted products and services. The news from BBC has shown that around 25% of Yelp reviews could be fake. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Therefore, it is urgent to detect review s- 1 http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-24299742 pam, to ensure that the online review continues to be trusted.</p><p>Jindal and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liu (2008)</ref> make the first step to de- tect review spam. Most efforts are devoted to ex- ploring effective linguistic and behavioral features by subsequent work to distinguish such spam from the real reviews. However, to notice such pattern- s or form behavioral features, developers should take a long time to observe the data, because the features are based on statistics. For instance, the feature activity window proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mukherjee et al. (2013c)</ref> is to measure the activity freshness of reviewers. It usually takes several months to count the difference of timestamps between the last and first reviews for reviewers. When the fea- tures show themselves finally, some major dam- ages might have already been done. Thus, it is important to design algorithms that can detect re- view spam as soon as possible, ideally, right after they are posted by the new reviewers. It is a cold- start problem which is the focus of this paper.</p><p>In this paper, we assume that we must identi- fy fake reviews immediately when a new reviewer posts just one review. Unfortunately, it is very dif- ficult because the available information for detect- ing fake reviews is very poor. Traditional behav- ioral features based on the statistics can only work well on users' abundant behaviors. The more be- havioral information obtained, the more effective the traditional behavioral features are (see experi- ments in Section 3 ). In the scenario of cold-start, a new reviewer only has a behavior: post a review. As a result, we can not get effective behavioral fea- tures from the data. Although, the linguistic fea- tures of reviews do not need to take much time to form, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mukherjee et al. (2013c)</ref> have proved that the linguistic features are not effective enough in detecting real-life fake reviews from the commer- cial websites, where we also obtain the same ob- servation (the details are shown in Section 3). Therefore, the main difficulty of the cold-start spam problem is that there are no sufficient behav- iors of the new reviewers for constructing effec- tive behavioral features. Nevertheless, there is am- ple textual and behavioral information contained in the abundant reviews posted by the existing re- viewers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). We could employ behavioral information of existing similar reviewers to a new reviewer to approximate his behavioral features. We argue that a reviewer's individual characteris- tics such as background information, motivation, and interactive behavior style have a great influ- ence on a reviewer's textual and behavioral infor- mation. So the textual information and the behav- ioral information of a reviewer are correlated with each other (similar argument in ). For example, the students of the college are likely to choose the youth hostel during summer vaca- tion and tend to comment the room price in their reviews. But the financial analysts on a business trip may tend to choose the business hotel, the en- vironment and service are what they care about in their reviews.</p><p>To augment the behavioral information of the new reviewers in the cold-start problem, we first try to find the textual information which is sim- ilar with that of the new reviewer, from the ex- isting reviews. There are several ways to model the textual information of the review spam, such as Unigram ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mukherjee et al., 2013c</ref>), POS (Ot- t et al., 2011) and LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Newman et al., 2003)</ref>. We employ the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to mod- el the review text, which has been proved that it can capture complex global semantic information that is difficult to express using traditional discrete manual features <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ren and Zhang, 2016)</ref>. Then we employ the behavioral information which is cor- related with the found textual information to ap- proximate the behavioral information of the new reviewer. An intuitive approach is to search the most similar existing review for the new review, then take the found reviewer's behavioral features as the new reviewers' features (detailed in Section 5.3). However, there is abundant behavioral infor- mation in the review graph <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>), it is diffi- cult for the traditional discrete manual behavioral features to record the global behavioral informa- tion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wang et al., 2016)</ref>. Moreover, the traditional features can not capture the reviewer's individual characteristics, because there is no explicit charac- teristic tag available in the review system (experi- ments in Section 5.3). So, we propose a neural net- work model to jointly encode the textual and be- havioral information into the review embeddings for detecting the review spam in the cold-start problem. By encoding the review graph struc- ture <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>), the proposed model can record the global footprints of the existing reviewers in an un- supervised way, and further record the reviewers' latent characteristic information in the footprints. The jointly learnt review embeddings can model the correlation of the reviewers' textual and behav- ioral information. When a new reviewer posts a re- view, the proposed model can represent the review with the similar textual information and the corre- lated behavioral information encoded in the word embeddings. Finally, the embeddings of the new review are fed into a classifier to identify whether it is spam or not.</p><p>In summary, our major contributions include:</p><p>• To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explores the cold-start problem in review spam detection. We qualitatively and quan- titatively prove that the traditional linguistic and behavioral features are not effective e- nough in detecting review spam for the cold- start task.</p><p>• We propose a neural network model to joint- ly encode the textual and behavioral infor- mation into the review embeddings for the cold-start spam detection task. It is an unsu- pervised distributional representation model which can learn from large scale unlabeled review data.</p><p>• Experimental results on two domains (hotel and restaurant) give good confidence that the proposed model performs effectively in the cold-start spam detection task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Whether Traditional Features are Effective</head><p>As a new reviewer posted just one review and we have to identify it immediately, the major chal- lenge of the cold-start task is that the available information about the new reviewer is very poor.</p><p>The new reviewer only provides us with one re- view record. For most traditional features based on the statistics, they can not form themselves or make no sense, such as the percentage of reviews written at weekends ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2015)</ref>, the entropy of rating distribution of user's review (Rayana and Akoglu, 2015). To investigate whether traditional features are effective in the cold-start task, we con- ducted experiments on the Yelp dataset in Mukher- jee et al. (2013c). We trained SVM models with different features on the existing reviews posted before January 1, 2012, and tested on the new re- views which just posted by the new reviewers after January 1, 2012. Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linguistic Features' Poor Performance</head><p>The linguistic features need not take much time to form. But <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mukherjee et al. (2013c)</ref> have proved that the linguistic features are not effective e- nough in detecting real-life fake reviews from the commercial websites, compared with the perfor- mances on the crowd source datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ott et al., 2011</ref>). They showed that the word bigrams per- form better than the other linguistic features, such as LIWC ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Newman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pennebaker et al., 2007)</ref>, part-of-speech sequence patterns (Mukher- jee and Liu, 2010), deep syntax ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Feng et al., 2012a</ref>), information gain (Mukherjee et al., 2013c) and so on. So, we conduct experiments with the word bigrams feature. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> (a, b) row 1, the word bigrams result in only around 55% in accuracy in both the hotel and restaurant domains. It indicates that the most effective tra- ditional linguistic feature (i.e., the word bigrams) can't detect the review spam effectively in the cold start task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Behavioral Features only Work Well with Abundant Information</head><p>Because there is not enough available information about the new reviewer, for most traditional be- havioral features based on the statistical mecha- nism, they couldn't form themselves or make no sense. We investigated the previous work and found that there are three behavioral features can be applied to the cold-start task. They are pro- posed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mukherjee et al. (2013b)</ref>, i.e., 1.Review length (RL) : the length of the new review posted by the new reviewer; 2.Reviewer deviation (RD): the absolute rating deviation of the new reviewer's review from other reviews on the same business; 3.Maximum content similarity (MCS) : the max- imum content similarity (using cosine similarity) between the new reviewer's review with other re- views on the same business. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> (a, b) row 2 shows the experiment re- sults by the combinations of the bigrams feature and the three behavioral features described above. The behavioral features make around 5% improve- ment in accuracy in the hotel domain (2.7% in the restaurant domain) as compared with only using bigrams. The accuracy is improved but it is just near 60% in average. It indicates that the tradi- tional features are not effective enough with poor behavioral information. What's more, the behav- ioral features cause around 4.6% decrease in F1- score and around 19% decrease in Recall in both hotel and restaurant domains. It is obvious that there is more false-positive review spam caused by the behavioral features as compared to only using bigrams. It further indicates that the traditional be- havioral features' discrimination for review spam gets to be weakened by the poor behavioral infor- mation.</p><p>To go a step further, we carried experi- ments with the three behavioral features which are formed on abundant behavioral information. When the new reviewers continue to post more re- views in after weeks, their behavioral information gets to be more. Then the review system could ob- tain sufficient data to extract behavior features as compared to the poor information in the cold-start period. So the behavioral features with abundant information make an obvious improvement in ac- curacy (6.4%) in the hotel domain <ref type="table">(Table 1 (</ref></p><note type="other">a) row 3) as compared with the results in Table 1 (a) row 2. But it is only 0.6% in the restaurant domain. By statistics on the datasets, we found that the new re- viewers posted about 54.4 reviews in average after their first post in the hotel domain, but it is only 10 reviews in average for the new reviewers in the restaurant domain. The added behavioral informa- tion in the hotel domain is richer than that in the restaurant domain. It indicates that:</note><p>• the traditional behavioral features can only work well with abundant behavioral informa- tion;</p><p>• the more behavioral information can be ob- tained, the more effective the traditional be- havioral features are. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Illustration of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>369</head><p>The difficulty of detecting review spam in the cold-start task is that the available behavioral in- formation of new reviewers is very poor. The new reviewer just posted one review and we have to fil- ter it out immediately, there is not any historical re- view provided to us. As we argued, the textual in- formation and the behavioral information of a re- viewer are correlated with each other. So, to aug- ment the behavioral information of new reviewer- s, we try to find the textual information which is similar with that of the new reviewer, from exist- ing reviews. Then we take the behavioral infor- mation which is correlated with the found textu- al information as the most possible behavioral in- formation of the new reviewer. For this purpose, we propose a neural network model to jointly en- code the textual and behavioral information into the review embeddings for detecting the review s- pam in the cold-start problem (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). When a new reviewer posts a review, the neural network can represent the review with the similar textual information and the correlated behavioral information encoded in the word embeddings. Fi- nally, embeddings of the new review are fed into a classifier to identify whether it is spam or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Behavioral Information Encoding</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, there is a part of review graph which is simplified from the Yelp website. As it shows, the review graph contains the global behavioral infor- mation (footprints) of the existing reviewers. Be- cause the motivations of the spammers and the re- al reviewers are totally different, the distributions of the behavioral information of them are differ- ent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mukherjee et al., 2013a</ref>). There are business- es (even highly reputable ones) paying people to write fake reviews for them to promote their prod- ucts/services and/or to discredit their competitors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu, 2015)</ref>. So the behavioral footprints of the spammers are decided by the demands of the busi- nesses. But the real reviewers only post reviews to the product or services they have actually experi- enced. Their behavioral footprints are influenced by their own characteristics. Previous work ex- tracts behavioral features for reviewers from these behavioral information. But it is impractical to the new reviewers in the cold-start task. Moreover, the traditional discrete features can not effective- ly record the global behavioral information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wang et al., 2016)</ref>. Besides, there is no explicit charac- teristic tag available in the review system, and we need to find a way to record the reviewers' latent characters information in footprints. Therefore we encode these behavioral informa- tion into our model by utilizing an embedding learning model which is similar with TransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bordes et al., 2013)</ref>. TransE is a model which can en- code the graph structure, and represent the nodes and edges (head, translation/relation, tail) in low dimension vector space. TransE has been proved that it is good at describing the global information of the graph structure by the work about distri- butional representation for knowledge base ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guu et al., 2015</ref>). We consider that each reviewer in review graph describes the product in his/her own view and writes the review. When we represent the product, reviewer, and review in low dimen- sion vector space, the reviewer embeddings can be taken as a translation vector, which has translated the product embeddings to the review embeddings. So, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we take the products (hotels/restaurants) as the head part of the TransE network in our model, take the reviewers as the translation (relation) part and take the review as the tail part. By learning from the existing large scale unlabeled reviews of the review graph, we can encode the global behavioral information in- to our model without extracting any traditional be- havioral feature, and record reviewers' latent char- acteristics information.</p><p>More formally, we minimize a margin-based criterion over the training set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L = ∑ (β,α,τ )∈S ∑ (β ′ ,α,τ ′ )∈S ′ max {0, 1 + d(β + α, τ ) − d(β ′ + α, τ ′ )}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>S denotes the training set of triples (β, α, τ ) composed product β (β ∈ B, products set (head part)), reviewer α (α ∈ A, reviewers set (trans- lation part)) and review text embeddings learnt by the CNN τ (τ ∈ T , review texts set (tail part)).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S ′ = {(β ′ , α, τ )|β ′ ∈ B} ∪ {(β, α, τ ′ )|τ ′ ∈ T } (2)</formula><p>The set of corrupted triplets S ′ (Equation <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>), is composed of training triplets with either the prod- uct or review text replaced by a random chosen one (but not both at the same time).  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d(β + α, τ ) = ∥β + α − τ ∥ 2 2 , s.t. ∥β∥ 2 2 = ∥α∥ 2 2 = ∥τ ∥ 2 2 = 1<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Textual Information Encoding</head><p>To encode the textual information into our model, we adopt a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn to represent the existing reviews. By statis- tics, we find that a review usually refers to several aspects of the products or services. For example, a hotel review may comment the room price, the free WiFi, and the bathroom at the same time. Com- pared with the recurrent neural network (RNN), the CNN can do a better job of modeling the dif- ferent aspects of a review. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ren and Zhang (2016)</ref> have proved that the CNN can capture complex global semantic information and detect review s- pam more effectively, compared with traditional discrete manual features and the RNN model. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we take the learnt embeddings τ of reviews by the CNN as the tail part. Specifically, we denote the review text consist- ing of n words as {w 1 , w 2 , ..., w n }, the word em- beddings e(w i ) ∈ R D , D is the word vector di- mension. We take the concatenation of the word embeddings in a fixed length window size Z as the input of the linear layer, which is denoted as I i ∈ R D×Z . So the output of the linear layer H i is calculated by H k,i = W k · I i + b i , where W k ∈ R D×Z is the weight matrix of filter k. We utilize a max pooling layer to get the output of each filter. Then we take tanh as the activation function and concatenate the outputs as the final review embeddings, which is denoted as τ i .</p></div>

The spammers often review their target products with a low rat- ing for discredited purpose, and with a high rating for promoted purpose. To encode the semantics of the sentiment polarity into the review embeddings, we learn the embeddings of 1-5 stars rating in our model at the same time.

We take the existing reviews posted before January 1, 2012 as the datasets for training our embed- ding learning model, and take the first new reviews which just posted by the new reviewers after Jan- uary 1, 2012 as the test datasets. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> displays the statistics of the balanced datasets for training and testing the classifier. Evaluation Metrics: We select precision (P), re- call (R), F1-Score (F1), accuracy (A) as metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Our Model v.s. the Traditional Features</head><p>To illustrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on the public datasets, and make comparison with the most effective tradi- tional linguistic features, e.g., bigrams, and the three practicable traditional behavioral features (RL, RD, MCS (Mukherjee et al., 2013b)) referred in Section 3.2. The results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. For our model, we set the dimension of embed- dings to 100, the number of CNN filters to 100, θ to 0.1, Z to 2. The hyper-parameters are tuned by grid search on the development dataset. The prod- uct and reviewer embeddings are randomly ini- tialized from a uniform distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Socher et al., 2013)</ref>. The word embeddings are initialized with 100-dimensions vectors pre-trained by the CBOW model (Word2Vec) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. As Ta- ble 5 showed, our model observably performs bet- ter in detecting review spam for the cold-start task in both hotel and restaurant domains.</p><p>Review Embeddings Compared with the tradi- tional linguistic features, e.g., bigrams, using the review embeddings learnt by our model, result- s in around 3.4% improvement in F1 and around 7.4% improvement in A in the hotel domain (1.1% in F1 and 5.0% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 5 (a,b) rows 1, 5). Compared with the combination of the bigrams and the traditional behavioral features, using the review embeddings learnt by our model, results in around 7.6% im- provement in F1 and around 2.2% improvement in A in the hotel domain (6.1% in F1 and 2.3% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 5 (a,b) rows 2, 5). The F1-Score (F1) of the classi- fication under the balance distribution reflects the ability to detect the review spam. The accuracy (A) of the classification under the balance distri- bution reflects the ability to identify both the re- view spam and the real review. The experimen- t results indicate that our model performs signif- icantly better than the traditional methods in F1 and A at the same time. The learnt review em- beddings with encoded linguistic and behavioral information are more effective in detecting review   <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: SVM classification results across linguistic features (LF, bigrams here ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mukherjee et al., 2013b)</ref>), the learnt review embeddings (RE) ; and the classification results by only using our CNN. Both training and testing use balanced data <ref type="bibr">(50:50)</ref>. Improvements of our model are statistically significant with p&lt;0.005 based on paired t-test.</p><p>spam for the cold-start task.</p><p>Rating Embeddings As we referred in Section 4.3, the rating of a review usually means the senti- ment polarity of a real reviewer or the motivation of a spammer. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> (a,b) rows 6, adding the rating embeddings of the products (hotel/restaurant) and reviews renders even higher F1 and A. We suppose that different rating embed- dings are encoded with different semantic mean- ings. They reflect the semantic divergences be- tween the average rating of the product and the review rating. In results, using RE+RRE+PRE which makes the best performance of our mod- el, results in around 5.5% improvement in F1 and around 9.4% improvement in A in the hotel do- main (2.9% in F1 and 6.2% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 5 (a,b) rows 1, 6), com- pared with the LF. Using RE+RRE+PRE result- s in around 9.7% improvement in F1 and around 4.2% improvement in A in the hotel domain (7.9% in F1 and 3.5% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 5 (a,b) rows 2, 6), compared with the LF+BF.</p><p>The experiment results prove that our model is effective. The improvements in both the F1 and A prove that our model performs well in both de- tecting the review spam and identifying the real review. Furthermore, the improvements in both the hotel and restaurant domains prove that our model possesses preferable domain-adaptability 2 . It can learn to represent the reviews with global linguistic and behavioral information from large- scale unlabeled existing reviews. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The improvements in hotel domain are greater than that in restaurant domain. The possible reason is the proportion of the available training data in hotel domain is higher than that in restaurant domain (99.01% vs. 97.40% in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Our Jointly Embeddings v.s. the Intuitive Methods</head><p>As mentioned in Section 1, to approximate the be- havioral information of the new reviewers, there are other intuitive methods. So we conduct exper- iments with two intuitive methods as a compari- son. One is finding the most similar existing re- view by edit distance ratio and taking the found reviewers' behavioral features as an approxima- tion, and then training the classifier on the be- havioral features and bigrams (BF EditSim+LF). The other is finding the most similar existing review by cosine similarity of review embed- dings which is the average of the pre-trained word embeddings (using Word2Vec), and then training the classifier on the behavioral features and review embeddings (BF W2Vsim+W2V). As shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, our joint embeddings (Ours RE and Ours RE+RRE+PRE) obviously perform bet- ter than the intuitive methods, such as the Ours RE is 3.8% (Accuracy) and 3.2% (F1) better than BF W2Vsim+W2V in the hotel domain. The ex- periments indicate that our joint embeddings do a better job in capturing the reviewer's character- istics and modeling the correlation of textual and behavioral information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">The Effectiveness of Encoding the Global Behavioral Information</head><p>To further evaluate the effectiveness of encoding the global behavioral information in our model, we build an independent supervised convolutional neural network which has the same structure and parameter settings with the CNN part of our mod- el. There is not any review graphic or behavioral information in this independent supervised CNN (Tabel 6 (a,b) row 2). As shown in Tabel 6 (a,b) rows 2, 3, compared with the review embeddings learnt by the independent supervised CNN, using the review embeddings learnt by our model result- s in around 9.0% improvement in F1 and around 3.8% improvement in A in the hotel domain (7.9% in F1 and 3.7% in A for the restaurant domain).</p><p>The results show that our model can represent the new reviews posted by the new reviewers with the correlated behavioral information encoded in the word embeddings. The transE part of our mod- el has effectively recorded the behavioral informa- tion of the review graph. Thus, our model is more effective by jointly embedding the textual and be- havioral informations, it helps to augment the pos- sible behavioral information of the new reviewer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">The Effectiveness of CNN</head><p>Compared with the the most effective linguistic features, e.g., bigrams, our independent super- vised convolutional neural network performs bet- ter in A than F1 (shown in Tabel 5 (a,b) rows 1, 2). It indicates that the CNN do a better job in identifying the real review than the review s- pam. We suppose that the possible reason is that the CNN is good at modeling the different seman- tic aspects of a review. And the real reviewer- s usually tend to describe different aspects of a hotel or restaurant according to their real person- al experiences, but the spammers can only forge fake reviews with their own infinite imagination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mukherjee et al. (2013b)</ref> also proved that different psychological states of the minds of the spammer- s and non-spammers, lead to significant linguistic differences between review spam and non-spam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>This paper analyzes the importance and difficul- ty of the cold-start challenge in review spam com- bat. We propose a neural network model that joint- ly embeds the existing textual and behavioral in- formation for detecting review spam in the cold- start task. It can learn to represent the new re- view of the new reviewer with the similar textu- al information and the correlated behavioral infor- mation in an unsupervised way. Then, a classifi- er is applied to detect the review spam. Experi- mental results prove the proposed model achieves an effective performance and possesses preferable domain-adaptability. It is also applicable to a large-scale dataset in an unsupervised way. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to handle the cold-start problem in review spam detection. We are going to explore more effective models in fu- ture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Part of review graph simplified from Yelp.</figDesc></figure>
