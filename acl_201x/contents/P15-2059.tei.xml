				<p>This paper investigates the contribution of document level processing of time-anchors for TimeLine event extraction. We developed and tested two different systems. The first one is a baseline system that captures explicit time-anchors. The second one extends the baseline system by also capturing implicit time relations. We have evaluated both approaches in the SemEval 2015 task 4 TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering. We empirically demonstrate that the document-based approach obtains a much more complete time anchoring. Moreover, this approach almost doubles the performance of the systems that participated in the task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Temporal relation extraction has been the topic of different SemEval tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Verhagen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">UzZaman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Llorens et al., 2015</ref>) and other challenges as the 6th i2b2 NLP Challenge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sun et al., 2013</ref>). These tasks focused mainly on the temporal relations of the events with respect to other events or time ex- pressions, and their goals are to discover which of them occur before, after or simultaneously to oth- ers. Recently, SemEval 2015 included a novel task regarding temporal information extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Minard et al., 2015)</ref>. The aim of SemEval 2015 task 4 is to order in a TimeLine the events in which a target entity is involved and presents some signifi- cant differences with respect to previous exercises. First, the temporal information must be recovered from different sources in a cross-document way. Second, the TimeLines are focused on the events involving just a given entity. Finally, unlike pre- vious challenges, SemEval 2015 task 4 requires a quite complete time anchoring. This work focuses mainly on this latter point. We show that the tem- poral relations that explicitly connect events and time expressions are not enough to obtain a full time-anchor annotation and, consequently, pro- duce incomplete TimeLines. We propose that for a complete time-anchoring the temporal analysis must be performed at a document level in order to discover implicit temporal relations. We present a preliminary approach that obtains, by far, the best results on the main track of SemEval 2015 task 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The present work is closely related to previous ap- proaches involved in TempEval campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Verhagen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">UzZaman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Llorens et al., 2015)</ref>. In these works, the problem can be seen as a clas- sification task for deciding the type of the tempo- ral link that connects two different events or an event and a temporal expression. For that reason, the task has been mainly addresed using super- vised techniques. For example, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mani et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mani et al., 2007</ref>) trained a MaxEnt classifier us- ing training data which were bootstrapped by ap- plying temporal closure. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chambers et al., 2007</ref>) focused on event-event relations using previously learned event attributes. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(D ´ Souza and Ng, 2013</ref>) combined hand-coded rules with some semantic and discourse features. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Laokulrat et al., 2013</ref>) obtained the best results on TempE- val 2013 annotating sentences with predicate-role structures, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mirza and Tonelli, 2014</ref>) affirm that using a simple feature set results in better per- formances.</p><p>However, recent works like ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chambers et al., 2014</ref>) have pointed out that these tasks cover just a part of all the temporal relations that can be inferred from the documents. Furthermore, time-anchoring is just a part of the works pre- sented above. Our approach aims to extend these strategies and it is based on other research lines involving the extraction of implicit information <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Palmer et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Whittemore et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tetreault, 2002</ref>). Particularly, we are inspired by recent works on Implicit Semantic Role Labelling (ISRL) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gerber and Chai, 2012)</ref> and very specially on the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blanco and Moldovan, 2014</ref>) who adapted the ideas about ISRL to focus on modi- fiers, including arguments of time, instead of core arguments or roles. As the SemEval 2015 task 4 does not include any training data we decided to develop a deterministic algorithm of the type of (Laparra and Rigau, 2013) for ISRL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering</head><p>In the SemEval task 4 TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Minard et al., 2015)</ref>, given a set of documents and a target entity, the aim is to build a TimeLine by detecting the events in which the entity is involved and anchoring these events to normalized times. Thus, a TimeLine is a collec- tion of ordered events in time relevant for a partic- ular entity. TimeLines contain relevant events in which the target entity participates as ARG0 (i.e agent) or ARG1 (i.e. patient) as defined in Prop- Bank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The target entities can be people, organization, product or financial enti- ties and the annotation of time anchors is based on TimeML.</p><p>For example, given the entity Steve Jobs, a TimeLine contains the events with the associated ordering in the TimeLine and the time anchor: The evaluation used in the task is based on the metric previously introduced in <ref type="bibr">TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2013</ref>). The metric captures the tem-poral awareness of an annotation (UzZaman and Allen, 2011) based on temporal closure graphs. In order to calculate the precision, recall and F1 score, the TimeLines are first transformed into a graph representation. For that, the time anchors are represented as TIMEX3 and the events are re- lated to the corresponding TIMEX3 by means of the SIMULTANEOUS relation type. In addition, BEFORE relation types are created to represent that one event happens before another one and SI- MULTANEOUS relation types to refer to events happening at the same time. The official scores are based on the micro-average of F1 scores.</p><p>The main track of the task (Track A) consists of building TimeLines providing only the raw text sources. Two systems participated in the task. The organisers also defined a Track B where gold event mentions were given. In this case, two different systems sent results. For both tracks, a sub-track in which the events are not associated to a time anchor was also presented.</p><p>In this work, we focus on the main track of the task. We believe the main track is the most chal- lenging one as no annotated data is provided. In- deed, WHUNLP 1 was the best run and achieved an F1 of 7.28%.</p><p>Three runs were submitted. The WHUNLP team used the Stanford CoreNLP and they applied a rule-based approach to extract the entities and their predicates. They also performed temporal reasoning. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The remaining two runs were submit- ted using the SPINOZA VU system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Caselli et al., 2015)</ref>. They performed entity resolution, event de- tection, event-participant linking, coreference res- olution, factuality profiling and temporal process- ing at document and cross-document level. Then, the TimeLine extractor built a global timeline be- tween all events and temporal expressions regard- less of the target entities and then it extracted the target entities for the TimeLines. The participants also presented an out of the competition system which anchors events to temporal expressions ap- pearing not only in the same sentence but also in the previous and following sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Baseline TimeLine extraction</head><p>In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors. We have defined a three step pro-cess to build TimeLines. Given a set of documents and a target entity, the system first obtains the events in which the entity is involved. Second, it obtains the time-anchors for each of these events. Finally, it sorts the events according to their time- anchors. For steps 1 and 2 we apply a pipeline of tools (cf. section 4.1) that provides annotations at different levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">NLP processing</head><p>Detecting mentions of events, entities and time ex- pressions in text requires the combination of vari- ous Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules. We apply a generic pipeline of linguistic tools that includes Named-Entity Recognition (NER) and Disambiguation (NED), Co-reference Resolution (CR), Semantic Role Labelling (SRL), Time Ex- pressions Identification (TEI) and Normalization (TEN), and Temporal Relation Extraction (TRE). The NLP processing is based on the NewsReader pipeline (Agerri et al., 2014a), version 2.1. Next, we present the different tools in our pipeline.</p><p>Named-Entity Recognition (NER) and Dis- ambiguation (NED): We perform NER using the ixa-pipe-nerc that is part of IXA pipes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agerri et al., 2014b</ref>). The module provides very fast models with high performances, obtaining 84.53 in F1 on CoNLL tasks. Our NED module is based on DB- pedia Spotlight ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Daiber et al., 2013</ref>). We have cre- ated a NED client to query the DBpedia Spotlight server for the Named entities detected by the ixa- pipe-nerc module. Using the best parameter com- bination, the best results obtained by this module on the TAC 2011 dataset were 79.77 in precision and 60.67 in recall. The best performance on the AIDA dataset is 79.67 in precision and 76.94 in recall.</p><p>Coreference Resolution (CR): In this case, we use a coreference module that is loosely based on the Stanford Multi Sieve Pass sytem (Lee et al., 2011). The system consists of a number of rule- based sieves that are applied in a deterministic manner. The system scores 56.4 F1 on CoNLL 2011 task, around 3 points worse than the system by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lee et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>Semantic Role Labelling (SRL): SRL is per- formed using the system included in the MATE- tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Björkelund et al., 2009)</ref>. This system re- ported on the CoNLL 2009 Shared Task a labelled semantic F1 of 85.63 for English.</p><p>Time Expression Identification (TEI) and Normalization (TEN): We use the time module from TextPro suite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pianta et al., 2008</ref>) to capture the tokens corresponding to temporal expressions and to normalize them following TIDES specifica- tion. This module is trained on TempEval3 data. The average results for English is: 83.81% preci- sion, 75.94% recall and 79.61% F1 values. Time Relation Extraction (TRE): We ap- ply the temporal relation extractor module from TextPro to extract and classify temporal relations between an event and a time expression. This module is trained using yamcha tool on the Tem- pEval3 data. The result for relation classification on the corpus of TempEval3 is: 58.8% precision, 58.2% recall and 58.5% F1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">TimeLine extraction</head><p>Our TimeLine extraction system uses the linguis- tic information provided by the pipeline. The pro- cess to extract the target entities, the events and time-anchors can be described as follows:</p><p>(1) Target entity identification: The target en- tities are identified by the NED module. As they can be expressed in several forms, we use the redirect links contained in DBpedia to extend the search of the events involving those target enti- ties. For example, if the target entity is Toyota the system would also include events involving the entities Toyota Motor Company or Toyota Motor Corp. In addition, as the NED does not always provide a link to DBpedia, we also consider the matching of the wordform of the head of the argu- ment with the head of the target entity.</p><p>(2) Event selection: We use the output of the SRL module to extract the events that occur in a document. Given a target entity, we combine the output of the NER, NED, CR and SRL to obtain those events that have the target entity as filler of their ARG0 or ARG1. We also set some con- straints to select certain events according to the specification of the SemEval task. That is, we only return those events that are not negated and are not accompanied by modal verbs except will.</p><p>(3) Time-anchoring: We extract the time- anchors from the output of the TRE and SRL. From the TRE, we extract as time-anchors those relations between events and time-expressions identified as SIMULTANEOUS. From the SRL, we extract as time-anchors those ARG-TMP re- lated to time expressions. In both cases we use the time-expression returned by the TEI module. The tests performed on the trial data show that the best choice for time-anchoring is combining both op- tions. For each time anchor we normalize the time expression using the output of the TEN module.</p><p>The TimeLine extraction process described fol- lowing this approach builds TimeLines for events with explicit time-anchors. We call this system BTE and it can be seen as a baseline since we be- lieve that the temporal analysis should be carried out at document level. Section 5 presents our strat- egy for improving the time-anchoring carried out by our baseline system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Document level time-anchoring</head><p>The explicit time anchors provided by the NLP tools presented in Section 4.1 do not cover the full set of events involving a particular entity. That is, most of the events do not have an explicit time an- chor and therefore are not captured as part of the TimeLine of that entity. Thus, we need to recover the time-anchors that appear implicitly in the text. In this preliminary work, we propose a simple strategy that tries to capture implicit time-anchors while maintaining the coherence of the temporal information in the document. As said in Section 2, this strategy follows previous works on Implicit Semantic Role Labelling.</p><p>The rationale behind the algorithm 1 is that by default the events of an entity that appear in a doc- ument tend to occur at the same time as previous events involving the same entity, except stated ex- plicitly. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> all the events involving Steve Jobs, like gave and announced, are anchored to the same time-expression Mon- day although this only happens explicitly for the first event gave. The example also shows how for other events that occur in different times the time- anchor is also mentioned explicitly, like for those events that involve the entities Tiger and Mac OS X Leopard.</p><p>Algorithm 1 starts from the annotation obtained by the tools described in Section 4.1. For a par- ticular entity a list of events (eventList) is cre- ated sorted by its occurrence in the text. Then, for each event in this list the system checks if that event has already a time-anchor (eAnchor). If this is the case, the time-anchor is included in the list of default time-anchors (def aultAnchor) for the following events of the entity with the same verb tense (eT ense). If the event does not have an explicit time-anchor but the system has found a time-anchor for a previous event belonging to the same tense (def aultAnchor[eT ense]), this time-anchor is also assigned to the current event (eAnchor). If none of the previous conditions sat- isfy, the algorithm anchors the event to the Docu- ment Creation Time (DCT) and sets this time- expression as the default time-anchor for the fol- lowing events with the same tense.</p><p>Algorithm 1 Implicit Time-anchoring 1: eventList = sorted list of events of an entity 2: for event in eventList do end if 13: end for Note that the algorithm 1 strongly depends on the tense of the events. As this information can be only recovered from verbal predicates, this strat- egy cannot be applied to events described by nom- inal predicates. For these cases just explicit time- anchors are taken into account.</p><p>The TimeLine is built ordering the events ac- cording to the time-anchors obtained both explic- itly and implicitly. We call this system DLT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>We have evaluated our two TimeLine extractors on the main track of the SemEval 2015 task 4. Two systems participated in this track, WHUNLP and SPINOZAVU, with three runs in total. Their per- formances in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F1-score (F1) are presented in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. We also present in italics additional results of both systems. On the one hand, the results of a cor- rected run of the WHUNLP system provided by the SemEval organizers. On the other hand, the results of an out of the competition version of the SPINOZAVU team explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Caselli et al., 2015)</ref>. The best run is obtained by the corrected version of WHUNLP 1 with an F1 of 7.85%. The low figures obtained show the intrinsic difficulty of the task, specially in terms of Recall.  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> also contains the results obtained by our systems. We present two different runs. On the one hand, we present the results obtained using just the explicit time-anchors provided by BTE. As it can be seen, the results obtained by this run are similar to those obtained by WHUNLP 1. On the other hand, the results of the implicit time-anchoring approach (DLT) outperforms by far our baseline and all previous systems applied to the task. To check that these results are not biased by the time-relation extractor we use in our pipeline (TimePro), we reproduce the perfor- mances of BTE and DLT using another system to obtain the time-relations. For this purpose we have used CAEVO by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chambers et al., 2014</ref>). The re- sults obtained in this case show that the improve- ment obtained by our proposal is quite similar, re- gardless of the time-relation extractor chosen. The figures in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> seem to prove our hy- pothesis. In order to obtain a full time-anchoring annotation, the temporal analysis must be carried out at a document level. The TimeLine extractor almost doubles the performance by just including a straightforward strategy as the one described in Section 5. As expected, <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows that this improvement is much more significant in terms of Recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and future-work</head><p>In this work we have shown that explicit tempo- ral relations are not enough to obtain a full time- anchor annotation of events. We have proved the need of a temporal analysis at document level. For that, we have proposed a simple strategy that acquires implicit relations and it obtains a more complete time-anchoring. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The approach has been evaluated on the TimeLine extraction task and the results show that the performance can be doubled when using implicit relations. As future work, we plan to explore in more detail this research line by applying more sophisticated approaches in the temporal analysis at document level.</p><p>However, this is not the only research line that we want to go in depth. The errors that the tools of the pipeline are producing have a direct impact on the final result of our TimeLine extractors. In a preliminary analysis, we have noticed that this is specially critical when detecting the events given a target entity. Our pipeline does not detect all mentions of the target entities. That is why we are planning an in-depth error analysis of the pipeline in order to find the best strategy to improve on the linguist analyses and the TimeLine extraction.</p></div>
