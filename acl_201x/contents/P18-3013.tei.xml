				<p>Technological advancements in the World Wide Web and social networks in particular coupled with an increase in social media usage has led to a positive correlation between the exhibition of Suicidal ideation on websites such as Twitter and cases of suicide. This paper proposes a novel supervised approach for detecting suicidal ideation in content on Twitter. A set of features is proposed for training both linear and ensemble classifiers over a dataset of manually annotated tweets. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared against four baselines that utilize varying approaches to validate its utility. The results are finally summarized by reflecting on the effect of the inclusion of the proposed features one by one for suicidal ideation detection.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>According to World Health Organization, suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15- 29-year-olds across the world. In fact, close to 800,000 people die due of suicide each year. The number of people who attempt suicide is much higher. While an individual suicide is often a soli- tary act, it can often have a devastating impact on families ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cerel et al., 2008</ref>). Many suicide deaths are preventable and it is important to under- stand the ways in which individuals communicate their depression and thoughts for preventing such deaths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sher, 2004</ref>) Suicide prevention is mainly hinged on surveillance and monitoring of suicide attempts and self-harm tendencies.</p><p>The younger generation has started to turn to the Internet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chan and Fang, 2007)</ref> for seeking help, discussing depression and suicide-related in- formation and offering support. The availability of suicide-related material on the Internet plays an important role in the process of suicide ideation. Due to this increasing availability of content on social media websites (such as Twitter, Facebook and Reddit etc.), and blogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yates et al., 2017)</ref> there is an urgent need to identify affected indi- viduals and offer help. Suicidal ideation refers to thoughts of killing oneself or planning suicide, while suicidal behavior is often defined to include all possible acts of self-harm with the intention of causing death ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Costello et al., 2002</ref>). Although Twitter provides a unique opportunity to identify at-risk of individuals (Jashinsky et al., <ref type="bibr">2014</ref>) and a possible avenue for intervention at both the indi- vidual and social level, there exist no best practices for suicide prevention using social media.</p><p>While there is a developing body of literature on the topic of identifying patterns in the lan- guage used on social media that expresses suici- dal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Choudhury et al., 2016)</ref>, very few attempts have been made to employ feature ex- traction methods for binary classifiers that sepa- rate text related to suicide from text that clearly indicates the author exhibiting suicidal intent. A number of successful models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Yates et al., 2017)</ref> have been used for sentence level classification, however, ones that are successful for being able to learn to separate suicidal ideation from depres- sion as well as less worrying content such as re- porting of a suicide, memorial, campaigning, and support. etc, require a greater analysis to select more specific features and methods to build an accurate and robust model. The drastic impact that suicide has on surrounding community cou- pled with the lack of specific feature extraction and classification models for the identification of sui- cidal ideation on social media, so that action can be taken is the driving motivation for the work pre- sented in this paper.</p><p>Suicide prevention by suicide detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Zung, 1979</ref>) is one of the most effective ways to drasti-cally reduce suicidal rates. The major practical ap- plication of this work lies in it's easy adaptability to any social media forum <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Robinson et al., 2016)</ref>, wherein it can be used directly for analyzing text- based content posted by its users and flag it if the content is concerning.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. The creation of a labeled dataset for learn- ing the patterns in tweets exhibiting suicidal ideation by manual annotation.</p><p>2. Proposed a set of features to be fed into clas- sifiers to improve the performance.</p><p>3. Employed four binary classifiers with the proposed set of features and compared them against baselines utilizing varied approaches to validate the proposed methodology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Media communication can have both positive and negative influence on suicidal ideation. A sys- tematic review of all articles in PsycINFO, MED- LINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAH from 1991 to 2011 for language constructs relating to self- harm or suicide by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Daine et al. (2013)</ref> concluded that internet may be used as an intervention tool for vulnerable individuals under the age of 25. However, not all language constructs containing the word suicide indicate suicidal intent, specific semantic constructs may be used for predicting whether a sentence implies self-harm tendencies or not. A suicide note analysis method for automat- ing the identification of suicidal ideation was built using binary support vector machine classifiers by Desmet and Hoste (2013) using fine-grained emotion detection for classifier optimization with lexico-semantic features for optimization. In 2014, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al. (2014)</ref> used rule-based meth- ods with hand-crafted unsupervised classification for developing a real-time suicidal ideation detec- tion system deployed over Weibo 1 , a microblog- ging platform. This approach differs from the pro- posed approach in terms of both features and the reach of the social media platforms. Topic mod- eling in Chinese microblogs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huang et al., 2015)</ref> for suicide ideation detection has also proven to be efficient, however for a limited subset with a fairly different set of features.</p><p>Studies corresponding to rise in suicidal ideation associated with specific temporal events ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kumar et al., 2015</ref>) have also been performed, but do not specifically focus on building a robust system that simply analyzes content coupled with no other factors. Related literature also focuses on building systems that analyze tweets of users who have committed suicide , that may not specifically hint at suicidal ideation, as opposed to the proposed problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection</head><p>Traditionally, it has been difficult extracting data related to suicidal ideation or mental illnesses due to social stigma but now, an increasing number of people are turning to the Internet to vent their frus- tration, seek help and discuss mental health issues ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Milne et al., 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sueki et al., 2014</ref>). To main- tain the privacy of the individuals in the dataset, we do not present direct quotes from any data, nor any identifying information.</p><p>Anonymised data was collected from mi- croblogging website Twitter -specifically, content containing self-classified suicidal ideation (i.e. text posts tagged with the word 'suicide) over the period of December 3, 2017 to January 31, 2018. The Twitter REST API 2 was used for collection of tweets containing any of the following English words or phrases that are consistent with the ver- nacular of suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(O'Dea et al., 2015):</ref> suicidal; suicide; kill myself; my suicide note; my suicide letter; end my life; never wake up; can't go on; not worth living; ready to jump; sleep forever; want to die; be dead; better off without me; better off dead; suicide plan; suicide pact; tired of living; don't want to be here; die alone; go to sleep forever; wanna die; wanna suicide; com- mit suicide; die now; slit my wrist; cut my wrist; slash my wrist; do not want to be here; want it to be over; want to be dead; nothing to live for; ready to die; not worth living; why should I con- tinue living; take my own life; thoughts of suicide; to take my own life; suicide ideation; depressed; I wish I were dead; kill me now</p><p>The texts were collected without knowing the sentiment. For example, when collecting tweets on hashtag #suicide, it is not known initially whether:</p><p>• the tweet is posted for suicide awareness and prevention;</p><p>• the person is talking about suicidal ideation and/or ways to kill himself;</p><p>• the tweet reports a third persons suicide eg: news report;</p><p>• the tweet uses suicide as a figure of speech eg: career suicide</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data Annotation</head><p>Then, text posts equaling 5213 in all were col- lected which were subsequently human annotated.</p><p>The Human annotators consisted of both univer- sity students fairly active on social media, and aware of aspects of cognitive psychology as well as university faculty in the domain of Psychol- ogy and Machine Learning. Human annotators were asked to indicate if the text implied suici- dal ideation using binary criteria by answering the question Does this text imply self-harm tendencies or suicidal intent?. Each post was scrutinized and analyzed by three independent annotators (H 1 , H 2 and H 3 ), due to the subjectivity of text annotation, wherein ambiguous posts were set to the default level, Suicidal intent absent. Posts were exam- ined individually and annotated according to the following classification system:</p><p>1. Suicidal intent present:</p><p>• Text conveys a serious display of suici- dal ideation; e.g., I want to die or I want to kill myself or I wish my last suicide attempt was successful; • Care was taken to classify only those posts as suicidal where suicide risk is not conditional unless some event is a clear risk factor eg: depression, bully- ing, substance use; • Posts where suicide plan and/or previ- ous attempts are discussed; e.g., "The fact that I tried to kill myself and it didn't work makes me more depressed." • Tone of text is sombre and not flippant, eg: This makes me want to kill myself, lol, "This day is horrible, I want to kill myself hahaha" are not included in this category. 2. Suicidal intent absent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 1 H 2 H 3 H 1 − 0.61 0.48 H 2 0.61 − 0.51 H 3 0.48 0.51 −</formula><p>• The default category for all posts.</p><p>• Posts emphasizing on suicide related news or information; e.g., Two female suicide bombers hit crowded market in Maiduguri.</p><p>• Posts such as Suicide squad sounds like a good option; no reasonable evidence to suggest that the risk of suicide is present; includes posts containing song lyrics, etc, were marked within this cat- egory.</p><p>• Posts pertaining to condolence and sui- cide awareness; e.g., "5 suicide preven- tion helplines in India you need to know about", Politician accused of driving his wife to suicide.</p><p>Annotators were instructed to select only one of the above categories and to select the default level in case of ambiguity. In all, 15.76% (822) of all tweets were annotated to be suicidal, which were then used to train and validate the classifiers pre- sented in the following sections. A satisfactory agreement between the annotators (e.g., 0.61 for H 1 and H 2 ) can be inferred from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Proposed Methodology</head><p>The overall methodology is divided into three phases. The initial phase consists of preprocessing the text within a tweet, the second phase involves feature extraction from preprocessed tweets for the training and testing of binary classifiers for the sui- cidal ideation identification, and the final phase actually classifies and identifies tweets exhibiting suicidal ideation. The details of these individual phases are presented below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Preprocessing</head><p>Preprocessing is achieved by applying a series of filters, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Xiang et al. (2012)</ref>, in the order given below to process the raw tweets.</p><p>1. Removal of non-English tweets using Ling- Pipe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldwin and Carpenter, 2003</ref>) with Hadoop.</p><p>2. Identification and elimination of user men- tions in tweet bodies having the format of @username, URLs as well as retweets in the format of RT.</p><p>3. Removal of all hashtags with length &gt; 10 due to a great volume of hashtags being concate- nated words, which tends to amplify the vo- cabulary size inadvertently.</p><p>4. Stopword removal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Feature Extraction</head><p>Tweets exhibiting suicidal ideation lack a semi- rigid pre-defined lexico-syntactic pattern. Hence, they warrant the use of hand engineering and ana- lyzing a set of features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang et al., 2016</ref>) in con- trast to sentence and word embeddings in a super- vised setting using Deep Learning Models such as Convolutional Neural Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kim, 2014</ref>) (CNN). The proposed methodology utilizes the following set of features for classification.</p><p>• Statistical Features. These encompass the number of tokens, and their length.</p><p>• LIWC Features. As an example, the accompanying tweet is associated with negative emotions and cog- nitive processes with a high authenticity and emotional tone. I'm holding a gun and de- ciding if I want to go through with suicide or not. I want to commit suicide really badly... Help?</p><p>• Part of Speech counts. POS counts for each label assigned by the Stanford Part-Of- Speech Tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) are used as a feature. POS Tags include nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, etc.</p><p>• TF-IDF. The Term Frequency-Inverse Docu- ment Frequency (TF-IDF) is used as a feature to reflect the importance of a particular word within the corpus and is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">tf idf (t) = f req(t) × ln N |{d ∈ D : t ∈ d}|</formula><p>where, t is the word feature, N is the number of tweets, and d is a document in the docu- ment set D.</p><p>• Topics Probability. The probability distribu- tion of each topic over its terms are used as a feature, which is based on the approach that the tweets are represented as random mixtures over latent topics. Latent Dirich- let Allocation (LDA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003)</ref> is a generative probabilistic model that is used to describe each such topic as a generative model which generates words of the vocabu- lary with certain probabilities, and forms the basis of evaluating Topics Probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Classification</head><p>Suicidal Ideation detection is formulated as a su- pervised binary classification problem. For ev- ery tweet t i ∈ D, the document set, a binary valued variable y i ∈ {0, 1} is introduced, where y i = 1 denotes that the tweet t i exhibits Suici- dal Ideation. To learn this, the classifiers must determine whether any sentence in t i possesses a certain structure or keywords that mark the exis- tence of any possible Suicidal thoughts. The fea- tures presented above are the used to train classi- fication models to identify tweets exhibiting Sui- cidal Ideation. Linear classifiers such as Logis- tic Regression as well as Ensemble Classifiers in- cluding Random Forest ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Liaw et al., 2002</ref>), Gradi- ent Boosting Decision Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Friedman, 2002</ref>) and XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) are employed for classification. Both XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees aim to boost the performance of a classi- fier in a stage-wise fashion by iteratively adding a new classifier to the ensemble to allow the op- timization of a differentiable loss function. The Random Forest classifier is one of the most pop- ular ensemble machine learning algorithm based on Bootstrap Aggregation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Quinlan et al., 1996)</ref> or bagging. It modifies the bagging procedure so that the learning algorithm is limited to a random sample of features of which to search, which has shown promise in text classification problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Baselines</head><p>Validation of the proposed methodology is done by comparison against Baseline models that act as a useful point for comparison. Comparison in terms of the evaluation metrics presented below are also done with other recent models for Suicidal Ideation classification as follows:</p><p>Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models are more robust to noise in comparison to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liu et al., 2016)</ref>, and better able to capture long-term dependencies in a sequence, due to their ability to learn how to forget past observations. The LSTM model uses h = 128 memory units, with a dropout probabil- ity of 0. <ref type="bibr">2, and ReLU (Nair and Hinton, 2010</ref>) was used for activation. For training, the Adam Op- timizer was used to minimize log loss. A batch size of 64 was chosen and trained for a total of 100 epochs. Pre-Trained word2vec word embed- dings that were trained on 100 billion words from Google News are employed as features for classi- fication. Support Vector Machines (Desmet and Hoste, 2013) (SVM) have been shown to work well with short informal text <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pak and Paroubek, 2010)</ref> and other promising results in the cognitive behavior domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(De Choudhury et al., 2013</ref>). The features described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Desmet and Hoste (2013)</ref> are used by the SVM for classification. Rule-based approaches focusing on maximizing the informa- tion gain aim to reduce the uncertainty of the class a particular tweet belongs to. A J48 decision tree (C4.5) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Quinlan et al., 1996</ref>) was used with the features above for classification. Lastly, a Negation Resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gkotsis et al., 2016</ref>) based approach that is relatively recent, that employs parse trees to build a set of basic rules that rely on minimum domain knowledge is used. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> presents the results for both baselines as well as the classifiers with the proposed method- ology in terms of four evaluation metrics: Accu- racy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score. The first four rows represent the results of the proposed fea- tures with both Linear and Ensemble classifiers as described in the Classification section above. The final four rows represent the baseline results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results and Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Analysis: Comparison with Baselines</head><p>The proposed features used in conjunction with the first four models described in the Classification section supersede the baseline models in terms of performance along most metrics. The LSTM model has the highest recall, owing to its abil- ity to capture long term dependencies, however its overall performance in terms of accuracy and F1 score is relatively less. Both SVM and Rule- based classification don't perform as well as the proposed methodology, owing to the lack of fea- tures used in these models that are not suitable for learning how to classify tweets with Suicidal Ideation. Both of these methods are more suit- able in a general domain, however, the features in the proposed methodology are more specific to the particular problem domain of Suicidal Ideation detection, particularly the LIWC features and Top- ics probability. Lastly, the Negation Resolution method performs poorly on the dataset, due to its inability to adapt to a vast and highly diverse form of suicidal ideation communication and its implicit rigidity. This in comparison to the pro- posed methodology, is unable to effectively learn and extract the essential features from input text, and thus does not perform as well.</p><p>In conclusion, the proposed methodology consist- ing of feature extraction coupled with ensemble and linear classifiers supersedes the baselines pre- sented from various domains in terms of perfor- mance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Classifiers with proposed features</head><p>The first four rows of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> represent the results in terms of the evaluation metrics for different classifiers, both Linear and Ensemble, using the proposed set of features. While the performance of the four classifiers is comparable, Random Forest classifiers perform the best. This is attributed to the ability of Random Forest classifiers that tackle error reduction by reducing variance rather than reducing bias. As has been seen with various text classification problems, Logistic Regression per- forms fairly well despite its simplicity, and has a greater accuracy and F1 score in comparison with both Boosting Algorithms. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows the variation in performance of the Random Forest classifier with the inclusion of  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Error Analysis</head><p>Some categories of errors that occur are:</p><p>1. Seemingly Suicidal tweets: Human annota- tors as well as our classifier could not iden- tify whether "I want to kill myself, lol. :(" was representative of suicidal ideation or a frivolous reference to suicide.</p><p>2. Pragmatic difficulty: The tweet "I lost my baby. Signing off.." was correctly identified by our human annotators as a tweet with sui- cidal intent present. This tweet contains an element of topic change with no explicit men- tion of suicidal ideation, but our classifier could not capture it.</p><p>3. Ambiguity: The tweet "Is it odd to know I'll commit suicide?" is a tweet that both human annotators as well as the proposed methodol- ogy couldn't classify due to it's ambiguity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>This paper proposes a model to analyze tweets, by developing a set of features to be fed into clas- sifiers for identification of Suicidal Ideation us- ing Machine Learning. When annotated by hu- mans, 15.76% of the total dataset of 5213 tweets was found to be suicidal. Both linear and ensem- ble classifiers were employed to validate the se- lection of features proposed for Suicidal Ideation detection. Comparisons with baseline models em- ploying various strategies such as Negation Res- olution, LSTMs, Rule-based methods were also performed. The major contribution of this work is the improved performance of the Random for- est classifier as compared to other classifiers as well as the baselines. This indicates the promise of the proposed set of features with a bagging based approach with minimal correlation show as com- pared to other classifiers. In the future, there is scope for larger amounts of data to be scraped from more social media websites as well as inves- tigate the performance withdeep learning models such as CNNs, LSTM-CNNs, etc.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Features extracted using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2001) capture people's social and psychological states by analyzing the text to generate labels.

the various features. The precision reduces by a 
small amount with the inclusion of Topics prob-
ability feature implying that a greater subset of 
tweets is classified as suicidal due to the LDA uni-
grams included via Topics probability features, but 
is finally boosted by the inclusion of the LIWC 
features. The POS counts also lead to a reduction 
in the recall, which is compensated with the sub-
sequent inclusion of Topics Probability and LIWC 
features. The drastic improvements are attributed 
to the TF-IDF, POS counts and LIWC features in 
terms of most evaluation metrics. It is observed 
that the proposed set of features perform the best 
in conjunction with Random Forest classifiers, and 
the improvement in performance with the inclu-
sion of each feature validates the need for the ex-
traction of that feature.
