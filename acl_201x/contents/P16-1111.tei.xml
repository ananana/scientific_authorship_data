				<p>Computationally modeling the evolution of science by tracking how scientific topics rise and fall over time has important implications for research funding and public policy. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying topic growth and decline. We investigate the role of rhetorical framing: whether the rhetorical role or function that authors ascribe to topics (as methods, as goals, as results, etc.) relates to the historical trajectory of the topics. We train topic models and a rhetorical function classifier to map topic models onto their rhetorical roles in 2.4 million abstracts from the Web of Science from 1991-2010. We find that a topic&apos;s rhetorical function is highly predictive of its eventual growth or decline. For example , topics that are rhetorically described as results tend to be in decline, while topics that function as methods tend to be in early phases of growth.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One of the most compelling research questions in the computational analysis of scientific literature is whether the vast collections of scientific text hold important clues about the dynamics involved in the evolution of science; clues that may help predict the rise and fall of scientific ideas, meth- ods and even fields. Being able to predict sci- entific trends in advance could potentially revolu- tionize the way science is done, for instance, by enabling funding agencies to optimize allocation of resources towards promising research areas. Prior studies have often tracked scientific trends by applying topic modeling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003)</ref> based techniques to large corpora of scientific texts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei and Lafferty, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hall et al., 2008)</ref>. They capture sci- entific ideas, methods, and fields in terms of top- ics, modeled as distributions over collection of words. These approaches usually adopt a de- contextualized view of text and its usage, associ- ating topics to documents based solely on word occurrences, disregarding where or how the words were employed. In reality, however, scientific ab- stracts often follow narrative structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Crookes, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Latour, 1987)</ref> that signal the specific rhetor- ical roles that different topics play within the re- search ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The rhetorical role of a topic is the purpose or role it plays in the paper: as its background (scientific context), its objective/goal, the data employed, the design or method used (mode of inference), the results (what is found) or the conclusions (what they mean).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RATIONALE:</head><p>Neonatal ibotenic acid lesion of the ventral hippocampus was proposed as a relevant animal model of schizophrenia reflecting positive as well as negative symptoms of this disease. Before and after reaching maturity, specific alterations in the animals' social behaviour were found. OBJECTIVE: In this study, social behaviour of ventral hippocampal lesioned rats was analysed. For comparison, rats lesioned either in the ventral hippocampus or the dorsal hippocampus at the age of 8 weeks were tested. METHODS: Rats on day 7 of age were lesioned with ibotenic acid in the ventral hippocampus and social behaviour was tested at the age of 13 weeks. For comparison, adult 8-week-old rats were lesioned either in the ventral or the dorsal hippocampus. Their social behaviour was tested at the age of 18 weeks. RESULTS: It was found that neonatal lesion resulted in significantly decreased time spent in social interaction and an enhanced level of aggressive behaviour. This shift is not due to anxiety because we could not find differences between control rats and lesioned rats in the elevated plus-maze. Lesion in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus, respectively, in 8-week-old rats did not affect social behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that ibotenic acid-induced hippocampal damage per se is not related to the shift in social behaviour. We favour the hypothesis that these changes are due to lesion-induced impairments in neurodevelopmental processes at an early stage of ontogenesis. Rhetorical functions that topics take part in could hold important clues about the stage or de- velopment of an intellectual movement they stand to represent. For example, a topic that shifts over time from being employed as a method to being mentioned as background may signal an increase in its maturity and perhaps a corresponding de- crease in its popularity among new research.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to determine the rhetorical functions of topics associ- ated with an abstract. There is much work on an- notating and automatically parsing the rhetorical functions or narrative structure of scientific writ- ing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Teufel, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chung, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gupta and Manning, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">de Waard and Maat, 2012</ref>). We derive insights from this prior work, but since we desire to apply our analysis to a broad range of domains, we build our narrative structure model based on over 83,000 self-labeled abstracts ex- tracted from a variety of domains in the Web of Science corpus. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows an example of an abstract in which the authors have labeled the different narrative sections explicitly and identi- fied the rhetorical functions. We use our narrative structure model to assign rhetorical function labels to scientific topics and show that these labels of- fer important clues indicating whether topics will eventually grow or decline.</p><p>Contributions: The three main contributions of our paper are: 1) we introduce the notion of the rhetorical scholarly functions of scientific topics, extending previous work which tended to focus on the rhetorical functions of individual sentences. We present an algorithm to assign rhetorical func- tion labels to a topic as used in an individual pa- per; 2) we derive a new narrative scheme for scien- tific abstracts from over 83,000 abstracts that are labeled with narrative structures by their authors themselves, and present a tagger trained on this data that can parse unseen abstracts with 87% ac- curacy; 3) we show that the rhetorical function dis- tribution of a topic reflects its temporal trajectory, and that it is predictive of whether the topic will eventually rise or fall in popularity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Our work builds upon a wealth of previous lit- erature in both topic modeling and scientific dis- course analysis, which we discuss in this section. We also discuss how our work relates to prior work on analyzing scientific trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Topic Modeling</head><p>Topic modeling has a long history of applications to scientific literature, including studies of tempo- ral scientific trends ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang and McCallum, 2006</ref>), article recommendation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wang and Blei, 2011)</ref>, and impact prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Yogatama et al., 2011</ref>). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hall et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson et al. (2012)</ref> show how tracking topic popularities over time can produce a 'computational history' of a particular scientific field (in their case ACL, where they tracked the rise of statistical NLP, among other dramatic changes).</p><p>Technical advancements in these areas usually correspond to modifications or extensions of the topic modeling (i.e., LDA) framework itself, such as by incorporating citation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nallapati et al., 2008)</ref> or co-authorship information ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mei et al., 2008</ref>) di- rectly into the topic model; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nallapati et al. (2011)</ref> employ such an extension to estimate the tempo- ral "lead" or "lag" of different scientific informa- tion outlets. We contribute to this line of work by showing how we can build off of the standard LDA framework-by overlaying rhetorical roles-and how this allows us to not only detect the growth and decline of scientific topics but also to predict these trends based upon the rhetorical roles being employed. Since our framework is structured as a pipeline ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3)</ref> and works with the output of a topic modeling system, it is compatible with the vast majority of these extended topic models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Scientific Discourse Analysis</head><p>Scientific discourse analysis is an active area of research with many different proposed schema of analysis -Argument Zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Teufel, 2000</ref>), Infor- mation Structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guo et al., 2010)</ref>, Core Scien- tific Concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liakata, 2010)</ref>, Research Aspects (Gupta and Manning, 2011), Discourse Segments (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Waard and Maat, 2012)</ref>, Relation Structures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tateisi et al., 2014)</ref>, and Rhetorical Roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chung, 2009)</ref> to name a few. Most studies in this area fo- cus on improving automatic discourse parsing of scientific text, while some works also focus on the linguistic patterns and psychological effects of sci- entific argumentation (e.g., de <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Waard and Maat, 2012)</ref>. A wide range of techniques have been used in prior work to parse scientific abstracts, from fully supervised techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chung, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guo et al., 2010</ref>) to semi-supervised ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guo et al., 2011c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guo et al., 2013</ref>) and unsupervised tech- niques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kiela et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Scientific discourse parsing has also been applied to other downstream tasks within the biomedical domain, such as information retrieval from randomized controlled trials in evidence based medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chung, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Verbeke et al., 2012)</ref>, cancer risk assessment ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Guo et al., 2011b</ref>), summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Teufel and Moens, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Contractor et al., 2012)</ref>, and question an- swering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guo et al., 2013)</ref>. Our work also falls in this category in the sense that our goal is to apply the rhetorical function parser to better understand the link between rhetoric and the historical trajec- tory of scientific ideas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Scientific Trends Analysis</head><p>There is also a large body of literature in biblio- metrics and scientometrics on tracking scientific trends using various citation patterns. Researchers have attempted to detect emerging research fronts using topological measures of citation networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Shibata et al., 2008</ref>) as well as co-citation clus- ters <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Small, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shibata et al., 2009)</ref>. Unlike this line of work, our focus is not on citation pat- terns, but on how scientific trends are reflected in the texts of scientific publications.</p><p>Prior studies have also analyzed text to detect scientific trends. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mane and Börner (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Guo et al. (2011a)</ref> use word burst detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kleinberg, 2003</ref>) to map new and emerging scientific fields, while Small (2011) examined sentiments expressed in the text surrounding citations, show- ing uncertainty in interdisciplinary citations con- trasted with utility in within-discipline citations. In contrast to this previous work, we analyze the rhetorical function of automatically extracted top- ics from abstract text, without access to the cita- tion context in full text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Corpus</head><p>We use the Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection, which contains scientific ab- stracts from over 8,500 of leading scientific and technical journals across 150 disciplines. We limit our study to the subset of abstracts from 1991 to 2010, which forms the majority of articles. This subset (denoted WOS hereafter) contains over 25 million articles from around 250 fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Rhetorical Functions of Scientific Topics</head><p>We use the term rhetorical function to identify the purpose or role a scientific topic plays within a re- search paper. This function qualifies the associa- tion between a topic and a paper. A topic could represent the general domain of the research or its main objective/goal. It could also correspond to the data used, the way the re- search is designed, or the methods used. A topic may serve one or more of these roles within the same paper. The same topic may also serve differ- ent roles in different papers. We are interested in finding the different rhetorical functions by which topics are associated with the papers in our cor- pus, as a tool for understanding the growth and decline of topics over time. Our focus is thus on the rhetorical functions that topics play across pa- pers, in order to understand the 'rhetorical struc- ture of science' <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Latour, 1987)</ref>, although these are cued by specific rhetorical structures in individual sentences of individual papers. (Our work on the function of topics thus differs somewhat from pre- vious research focusing on the rhetorical role of individual sentences or segments in the structure of the paper.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Topic C Objective</head><p>We follow a three-step process to assign rhetor- ical function labels to a large corpus of scientific abstracts. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> presents the pictorial repre- sentation of the procedure we follow -1) obtain topic probabilities for each abstract, 2) parse the narrative structure of the abstracts in order to ar- rive at segments of text with different discourse intentions, and 3) superimpose the topic assign- ments and the abstract parse to arrive at the rhetor- ical function labels that capture how the topics are associated with the work presented in the abstract. We describe each of these steps in detail below.</p><p>a. Topic modeling: The core of our approach relies on the popular latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei et al., 2003)</ref> algorithm. It probabilis- tically assigns both words and abstracts to differ- ent topics, in an unsupervised manner. Let A = {a 1 , a 2 , ...a |A| } be the set of abstracts within the field we are studying, and let T = {t 1 , t 2 , ...t |T | } be the set of different topics in the field. A topic model trained on A assigns θ a,t , the probability of topic t occurring in abstract a for all a ∈ A and t ∈ T . The topic model also provides the φ t,w , the probability of word w occurring in topic t.</p><p>b. Abstract parsing: An abstract parser di- vides the abstract text into a sequence of dis- course segments, with each segment assigned a specific label denoting its rhetorical purpose. Let S(a) = (s 1 , s 2 , ...s |S(a)| ) be the sequence of seg- ments identified by the abstract parser, and let L denote the set of labels in the abstract parsing framework. The abstract parser assigns a label l(s i ) ∈ L, for each s i ∈ S(a).</p><p>c. Rhetorical Function Labeling: We tease apart the abstract-level topic distribution θ a,t as- signed by the topic model (step a) along the seg- ments found by the abstract parser (step b), and find the topic weights on each label θ l,t (a) by cal- culating topic weights for segments that are as- signed label l, i.e., {s i ∈ S(a) : l(s i ) = l}. We calculate the topic weights for each segment by ag- gregating the topic weights on each word derived from φ t,w inferred by the topic model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">θ l,t (a) ∝ w i ∈s i :l(s i )=l φ t,w<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We first describe the abstract parsing system (step b) we built for this purpose in Section 5, be- fore discussing the execution details of each of the above three steps in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Abstract Parsing</head><p>Datasets with manual annotations for discourse structure of abstracts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gupta and Manning, 2011</ref>) are few, small, and limited to specific domains. It is not clear how accurate an abstract parser trained on these datasets will per- form on other domains. Since we want to obtain the structure of abstracts in a broad range of do- mains over different time-periods, a parser trained on small datasets in specific domains may not be adequate for our purposes. Hence, we exploit the large number of abstracts in the WOS corpus in order to gather a dataset of self-labeled abstracts from a wide range of domains, over a period of two decades. By self-labeled abstracts, we refer to the abstracts where the authors have identified the discourse segments using explicit section labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Extracting Self-labeled Abstracts</head><p>In the first step, we extract all the patterns from the WOS corpus that could potentially be a segment label. For this, we look for a pattern that is com- monly used by authors to label abstract segments -a capitalized phrase of one or more words oc- curring at the beginning of the abstract or preceded by a period, and followed by a ":". We obtained 455,972 matches for the above pattern, corre- sponding to 2,074 unique labels, majority of which were valid discourse segment labels. These in- clude variations of the same labels (e.g., "OBJEC- TIVE" and "AIM", "CONCLUSION" and "CON- CLUSIONS" etc.) and typos (e.g., "RESLUTS"). There were also instances where two common la- bels were combined (e.g., "DATA AND METH- ODS"). The extracted matches also contained a long tail of false positives (e.g., "BMI").</p><p>One of the challenges in using the set of ab- stracts we obtained above is that they do not follow a common labeling scheme. Hence, we manually analyzed the top 100 unique labels (which corre- sponds to labels with more than ∼50 instances) and mapped them into a unified labeling scheme, grouping together labels with similar intentions. This resulted in a typology of seven labels:</p><p>• • CONCLUSION: What was inferred We use this mapping to obtain abstracts that are self-labeled. We exclude the abstracts that had combined labels, since they may add noise to the training data. We also exclude abstracts that contained only false positive matches. This pre- processing resulted in a dataset of 83,559 ab- stracts. We refer to this dataset as SL, hereafter. We divide the SL dataset into Train/Dev/Test sub- sets for our experiments <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Statistics of self-labeled abstracts</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Automatic tagging of abstracts</head><p>We use the SL dataset to build a supervised learn- ing system that can predict the abstract structure in unseen documents. We perform the prediction at the sentence level. We used the CRF algorithm to train the model, as it has been proven success- ful in similar tasks in prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hirohata et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Merity et al., 2009</ref>). In our preliminary ex- periments, we also tried using SVM, but CRF was faster and outperformed SVM by 4-5% points con- sistently. We use the following features: 1. Location: location of the sentence from the beginning or end of the abstract 2. Word ngrams: unigrams and bigrams of word lemmas 3. Part-of-speech ngrams: unigrams and bi- grams of part-of-speech tags 4. Verb lemmas and part-of-speeches: lemmas of verbs, and their part-of-speech tags in or- der to identify the tense of verb usage 5. Verb classes: we looked up each verb in the VerbNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kipper-Schuler, 2005</ref>) index and added the VerbNet class to the feature set if the verb maps to a unique verb class. 6. Concreteness rating: we used the max, min, and mean concreteness ratings of words based on ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brysbaert et al., 2014</ref>). Most of these features are commonly used in sim- ilar tasks, while the concreteness features are new (and significantly improved performance). We do not use parse features, however, since our pipeline emphasizes computational efficiency, and parse features showed minimal utility relative to their computational cost in prior work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guo et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate the performance of our learned model in terms of overall accuracy as well as per- class precision, recall and F-measure of predicting the segment labels at the sentence level. We per- formed experiments on the Dev set to choose the best feature configuration (e.g., tuning for word and part-of-speech ngram length). Each feature set described in the previous paragraph were con-   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the results obtained on testing the final classifier system on the Test subset of SL. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We obtain an overall high accuracy of 86.6% at the sentence level. While RESULT and CON- CLUSION obtained F-measures above 90%, OB- JECTIVE and METHOD reported reasonable F- measures above 80%. DESIGN obtained the low- est precision, recall and F-measure. Overall, the performance we obtain is in the range of other re- ported results in similar tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guo et al., 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Analysis Setup</head><p>In the rest of this paper, we apply the rhetor- ical function labeling system described in Sec- tion 4 to analyze the growth and decline of sci- entific topics. We chose four diverse fields from the WOS corpus with large numbers of abstracts for our analysis, which are: Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology (BIO): 850,394 abstracts, Ap- plied Physics (PHY): 558,934 abstracts, Physical Chemistry (CHM): 533,871 abstracts, and Neuro- sciences (NEU): 477,197 abstracts. We apply the steps (a), (b), and (c) of rhetorical function label- ing as described in Section 4 to these fields as fol- lows:</p><p>Topic Modeling: We use the LightLDA imple- mentation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yuan et al., 2015)</ref> of LDA. It employs a highly efficient and parallelized Metropolis- Hastings sampler that allows us to scale our ap-proach to massive datasets (e.g., millions of ab- stracts in our case). For all our experiments, we ran the algorithm for 1000 iterations, as this was sufficient for convergence. We use 500 topics for all four fields, but otherwise use the default hyper- parameter settings from the LightLDA package. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Abstract Parsing We applied the 7-label ab- stract parsing system described in Section 5 on all abstracts in each of the four disciplines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rhetorical Function Labeling</head><p>Once the steps (a) and (b) are completed, we applied the rhetor- ical function labeling step (c) from Section 4 in order to obtain topic weights for each segment. In addition, we calculate a rhetorical function label distribution (referred to as label distribution here- after) for each topic associated with an abstract.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Dissecting Topic Trajectories</head><p>In this section, we investigate whether the label distribution of the topics (i.e., across the rhetori- cal function labels) sheds light on the kind of tra- jectories they follow; in particular, whether it can predict the up-trend vs. down-trend of topics. We formalize the problem as follows: given two sets of topics clustered based on their historical trajec- tories, do the label-distribution based features of a topic have predictive power to classify the topic to be in either set?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Tracking topic popularities</head><p>For each field, we first calculated the number of articles in which each topic occurred in at least one of the rhetorical functions for each year in the 20-year period 1991-2010. Since the fields them- selves grow over the years, we divide this number by the number of articles within that field to obtain the popularity of each topic in any year:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">popularity(t, y) = DocsW ithT opic(t)/|A y |,</formula><p>where A y denotes the subset of articles in year y.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Detecting growing vs. declining topics</head><p>We are interested in the set of topics in each field that are either growing or declining. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows example popularity trends for two such top- ics in neuroscience: stem cell research, which sees Stem cell research ("cell", "stem", "neural")</p><p>Opioid drug research ("morphine", "effect", "opioid") <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Example topic popularity curves from 1991 till 2010. Stem cell research (green) sees an increase in popularity over this time period, while Opioid research (blue) declines in popularity.</p><p>a dramatic increase in popularity from 1991-2010, and opioid 3 drug research, which declines in pop- ularity during the same time-period. Of course, topics do not always follow trajec- tories of pure growth or decline. A topic may have risen and subsequently fallen in popularity over the period of 20 years, or may stay more or less the same throughout ( ). Hence, categorizing topics to be grow- ing or declining solely based on the popularity at the beginning and end of the time period is problematic. We circumvent this issue and avoid manually-defined thresholds by discovering topi- cal growth/decline curves in an unsupervised fash- ion. We use the K-Spectral Centroid (K-SC) algo- rithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yang and Leskovec, 2011)</ref>, which groups different time-series into clusters, such that simi- lar shapes get assigned to the same cluster, irre- spective of scaling and translation (unlike other popular time series clustering algorithms such as Dynamic Time Warping). We run the clustering algorithm using K = 3, and choose the cluster with the upward trending centroid to be the set of growing topics and the cluster with the downward trending centroid to be the set of declining topics. 4 <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows example centroids from Physical Chemistry, which clearly exhibit decreasing, in- creasing, and non-changing trends. </p><note type="other">0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 popularity Clusterr11(##==127) 1991 2000 2010 year Clusterr22(##==44)</note></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Characterizing topic growth vs. decline</head><p>We not only seek to detect growing vs. declin- ing topics; our goal is to characterize these tra- jectories based upon the rhetorical functions that the topics are fulfilling during different points of their life-cycles. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows how the rhetor- ical function label distributions of the opioid and stem cell research topics shift from 1991 to 2010. The opioid research topic, which declines in pop- ularity during this time-period, is frequently dis- cussed in the RESULT and BACKGROUND roles during the early years. In contrast, the stem cell research topic, which is dramatically increasing in popularity, only begins to be discussed frequently in these roles towards the end of the time-period. Intuitively, these shifts make sense: topics become results-oriented and mentioned as background as they reach their peak; this peak is seen at the beginning of the time-period for opioid research, while stem cell research appears to be increas- ing towards a peak by the end of our data (i.e., 2010). These observations indicate that the rhetor- ical functions which a topic is fulfilling may be indicative of its current growth vs. decline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Experiments</head><p>We perform two sets of experiments to quantify the qualitative insights noted above, i.e. that a topic's rhetorical function distribution is indica- tive of its eventual growth vs. decline. First, we show that a topic's rhetorical function distribution over the entire time-period can be used to classify the topic as either growing or declining. Next, we show that using only the first five years of data, we can predict whether a topic will eventually grow or decline. We use two sets of features:</p><p>• label-distribution-percents (LD-%): seven features corresponding to the percentage of topics across the seven rhetorical function la- bels (e.g., % of time the topic is a METHOD)  • label-distribution-changes (LD-∆): seven features that aggregate the mean change in this percentage over the years (e.g., is the % of being METHOD going up/down?). These features are fed into a standard L2- regularized logistic regression classifier (with reg- ularization parameter C = 10), which predicts whether a topic belongs to the growing or declin- ing cluster. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We use random prediction and major- ity prediction as two uninformed baselines.  For the task of classifying a topic as either grow- ing or declining, we compute the LD-% and LD- ∆ features separately over the first and last five years of the data. This allows the model to ana- lyze how the rhetorical functions are differentially expressed at the start vs. the end of the period un- der consideration. We also add a feature label- distribution-ratio (LD-R), which is the ratio of the end to beginning LD-% values, so that the model has access to relative increases/decreases in the label distributions over the entire time-period. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Similar performance was obtained with a linear SVM <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows the performance of our model on this task. As expected a topic's label distribution over its entire life-time is very informative with re- spect to classifying the topic as growing or declin- ing. We achieve a significant improvement over the baselines on the full dataset (32.3% relative improvement over majority prediction), and this trend holds across each field separately. The ratio feature proved to be extremely predictive in this task, i.e. relative increases/decreases in a topic be- ing used in different functional roles are very pre- dictive of the type of its trajectory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification task</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prediction task</head><p>We now turn to the more difficult task of predict- ing whether a topic will grow or decline, given ac- cess only to the first five years of its label distribu- tion. The setup here is identical to the classifica- tion task, except that we now have access only to the LD-∆ and LD-% features aggregated over the first five years of data.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> shows the performance of our model on this task. (The baseline performances are the same as in the classification task). These results show that we can accurately predict whether a topic will grow or decline using only a small amount of data.   <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Logistic Regression feature weights for the prediction task on the full (ALL) dataset.</p><p>Moreover, we see that both percentage and delta features are necessary for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Analysis</head><p>The feature weights of our learned linear model also provide insights into the dynamics of scien- tific trends. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> contains the learned feature weights for the prediction task. Overall, these weights reinforce the conclusions drawn from the case study in Section 7.3. The strongest feature is the LD-% feature for the RESULT rhetorical func- tion, which is highly negative. This indicates that topics that are currently being discussed as a re- sult are likely at the peak of their popularity, and are thus likely to decrease in the future. Interest- ingly, the weights on the LD-% features for the methodological rhetorical functions (METHODS, DATA, and DESIGN) are all significantly posi- tive. This suggests that topics occupying these functions may have reached a level of maturity where they are active areas of research and are be- ing consumed by a large number of researchers, but that they have not yet peaked in their pop- ularity. Finally, we see that the weights for the BACKGROUND and CONCLUSION roles have opposite trends: growing topics are more often mentioned as conclusions whereas dying topics, i.e. topics at the peak of their life-cycles, tend to be mentioned in background, or contextualizing, statements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We introduce a novel framework for assigning rhetorical functions to associations between scien- tific topics and papers, and we show how these rhetorical functions are predictive of a topic's growth vs. decline. Our analysis reveals important regularities with respect to how a topic's usage evolves over its life- cycle. We find that topics that are currently dis- cussed as results tend to be in decline, whereas topics that are playing a methodological role tend to be in the early phases of growth. In some ways these results are counter-intuitive; for example, one might expect topics that are being discussed as results to be the focus of current cutting edge research, and that methodological topics might be more mundane and lacking in novelty. Instead our results suggest that results-oriented topics are at the peak of their life-cycle, while methodological topics still have room to grow. This result has im- portant implications for research funding and pub- lic policy: the most promising topics-in terms of potential for future growth-are not those that are currently generating the most results, but are in- stead those that are active areas of methodological inquiry.</p><p>Our analysis does suffer from some limita- tions. Examining only 20 years of scientific progress prevents us from analyzing drastic scien- tific changes, e.g. paradigm shifts, that are only obvious over longer time-scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kuhn, 2012)</ref>. Access to longer time-spans-along with varying data sources such as grants and patents-would also allow us to more completely model the trajec- tory of a topic as it moves from being active area of research to potentially impacting commercial in- dustries and economic development. Nonetheless, we hope this work offers another step towards us- ing computational tools to better understand the 'rhetorical structure of science' <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Latour, 1987)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example abstract snippet.
