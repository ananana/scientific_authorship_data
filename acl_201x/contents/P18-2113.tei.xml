				<p>Text simplification (TS) is a monolingual text-to-text transformation task where an original (complex) text is transformed into a target (simpler) text. Most recent work is based on sequence-to-sequence neural models similar to those used for machine translation (MT). Different from MT, TS data comprises more elaborate transformations , such as sentence splitting. It can also contain multiple simplifications of the same original text targeting different audiences , such as school grade levels. We explore these two features of TS to build models tailored for specific grade levels. Our approach uses a standard sequence-to-sequence architecture where the original sequence is annotated with information about the target audience and/or the (predicted) type of simplification operation. We show that it outperforms state-of-the-art TS approaches (up to 3 and 12 BLEU and SARI points, respectively), including when training data for the specific complex-simple combination of grade levels is not available, i.e. zero-shot learning.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Text simplification (TS) is the task of modifying an original text into a simpler version of it. One of the main parameters for defining a suitable simpli- fication is the target audience. Examples include elderly, children, cognitively impaired users, non- native speakers and low-literacy readers.</p><p>Traditionally, work on TS has been divided in lexical simplification (LS) and syntactic simplifi- cation (SS). LS <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Paetzold, 2016</ref>) deals with the identification and replacement of complex words or phrases. SS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Siddharthan, 2011</ref>) performs structural transformations such as changing a sen- tence from passive to active voice. However, most recent approaches learn transformations from cor- pora, addressing simplification at lexical and syn- tactic levels altogether. These include either learn- ing tree-based transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Woodsend and Lapata, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Paetzold and Specia, 2013</ref>) or using machine translation (MT)-based techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Coster and Kauchak, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wubben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Narayan and Gardent, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Nisioi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhang and Lapata, 2017)</ref>. This paper uses the latter type of technique, which treats TS as a monolingual MT task, where an original text is "translated" into its simplified version.</p><p>In order to build MT-based models, a parallel corpus of original texts with their simplified coun- terparts is needed. For English, two main such cor- pora are available: Wikipedia-Simple Wikipedia (W-SW) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>) and the Newsela Arti- cle Corpus. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The former is a collection of orig- inal Wikipedia articles and their simplified ver- sions created by volunteers. The latter consists of news articles professionally simplified for var- ious specific audiences following the US school grade system. To build simplification models, the pairs of articles in these corpora have been aligned at the level of smaller units using standard algo- rithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Coster and Kauchak, 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Paetzold and Specia, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">ˇ Stajner et al., 2017)</ref>. Based on the number of sentences involved in these alignments, one can categorise alignments into four types of coarse-grained simplification operations:</p><p>• Identical: an original sentence is aligned to itself, i.e. no simplification is performed.</p><p>• Elaboration: an original sentence is aligned to a single, rewritten simplified sentence.</p><p>• One-to-many: splitting -an original sentence is aligned to 2+ simplified sentences.</p><p>• Many-to-one: joining -2+ original sentences are aligned to a single simplified sentence.</p><p>We hereafter refer to the unit of simplification, i.e. one or more original or simplified sentences, as instances.</p><p>The Newsela corpus is seen as having higher quality than W-SW because its simplifications are created by professionals, following well defined guidelines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>. It is also larger which is preferable for training corpus-based mod- els. More interestingly, the Newsela corpus has a feature that has been ignored thus far: Each in- stance in the corpus was created for readers with a certain school grade level. Each original article has a label indicating its corresponding grade level (from 12 to 2), and may have various simplified versions, each for a different grade level. For ex- ample, a level 12 article may have simplified coun- terparts for levels 8 and 4. In other words, the cor- pus contains instances where the same input leads to different outputs. Disregarding this factor may lead to suboptimal models. To avoid this prob- lem, previous work (Alva- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Manchego et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhang and Lapata, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Scarton et al., 2018b</ref>) has used subsets of the corpus with only certain com- binations of complex-simplified article pairs, e.g. adjacent or non-adjacent pairs. This however re- duces the amount of data available for training.</p><p>We propose a way of making use of this infor- mation to build more informed TS models that are aware of different types of target audiences, while still making use of the full dataset for learning. In- spired by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Johnson et al. (2017)</ref> for MT, we add to each original instance an artificial to- ken that represents the target grade level of that in- stance in order to guide a sequence-to-sequence at- tentional encoder-decoder neural approach (Bah- danau et al., 2015) ( §2). In a similar vein, we also annotate the coarse-grained type of operation that should be performed to simplify the original instance, under the hypothesis that certain opera- tions are more often used to simplify into certain grade levels. Deciding on the operation is an easier problem than performing the actual operation. We rely on both gold and predicted operation types.</p><p>Experiments with models built with these ar- tificial tokens outperform state-of-the-art neural models for TS, with the best approach combining grade level and type of operation ( §3). Interest- ingly, such an approach also enables zero-shot TS, where a simplification for a grade level pair unseen at training time can still be generated during test- ing. We show that our zero-shot learning models perform virtually as well as our grade/operation- informed models ( §4). To the best of our knowl- edge, this is the first work to build TS models for specific target audiences and to explore zero-shot learning for this application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System architecture</head><p>Our approach follows that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Johnson et al. (2017)</ref>, a multilingual MT approach that adds an artificial token to encode the target language to the begin- ning of each source sentence in the parallel corpus. With this modified version of the corpus, a single encoder-decoder architecture is used to deal with different language pairs. Based on the tokens, the source sentences are encoded differently accord- ing to the target language they have been paired with in the corpus. Such an approach enables zero- shot MT, where a model is able to provide transla- tions for language pairs it has not seem at training time.</p><p>We apply three types of data manipulation, where artificial tokens are added to the beginning of original side of both training and test instances:</p><p>• to-grade: the token corresponds to the grade level of the target instance, • operation: the token is one of the four possi- ble coarse-grained operations that transforms the original into the simplified instance, • to-grade-operation: concatenation of the two above tokens. Different from the grade level, which can be available at test time simply by knowing the in- tended reader of the text, information about the operations to be performed, which we extracted from the parallel corpus, will not be available at test time. We use gold labels extracted from the parallel corpus for an oracle experiment but also use a classifier that predicts the operations for the test set based on those in the training data. We built a simple Naive Bayes classifier using the scikit-learn toolkit (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and nine features ( :</p><p>• number of tokens / punctuation / content words / clauses, • ratio of the number of verbs / nouns / adjec- tives / adverbs / connectives to the number of content words. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows examples of the tokens used when an original instance is marked to be simpli-to grade level 4 to grade level 2 to-grade &lt;4&gt; dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe.</p><p>&lt;2&gt; dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe. operation &lt;identical&gt; dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe.</p><p>&lt;elaboration&gt; dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe. to-grade-operation &lt;4-identical&gt; dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe.</p><p>&lt;2-elaboration&gt; dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe. reference dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe.</p><p>dusty handprints could be seen on the fence near Sasabe. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Examples of artificial tokens used.</p><p>fied to grade level 4 or grade level 2. Since the ref- erence for grade level 4 is a copy of the original, the operation token for this case is &lt;identical&gt;.</p><p>For level 2 the reference is a rewrite and, there- fore, the operation token is &lt;elaboration&gt;.</p><p>We use OpenNMT 2 as our encoder-decoder architecture. Both encoder and decoder have two LSTM layers, hidden states of size 500 and dropout = 0.3. Global attention combined with input-feeding is used, as describe in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Luong et al., 2015)</ref>. A model is trained for each dataset con- structed with different artificial tokens for 13 epochs. The best model is selected according to perplexity on the development set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the architecture of the neural network, in- cluding attention and input-feeding. In this exam- ple, &lt;token&gt; represents the artificial token added to the pre-processed data. We evaluate our models with BLEU <ref type="bibr">3 (Papineni et al., 2002</ref>) (a proxy for grammaticality assess- ment), SARI (Xu et al., 2016) 4 (a proxy for sim- plicity assessment) and Flesch Reading Ease 5 (a proxy for readability assessment). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al. (2016)</ref>, BLEU shows high correlation with human scores for grammaticality and mean- ing preservation, whilst SARI shows high cor- relation with human scores for simplicity. Al- though previous work have also relied on human judgements of grammaticality, meaning preserva- tion and simplicity, in our case such a type of eval- uation is infeasible: we would need to involve judges with specific grade levels or rely on pro- fessionals who are experts in grade level-specific simplification to make such assessments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Reader-specific TS models</head><p>Our version of the Newsela corpus has 550, 644 instance pairs (11M original tokens and 10M target tokens), which we randomly divided into training (440, 516 instances: 80%), development (55, 064 instances: 10%) and test (55, 064 in- stances: 10%) sets. Instances were aligned using the method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Paetzold and Specia (2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xu et al. (2015)</ref> report over 56K original sentences and approximately 305K sentences including the original ones and all simplification types. Our number of instance pairs is higher because we al- lowed alignments from original to all simplified versions and among simplified versions. An orig- inal article 0 may be aligned to up to four simpli- fied versions: 1, 2, 3 and 4. For each article, the alignments were extracted between 0-{1,2,3,4}, 1- {2,3,4}, 2-{3,4} and 3-4, where available. Our corpus is also larger than the ones used in (Alva- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Manchego et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Scarton et al., 2018b</ref>) and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zhang and Lapata, 2017)</ref>. While the former use only adjacent levels (e.g. 0-1, 1-2) and the latter only non-adjacent levels (e.g. 0-2, 1-4), we make use of the full dataset.</p><p>As baseline we trained a model using Open- NMT and the same hyperparameters as described in §2 on the entire Newsela corpus but without artificial tokens (s2s model). The state-of-the-art model is represented by NTS, which was also trained on the entire corpus using a similar Open- NMT architecture with the same hyperparameters but additional pre-trained word embeddings as de- scribed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Nisioi et al. (2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> the NTS system performs slightly worse than the baseline system accord- ing to BLEU and SARI. Although concatenating global and local embeddings has led to improve- ments for the W-SW corpus in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Nisioi et al., 2017</ref>), this does not seem to be the case for the Newsela corpus. Our models outperform both the baseline and NTS systems by a large margin. Examples of outputs from all systems can be found in the Sup- plementary Material.  The best model is the one built with the &lt;to- grade+operation&gt; token with gold operations an- notations (last row). The second best system uses the gold &lt;operation&gt; token only. There- fore, knowing the operation type to be performed for a given instance provides valuable informa- tion. Even though the models with predicted op- erations <ref type="bibr">('pred' in</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>) still outperform the baseline, they lag behind their counterparts built using gold operations. The main reason for that is the very simplistic classifier we used (average accuracy = 0.51, calculated using 10-fold cross- validation). In summary, s2s+to-grade is the best performing model in a real world scenario, given the low performance of 'pred' systems. A more in- formed classifier should lead to better results, but this left for future work; our goal was to show the potential of this information.</p><p>The improvements in SARI are substantial: 7 points over the baseline even with the predicted operations. However, SARI aims to measure simplicity in general (not for specific grade lev- els). Since human evaluation of the targeted sim- plification performed by our models is not fea- sible, we can only approximate the usefulness of our models by using readability metrics such <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Equivalent to their best performing "NTS- <ref type="bibr">w2v" version.</ref> as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. This met- ric maps a text into a US grade level, which is the same grading provided in the Newsela cor- pus and, therefore, relevant for our study. <ref type="table">Ta- ble 3</ref> shows the Flesch-Kincaid results for the test set divided into the appropriate grade levels considering the outputs of s2s, s2s+to-grade and s2s+to-grade+operation (gold) models. Simpli- fications generated by s2s+to-grade and s2s+to- grade+operation are scored consistently closer to the appropriate grade, which does not happen with s2s.</p><p>s2s +to-grade +to-grade+operation (gold)  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Flesch-Kincaid scores for instances of each grade level simplified using s2s, s2s+to-grade and s2s+to-grade+operation (gold) models.</p><p>The last row of <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the Mean Abso- lute Error (MAE) considering the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores for the system outputs as the hypothesis and the expected grade level as the gold scores. Our s2s+to-grade and s2s+to- grade+operation (gold) models show lower error scores than the baseline system, which supports our hypothesis that such models produce more ad- equate outputs for targeted grade levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Usefulness of the s2s+to-grade model</head><p>The main advantage of s2s+to-grade is that a user can inform their grade level and retrieve a person- alised simplification. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows an example with different simplifications for an out-of-domain instance from the SimPA corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Scarton et al., 2018a</ref>). The same instance was given as input to the s2s+to-grade model with different artificial tokens according to the grade level that we want to achieve. The s2s system (second row) repeats the original instance (first row). Conversely, our s2s+to-grade model is capable of distinguishing among different levels and produces personalised simplifications for each grade level.</p><p>original We want to reassure you that we take fire safety very seriously and we are doing everything we can to make sure our residents are safe. s2s</p><p>We want to reassure you that we take fire safety very seriously and we are doing everything we can to make sure our residents are safe.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Zero-shot TS models</head><p>To show that zero-shot TS is possible, we build models on training data without instances of a cer- tain grade level pair and test them on instances of that grade level pair. Consider the grade level pair &lt; g o , g t &gt;, where g o is the grade level of an original instance o, g t of a target instance t, and t is aligned to o. We test if our "s2s+to-grade" model can generalise for instances of &lt; ˆ g o , ˆ g t &gt; that have not been seen at training time.</p><p>Due to space restrictions, we only show results for three representative grade level pairs. These pairs have a large enough number of training and test instances and cover levels that are closer or further apart from each other. In addition, after removing them the training corpus still has enough instances of thê g t as target grade level. Instances of the target but not the original level (or of the target language in MT) must exist for zero-shot to be possible. The distributions of the selected grade level pairs is shown in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref>: Zero-shot data distribution.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, the s2s and s2s+to-grade models are the same as in Section 3, i.e. trained with the entire dataset without artificial tokens (s2s) or with arti- ficial tokens (s2s+to-grade). The zero-shot mod- els (s2s+to-grade+zs) are trained with &lt;to-grade&gt; data, but after removing instances of the grade level pair &lt; ˆ g o , ˆ g t &gt; under investigation, i.e. on a smaller dataset. For &lt; 12, 7 &gt; and &lt; 12, 4 &gt;, the zero-shot models outperform the baseline ac- cording to all metrics. In terms of SARI, for &lt; 12, 7 &gt; the zero-shot model is only marginally worse than the s2s+to-grade model. Conversely, s2s+to-grade+zs outperforms s2s+to-grade for &lt; 12, 4 &gt;, which is an impressive result. Finally, for &lt; 6, 5 &gt; all three models perform similarly. This may be explained by the proximity ofˆgofˆ ofˆg o andˆgandˆ andˆg t , which means that instances must be considerably close to each other and therefore simplifications will be minor and have little impact in the scores.  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Results of zero-shot experiments for TS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented an approach for TS that bene- fits from corpora built for various target audiences and allows building better models than general- purpose ones. We have also shown that zero-shot learning is possible for TS, where instances of the original-target audience do not exist. As future work we intend to investigate (i) better classifiers to predict operation types and (ii) multi-task learn- ing as an alternative way of building a single TS model for various specific target audiences. We also plan to run experiments with the W-SW cor- pus and using an improved classifier to train mod- els with information on operations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Neural model architecture.</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="3,113.93,451.22,134.40,136.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
