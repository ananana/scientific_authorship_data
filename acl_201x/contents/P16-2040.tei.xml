				<p>Finding quality descriptions on the web, such as those found in Wikipedia articles , of newer companies can be difficult: search engines show many pages with varying relevance, while multi-document summarization algorithms find it difficult to distinguish between core facts and other information such as news stories. In this paper, we propose an entity-focused, hybrid generation approach to automatically produce descriptions of previously unseen companies, and show that it outperforms a strong summarization baseline.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As new companies form and grow, it is impor- tant for potential investors, procurement depart- ments, and business partners to have access to a 360-degree view describing them. The number of companies worldwide is very large and, for the vast majority, not much information is avail- able in sources like Wikipedia. Often, only fir- mographics data (e.g. industry classification, lo- cation, size, and so on) is available. This cre- ates a need for cognitive systems able to aggre- gate and filter the information available on the web and in news, databases, and other sources. Provid- ing good quality natural language descriptions of companies allows for easier access to the data, for example in the context of virtual agents or with text-to-speech applications.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an entity-focused sys- tem using a combination of targeted (knowledge base driven) and data-driven generation to create company descriptions in the style of Wikipedia de- scriptions. The system generates sentences from RDF triples, such as those found in DBPedia and Freebase, about a given company and combines these with sentences on the web that match learned expressions of relationships. We evaluate our hy- brid approach and compare it with a targeted-only approach and a data-driven-only approach, as well as a strong multi-document summarization base- line. Our results show that the hybrid approach performs significantly better than either approach alone as well as the baseline.</p><p>The targeted (TD) approach to company de- scription uses Wikipedia descriptions as a model for generation. It learns how to realize RDF re- lations that have the company as their subject: each relation contains a company/entity pair and it is these pairs that drive both content and expres- sion of the company description. For each com- pany/entity pair, the system finds all the ways in which similar company/entity pairs are expressed in other Wikipedia company descriptions, clus- tering together sentences that express the same company/entity relation pairs. It generates tem- plates for the sentences in each cluster, replacing the mentions of companies and entities with typed slots and generates a new description by insert- ing expressions for the given company and entity in the slots. All possible sentences are generated from the templates in the cluster, the resulting sen- tences are ranked and the best sentence for each relation selected to produce the final description. Thus, the TD approach is a top-down approach, driven to generate sentences expressing the rela- tions found in the company's RDF data using real- izations that are typically used on Wikipedia.</p><p>In contrast, the data-driven (DD) approach uses a semi-supervised method to select sentences from descriptions about the given company on the web. Like the TD approach, it also begins with a seed set of relations present in a few companies' DBPedia entries, represented as company/entity pairs, but instead of looking at the corresponding Wikipedia articles, it learns patterns that are typ-ically used to express the relations on the web. In the process, it uses bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agichtein and Gravano, 2000</ref>) to learn new ways of ex- pressing the relations corresponding to each com- pany/entity pair, alternating with learning new pairs that match the learned expression patterns. Since the bootstrapping process is driven only by company/entity pairs and lexical patterns, it has the potential to learn a wider variety of expressions for each pair and to learn new relations that may exist for each pair. Thus, this approach lets data for company descriptions on the web determine the possible relations and patterns for expressing those relations in a bottom-up fashion. It then uses the learned patterns to select matching sentences from the web about a target company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The TD approach falls into the generation pipeline paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Reiter and Dale, 1997)</ref>, with content selection determined by the relation in the com- pany's DBpedia entry while microplanning and realization are carried out through template gen- eration. While some generation systems, partic- ularly in early years, used sophisticated gram- mars for realization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Elhadad, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">White, 2014)</ref>, in recent years, template-based generation has shown a resurgence. In some cases, authors focus on doc- ument planning and sentences in the domain are stylized enough that templates suffice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Elhadad and Mckeown, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouayad-Agha et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gkatzia et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Biran and McKeown, 2015)</ref>. In other cases, learned models that align database records with text snippets and then abstract out specific fields to form templates have proven suc- cessful for the generation of various domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angeli et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kondadadi et al., 2013)</ref>. Others, like us, target atomic events (e.g., date of birth, occupation) for inclusion in biographies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Filatova and Prager, 2005</ref>) but the templates used in other work are manually encoded.</p><p>Sentence selection has also been used for ques- tion answering and query-focused summarization. Some approaches focus on selection of relevant sentences using probabilistic approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daumé III and Marcu, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Conroy et al., 2006</ref>), semi- supervised learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wang et al., 2011</ref>) and graph- based methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Erkan and Radev, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Otterbacher et al., 2005</ref>). Yet others use a mixture of targeted and data-driven methods for a pure sen- tence selection system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Weischedel et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Schiffman et al., 2001</ref>). In our approach, we target both relevance and variety of expression, driving content by se- lecting sentences that match company/entity pairs and inducing multiple patterns of expression. Sen- tence selection has also been used in prior work on generating Wikipedia overall articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sauper and Barzilay, 2009)</ref>. Their focus is more on learning domain-specific templates that control the topic structure of an overview, a much longer text than we generate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Targeted Generation</head><p>The TD system uses a development set of 100 S&amp;P500 companies along with their Wikipedia articles and DBPedia entries to form templates. For each RDF relation with the company as the subject, it identifies all sentences in the corre- sponding article containing the entities in the re- lation. The specific entities are then replaced with their relation to create a template. For example, "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen" is converted to "company was founded by founder," with conjoined entities collapsed into one slot. Many possible templates are created, some of which contain multiple relations (e.g., "company, located in location, was founded by founder"). In this way the system learns how Wikipedia articles express relations between the company and its key entities (founders, headquar- ters, products, etc).</p><p>At generation time, we fill the template slots with the corresponding information from the RDF entries of the target company. Conjunctions are inserted when slots are filled by multiple entities. Continuing with our example, we might now pro- duce the sentence "Palantir was founded by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Nathan Gettings" for target company Palan- tir. Preliminary results showed that this method was not adequate -the data for the target com- pany often lacked some of the entities needed to fill the templates. Without those entities the sen- tence could not be generated. As Wikipedia sen- tences tend to have multiple relations each (high information density), many sentences containing important, relevant facts were discarded due to phrases that mentioned lesser facts we did not have the data to replace. We therefore added a post- processing step to remove, if possible, any phrases from the sentence that could not be filled; other- wise, the sentence is discarded.</p><p>This process yields many potential sentences for each relation, of which we only want to choose the best. We cluster the newly generated sen- tences by relation and score each cluster. Sen- tences are scored according to how much informa- tion about the target company they contain (num- ber of replaced relations). Shorter sentences are also weighted more as they are less likely to con- tain extraneous information, and sentences with more post-processing are scored lower. The high- est scored sentence for each relation type is added to the description as those sentences are the most informative, relevant, and most likely to be gram- matically correct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data-Driven Generation</head><p>The DD method produces descriptions using sen- tences taken from the web. Like the TD approach, it aims to produce sentences realizing relations be- tween the input company and other entities. It uses a bootstrapping approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agichtein and Gravano, 2000</ref>) to learn patterns for expressing the relations. It starts with a seed set of company/entity pairs, representing a small subset of the desired rela- tions, but unlike previous approaches, can gener- ate additional relations as it goes.</p><p>Patterns are generated by reading text from the web and extracting those sentences which con- tain pairs in the seed set. The pair's entities are replaced with placeholder tags denoting the type of the entity, while the words around them form the pattern (the words between the tags are selected as well as words to the left and right of the tags). Each pattern thus has the form "LT1MT2R," where L, M, and R are re- spectively the words to the left of, between, and to the right of the entities. T1 is the type of the first entity, and T2 the type of the second. Like the TD algorithm, this is essentially a template based approach, but the templates in this case are not aligned to a relation between the entity and the company; only the type of entity (person, location, organization, etc) is captured by the tag.</p><p>New entity pairs are generated by matching the learned patterns against web text. A sentence is considered to match a pattern if it has the same entity types in the same order and its L, M, and R words fuzzy match the corresponding words in the pattern. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The entities are therefore assumed to be related since they are expressed in the same way as the seed pair. Unlike the TD approach, the ac- tual relationship between the entities is unknown (since the only data we use is the web text, not the structured RDF data); all we need to know here is that a relationship exists.</p><p>We alternate learning the patterns and generat- ing entity pairs over our development set of 100 companies. We then take all the learned patterns and find matching sentences in the Bing search re- sults for each company in the set of target compa- nies. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Sentences that match any of the patterns are selected and ranked by number of matches (more matches means greater probability of strong rela- tion) before being added to the description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pruning and Ordering</head><p>After selecting the sentences for the description, we perform a post-processing step that removes noise and redundancy. To address redundancy, we remove those sentences which were conveyed pre- viously in the description using exactly the same wording. Thus, sentences which are equal to or subsets of other sentences are removed. We also remove sentences that come from news stories; analysis of our results on the development set indi- cated that news stories rarely contain information that is relevant to a typical Wikipedia description. To do this we use regular expressions to capture common newswire patterns (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[CITY, STATE: sentence]</ref>). Finally, we remove incomplete sen- tences ending in ". . . ", which sometimes appear on websites which themselves contain summaries.</p><p>We order the selected sentences using a scoring method that rewards sentences based on how they refer to the company. Sentences that begin with the full company name get a starting score of 25, sentences that begin with a partial company name start with a score of 15, and sentences that do not contain the company name at all start at -15 (if they contain the company name in the middle of the sentece, they start at 0). Then, 10 points are added to the score for each keyword in the sen- tence (keywords were selected from the most pop- ulous DBPedia predicates where the subject is a company). This scoring algorithm was tuned on the development set. The final output is ordered in descending order of scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Hybrid system</head><p>In addition to the two approaches separately, we also generated hybrid output from a combination of the two. In this approach, we start with the DD output; if (after pruning) it has fewer than three sentences, we add the TD output and re-order.</p><p>The hybrid approach essentially supplements the large, more noisy web content of the DD out- put with the small, high-quality but less diverse TD output. For companies that are not consumer- facing or are relatively young, and thus have a rel- atively low web presence -our target population - this can significantly impact the description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>To evaluate our approach, we compare the three versions of our output -generated by the TD, DD, and hybrid approach -against multi-document summaries generated (from the same search re- sults used by our DD approach) by TextRank (Mi- halcea and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Tarau, 2004</ref>). For each one of the ap- proaches as well as the baseline, we generated de- scriptions for all companies that were part of the S&amp;P500 as of January 2016. We used our devel- opment set of 100 companies for tuning, and the evaluation results are based on the remaining 400.</p><p>We conducted two types of experiments. The first is an automated evaluation, where we use the METEOR score <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lavie and Agarwal, 2007</ref>) between the description generated by one of our approaches or by the baseline and the first sec- tion of the Wikipedia article for the company. In Wikipedia articles, the first section typically serves as an introduction or overview of the most important information about the company. ME- TEOR scores capture the content overlap between the generated description and the Wikipedia text. To avoid bias from different text sizes, we set the same size limit for all descriptions when compar- ing them. We experimented with three settings: 150 words, 500 words, and no size limit.</p><p>In addition, we conducted a crowd-sourced evaluation on the CrowdFlower platform. In this evaluation, we presented human annotators with two descriptions for the same company, one de- scribed by our approach and one by the baseline, in random order. The annotators were then asked to choose which of the two descriptions is a better overview of the company in question (they were 150 words 500 words no limit  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Second experiment results: % of compa- nies for which the approach was chosen as best by the human annotators, and average scores given provided a link to the company's Wikipedia page for reference) and give a score on a 1-5 scale to each description. For quality assurance, each pair of descriptions was processed by three annota- tors, and we only included in the results instances where all three agreed. Those constituted 44% of the instances. In this evaluation we only used the hybrid version, and we limited the length of both the baseline and our output to 150 words to reduce bias from a difference in lengths and keep the de- scriptions reasonably short for the annotators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>The results of the automated evaluation are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Our DD system achieves higher ME- TEOR scores than the TextRank baseline under all size variations, while TD by itself is worse in most cases. In all cases the combined approach achieves a better result than the DD system by itself.</p><p>The results of the human evaluation are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Here the advantage of our approach becomes much more visible: we clearly beat the baseline both in terms of how often the annotators chose our output to be better (almost 75% of the times) and in terms of the average score given to our descriptions (3.81 on a 1 − 5 point scale).</p><p>All results are statistically significant, but the difference in magnitude between the results of the two experiments are striking: we believe that while the TextRank summarizer extracts sentences which are topically relevant and thus achieve re- sults close to ours in terms of METEOR, the more structured entity-focused approach we present here is able to extract content that seems much more reasonable to humans as a general descrip- tion. One example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Right from the start, we see that our system out-performs TextRank. Our first sentence introduces the company and provides a critical piece of his- tory about it, while TextRank does not even im- mediately name it. The hybrid generation output has a more structured output, going from the ori- gins of the company via merger, to its board, and finally its products. TextRank's output, in compar- ison, focuses on the employee experience and only mentions products at the very end. Our system is much more suitable for a short description of the company for someone unfamilar with it.</p><p>TextRank: The company also emphasizes stretch assign- ments and on-the-job learning for development, while its for- mal training programs include a Masters in the Business of Activision(or "MBActivision") program that gives employ- ees a deep look at company operations and how its games are made, from idea to development to store shelves. How easy is it to talk with managers and get the information I need? Will managers listen to my input? At Activision Blizzard, 78 percent of employees say they often or almost always experi- ence a free and transparent exchange of ideas and information within the organization. Gaming is a part of day-to-day life at Activision Blizzard, and the company often organizes internal tournaments  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We described two approaches to generating com- pany descriptions as well as a hybrid approach. We showed that our output is overwhelmingly pre- ferred by human readers, and is more similar to Wikipedia introductions, than the output of a state- of-the-art summarization algorithm. These complementary methods each have their advantages and disadvantages: the TD approach ensures that typical expressions in Wikipedia com- pany descriptions -known to be about the fun- damental relations of a company -will occur in the generated output. However, since it modifies them, it risks generating ungrammatical sentences or sentences which contain information about an- other company. The latter can occur because the sentence is uniquely tied to the original. For in- stance, the following Wikipedia sentence fragment -"Microsoft is the world's largest software maker by revenue" -is a useful insight about the com- pany, but our system would not be able to correctly modify that to fit any other company.</p><p>In contrast, by selecting sentences from the web about the given company, the DD approach en- sures that the resulting description will be both grammatical and relevant. It also results in a wider variety of expressions and a greater number of sen- tences. However, it can include nonessential facts that appear in a variety of different web venues. It is not surprising, therefore, that the hybrid ap- proach performs better than either by itself.</p><p>While in this paper we focus on company de- scriptions, the system can be adapted to generate descriptions for other entities (e.g. Persons, Prod- ucts) by updating the seed datasets for both ap- proaches (to reflect the important facts for the de- sired descriptions) and retuning for best accuracy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Descriptions for Activision Blizzard</figDesc></figure>
