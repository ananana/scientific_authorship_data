				<p>We release the Simple Paraphrase Database, a subset of of the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) adapted for the task of text simplification. We train a supervised model to associate simplification scores with each phrase pair, producing rankings competitive with state-of-the-art lexical simplification models. Our new simplification database contains 4.5 million paraphrase rules, making it the largest available resource for lexical simplification.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Motivation</head><p>Language is complex, and the process of reading and understanding language is difficult for many groups of people. The goal of text simplification is to rewrite text in order to make it easier to un- derstand, for example, by children <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(De Belder and Moens, 2010)</ref>, language learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007)</ref>, people with disabilities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rello et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Evans et al., 2014)</ref>, and even by machines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Siddharthan et al., 2004</ref>). Automatic text simplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Napoles and Dredze, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wubben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xu et al., 2016</ref>) has the po- tential to dramatically increase access to informa- tion by making written documents available at all reading levels.</p><p>Full text simplification involves many steps, including grammatical restructuring and summa- rization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Feng, 2008)</ref>. One of the most basic subtasks is lexical simplification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Specia et al., 2012</ref>)-replacing complicated words and phrases with simpler paraphrases. While there is active re- search in the area of lexical simplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Coster and Kauchak, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Glavaš andŠtajnerandˇandŠtajner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Paetzold, 2015)</ref>, existing models have been by- and-large limited to single words. Often, how- medical practitioner → doctor legislative texts → laws hypertension → high blood pressure prevalent → very common significant quantity → a lot impact negatively → be bad <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: In lexical simplification, it is often necessary to re- place single words with phrases or phrases with single words. The above are examples of such lexical simplifications cap- tured by the Simple PPDB resource.</p><p>ever, it is preferable, or even necessary to para- phrase a single complex word with multiple sim- pler words, or to paraphrase multiple words with a single word. For example, it is difficult to imagine a simple, single-word paraphrase of hypertension, but the three-word phrase high blood pressure is a very good simplification <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Such phrasal simplifications are overlooked by current lexical simplification models, and thus are often unavail- able to the end-to-end text simplification systems that require them. Recent research in data-driven paraphrasing has produced enormous resources containing millions of meaning-equivalent phrases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ganitkevitch et al., 2013)</ref>. Such resources capture a wide range of language variation, including the types of lexical and phrasal simplifications just described. In this work, we apply state-of-the-art machine learned models for lexical simplification in order to iden- tify phrase pairs from the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) applicable to the task of text simplifica- tion. We introduce Simple PPDB, 1 a subset of the Paraphrase Database containing 4.5 million sim- plifying paraphrase rules. The large scale of Sim- ple PPDB will support research into increasingly advanced methods for text simplification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Identifying Simplification Rules</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Paraphrase Rules</head><p>The Paraphrase Database (PPDB) is currently the largest available collection of paraphrases. Each paraphrase rule in the database has an automatically-assigned quality score between 1 and 5 ( . In this work, we use the PPDB-TLDR 2 dataset, which contains 14 mil- lion high-scoring lexical and phrasal paraphrases, and is intended to give a generally good tradeoff between precision and recall. To preprocess the data, we lemmatize all of the phrases, and remove rules which differ only by morphology, punctu- ation, or stop words, or which involve phrases longer than 3 words. The resulting list contains 7.5 million paraphrase rules covering 625K unique lemmatized words and phrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Lexical Simplification Model</head><p>Our goal is to build a model which can accurately identify paraphrase rules that both 1) simplify the input phrase and 2) preserve its meaning. That is, we want to avoid a model which favors "sim- ple" words (e.g. the, and) even when they capture none of the meaning of the input phrase. We there- fore train our model to make a three-way distinc- tion between rules which simplify the input, rules which make the input less simple, and rules which generate bad paraphrases.</p><p>Data. We collect our training data in two phases. First, we sample 1,000 phrases from the vocab- ulary of the PPDB. We limit ourselves to words which also appear at least once in the Newsela corpus for text simplifcation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>, in order to ensure that we focus our model on the types of words for which the final resource is most likely to be applied. For each of these 1,000 words/phrases, we sample up to 10 candidate para- phrases from PPDB, stratified evenly across para- phrase quality scores. We ask workers on Ama- zon Mechanical Turk to rate each of the chosen paraphrase rules on a scale from 1 to 5 to indi- cate how well the paraphrase preserves the mean- ing of the original phrase. We use the same an- notation design used in . We have 5 workers judge each pair, omitting workers who do not provide correct answers on the em- bedded gold-standard pairs which we draw from WordNet. For 62% of the paraphrase rules we had scored, the average human rating falls below 3, in- dicating that the meaning of the paraphrase differs substantially from that of the input. We assign all of these rules to the "bad paraphrase" class.</p><p>We take the remaining 3,758 meaning- preserving paraphrase rules (scored ≥3 in the above annotation task) and feed them into a second annotation task, in which we identify rules that simplify the input. We use the same annotation interface as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pavlick and Nenkova (2015)</ref>, which asks workers to choose which of the two phrases is simpler, or to indicate that there is no difference in complexity. We collect 7 judgements per pair and take the majority label, discarding pairs for which the majority opinion was that there was no difference. We include each rule in our training data twice, once as an instance of a "simplifying" rule, and once in the reverse direction as an instance of a "complicating" rule.</p><p>In the end, our training dataset contains 11,829 pairs, with the majority class being "bad para- phrase" (47%), and the remaining split evenly between "simplifying" and "complicating" para- phrase rules (26% each).</p><p>Features. We use a variety of features that have been shown in prior work to give good signal about phrases' relative complexity. The fea- tures we include are as follows: phrase length in words and in characters, frequency according to the Google NGram corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brants and Franz, 2006</ref>), number of syllables, the relative frequency of usage in Simple Wikipedia compared to normal <ref type="bibr">Wikipedia (Pavlick and Nenkova, 2015)</ref>, charac- ter unigrams and bigrams, POS tags, and the aver- aged Word2Vec word embeddings for the words in the phrase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>). For each phrase pair e 1 , e 2 , for each feature f , we include f (e 1 ), f (e 2 ) and f (e 1 ) − f (e 2 ). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We also include the co- sine similarity of the averaged word embeddings and the PPDB paraphrase quality score as features.</p><p>We train a multi-class logistic regression model <ref type="bibr">4</ref> to predict if the application of a paraphrase rule will result in 1) simpler output, 2) more com- plex output, or 3) non-sense output.</p><p>Performance. 54.7% 46.3% Supervised Model, Full 60.4% 52.9% <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>: Accuracy on 10-fold cross-validation, and precision for identifying simplifying rules.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Simple PPDB</head><p>We run the trained model described above over all 7.5 million paraphrase rules. From the pre- dictions, we construct Simple PPDB: a list of 4.5 million simplifying paraphrase rules. A rule in Simple PPDB is represented as a triple, consist- ing of a syntactic category, and input phrase, and a simplified output phrase. Each rule is associated with both a paraphrase quality score from 1 to 5 (taken from PPDB 2.0), and simplification con- fidence score from 0 to 1.0 (our classifier's con- fidence in the prediction that the rule belongs to the "simplifying" class). Note that ranking via the confidence scores of a classification model has not, to our knowledge, been explored in previous work on lexical simplification. The remainder of this paper evaluates the quality of the simplifica- tion ranking. For an evaluation of the paraphrase quality ranking, see . <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows examples of some of the top ranked para- phrases according to Simple PPDB's simplifica- tion score for several input phrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>To evaluate Simple PPDB, we apply it in a set- ting intended to emulate the way it is likely to be used in practice. We use the Newsela Simplifica- tion Dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xu et al., 2015</ref>), a corpus of manu- ally simplified news articles. This corpus is cur- rently the cleanest available simplification dataset and is likely to be used to train and/or evaluate the simplification systems that we envision benefitting most from Simple PPDB. We draw a sample of 100 unique word types ("targets") from the corpus for which Simple PPDB has at least one candidate simplification. For each target, we take Simple PPDB's full list of simplification rules which are of high quality according to the PPDB 2.0 paraphrase score <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and which match the syntactic category of the target. On average, Simple PPDB proposes 8.8 such can- didate simplifications per target.</p><p>Comparison to existing methods. Our base- lines include three existing methods for gener- ating lists of candidates that were proposed in prior work. The methods we test for generating lists of candidate paraphrases for a given target are: the WordNetGenerator, which pulls syn- onyms from WordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Devlin and Tait, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Carroll et al., 1999</ref>), the KauchakGenerator, which generates candidates based on automatic alignments between Simple Wikipedia and normal <ref type="bibr">Wikipedia (Coster and Kauchak, 2011a)</ref>, and the GlavasGenerator, which generates candidates from nearby phrases in vector space (Glavaš andŠtajner andˇandŠtajner, 2015) (we use the pre-trained Word2Vec VSM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>).</p><p>For each generated list, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Horn et al. (2014)</ref>'s supervised SVM Rank approach to rank the candidates for simplicity. We reimplement the main features of their model: namely, word fre- quencies according to the Google NGrams cor- pus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brants and Franz, 2006</ref>) and the Simple Wikipedia corpus, and the alignment probabili- ties according to automatic word alignments be- tween Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Coster and Kauchak, 2011b</ref>). We omit the lan- guage modeling features since our evaluation does not consider the context in which the substitution is to be applied.</p><p>All of these methods (the three generation meth- ods and the ranker) are implemented as part of the LEXenstein toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Paetzold and Specia, 2015)</ref>. We use the LEXenstein implementations for the results reported here, using off-the-shelf configu- rations and treating each method as a black box.</p><p>Setup. We use each of the generate-and-rank methods to produce a ranked list of simplification candidates for each of the 100 targets drawn from the Newsela corpus. When a generation method fails to produce any candidates for a given tar- get, we simply ignore that target for that partic- ular method. This is to avoid <ref type="table">giving Simple PPDB keenly   omit  employment opportunity  remedied  most strongly  leave out  a new job  set right  deeply  delete it  opportunity  be fixed  strongly  be removed  business opportunity  be corrected  eagerly  forget about it  the job  to be resolved  very  be ignored  labour  be solved   Table 3</ref>: Examples of top-ranked simplifications proposed by Simple PPDB for several input words. Often, the best simplifi- cation for a single word is a multiword phrase, or vice-versa. These many-to-one mappings are overlooked when systems use only length or frequency as a proxy for simplicity.</p><p>an unfair advantage, since, by construction, PPDB will have full coverage of our list of 100 targets. In the end, the GlavasGenerator is evaluated over 95, the WordNetGenerator over 82, and the Kauchak- Generator over 48. The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref> do not change significantly if we restrict all systems to the 48 targets which the KauchakGenerator is ca- pable of handling. Since the GlavasGenerator is capable of producing an arbitrary number of can- didates for each target, we limit the length of each of its candidate lists to be equal to the number of candidates produced by Simple PPDB for that same target.</p><p>Human judgments. For each of the proposed rules from all four systems, we collect human judgements on Amazon Mechanical Turk, using the same annotation interface as before. That is, we ask 7 workers to view each pair and indicate which of the two phrases is simpler, or to indicate that there is no difference. We take the majority la- bel to be the true label for each rule. Workers show moderate agreement on the 3-way task (κ = 0.4 ± 0.03), with 14% of pairs receiving unanimous agreement and 37% receiving the same label from 6 out of 7 annotators. We note that the κ metric is likely a lower bound, as it punishes low agree- ment on pairs for which there is little difference in complexity, and thus the "correct" answer is not clear (e.g. for the pair matter, subject, 3 annota- tors say that matter is simpler, 2 say that subject is simpler, and 2 say there is no difference).</p><p>Results.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref>: Precision of relative simplification rankings of three existing lexical simplification methods compared to the Sim- ple PPDB resource in terms of Average Precision and P@1 (both range from 0 to 1 and higher is better). All of the ex- isting methods were evaluated using the implementations as provided in the LEXenstein toolkit.</p><p>likely due to a combination of the additional fea- tures applied in Simple PPDB's model (e.g. word embeddings) and the difference in training data (Simple PPDB's model was trained on 11K para- phrase pairs with trinary labels, while the <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Horn et al. (2014)</ref> model was trained on 500 words, each with a ranked list of paraphrases).  In addition, Simple PPDB offers the largest coverage (  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>: Overall coverage of three existing lexical simplifica- tion methods compared to the Simple PPDB resource. Glavas is marked as ∞ since it generates candidates based on near- ness in vector space, and in theory could generate as many words/phrases as are in the vocabulary of the vector space.</p><p>each target-for the 100 targets drawn from the Newsela corpus, PPDB provided an average of 8.8 candidates per target. The next best generator, the WordNet-based system, produces only 6.7 candi- dates per target on average, and has a total vocab- ulary of only 155K words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We have described Simple PPDB, a subset of the Paraphrase Database adapted for the task of text simplification. Simple PPDB is built by apply- ing state-of-the-art machine learned models for lexical simplification to the largest available re- source of lexical and phrasal paraphrases, result- ing in a web-scale resource capable of supporting research in data-driven methods for text simplifi- cation.
