				<p>Counselor empathy is associated with better outcomes in psychology and behav-ioral counseling. In this paper, we explore several aspects pertaining to counseling interaction dynamics and their relation to counselor empathy during mo-tivational interviewing encounters. Particularly , we analyze aspects such as par-ticipants&apos; engagement, participants&apos; verbal and nonverbal accommodation, as well as topics being discussed during the conversation , with the final goal of identifying linguistic and acoustic markers of counselor empathy. We also show how we can use these findings alongside other raw linguistic and acoustic features to build accurate counselor empathy classifiers with accuracies of up to 80%.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Behavioral counseling is an important tool to ad- dress public health issues such as mental health, substance abuse, and nutrition problems among others. This has motivated increased interest in the study of mechanisms associated with success- ful interventions. Among them, counselor empa- thy has been identified as a key intervention com- ponent that relates to positive therapy outcomes.</p><p>Displaying empathic behavior helps counselors to build rapport with their clients. Empathy levels experienced during counseling have a significant effect on treatment outcomes, as clients who per- ceive their counselor as empathic are more likely to improve than the ones who do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Moyers and Miller, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we apply quantitative approaches to understand the dynamics of the counseling in- teractions and their relation to counselor empa- thy. We focus our analysis on counseling con- ducted using Motivational Interviewing (MI), a well-established evidence-based counseling style, where counselor empathy is defined as the active interest and effort to understand the client's per- spective <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Miller and Rollnick, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>We address four main research questions. First, are there differences in how the counselor and the client engage during empathic conversations? We explore this question by conducting turn-by-turn word frequency analyses of participant's interac- tions across the counseling conversations. Second, are there differences in verbal and vocal mimicry patterns occurring during high and low empathy interactions? We address this question by measur- ing the degree of language matching, verbal and nonverbal coordination, and power dynamics ex- pressed during the interaction. Third, are there content differences in counselor discourse during high and low empathy interactions? We answer this question by applying topic modeling to iden- tify the topics that are more salient in high and low empathy interventions (or in both). Finally, fourth, can we build accurate classifiers of coun- selor empathy? We show how the linguistic and acoustic empathy markers identified in our analy- ses, together with other raw features, can be used to construct classifiers able to predict counselor empathy with accuracies of up to 80%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>There have been several efforts to study the role of empathy during counseling interactions. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Xiao et al., 2012</ref>) applied a text-based approach to dis- criminate empathic from non-empathic encounters using word-frequency analysis. They conducted a set of experiments aiming to predict empathy at the utterance and session level on a manually an- notated dataset. Results showed that empathy can be predicted at reasonable accuracy levels, compa- rable to human assessments. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gibson et al., 2015)</ref> presented a more refined approach for this task, which in addition to n-grams included features derived from the Linguistic Inquire Word Count, LIWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010)</ref> as well as psycholinguistic norms.</p><p>Other research has focused on exploring aspects related to counselor empathy skills, such as their ability to match the client language. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lord et al., 2015)</ref> analyzed the language coordination be- tween client and counselor using Language Style Synchrony (LSS), a measure of the degree of sim- ilarity in word usage among speakers in adjacent talking turns. They found that empathy scores are positively related to LSS, and that higher levels of LSS are likely to result in higher empathy scores.</p><p>Another line of work has explored the use of the acoustic component to predict empathy lev- els during counseling encounters. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xiao et al., 2014</ref>) presented a study on the automatic evalua- tion of counselor empathy based on the analysis of correlation between prosody patterns and the de- gree of empathy showed by the therapist during the counseling interactions. More recently, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Xiao et al., 2015</ref>) addressed the empathy prediction task by deriving language models from transcripts ob- tained by an automatic speech recognition system, thus eliminating the need of human intervention during speaker segmentation and transcription.</p><p>Most of this previous research has focused on the prediction task, and explored a variety of lin- guistic and acoustic representations for this goal. While some of this work has explored the lin- guistic accommodation between speakers, previ- ous methods have not fully explored the conversa- tional aspects of the counseling interaction.</p><p>In this paper, we seek to explore how conver- sational aspects such as engagement, accommo- dation, and discourse topics are related to coun- selor empathy by using strategies such as turn-by- turn word frequency analysis, language coordina- tion, power dynamics analysis, and topic model- ing. Furthermore, we build accurate empathy clas- sifiers that rely on acoustic and linguistic cues in- spired by our conversational analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Counseling Empathy Dataset</head><p>The dataset used in this study consists of 276 MI audio-recorded sessions from: two clinical re- search studies on smoking cessation and medica- tion adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Catley et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goggin et al., 2013)</ref>; recordings of MI students from a graduate- level MI course; wellness coaching phone calls; brief medical encounters in dental practice and student counseling. The dataset was obtained from a previous study conducted by the authors. Further details can be found in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pérez-Rosas et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The counseling sessions target three behavior changes: diet changes (72 sessions), smoking ces- sation (95 sessions), medication adherence (93 sessions). In addition, there are 16 sessions on miscellaneous topics. The full set comprises 97.8 hours of audio with an average session length of 20.8 minutes with a standard deviation of 11.5 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Preprocessing</head><p>Before conducting our analysis on the collected dataset, we performed several preprocessing steps to ensure the confidentiality of the data and to en- able automatic text and audio feature extraction.</p><p>First, all the counseling recordings were sub- jected to an anonymization process. This includes manually trimming the audio to remove introduc- tions, and inserting silences to replace references to participant's name and location.</p><p>Next, 162 sessions for which transcripts were not readily available were transcribed via Mechan- ical Turk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marge et al., 2010</ref>) using the follow- ing guidelines: 1) transcribe speech turn by turn, 2) clearly identify the speaker (either client or counselor), 3) include speech disfluencies, such as false starts, repetitions of whole words or parts of words, and fillers. Transcriptions were manually verified at random points to avoid spam and en- sure their quality.</p><p>Since sessions were recorded in natural condi- tions, we applied speech enhancement methods to remove noise and improve the speech signal qual- ity. We started by converting the audio signal from a stereo to a mono channel and to a uniform sample rate of 16k. We then applied the Mean Square Error estimation of spectral amplitude for audio denoising, as implemented in the Voicebox Speech Processing toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brookes, 2003)</ref>. To allow for a turn-by-turn audio analysis of the coun- seling interaction, we processed the speech sig- nal to separate client and counselor speech seg- ments. To accomplish this task, we used on au- tomatic speech-to-text forced alignment API. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We then used the automatically-obtained time stamps to segment the audio and derive speaker-specific speech segments for each counseling dyad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data Annotation</head><p>Empathy assessments were obtained using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) coding scheme version 4.1 <ref type="bibr">(Moyers, 2014)</ref>. Each session was assigned an empathy score using a 5-point Likert scale, which mea- sures the extent to which the clinician understands or makes an effort to grasp the client's perspec- tive and feelings. The coding was conducted by two independent teams of three coders who had previous experience in MI and MI coding. An- notations were conducted using the session audio recording along with its transcript. The inter-rater reliability, measured in a random sample of 20 double coded sessions using the Intra-Class Cor- relation Coefficient was 0.60, 2 suggesting that the annotators showed moderate agreement on empa- thy assessments. The reported annotation agree- ment was calculated on the original 5-scale em- pathy score and it is within the ranges reported in previous Motivational Interviewing studies (0.60- 0.62). Because of the skewed frequency distribu- tion of the empathy scores in the dataset, we de- cided to conduct our analyses using empathy as a binary outcome, by classifying scores from 1 to 3 as low empathy, and scores of 4 and 5 as high em- pathy. This resulted in 179 high empathy sessions and 97 low empathy sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Empathic vs Non-Empathic Interactions: Counselor Engagement</head><p>We start by exploring differences in verbal ex- change length between low and high empathy en- counters as an indirect measure of participants en- gagement during the conversation. In this anal- ysis, we account for the time dimension by seg- menting the conversation into five equal portions. First, we look at the ratio of words exchanged be- tween the counselor and the client for the different fractions of the conversation.   lower ratio of words exchanged between coun- selors and clients across the interaction, while high empathy exchanges show consistently higher lev- els of interaction. This can be further observed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, which shows that more empathic coun- selors speak considerably less than their clients, and that their less empathic counterparts. This is in line with findings in MI literature indicating that counselors who reduce the amount of time they talk with their clients are likely to allow more time for the patient to talk and explore their concerns, thus improving the perception of empathy and un- derstanding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">and Bylund, 2014)</ref>. We analyze the accommoda- tion and its relation to empathy by exploring ver- bal and nonverbal behaviors exhibited by counsel- ing participants during MI encounters. In addi- tion to accommodation assessments, we explore the direction of the accommodation phenomena, i.e., whether the counselor is mirroring or leading the client.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Verbal Accommodation</head><p>In order to explore how verbal accommodation phenomena in our dataset relate to the MITI empathy assessments, we use two methods that are drawn from the Conversation Accommoda- tion Theory. The first one is the Linguistic Style Matching (LSM) proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gonzales et al., 2009</ref>) to quantify to which extent one speaker, i.e., the counselor, matches the language of the other, i.e., the client. The second one is the Lin- guistic Style Coordination (LSC) metric proposed in (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011), which quantifies the degree to which one individual im- mediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Both metrics are evaluated across eight linguistic markers from the LIWC dictionary (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010) (i.e., quantifiers, conjunctions, adverbs, auxiliary verbs, prepositions, articles, personal pronouns and im- personal pronouns).</p><p>LSM produces a score ranging between 0 and 1 indicating how much one person uses types of words comparable to the other person, while LSC generates a coordination score in the range of -1 to 1 indicating the degree of immediate coordi- nation between speakers. While both measures are designed to analyze verbal synchrony, they can reveal different aspects of the counseling in- teraction. We use LSM to explore the potential match of language between counselors and clients across the counseling interaction, and we use LSC to quantify whether the counselor use of a spe- cific linguistic marker in a given turn increases the probability of the client using the same marker during their reply. In addition, we use LSC to investigate power differences during the conver- sation based on the amount of coordination dis- played by either counselor or client, under the assumption that the speaker who accommodates less holds the most power during the conversa- tion (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the average LSM scores for 0-20 40-60 60-80 80-100 eight linguistic markers measured on five equal segments of the conversation duration. As ex- pected, we observe an increasing trend of lan- guage style matching during the counseling in- teraction in both high-empathic and low-empathic encounters, as people usually match their lan- guage unconsciously and regardless of the out- come of the conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002</ref>). Interestingly, counselors and clients present a higher degree of language match- ing during high empathy encounters, while speak- ers in low empathy encounters show lower levels of style matching.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0.6 0.7 0.8</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Portion of the conversation (% of turns) Linguistic Style Matching</head><p>We evaluate the immediate LSC in two direc- tions: coordination of counselors toward clients, and coordination of clients toward counselors. Re- sults indicate low levels of immediate coordina- tion in both cases, with values ranging between -0.06 and 0.1. Nonetheless, the results also sug- gest that clients coordinate more than counselors, with LSC(client,counselor)=-0.030 compared to LSC(counselor, client)=-0.038, which further sug- gests that counselors have more power (control) during the conversation. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Analyses of the LSC levels from counselors to clients on different linguistic markers across high- empathic and low-empathic interactions provide interesting findings. While counselors generally show lower levels of coordination in the use of prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and personal pro- nouns <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>, low-empathic counselors show higher LSC levels than their high-empathic coun- terparts. This can be attributed to the use of con- frontational language (e.g., I, could, should, and have), which is often associated with low empa- thy. Similar analyses on the client side, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, indicate significant differences in the use of linguistic markers by the client (except for ar- ticles and quantifiers). In particular, during low empathy encounters, clients coordinate more on the use of conjunctions, adverbs, auxiliary verbs, prepositions, personal pronouns, and impersonal pronouns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Nonverbal Accommodation</head><p>Empathy is also shown through nonverbal chan- nels such as visual and acoustics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Regenbogen et al., 2012</ref>). We explore the role of nonverbal mirroring in empathy by looking at vocal syn- chrony patterns shared between counselors and clients during the counseling interaction. We fo- cus our analysis on vocal pitch, which is defined as the psychological perception of the voice fre- quency in terms of how high or how low it sounds. Pitch carries information about the speaker's emo- tional state, and has been shown to be related to the perception of empathy in psychotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Reich et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>We evaluate speech synchrony during turn- taking trajectories in the conversation. We con- sider two cases: sequences where the counselor replies to the client statements (e.g., rephrasing), and sequences where the counselor leads the in- teraction (e.g., asking questions). Starting with the turn-by-turn segmentation, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> we extract pitch (F0) on each speaker-specific segment using OpenEar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eyben et al., 2009</ref>). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We then measure the corre- lation of all pitch values during counselor follow- ing turns and during counselor leading turns across the entire therapy session. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Figures 6 and 7 show the trends in pitch syn- chrony across high-empathic and low-empathic encounters in the dataset. In the first figure, we observe that when replying to clients, counselors who are given low empathy scores show higher vocal synchrony levels than counselors who re- ceive higher empathy scores. A potential expla- nation for this finding is that a counselor who mir- rors the client pitch might amplify the emotional distress of the client, or may suggest the coun- selor's lack of confidence or knowledge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Reich et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, we observe the opposite trend for the counselor leading sequences, where higher vocal synchrony levels are observed dur- ing high empathy interactions, which can be at- 5 On average, there are approximately 40 counselor-client turns per conversation <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The feature extraction was done at audio-frame level ev- ery 10ms with a 25ms Hamming window. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The terms of "counselor following" and "counselor lead- ing" simply refer to how the correlation is computed. In "counselor following," we consider the set of counselor utter- ances and the previous client utterances; in "counselor lead- ing," we consider the set of counselor utterances and the fol- lowing client utterances. tributed to clients mirroring the counselor speech. The similarity is noticeably higher at the begin- ning of the conversation and gradually decreases as the conversation progresses. Moreover, the dif- ferences are not significant for the 40-100% turns, but results for the first 20% suggest significant dif- ferences at least in the beginning of the conversa- tion (p &lt; 0.05). This further confirm similarities during verbal and nonverbal accommodation, sim- ilar to how in section 5.1 we found that during high-empathic encounters, counselors hold con- trol of the conversation and clients accommodate more than counselors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Topics Discussed during Counseling Interaction and their Relation to Empathy</head><p>We also conduct content analysis on the coun- seling interactions, to identify themes discussed in high-empathic and low-empathic encounters. For this task, we employ the Meaning Extraction Method (MEM) , a topic extraction method that identifies the most common words used in a set of documents, and clusters them into coherent themes by analyz- ing their co-occurrences. MEM has been used in the past in the psychotherapy domain to ana- lyze salient topics in depression forums ( <ref type="bibr">RamirezEsparza et al., 2008</ref>) and also to investigate dif- ferences in topics discussed by patients given their therapy outcomes, i.e., therapeutic gain or unsuc- cessful therapy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wolf et al., 2010</ref>   to conduct the text preprocessing tasks, which include tokenizing and lemmatizing the words in each session, as well as removing function words. We keep only words who appear in at least 10% of the transcripts with a minimum frequency of 50. From the resulting list, we remove adjectives, adverbs, and verbs and keep only nouns as they usually refer to one defi- nite class thus helping us to identify less ambigu- ous topics. Using the resulting noun list, with 339 entries, we generate a binary vector for each doc- ument, indicating the presence or absence of each noun in the document. We then run a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by varimax rotation on the document matrix to find clusters of co-occurring nouns.</p><p>The initial PCA shows that the first three com- ponents consist mainly of domain specific nouns. Notably, this accurately captures the presence of the three main behavior change targets discussed in the dataset, i.e., medication adherence, smoking cessation, and weight management; sample words from each component are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>In order to identify topics potentially related to the counseling skill, we decided to remove the do- main words from the analysis, which resulted in 250 nouns. Next, we use the same PCA config- uration on the binary document matrix and rerun the experiment, which this time leads to 98 com- ponents. Following PCA literature recommen- dations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Velicer and Fava, 1998)</ref>, we retain only components with at least three variables with load- ings greater than 0.30, which leads to 14 compo- nents. We then re-run PCA forcing a 14 compo- nents solution; these components explain 35% of the total variance in the original matrix. Finally, we use the method proposed in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wilson et al., 2016</ref>) to measure the degree to which a particu- lar MEM topic (component) is used during high- empathic and low-emphatic encounters.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the scores assigned to each topic. In this table, scores greater than 1 corre- spond to topics salient in high empathy encounters while scores lower than 1 indicate topics salient in low empathy encounters. From this table, we can derive interesting observations. First, dur- ing high-empathic encounters, counselors seem to pay more attention to patient concerns, provide in- formation, use reflective language, and talk about change. Second, during less empathic encounters, counselors seem to persuade and direct more, as well as focus on client's resistance to change. In- terestingly, topics that are identified as dominant in less empathic interactions are also related to MI non-adherent behavior, which means the coun- selors are not following the MI strategy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rollnick et al., 2008)</ref>. Finally, regardless of the empathy shown during the encounter, counselors discuss patients' support system and feelings at similar rates (values closer to 1), which is expected when following the MI strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Prediction of Counselor Empathy</head><p>In the previous sections, we provided evidence of important differences in linguistic and verbal be- haviors exhibited by counselors and clients during high-empathic and low-empathic MI encounters. In this section, we explore the use of linguistic and acoustic cues to build a computational model that predicts counselor empathy during MI encounters.</p><p>The feature set consists of the cues identified during our exploratory analyses as potential indi- cators of counselor empathy, as well as additional text and audio features used during standard NLP and acoustic feature extraction.</p><p>The text-based features are extracted from the manual transcripts of the sessions, while the audio-based features are extracted from audio seg- ments obtained by force-aligning each session transcript with its corresponding audio. However, as future work, we are considering to automatize this process by conducting automatic speaker di- arization and transcription via automatic speech recognition.</p><p>During our experiments, we first explore the predictive power of each cue separately, followed by an integrated model that attempts to combine the linguistic and acoustic cues to improve the pre- diction of counselor empathy.</p><p>All the experiments are performed using a Ran- dom Forest <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Breiman, 2001)</ref> classifier. Given the large number of features, we use feature selection based on information gain to identify the best set of features during each experiment. During this process we keep at least 20% of the features in each set. Evaluations are conducted using leave- one-session-out cross-validation. The feature se- lection algorithm is run on each training fold be- fore the model is trained, and the final model in- cludes the best subset of attributes. As a refer- ence value, we use a majority class baseline, ob- tained by selecting high empathy as the default class, which corresponds to 64% accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Linguistic and Acoustic Features</head><p>Engagement: These features represent the partic- ipant's engagement during the conversation as de- scribed in Section 4. They are evaluated at 20% increments of the conversation duration and also at conversation (session) level. The features are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. Linguistic accommodation: We measure the LSM and LSC metrics as described in section 5.2 over 74 LIWC categories and measured at 20% in- crements of the encounter duration.   Nonverbal accommodation: This set includes the counselor-leading and counselor-following synchrony scores, calculated as described in sec- tion 5.2, and evaluated at 20% increments of the encounter duration. Discourse topics: These features consist of the 14 topics identified in section 6 as frequently dis- cussed during the MI encounters. The features are obtained by calculating the product of the princi- pal components matrix and the binary document- term matrix. Raw linguistic features: We extract a large set of linguistic features derived from the session tran- script to model the counselor language. We in- clude: unigrams and bigrams (ngrams), repre- sented as a vector containing their frequencies in the session; psycholinguistic-inspired features that capture differences in semantic meaning (lex- icons), represented as the total frequency counts of all the words in a lexicon-category that are present in the transcript; syntactic features that encode syntax patterns in the counselor statements (CFG), represented as a vector containing the frequency of lexicalized and unlexicalized production rules from the Context Free Grammar parse trees 9 of each transcript. The final linguistic features set consists of 13,648 features. Raw acoustic features: This feature set includes a large number of speech features extracted with the OpenEar toolkit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eyben et al., 2009</ref>). We use a predefined feature set, EmoLarge, which consists of a set of 6,552 features used for emotion recog- nition tasks. The features are derived from 25 low- level speech descriptors including intensity, loud- ness, 12 Mel frequency coefficients, pitch (F0),   probability of voicing, F0 envelope, zero-crossing rate, and 8 line spectral frequencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Classification Results</head><p>Classification results for each feature set are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. For the linguistic and acoustic modalities, almost all the feature sets provide clas- sification accuracies above the baseline, with good F-scores for both high and low empathy. The only exception are the nonverbal accommodation fea- tures, which have an accuracy comparable to the baseline (64.86% vs. 64%).</p><p>When combining all the feature sets for each modality, we observe performance gains in the range of 10 to 15%, as compared to the models that use one feature set at a time.</p><p>We also conduct multimodal experiments where we combine linguistic and acoustic features using either early fusion by concatenating all the feature vectors, or late fusion by aggregating the outputs of each classifier using a rule-based score level fu- sion that assigns a weight of 0.8 to the linguistic classifier, and 0.2 to the acoustic classifier. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Overall, the results show performance gains when using late fusion as compared to early fu- sion. While the late fusion model does not outper- form the best linguistic model in terms of accuracy and high empathy F-score, the multimodal late fu- sion classifier has significantly better F-score per- formance in the classification of low empathy en- counters, thus suggesting potential benefits of fus-ing acoustic and linguistic cues during the predic- tion of counselor empathy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we presented an extensive analysis of counselors and clients behaviors during MI en- counters, and found significant differences in the way counselors and clients behave during high and low empathy encounters. We specifically explored the engagement, coordination, and discourse of counselors during MI interventions. Our main findings include: Engagement: Empathic counselors show more engagement during the conversation by a) showing levels of verbal interaction consistent with their client, and b) reducing their relative talking time with clients. Coordination: Empathic counselors match the linguistic style of their clients across the session, but maintain control of the conversation by coor- dinating less at immediate conversation turn-level. Conversation content: Empathic counselors use reflective language and talk about behavior change, while less empathic counselors persuade more and focus on client resistance toward change.</p><p>The results of these analyses were used to build accurate counselor empathy classifiers that rely on linguistic and acoustic cues, with accuracies of up to 80%.</p><p>In the future, we plan to build upon the acquired knowledge and the developed classifiers to create automatic tools that provide accurate evaluative feedback of counseling practice.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Word ratio by turn between clients and counselors as the conversation progresses.</figDesc></figure>

The turn-level word ratios are then averaged for all the turns included in a portion of the conversation.</note>
