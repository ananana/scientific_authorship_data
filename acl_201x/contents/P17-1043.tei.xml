				<p>We present a system which parses sentences into Abstract Meaning Representations , improving state-of-the-art results for this task by more than 5%. AMR graphs represent semantic content using linguistic properties such as semantic roles, coref-erence, negation, and more. The AMR parser does not rely on a syntactic pre-parse, or heavily engineered features, and uses five recurrent neural networks as the key architectural components for inferring AMR graphs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Semantic analysis is the process of extracting meaning from text, revealing key ideas such as "who did what to whom, when, how, and where?", and is considered to be one of the most complex tasks in natural language processing. Historically, an important consideration has been the definition of the output of the task -how can the concepts in a sentence be captured in a general, consistent and expressive manner that facilitates downstream semantic processing? Over the years many for- malisms have been proposed as suitable target rep- resentations including variants of first order logic, semantic networks, and frame-based slot-filler no- tations. Such representations have found a place in many semantic applications but there is no clear consensus as to the best representation. However, with the rise of supervised machine learning tech- niques, a new requirement has come to the fore: the ability of human annotators to quickly and reli- ably generate semantic representations as training data.</p><p>Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Ba- narescu et al., 2012) 1 was developed to provide 1 http://amr.isi.edu/language.html a computationally useful and expressive repre- sentation that could be reliably generated by hu- man annotators. Sentence meanings in AMR are represented in the form of graphs consisting of concepts (nodes) connected by labeled relations (edges). AMR graphs include a number of tra- ditional NLP representations including named en- tities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)</ref>, word senses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002</ref>), coreference rela- tions, and predicate-argument structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Palmer et al., 2005</ref>). More recent innovations include wikification of named entities and normalization of temporal expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Verhagen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Strötgen and Gertz, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="formula">(2016)</ref> provides an insightful discussion of the re- lationship between AMR and other formal repre- sentations including first order logic.</p><p>The process of creating AMR's for sentences is called AMR Parsing and was first introduced in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al., 2014)</ref>. A key factor driving the de- velopment of AMR systems has been the increas- ing availability of training resources in the form of corpora where each sentence is paired with a corresponding AMR representation 2 . A consis- tent framework for evaluating AMR parsers was defined by the Semeval-2016 Meaning Represen- tation Parsing Task <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . Standard training, develop- ment and test splits for the AMR Annotation Re- lease 1 corpus are provided, as well as an addi- tional out-of-domain test dataset, for system com- parisons. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Viewed as a structured prediction task, AMR parsing poses some difficult challenges not faced by other related language processing tasks includ- ing part of speech tagging, syntactic parsing or se-  name (a) An AMR graphical depiction of the meaning of the sen- tence France plans further nuclear cooperation with nu- merous countries . Concepts are represented as ovals, and relations are the directed connections between them. Pred- icate concepts are labelled with their PropBank sense, and semantic roles are indicated by "Arg" relations. Non-Arg relations like name or mod are called "Nargs" in this pa- per. Note the shaded section, which shows an example of a subgraph, containing related concepts and relations. In the example, the subgraph represents "France" which includes the category country and a shortened link to the France wiki page. (b) General Architecture for the AMR Parser, which creates an AMR based on the words in a sentence. The 5 B-LSTM networks infer structures of the AMR. For example, the SG network infers subgraphs, which are mostly single concept, like "plan-01" or "further", but can also be like the more complex shaded "France" subgraph in the example. Other B-LSTM networks are used to infer predicate argument re- lations (Args), other relations (Nargs), attributes like "TOP" (Attr) and name categories like "country" for France (Ncat). mantic role labeling. The prediction task in these settings can be cast as per-token labeling tasks (i.e. IOB tags) or as a sequence of discrete parser actions, as in transition-based (shift-reduce) ap- proaches to dependency parsing. The first challenge is that AMR representations are by design abstracted away from their associ- ated surface forms. AMR corpora pair sentences with their corresponding representations, without providing an explicit annotation, or alignment, that links the parts of the representation to their corresponding elements of the sentence. Not sur- prisingly, this complicates training, decoding and evaluation.</p><p>The second challenge is the fact that, as noted earlier, the AMR parsing task is an amalgam of predicate identification and classification, entity recognition, co-reference, word sense disambigua- tion and semantic role labeling -each of which relies on the others for successful analysis. The architecture and system presented in the follow- ing sections is largely motivated by these two chal- lenges.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">AMR Parsers</head><p>Most current AMR parsers are constructed using some form of supervised machine learning that ex- ploits existing AMR corpora. In general, these systems make use of features derived from vari- ous forms of syntactic analysis, ranging from part- of-speech tagging to more complex dependency or phrase-structure analysis. Currently, most systems fall into two classes: (1) systems that incremen- tally transform a dependency parse into an AMR graph using transition-based systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang et al., , 2016</ref>, and (2) graph-oriented approaches that use syntactic features to score edges between all concept pairs, and then use a maximum span- ning connected subgraph (MSCG) algorithm to se- lect edges that will constitute the graph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Werling et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>As expected, there are exceptions to these gen- eral approaches. The largely rule-based approach of (2015) converts logical forms from an exist- ing semantic analyzer into AMR graphs. They demonstrate the ability to use their existing system to generate AMRs in German, French, Spanish and Japanese without the need for a native AMR corpus.</p><p>(2015) proposes a synchronous hyperedge re- placement grammar solution, (2015) uses syntax- based machine translation techniques to create tree structures similar to AMR, while (2015) creates logical form representations of sentences and then converts these to AMR.</p><p>An exception to the use of heavily engineered features is the deep learning approach of (2016), which, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collobert et al., 2011</ref>), relies on word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to generate AMR graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Bidirectional LSTM Neural Networks</head><p>Unlike relatively simple sequence processing tasks like part-of-speech tagging and NER, semantic analysis requires the ability to keep track of rel- evant information that may be arbitrarily far away from the words currently under consideration. Re- current neural networks (RNNs) are a class of neu- ral architecture that use a form of short-term mem- ory in order to solve this semantic distance prob- lem. Basic RNN systems have been enhanced with the use of special memory cell units, referred to as Long Short-Term Memory neural networks, or LSTM's (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Such systems can effectively process information dispersed over hundreds of words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schmidhuber et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gers et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Bidirectional LSTMs (B-LSTM) networks are LSTMs that are connected so that both future and past sequence context can be examined.

We use the LSTM cell as described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Graves et al., 2013)</ref>, configured in a B-LSTM shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, as the core network architecture in the system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Parser Overview</head><p>Our parser 5 will be explained using this example sentence: France plans further nuclear coopera- tion with numerous countries . A graphical depiction of an AMR for this sen- tence is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>.</p><p>Given an input sentence, the approach taken in our AMR parser is similar to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al., 2014</ref>) in that it consists of two subtasks: (1) dis- cover the concepts (nodes and sub-graphs) present in the sentence, and (2) determine the relations (arcs) that connect the concepts (relations cap- ture both traditional predicate-argument structures (ARGs), as well as additional modifier relations that capture notions including quantification, po- larity, and cardinality.) Neither of these tasks is straightforward in the AMR context. Among the complications are the fact that individual words may contribute to more than one node (as in the case of France), parts of the graph may be "reen- trant", participating in relations with multiple con- cepts, and predicate-argument and modifier rela- tions can be introduced by arbitrary parts of the input.</p><p>At a high level, our system takes an input sen- tence in form of a vector of word embeddings and uses a series of recurrent neural networks to (1) discover the basic set of nodes and sub- graphs that comprise the AMR, (2) discover the set of predicate-argument relations among those concepts, and (3) identifying any relevant modifier relations that are present.</p><p>A high level block diagram of the parser is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>. The parser extracts fea- tures from the sentence which are processed by a bidirectional LSTM network (B-LSTM) to cre- ate a set of AMR subgraphs, which contain one or two concepts as well as their internal relations to each other. Features based on the sentence and these subgraphs are then processed by a pair of B-LSTM networks to compute the probabilities of relations between all subgraphs. All subgraphs are then connected using an iterative, greedy algo- rithm to compute a single component graph, with all subgraphs connected by relations. Separately, another two B-LSTM networks compute attribute and name categories, which are then appended to the graph. Finally, the subgraphs are expanded into the most probable AMR concept and relation primitives to create the final AMR.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">AMR Spans, Subgraphs, and Subgraph Decoding</head><p>Mapping the words in a sentence to AMR concepts is a critical first step in the parsing process, and can influence the performance of all subsequent processing. Although the most common mapping is one word to one concept, a series of consecu- tive words, or span, can also be associated with an AMR concept. Likewise, a span of words can be mapped to a small connected subgraph, such as the single word span France which is mapped to a subgraph composed of two concepts connected by a name relation. (see the shaded section of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  1a</ref>). Training corpora provide sentences which are annotated by humans with AMR graphs, not nec- essarily including a reference span to subgraph mapping. An automatic AMR aligner can be used to predict relationships between words and gold AMR's. We use the alignments produced by the aligner of <ref type="formula">(2014)</ref>, along with the words and refer- ence AMR graphs, to identify a subgraph type to associate with each span. Each word in the sen- tence is then associated with an IOBES subgraph type tag. We call the algorithm which defines span to subgraph mapping the Expert Span Identifier, and use it to train the SG Network.</p><p>A convenient development detail stems from the fact that during the AMR creation process, the identified subgraphs must be expanded into individual concepts and relations. For example, the subgraph type "Named", along with the span France, must be expanded to create the concepts, relations, and attributes shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>.</p><note type="other">A Subgraph Expander algorithm implements this task, which is essentially the inverse of the Ex- pert Span Identifier. The Expert Span Identifier and Subgraph Expander were developed by cas- cading the two in a test configuration as shown in Figure 3a.</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Features</head><p>All input features for the five networks correspond to the sequence of words in the input sentence, and are presented to the networks as indices into lookup tables. With the exception of pre-trained word embeddings, these lookup tables are ran- domly initialized prior to training and representa- tions are created during the training process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Word Embeddings</head><p>The use of distributed word representations gener- ated from large text corpora is pervasive in mod- ern NLP. We start with 300 dimension GloVe rep- resentations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) trained on the 840 billion word common crawl ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Smith et al., 2013</ref>). We added two binary dimensions: one for out of vocabulary words, and one for padding, re- sulting in vectors with a width of 302. These em- beddings are mapped from the words in the sen- tence, and are then trained using back propagation just like other parameters in the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Wikifier</head><p>The AMR standard was expanded to include the annotation of named entities with a canonical form, using Wikipedia as the standard (see France in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a)</ref>. The wiki link associated with this "wikification" is expressed using the :wiki at- tribute, which requires some kind of global exter- nal knowledge of the Wikipedia ontology. We use the University of Illinois Wikifier <ref type="bibr">(Ratinov et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cheng and Roth, 2013</ref>) to identify the :link directly, and use the possible categories output from the wikifier as feature inputs to the NCat Net- work.</p></div>

The expert system uses the sentence, reference AMR, and align- ment to identify spans of words which are related to con- cepts within the AMR. These spans are also labelled with a subgraph type. A "subgraph expander" uses the words and subgraph type to expand into AMR subgraphs.  Named Entity Recognition can be valuable in- put to a parser, and state-of-the-art NER systems can be created using convolutional neural net- works (Collobert et al., 2011) or LSTM (Chiu and Nichols, 2015) aided by information from gazetteers. These gazetteers are large dictionaries containing well known named entities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Florian et al., 2003)</ref>).</p><p>Rather than add gazetteer features to our sys- tem, we make use of the NER information already calculated and provided by the Univ. of Illinois Wikifier. We then encode the classified named en- tities output from the wikifier as feature embed- dings, which are used by the SG Network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">AMR Subgraph (SG) Network</head><p>The features used as input to the SG network are:</p><p>• word: 45Kx302, the word embeddings • suffix: 430x5, embeddings based on the final two letters of each word.</p><p>• caps: 5x5, embeddings based on the capital- ization pattern of the word.</p><p>• NER: 5x5, embeddings indexed by NER from the Wikifier, 'O', 'LOC', 'ORG', 'PER' or 'MISC'.</p><p>The SG Network produces probabilities for 46 BIOES tagged subgraph types, and the highest probability tag is chosen for each word, as shown for the example sentence in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Predicate Argument Relations (Args) Network</head><p>The AMR concepts (nodes) are connected by rela- tions (arcs). We found it convenient to distinguish predicate argument relations, or "Args" from other relations, which we call "Nargs". For example, see ARG0 and ARG1 relations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref> are "Args", compared with the name, degree, mod, or quant relations which are "Nargs". The Args Network is run once for each predi- cate subgraph, and produces a matrix P args which defines the probability (prior to the identification of any relations 6 ) of a type of predicate argument relation from a predicate subgraph to any other SG identified subgraph. (For example, see ARG0 and ARG1 relations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>.) The matrix has di- mensions 5 by s, where 5 is the number of predi- cate arg relations identified by the network, and s is the total number of subgraphs identified by the SG Network for the sentence.</p><p>The Args features, calculated for each source predicate subgraph, are:</p><p>• Word, Suffix and Caps as in the SG network.</p><p>• SG: 46x5, indexed by the SG network identi- fied subgraph.</p><p>• PredWords <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>  • PredSG <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, 46x10: The SG embedding of the word and surrounding 2 words associated with the source predicate subgraph.</p><p>• regionMark: 21x5, indexed by the distance in words between the word and the word asso- ciated with the source predicate subgraph. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows an example feature set for one subgraph while evaluating a predicate subgraph.</p></div>

Note that subgraph expansion also identi- fies many attributes, for example the words associ- ated with named entities, or the normalized quan- tity and date representations. A known shortcom- ing of this network is that the TOP and polarity at- tributes are not mutually exclusive, but noting that the cooccurrence of the two does not occur in the training data, we chose to avoid adding a separate network to allow the prediction of both attributes for a single subgraph.</p></div>

Outgoing predicate relations are limited to one of each kind (i.e. can't have two ARG0's)</p><p>We initialize a graph description with all the subgraphs identified by the SG network. Prob- abilities for all possible edges are represented in the P args and P nargs matrices. The Subgraphs are connected to one another by applying a greedy al- gorithm, which repeatedly selects the most proba- ble edge from the P args and P nargs matrices and adds the edge to the graph description. After an edge is selected to be added to the graph, we ad- just P args and P nargs based on the constraints (hard decisions change the probabilities), and re- peat adding edges until all remaining edge proba- bilities are below a threshold. (The optimum value of this threshold, 0.55, was found by experiment- ing with the development data set). From then on, only the most probable edges which span graph components are chosen, until the graph contains a single component.</p><p>Expressed as a step by step procedure, we first define p connect as the probability threshold at which to require graph component spanning, and we repeat the following, until any two subgraphs in the graph are connected by at least one path.</p><p>1.

If p r &lt; p connect , keep selecting most proba- ble relations until a component spanning con- nection is found. 3. Add the selected relation to the graph. If a cycle is created, reverse the relation direction and label. 4. Eliminate impossible relations based on the constraints and re-normalize the affected P args and P nargs matrices.</p></div>

The TOP attribute occurs exactly once in each AMR, so the subgraph with highest TOP probability produced by the Attr network is identified. The AMR graph is adjusted so that it is rooted with the most probable TOP sub- graph. After graph adjustment, new cycles are sometimes created, which are removed by using -of relation reversal. 2. The subgraphs identified by the SG network, which were considered to be single nodes during relation resolution, are expanded to basic AMR concepts and relations to form a concept/relation AMR graph representation, using the Subgraph Expander component de- veloped as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3b</ref>. When a sub- graph contains two concepts, the choice of connecting to parent or child within the sub- graph is made based on training data statistics of each relation type (Arg or Narg) for each subgraph type. 3.

A practical graph comparison program called Smatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cai and Knight, 2013</ref>) is used to consistently evaluate AMR parsers. The smatch python script provides an F1 evaluation metric for whole-sentence semantic graph analysis by comparing sets of triples which describe por- tions of the graphs, and uses a hill climbing algo- rithm for efficiency. All networks, including SG, were trained us- ing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a fixed learning rate. We tried sentence level log- likelihood, which trains a viterbi decoder, as a training objective, but found no improvement over word-level likelihood (cross entropy). After all LSTM and linear layers, we added dropout to minimize overfitting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hinton et al., 2012)</ref> and batch normalization to reduce sensitivity to learn- ing rates and initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>For each of the five networks, we used the LDC2015E86 training split to train parameters, and periodically interrupted training to run the dev split (forward) in order to monitor performance.</p><p>The model parameters which resulted in best dev performance were saved as the final model.

The best performing systems for in-domain (dev and test) data correlated well with the best ones for the out-of-domain (eval) data, although the scores for the eval dataset were lower overall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Individual Network Results</head><p>The word spans tagged by the SG network are used to determine the features for the other net- works. In particular, every span identified as a predicate will trigger the system to evaluate the Args network in order to determine the probabil- ities of outgoing predicate ARG relations. Like- wise, all spans identified as subgraphs (other than named subgraphs) will lead to a Nargs network evaluation to determine outgoing non-Arg rela- tions. The SG network identifies predicates with 0.93 F1, named subgraphs with 0.91 F1, and all other subgraphs with 0.94 F1.</p><p>The Args network identifies ARG0 and ARG1 relations with 0.73 F1, but identification of ARG2, ARG3, and ARG4 drops down to (0.53, 0.20, and 0.43). It is difficult for the system to generalize among these relation tags because they differ sig- nificantly between predicates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have shown that B-LSTM neural networks can be used as the basis for a graph based semantic parser. Our AMR parser effectively exploits the ability of B-LSTM networks to learn to selectively extract information from words separated by long distances in a sentence, and to build up higher level representations by rejecting or remembering important information during sequence process- ing. There are changes which could be made to eliminate all pre-processing and to further improve parser performance.</p><p>Eliminating the need for syntactic pre-parsing is valuable since a syntactic parser takes up sig- nificant time and computational resources, and er- rors in the generated syntax will propagate into an AMR parser. Our approach avoids both of these problems, while generating high quality results.</p><p>Wikification tasks are generally independent from parsing, but wiki links are a requirement for the latest AMR specification. Since our preferred wikifier application generates NER information, we used the generated NER tags as input to the SG network. But it would also be fairly easy to add gazetteer information to the network fea- tures in order to remove the need for NER pre- processing. Therefore, the wikification subtask is the only portion of the parser which requires any pre-processing at all. Incorporating wikification gazetteers as B-LSTM features might allow a per- formant, fully self contained parser to be created.</p><p>Sense disambiguation is not a very generaliz- able task, senses other than 01 and 02 for dif- ferent predicates may differ from each other in ways which are very difficult to discern. A better approach to disambiguation is to consider predi- cates separately, solving for a set of coefficients for each verb found in the training set. A gen- eral set of model parameters could then be used to handle unseen examples. Likewise, high level ARGs like ARG2 and ARG3 don't generalize very well among different predicates, and ARG infer- ence accuracy could be improved with predicate- specific network parameters for the most common cases.</p><p>The alignment between concepts and words is not a reliable, direct mapping: some concepts can- not be grounded to words, some are ambiguous, and automatic aligners tend to have high error rates relative to human aligning judgements. Im- provements in the quality of the alignment in train- ing data would improve parsing results.</p></div>
