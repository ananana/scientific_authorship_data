				<p>This paper introduces an unsupervised graph-based method that selects textual labels for automatically generated topics. Our approach uses the topic keywords to query a search engine and generate a graph from the words contained in the results. PageRank is then used to weigh the words in the graph and score the candidate labels. The state-of-the-art method for this task is supervised (Lau et al., 2011). Evaluation on a standard data set shows that the performance of our approach is consistently superior to previously reported methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Topic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hofmann, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blei et al., 2003)</ref> have proved to be a useful way to represent the content of document collections, e.g. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chaney and Blei, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ganguly et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gretarsson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hinneburg et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Snyder et al., 2013)</ref>. In these interfaces, topics need to be pre- sented to users in an easily interpretable way. A common way to represent topics is as set of key- words generated from the n terms with the highest marginal probabilities. For example, a topic about the global financial crisis could be represented by its top 10 most probable terms: FINANCIAL, BANK, MARKET, GOVERNMENT, MORTGAGE, BAILOUT, BILLION, STREET, WALL, CRISIS. But interpreting such lists is not always straightfor- ward, particularly since background knowledge may be required ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chang et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Textual labels could assist with the interpre- tations of topics and researchers have developed methods to generate these automatically ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mei et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lau et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al., 2011</ref>). For example, a topic which has keywords SCHOOL, STUDENT, UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE, TEACHER, CLASS, EDUCATION, LEARN, HIGH, PROGRAM, could be labelled as EDUCATION and a suitable la- bel for the topic shown above would be GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS. Approaches that make use of alternative modalities, such as images ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aletras and Stevenson, 2013)</ref>, have also been proposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mei et al. (2007)</ref> label topics using statistically significant bigrams identified in a reference collec- tion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Magatti et al. (2009)</ref> introduced an approach for labelling topics that relied on two hierarchical knowledge resources labelled by humans, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lau et al. (2010)</ref> proposed selecting the most rep- resentative word from a topic as its label. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hulpus et al. (2013)</ref> make use of structured data from DB- pedia to label topics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al. (2011)</ref> proposed a method for auto- matically labelling topics using information from Wikipedia. A set of candidate labels is gener- ated from Wikipedia article titles by querying us- ing topic terms. Additional labels are then gen- erated by chunk parsing the article titles to iden- tify n-grams that represent Wikipedia articles as well. Outlier labels (less relevant to the topic) are identified and removed. Finally, the top-5 topic terms are added to the candidate set. The la- bels are ranked using Support Vector Regression (SVR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Vapnik, 1998)</ref> and features extracted us- ing word association measures (i.e. PMI, t-test, χ 2 and Dice coefficient), lexical features and search engine ranking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al. (2011)</ref> report two ver- sions of their approach, one unsupervised (which is used as a baseline) and another which is super- vised. They reported that the supervised version achieves better performance than a previously re- ported approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mei et al., 2007)</ref>. This paper introduces an alternative graph- based approach which is unsupervised and less computationally intensive than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al. (2011)</ref>. Our method uses topic keywords to form a query. A graph is generated from the words contained in the search results and these are then ranked using the PageRank algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Page et al., 1999</ref>; Mihal-{'Description': 'Microsoft will accelerate your journey to cloud computing with an agile and responsive datacenter built from your existing technology investments.', 'DisplayUrl': 'www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/datacenter/virtualization.aspx', 'ID': 'a42b0908-174e-4f25-b59c-70bdf394a9da', 'Title': 'Microsoft | Server &amp; Cloud | Datacenter | Virtualization ...', 'Url': 'http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/datacenter/virtualization.aspx', ... } <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>: Sample of the metadata associated with a search result. cea and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Tarau, 2004</ref>). Evaluation on a standard data set shows that our method consistently out- performs the best performing previously reported method, which is supervised ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al., 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>We use the topic keywords to query a search en- gine. We assume that the search results returned are relevant to the topic and can be used to identify and weigh relevant keywords. The most impor- tant keywords can be used to generate keyphrases for labelling the topic or weight pre-existing can- didate labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Retrieving and Processing Text Information</head><p>We use the approach described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al. (2011)</ref> to generate candidate labels from Wikipedia arti- cles. The 10 terms with the highest marginal prob- abilities in the topic are used to query Wikipedia and the titles of the articles retrieved used as candi- date labels. Further candidate labels are generated by processing the titles of these articles to identify noun chunks and n-grams within the noun chunks that are themselves the titles of Wikipedia arti- cles. Outlier labels, identified using a similarity measure (Grieser et al., 2011), are removed. This method has been proved to produce labels which effectively summarise a topic's main subject. However, it should be noted that our method is flexible and could be applied to any set of can- didate labels. We have experimented with various approaches to candidate label generation but chose to report results using the approach described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al. (2011)</ref> to allow direct comparison of ap- proaches.</p><p>Information obtained from web searches is used to identify the best labels from the set of candi- dates. The top n keywords, i.e. those with highest marginal probability within the topic, are used to form a query which was submitted to the Bing 1 search engine. Textual information included in the Title field 2 of the search results metadata was ex- tracted. Each title was tokenised using openNLP <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and stop words removed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Creating a Text Graph</head><p>We consider any remaining words in the search result metadata as nodes, v ∈ V , in a graph G = (V, E). Each node is connected to its neigh- bouring words in a context window of ±n words. In the previous example, the words added to the graph from the Title of the search result are mi- crosoft, server, cloud, datacenter and virtualiza- tion.</p><p>We consider both unweighted and weighted graphs. When the graph is unweighted we assume that all the edges have a weight e = 1. In addi- tion, we weight the edges of the graph by comput- ing the relatedness between two nodes, v i and v j , as their normalised Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bouma, 2009)</ref>. Word co-occurrences are computed using Wikipedia as a a reference cor- pus. Pairs of words are connected with edges only if NPMI(w i , w j ) &gt; 0.2 avoiding connections be- tween words co-occurring by chance and hence in- troducing noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Identifying Important Terms</head><p>Important terms are identified by applying the PageRank algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Page et al., 1999</ref>) in a sim- ilar way to the approach used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mihalcea and Tarau (2004)</ref> for document keyphrase extraction. The PageRank score (P r) over G for a word (v i ) can be computed by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P r(v i ) = d · v j ∈C(v i ) sim(v i , v j ) v k ∈C(v j ) sim(v j , v k ) P r(v j ) + (1 − d)v<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where C(v i ) denotes the set of vertices which are connected to the vertex v i . d is the damping factor which is set to the default value of d = 0.85 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Page et al., 1999</ref>). In standard PageRank all elements of the vector v are the same, 1 N where N is the number of nodes in the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Ranking Labels</head><p>Given a candidate label L = {w 1 , ..., w m } con- taining m keywords, we compute the score of L by simply adding the PageRank scores of its con- stituent keywords:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Score(L) = m i=1 P r(w i )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The label with the highest score amongst the set of candidates is selected to represent the topic. We also experimented with normalised versions of the score, e.g. mean of the PageRank scores. How- ever, this has a negative effect on performance since it favoured short labels of one or two words which were not sufficiently descriptive of the top- ics. In addition, we expect that candidate labels containing words that do not appear in the graph (with the exception of stop words) are unlikely to be good labels for the topic. In these cases the score of the candidate label is set to 0. We also experimented with removing this restriction but found that it lowered performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data</head><p>We evaluate our method on the publicly avail- able data set published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al. (2011)</ref>. The data set consists of 228 topics generated using text documents from four domains, i.e. blog posts (BLOGS), books (BOOKS), news articles (NEWS) and scientific articles from the biomedi- cal domain (PUBMED). Each topic is represented by its ten most probable keywords. It is also as- sociated with candidate labels and human ratings denoting the appropriateness of a label given the topic. The full data set consists of approximately 6,000 candidate labels (27 labels per topic).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>Our evaluation follows the framework proposed by Lau et al. (2011) using two metrics, i.e. Top- 1 average rating and nDCG, to compare various labelling methods.</p><p>Top-1 average rating is the average human rat- ing (between 0 and 3) assigned to the top-ranked label proposed by the system. This provides an in- dication of the overall quality of the label the sys- tem judges as the best one.</p><p>Normalised discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Järvelin and Kekäläinen, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Croft et al., 2009</ref>) compares the label ranking proposed by the system to the ranking provided by human annotators.</p><p>The discounted cumulative gain at position p, DCG p , is computed using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">DCG p = rel 1 + p i=2 rel i log 2 (i)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where rel i is the relevance of the label to the topic in position i. Then nDCG is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">nDCG p = DCG p IDCG p (4)</formula><p>where IDCG p is the superviseed ranking of the image labels, in our experiments this is the rank- ing provided by the scores in the human annotated data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Model Parameters</head><p>Our proposed model requires two parameters to be set: the context window size when connecting neighbouring words in the graph and the number of the search results considered when constructing the graph.</p><p>We experimented with different sizes of context window, n, between ±1 words to the left and right and all words in the title. The best results were ob- tained when n = 2 for all of the domains. In addi- tion, we experimented with varying the number of search results between 10 and 300. We observed no noticeable difference in the performance when the number of search results is equal or greater than 30 (see below). We choose to report results obtained using 30 search results for each topic. In- cluding more results did not improve performance but required additional processing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussion</head><p>Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Performance when PageRank is applied to the unweighted (PR) and NPMI-weighted graphs (PR-NPMI) (see Section The results obtained by applying PageRank over the unweighted graph (2.05, 1.98, 2.04 and 1.88) are consistently better than the supervised and unsupervised methods reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al. (2011)</ref> for the Top-1 Average scores and this im- provement is observed in all domains. The differ- ence is significant (t-test, p &lt; 0.05) for the un- supervised method. A slight improvement in per- formance is observed when the weighted graph is used (2.08, 2.01, 2.05 and 1.90). This is expected since the weighted graph contains additional in- formation about word relatedness. For example, the word hardware is more related and, therefore, closer in the graph to the word virtualization than to the word investments.</p><p>Results from the nDCG metric imply that our methods provide better rankings of the candidate labels in the majority of the cases. It is outper- formed by the best supervised approach in two do- mains, NEWS and PUBMED, using the nDCG- 3 and nDCG-5 metrics. However, the best label proposed by our methods is judged to be better (as shown by the nDCG-1 and Top-1 Av. Rat- ing scores), demonstrating that it is only the lower ranked labels in our approach that are not as good as the supervised approach.</p><p>An interesting finding is that, although limited in length, the textual information in the search re- sult's metadata contain enough salient terms rel- evant to the topic to provide reliable estimates of  term importance. Consequently, it is not necessary to measure semantic similarity between topic key- words and candidate labels as previous approaches have done. In addition, performance improvement gained from using the weighted graph is mod- est, suggesting that the computation of association scores over a large reference corpus could be omit- ted if resources are limited.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, we show the scores of Top-1 av- erage rating obtained in the different domains by experimenting with the number of search results used to generate the text graph. The most inter- esting finding is that performance is stable when 30 or more search results are considered. In addi- tion, we observe that quality of the topic labels in the four domains remains stable, and higher than the supervised method, when the number of search results used is between 150 and 200. The only domain in which performance of the supervised method is sometimes better than the approach pro- posed here is NEWS. The main reason is that news topics are more fine grained and the candidate labels of better quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lau et al., 2011</ref>) which has direct impact in good performance of ranking methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We described an unsupervised graph-based method to associate textual labels with automati- cally generated topics. Our approach uses results retrieved from a search engine using the topic keywords as a query. A graph is generated from the words contained in the search results metadata and candidate labels ranked using the PageRank algorithm. Evaluation on a standard data set shows that our method consistently outperforms the supervised state-of-the-art method for the task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 shows</head><label>1</label><figDesc>a sample of the metadata asso- ciated with a search result for the topic: VMWARE, SERVER, VIRTUAL, ORACLE, UPDATE, VIRTU- ALIZATION, APPLICATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, MANAGEMENT, MICROSOFT.</figDesc></figure>
