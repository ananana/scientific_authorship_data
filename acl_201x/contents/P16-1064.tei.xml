We investigate the task of Cultural-common Topic Detection (CTD), which is aimed at discovering common discussion topics from news reader comments written in different languages. We propose a new probabilistic graphical model called MCTA which can cope with the language gap and capture the common semantics in different languages. We also develop a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler which effectively incorporates the term translation relationship into the detection of cultural-common topics for model parameter learning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Nowadays the rapid development of information and communication technology enables more and more people around the world to engage in the movement of globalization. One effect of global- ization is to facilitate greater connections between people bringing cultures closer than before. This also contributes to the convergence of some ele- ments of different cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Melluish, 2014)</ref>. For example, there is a growing tendency of people watching the same movie, listening to the same music, and reading the news about the same event. This kind of cultural homogenization brings the emergence of commonality of some aspects of dif- ferent cultures worldwide. It would be beneficial to identify such common aspects among cultures. For example, it can provide some insights for global market and international business <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cavusgil et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Many news websites from different regions in the world report significant events which are of in- terests to people from different continents. These websites also allow readers around the world to give their comments in their own languages. The volume of comments is often enormous espe- cially for popular events. In a news website, readers from a particular culture background tend to write comments in their own preferred lan- guages. For some important or global events, we observe that readers from different cultures, via different languages, express common discus- sion topics. For instance, on March 8 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members, disappeared. Upon the happening of this event, many news ar- ticles around the world reported it and many read- ers from different continents commented on this event. Through analyzing the reader comments manually, we observe that both English-speaking and Chinese-speaking readers expressed in their corresponding languages their desire for praying for the MH370 flight. This is an example of a cultural-common discussion topic. Identifying such cultural-common topics automatically can fa- cilitate better understanding and organization of the common concerns or interests of readers with different language background. Such technology can be deployed for developing various applica- tions. One application is to build a reader com- ment digest system that can organize comments by cultural-common discussion topics and rank the topics by popularity. This provides a functional- ity of analyzing the common focus of readers from different cultures on a particular event. An exam- ple of such application is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. Un- der each event, reader comments are grouped by cultural-common topics.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the task of Cultural-common Topic Detection (CTD) on mul- tilingual news reader comments. Reader com- ments about a global event, written in different languages, from different news websites around the world exist in massive amount. The main goal of this task is to discover cultural-common dis- cussion topics from raw multilingual news reader comments for a news event. One challenge is that the discussion topics are unknown. Another chal- lenge is related to the language gap issue. Pre- cisely, the words of reader comments in different languages are composed of different terms in their corresponding languages. Such language gap is- sue poses a great deal of challenge for identifying cultural-common discussion topics in multilingual news comments settings.</p><p>One recent work done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Prasojo et al. (2015)</ref> is to organize news reader comments around entities and aspects discussed by readers. Such organiza- tion of reader comments cannot handle the iden- tification of common discussion topics. On the other hand, the Muto model proposed by Boyd- Graber and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blei (2009)</ref> can extract common top- ics from multilingual documents. This model merely outputs cross-lingual topics of matching word pairs. One example of such kind of topic contains key terms of word pairs such as "plane: ocean: . . . ". The assumption of one-to- one mapping of words has some drawbacks. One drawback is that the correspondence of identi- fied common topics is restricted to the vocabu- lary level. Another drawback is that the one-to- one mapping of words cannot fit the original word occurrences well. For example, the English term "plane" appears in the English documents fre- quently while the Chinese translation "" ap- pears less. It is not reasonable that "plane" and " " share the same probability mass in common topics. Another closely related existing work is the PCLSA model proposed by . PCLSA employs a mixture of English words and Chinese words to represent common topics. It incorporates bilingual constraints into the Proba- bilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hofmann, 2001)</ref> and assumes that word pairs in the dictionary share similar probability in a com- mon topic. However, similar to one-to-one map- ping of words, such bilingual constraints cannot handle well the original word co-occurrence in each language resulting in a degradation of the co- herence and interpretability of common topics.</p><p>We propose a new probabilistic graphical model which is able to detect cultural-common topics from multilingual news reader comments in an un- supervised manner. In principle, no labeled data is needed. In this paper, we focus on dealing with two languages, namely, English and Chinese news reader comments. Different from prior works, we design a technique based on auxiliary distributions which incorporates word distributions from the other language and can capture the common se- mantics on the topic level. We develop a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler which decouples the in- ference of topic distribution and word distribution. We also incorporate the term translation relation- ship, derived from a bilingual dictionary, into the detection of cultural-common topics for model pa- rameter learning.</p><p>We have prepared a data set by collecting En- glish and Chinese reader comments from differ- ent regions reflecting different culture. Our exper- imental results are encouraging showing improve- ments over the state-of-the-art model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Prasojo et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Biyani et al. (2015)</ref> or- ganized news reader comments via identified en- tities or aspects. Such kind of organization via entities or aspects cannot capture common topics discussed by readers. Digesting merely based on entities fails to work in multilingual settings due to the fact that the common entities have distinct mentions in different languages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhai et al. (2004)</ref> discovered common topics from comparable texts via a PLSA based mixture model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Paul and Girju (2009)</ref> proposed a Mixed- Collection Topic Model for finding common top- ics from different collections. Despite the fact that the above models can find a kind of common topic, they only deal with a single language setting with- out considering the language gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Some works discover common latent topics from multilingual corpora. For aligned corpora, they assume that the topic distribution in each doc- ument is the same <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Vuli´cVuli´c et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vuli´cVuli´c and Moens, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Erosheva et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fukumasu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mimno et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ni et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Peng et al., 2014</ref>). However, aligned corpora are often unavailable for most domains. For unaligned corpora, cross-lingual topic models use some language resources, such as a bilingual dictionary or a bilingual knowledge base to bridge the language gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jagarlamudi and Daumé III, 2010)</ref>. As mentioned above, the goals of Boyd- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Graber and Blei (2009)</ref> as well as <ref type="bibr">Jagarlamud and Daumé (2010)</ref> focus on mining the corre- spondence of topics at the vocabulary level, which are different from that of  and ours. The model in  adds the constraints of word translation pairs into PLSA. These constraints cannot handle the original word co-occurrences well. In contrast, we consider the language gap by incorporating word distributions from the other language, capturing the common semantics on the topic level. Moreover, we use a fully Bayesian paradigm with a prior distribution.</p><p>Some existing topic methods conduct cross- lingual sentiment analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Guo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boyd-Graber and Resnik, 2010</ref>). These models are not suitable for our CTD task because they mainly detect com- mon elements related to product aspects. More- over some works focus more on detecting senti- ments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our Proposed Model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model Description</head><p>The problem definition of the CTD task is de- scribed as follows. For a particular event, both English and Chinese news reader comments are collected from different regions reflecting differ- ent culture. The set of English comments is de- noted by E and the set of Chinese comments is de- noted by C. The goal of the CTD task is to extract cultural-common topics k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K} from E and C. The set of multilingual news reader com- ments of each event are processed within the same event.</p><p>Our proposed model is called Multilingual Cultural-common Topic Analysis (MCTA) which is based on graphical model paradigm as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The plate on the right represents cultural-common topics. Each cultural-common topic k is represented by an English word distri- bution ϕ e k over English vocabulary Λ e and a Chi- nese word distribution ϕ c k over Chinese vocabu- lary Λ c . We make use of a bilingual dictionary, which is composed of many-to-many word trans- lations among English and Chinese words. To capture common semantics of multilingual news reader comments, we design two auxiliary distri- </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ϕ e k ∝ λ(η c k ) T M c→e + (1 − λ)η e k where η e , η c ∼ Dir(β)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where λ ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter which balances the nature of original topics and transferred infor- mation from the other language. M c→e is a map-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ping |Λ c | × |Λ e | matrix from Λ c to Λ e . Each ele- ment M c→e ij</formula><p>is the mapping occurrence probability of the English term w e j given the Chinese term w c i in the set of news reader comments. This proba- bility is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M c→e ij = C(w e j ) + 1 |T (w c i )| + w e ∈T (w c i ) C(w e )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where C(w e j ) is the count of w e j in all news reader comments and T (w c i ) is the set of English transla- tions of w c i found in the bilingual dictionary. The "add-one" smoothing is adopted. Note that the sum of each row is equal to 1. Using the same principle, we can derive ϕ c k which can be formu- lated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ϕ c k ∝ λ(η e k ) T M e→c + (1 − λ)η c k where η e , η c ∼ Dir(β)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>As a result, the incorporation of η e k and η c k on the topic level encourages the word distribution ϕ e k and ϕ c k to share common semantic components of reader comments in different languages.</p><p>The upper left plate in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> represents En- glish reader comments. N e d denotes the num- ber of English reader comments and N e dw denotes the number of words in the English comment d e . Each English reader comment d e is characterized by a K-dimensional topic membership vector θ e d , which is assumed to be generated by the prior Dir(α · 1 K ). For each word w e n in an English comment d e , we generate the topic z n e from θ e d . We generate the word w e n from the corresponding distribution ϕ e k . The bottom left plate in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> represents Chi- nese reader comments. Similarly, we generate the topic distribution θ c d from the prior Dir(α · 1 K ). The topic z n c of each word w c n in a Chinese com- ment d c is generated from θ c d . We generate word w c n from the corresponding distribution ϕ c k . The generative process is formally depicted as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">• For each topic k ∈ K -choose auxiliary distributions η e k ∼ Dir(β· 1 |Λ e | ) and η c k ∼ Dir(β · 1 |Λ c | ) -choose English word distribution ϕ e</formula><p>k and ϕ c k using Eq. 1 and Eq. 3 respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">• For each English comment d e ∈ E, choose θ e d ∼ Dir(α · 1 K ) -For each position n in d e -draw z e n ∼ Multi(θ e d ) -draw w e n ∼ Multi(ϕ e k ) • For each Chinese comment d c ∈ C, choose θ c d ∼ Dir(α · 1 K ) -For each position n in d c -draw z c n ∼ Multi(θ c d ) -draw w c n ∼ Multi(ϕ c k )</formula><p>Note that for simplicity, we present our model on the bilingual setting of Chinese and English. It can be extended to multilingual setting via introduc- ing auxiliary distributions for each language. Each topic word distribution for each language is gener- ated by the convex combination of all the auxiliary distributions.</p></div>

Then we translate Chinese topics into English topics and use symmetric KL divergence to align translated Chinese topics with original En- glish topics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experiment Settings</head><p>For each event, we partitioned the comments into a subset of 90% for the graphical model param- eter estimation. The remaining 10% is used as a holdout data for the evaluation of the CCP met- ric as discussed in Section 4.4.1. We repeated the runs five times. For each run, we randomly split the comments to obtain the holdout data. As a re- sult, we have five runs for our method as well as comparative methods. We make use of the hold- out data of one event, namely the event "MH370 Flight Accident", to estimate the number of top- ics K for all models and λ in Eq. 1 for our model. The setting of K is described in Section 4.4.3. We set λ = 0.5 after tuning. For hyper-parameters, we set α to 0.5 and β to 0.01. When performing our Gibbs algorithm, we set the maximum itera- tion number as 1000, and the burn-in sweeps as 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Cultural-common Topic Evaluation</head><p>We conduct quantitative experiments to evaluate how well our MCTA model can discover cultural- common topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>We use two metrics to evaluate the topic quality. The first metric is the "cross-collection perplex- ity" measure denoted as CCP which is similar to the one used in . The CCP of high quality cultural-common topics should be lower than those topics which are not shared by the English and Chinese reader comments. The calcu- lation of CCP consists of two steps: 1) For each k ∈ K, we translate ϕ e k into Chinese word distri- bution T (ϕ e k ) and translate ϕ c k English word dis- tribution T (ϕ c k ). To translate ϕ e k and ϕ c k , we look up the bilingual dictionary and conduct word-to- word translation. If one word has several trans- lations, we distribute its probability mass equally to each English translation. 2) We use T (ϕ e k ) to fit the holdout Chinese comments C and T (ϕ c k ) to fit the holdout English comments E using Eq. 13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blei et al., 2003)</ref>. Eq. 13 depicts the calculation of CCP. The lower the CCP value is, the better the performance is.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">CCP = 1 2 exp{− d∈E w∈d k∈K log p(k|θ d )p(w|T (ϕ c k )) d∈E N e d }+ 1 2 exp{− d∈C w∈d k∈K log p(k|θ d )p(w|T (ϕ e k )) d∈C N c d } (13)</formula><p>For each detected common topic, we wish to evaluate the degree of commonality. We de- sign another metric called "topic commonality dis- tance" denoted by TCD. We first evaluate the KL- divergence between the English topic and trans- lated Chinese topic. We also evaluate the KL- divergence between the Chinese topic and trans- lated English topic. Then TCD is computed as the average sum of the two KL-divergences. The lower the TCD measure is, the better the topic is.  The topic detected by PCLSA is a mixture of English and Chinese words. We obtain English representation and Chinese representation of the topic by the conditional probabilities as given in Eq. 14.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p(w e |ϕ e k ) = p(w e |ϕ k ) w∈Λ e p(w|ϕ k ) p(w c |ϕ c k ) = p(w c |ϕ k ) w∈Λ c p(w|ϕ k )<label>(14)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Experimental Results</head><p>The average CCP values of the three models are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. Our MCTA model achieves the best performance compared with PCLSA and LDA. Both MCTA and PCLSA achieve a better CCP than LDA because they can bridge the lan- guage gap in the multilingual news reader com- ments to some extent. Compared with PCLSA, our MCTA model demonstrates a 4.2% improve- ment. Our MCTA model provides a better char- acterization of the collections. One reason is that our MCTA model learns the word distribution of cultural-common topics using an effective topic modeling with a prior Dirichlet distribution. It is similar to the advantage of LDA over PLSA. Moreover, the bilingual constraints in PCLSA can- not handle the original natural word co-occurrence well in each language. In contrast, MCTA rep- resents cultural-common topics as a mixture of the original topics and the translated topics, which capture the comment semantics more effectively. The average TCD of three models are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Our MCTA outperforms the two compar- ative methods.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Determining Number of Topics</head><p>As mentioned in Section 4.3, we use the hold- out data of one event to determine K. For each λ ∈ {0.2, 0.5, 0.8}, we vary K in the range of <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">200]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> depicts the effect of K on the cross-collection perplexity as measured by CCP. We can see that CCP decreases with the increase of the number of topics. Moreover, through man- ual inspection we observed that when K is 30 or more, even though CCP decreases, the topics will be repeated. Similar observations for the number of topics can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Paul and Girju (2009)</ref>. Therefore, we set K = 30. We can also see that our model is not very sensitive to the balance pa- rameter λ.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Topic Coherence Evaluation</head><p>We also evaluate the coherence of topics gener- ated by PCLSA and MCTA, which indicates the interpretability of topics. Following Newman et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2010)</ref>, we use a pointwise mutual information (PMI) score to measure the topic coherence. We compute the average PMI score of top 20 topic word pairs using Eq. 15. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Newman et al. (2010)</ref> observed that it is important to use an external data set to evaluate PMI. Therefore, we use a 20- word sliding window in Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Shaoul, 2010)</ref> to identify the co-occurrence of word pairs.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P M I(w i , w j ) = log P (w i , w j ) P (w i )P (w j ) (15)</formula><p>The experimental results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. We can see that our MCTA model generally improves the coherence of the learned topics compared with PCLSA. The word-to-word bilingual constraints in PCLSA are not as effective. On the other hand, our MTCA model incorporates the bilingual trans- lations using auxiliary distributions which incor- porate word distributions from the other language on the topic level and can capture common seman- tics of multilingual reader comments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Application and Case Study</head><p>We present an application for news comment di- gest and show some examples of detected cultural- common discussion topics in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. Under each event, the system can group reader comments into cultural-common discussion topics which can cap- ture common concerns of readers in different lan- guages. For each common topic, it shows top ranked words and corresponding reader comments</p></div>

Considering the event "MH370 Flight accident", it shows two of the de- tected cultural-common topics. The first one in- dicates that readers pray for the family in the ac- cident and the second one is related to the search of the crashed plane. For the common topic about praying for the family, we can see that the top- ics contain both English words and Chinese words which are very relevant and share common se- mantics of "family" and "hope". Moreover, the corresponding English and Chinese reader com- ments, both of which mention the family in the ac- cident, illustrate a high coherent common discus- sion topic. Similarly for the second common topic, there are common semantics between English and Chinese top ranked words about the search of the crashed plane. Some of the English comments and Chinese comments mention the query of the posi- tion of the crashed plane. Interesting common top- ics are also generated for other events, such as the common topic of religion for the event "ISIS in Iraq" and the topic of economic organization for the event "AIIB foundation".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We investigate the task of cultural-common dis- cussion topic detection from multilingual news reader comments. To tackle the task, we develop a new model called MCTA which can cope with the language gap and extract coherent cultural- common topics from multilingual news reader comments. We also develop a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler which incorporates the term trans- lation relationship into the detection of cultural- common topics effectively for model parameter learning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Our proposed graphical model</figDesc></figure>
