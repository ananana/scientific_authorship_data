				<p>This tutorial surveys neural approaches to conversational AI that were developed in the last few years. We group conversational systems into three categories: (1) question answering agents, (2) task-oriented dialogue agents, and (3) social bots. For each category, we present a review of state-of-the-art neural approaches , draw the connection between neural approaches and traditional symbolic approaches, and discuss the progress we have made and challenges we are facing , using specific systems and models as case studies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Motivation and objectives</head><p>Developing an intelligent dialogue system that not only emulates human conversation, but also can answer questions of topics ranging from latest news of a movie star to Einstein's theory of rela- tivity, and fulfill complex tasks such as travel plan- ning, has been one of the longest running goals in AI. The goal remains elusive until recently when we started observing promising results in both the research community and industry as the large amount of conversation data is available for train- ing and the breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) are applied to conversational AI.</p><p>This tutorial presents a review of state of the art neural approaches to conversational AI that were developed in the last few years, draws the con- nection between neural approaches and traditional symbolic approaches, and discusses the progress we have made and challenges we are facing, using specific systems and models as case studies.</p><p>This tutorial is a valuable resource for students, researchers, and the software developers, provid- ing a detailed presentation of the important ideas and insights needed to understand and create mod- ern dialogue agents that are instrumental to mak- ing the world knowledge and services accessible to millions of users in the most natural way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The tutorial</head><p>In this tutorial, we start with a brief introduction to the recent progress on DL and RL that is re- lated to natural language processing (NLP), infor- mation retrieval (IR) and conversational AI. Then, we describe in detail the state-of-the-art neural ap- proaches developed for three types of dialogue systems. The first is a question answering (QA) agent. Equipped with rich knowledge drawn from various data sources including Web documents and pre-complied knowledge graphs (KG's), the QA agent can provide concise direct answers to user queries. The second is a task-oriented dia- logue system that can help users accomplish tasks ranging from meeting scheduling to vacation plan- ning. The third is a social chat bot which can con- verse seamlessly and appropriately with humans, and often plays roles of a chat companion and a recommender. In the final part of the tutorial, we review attempts to developing open-domain con- versational AI systems that combine the strengths of different types of dialogue systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">A Unified View: Dialogue as Optimal Decision Making</head><p>The example dialogue presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> can be formulated as a sequential decision making pro- cess. It has a natural hierarchy: a top-level process selects what agent to activate for a particular sub- task (e.g., answer a question, schedule a meeting, give a recommendation or just have a chat etc.), and a low level process, perform by the selected agent, chooses primitive actions to complete the subtask.</p><p>usr: Where are sales lagging behind our forecast? agt: The worst region is <ref type="bibr">[country]</ref>, where sales are 15% below projections. usr: Do you know why? agt: The forecast for <ref type="bibr">[product]</ref> growth was overly optimistic. usr: How can we turn this around?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>agt:</head><p>Here are the 10 customers in <ref type="bibr">[country]</ref> with the most growth potential, per our CRM model. usr: Can you set up a meeting with the CTO of <ref type="bibr">[company]</ref>?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>agt:</head><p>Yes, I've set up a meeting with [person name] for next month when you are in <ref type="bibr">[location]</ref>. usr: Thanks. Such hierarchical decision making processes can be formulated in the mathematical frame- work of options over Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sutton et al., 1999</ref>), where options gen- eralize primitive actions to higher-level actions. This is an extension to the traditional MDP set- ting where an agent can only choose a primitive action at each time step, with options the agent can choose a multi-step action which for example could be a sequence of primitive actions for com- pleting a subtask.</p><p>If we view each option as an action, both top- level and low-level processes can be naturally mapped to the reinforcement learning (RL) frame- work as follows. The dialogue agent navigates a MDP, interacting with its environment over a se- quence of discrete steps. At step, the agent ob- serves the current state, and chooses an action a according to a policy. The agent then receives re- ward and observe a new state, continuing the cycle until the episode terminates. The goal of dialogue learning is to find optimal policies to maximize ex- pected rewards. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> summarizes all dialogue agents using a unified view of RL.</p><p>Although RL provides a unified machine learn- ing (ML) framework for building dialogue agents, applying RL requires training a dialogue agent by interacting with real users, which can be very expensive for many domains. Thus, in practice we often use RL together with supervised learn- ing especially in the cases where there is a large amount of human-human conversational data. In the rest of the tutorial, we will survey these ML approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Question Answering and Machine Reading Comprehension</head><p>Recent years have witnessed an increasing de- mand for question answering (QA) dialogue agents that allow users to query large scale knowl- edge bases (KB) or document collections via nat- ural language. The former is known as KB-QA agents and the latter text-QA agents. KB-QA agents are superior to traditional SQL-like systems in that users can query a KB interactively without composing complicated SQL-like queries. Text- QA agents are superior to traditional search en- gines, such as Bing and Google, in that they pro- vide concise direct answers to user queries. In this part, we start with a review of tradi- tional symbolic approaches to KB-QA based on semantic parsing. We show that a symbolic system is hard to scale because the keyword-matching- based inference used by the system is inefficient for a big KB, and is not robust to paraphrasing. To address these issues, neural approaches are devel- oped to represent queries and KB using continuous semantic vectors so that the inference can be per- formed at the semantic level in a compacted neu- ral space. We use ReasoNet with shared memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Shen et al., 2017)</ref> as an example to illustrate the implementation details. We also review different dialogue policies for multi-turn KB-QA agents.</p><p>We then discuss neural text-QA agents. The heart of such systems is a neural Machine Read- ing Comprehension (MRC) model that generates an answer to an input query based on a set of pas- sages. After reviewing popular MRC datasets, we describe the technologies developed for state-of- the-art MRC models in two dimensions: (1) the methods of encoding query and passages as vec- tors in a neural space, and (2) the methods of per- forming inference in the neural space to generate the answer.</p><p>We end this section by outlining our effort of turning Microsoft Bing from a Web search engine into an open-domain QA engine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems</head><p>In this part, we first introduce the architecture of a typical task-oriented dialogue system. It consists of <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>   We describe state-of-the-art approaches in two frontiers. The first is end-to-end (E2E) learning where these modules are implemented using dif- ferentiable models like neural networks, so that they can be jointly optimized from user feedback signals using backpropagation and RL. The sec- ond is the use of advanced RL techniques to opti- mize dialogue policies in more complex scenarios. Examples include improved efficiency of explo- ration for faster learning, and hierarchical problem solving for composite-task dialogues where the re- ward signal is particularly sparse. We review sev- eral recent proposals, including the ones based on Bayesian models, curiosity-driven strategy, hier- archical reinforcement learning, adversarial learn- ing, and the Dyna framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Sutton, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Peng et al., 2018</ref>) to integrate planning and learning, etc.</p><p>We end this section by presenting a few exam- ple task-oriented systems from some of the lead- ing players in the industry, including Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Fully Data-Driven Conversation Models and Social Bots</head><p>Social bots (also known as chatbots) are of grow- ing importance in facilitating smooth interaction between humans and their electronic devices. Re- cently, researchers have begun to explore fully data-driven generation of conversational responses within the framework of neural machine transla- tion (NMT) in the form of encoder-decoder or seq2seq models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sordoni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Vinyals and Le, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Serban et al., 2016)</ref>. Such end-to-end models have been particularly successful with so- cial bot scenarios, as they require little interac- tion with the user's environment (no need for API calls) and such models cope well with free-form and open domain texts. However, neural responses are often too gen- eral to carry meaningful information, e.g., with the common response "I don't know" which can serve as a reply to most user questions. A mutual in- formation model is proposed by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Li et al., 2016a)</ref>, and is later improved by using deep reinforce- ment learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2016c</ref>). Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Li et al.(Li et al., 2016b</ref>) presented a persona-based model to address the issue of speaker consistency in neural response generation.</p><p>Although task-oriented dialogue systems and social bots are originally developed for different purposes, there is a trend of combining both as a step towards building an open-domain dialogue agent. For example, on the one hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ghazvininejad et al., 2018</ref>) presented a fully data-driven and knowledge-grounded neural conversation model aimed at producing more contentful responses without slot filling. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zhao et al. (Zhao et al., 2017)</ref> proposed a task-oriented dia- logue agent based on the encoder-decoder model with chatting capability. These works represent steps toward end-to-end dialogue systems that are useful in scenarios beyond chitchat.</p><p>We end this section by presenting a few exam- ples of chatbots that have been made available to the public, including Microsoft's XiaoIce, Replika and Alexa Prize systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Contributions and related tutorials</head><p>Conversational AI, which aims to develop in- telligent agents for QA, social chat and task- completion, as presented in this tutorial, is a rapidly growing field. Recently, there have been related tutorial and survey papers on deep learn- ing and dialogue systems. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Yih et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Yih et al., , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gao, 2017)</ref> reviewed deep learning approaches to a wide range of NLP and IR tasks, including dia- logue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chen et al., 2017b</ref>) is a recent tutorial on dialogue mainly focusing on task-oriented agents. <ref type="figure">(Serban et al., 2015)</ref> gave a good survey of pub- lic dialogue datasets that can used to develop dia- logue agents. <ref type="figure">(Chen et al., 2017a</ref>) reviewed popu- lar deep neural network models for dialogue, fo- cusing only on supervised learning approaches. This tutorial expands the scope of (Chen et al., 2017a) and ( <ref type="bibr">Serban et al., 2015</ref>) by going beyond data and supervised learning.</p><p>The contributions of this tutorial include:</p><p>1. We provide a comprehensive survey on neu- ral approaches to conversational AI that were developed in the last few years, covering QA, task-oriented and social bots with a unified view of optimal decision making.</p><p>2. We draw connections between modern neu- ral approaches and traditional symbolic ap- proaches, allowing us to better understand why and how the research has been evolved and shed light on how we move forward.</p><p>3. We present state-of-the-art approaches to training dialogue agents using both super- vised learning and reinforcement learning methods.</p><p>4. We picture the landscape of conversational systems developed in research communities and released in industry, demonstrating via case studies the progress we have made and the challenges we are facing.</p></div>

(3) a dialogue policy which selects the next action 
based on the current state; and (4) a natural lan-
guage generator (NLG) for converting the agent 
action to a natural language response. While tra-
ditionally these modules are often implemented 
and optimized individually using statistical mod-
