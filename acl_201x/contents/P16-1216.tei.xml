				<p>Anaphor resolution is an important task in NLP with many applications. Despite much research effort, it remains an open problem. The difficulty of the problem varies substantially across different sub-problems. One sub-problem, in particular , has been largely untouched by prior work despite occurring frequently throughout corpora: the anaphor that has multiple antecedents, which here we call multi-antecedent anaphors or m-anaphors. Current coreference resolvers restrict anaphors to at most a single antecedent. As we show in this paper, relaxing this constraint poses serious problems in coreference chain-building, where each chain is intended to refer to a single entity. This work provides a formaliza-tion of the new task with preliminary insights into multi-antecedent noun-phrase anaphors, and offers a method for resolving such cases that outperforms a number of baseline methods by a significant margin. Our system uses local agglomerative clustering on candidate antecedents and an existing coreference system to score clusters to determine which cluster of mentions is antecedent for a given anaphor. When we augment an existing coreference system with our proposed method, we observe a substantial increase in performance (0.6 absolute CoNLL F1) on an annotated corpus.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Anaphor resolution is a very difficult task in Nat- ural Language Understanding, involving the com- plex interaction of discourse cues, syntactic rules, and semantic phenomena. It is closely related to the task of coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Van Deemter and Kibble, 2000</ref>), for which a myriad of solu- tions have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clark and Manning, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wiseman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Björkelund and Farkas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stoyanov et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ng, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bergsma and Lin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Soon et al., 2001</ref>). However, given the complexity of the problem, a comprehensive approach remains elusive. The difficulty varies drastically across different cases (proper nouns, pronouns, gerunds, etc.), each of which involves different assumptions about and models of vari- ous linguistic phenomena (e.g., vocabulary, syn- tax, and semantics). As a result, state-of-the- art systems yield varying performance across sub- problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mitkov, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kummerfeld and Klein, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Björkelund and Nugues, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Recasens and Hovy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stoyanov et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bengtson and Roth, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Van Deemter and Kibble, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ng and Cardie, 2002b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kameyama, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>To avoid the complexity of the overarching res- olution task, many current systems -whether learning-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clark and Manning, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wiseman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Durrett and Klein, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Björkelund and Farkas, 2012</ref>) or rule-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., 2011</ref>) -focus on a restricted ver- sion of the problem, where candidate anaphors are linked to at most one antecedent, from which coreference chains are built by propagating the in- duced equivalence relation, with each chain cor- responding to an entity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Van Deemter and Kibble, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>While this single-antecedent inference task does resolve a very large number of anaphors in any given text, it leaves one quite common sub- problem virtually untouched: anaphors that link to multiple antecedents. These have sometimes been called split-antecedent anaphors; here we use the term multi-antecedent anaphors or m-anaphors in order to emphasize the existence of more than one (possibly more than two) antecedents for a given anaphor. Consider the following examples:</p><p>(1) <ref type="bibr">[Elizabeth]</ref> 1 met <ref type="bibr">[Mary]</ref> 2 at the park and</p><p>[they] 1,2 began their stroll to the river.</p><p>(2) Mrs. Dashwood, having moved to another country, saw her <ref type="bibr">[mother]</ref> 1 and [sister-in- law] 2 demoted to occasional visitors. As such, however, her old [kin] 1,2 were treated by her new family with quiet civility.</p><p>Such cases present a challenge to state-of-the- art methods: certain features well-suited for the single-antecedent case do not apply (e.g. gender and pluarity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Recasens and Hovy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stoyanov et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bergsma and Lin, 2006</ref>), and strong long-distance effects cannot be ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ingria and Stallard, 1989)</ref>. Moreover, the presence of multi- ple antecedents for a single anaphor violates the separation between coreference chains.</p><p>In this paper, we address the multi-antecedent case of noun-phrase (NP) anaphor resolution in English, the most widely understood and studied form of coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ng, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ng, 2008)</ref>. While we frame the general question of multi-antecedent inference, we restrict our analy- ses to one particular sub-problem: resolving the antecedents of the pronouns they and them. These pronouns best isolate the characteristics of m- anaphors (see Section 2 for more on the motivation of this choice). We propose a system for resolving they and them that models grouping compatibility of mentions through a maximum entropy pairwise model, independently from coreference of group- ings, which is handled through an existing coref- erence resolution system leveraging corpus knowl- edge.</p><p>This paper makes four core contributions. First, it provides a generalization of the anaphor reso- lution problem to permit linking to multiple an- tecedents. Second, we characterize core properties of m-anaphors and their linguistic environments in a large, annotated corpus. Third, we provide a entity-centric system for specifically resolving multi-antecedent cases that outperforms a number of baselines. And, finally, we show how to pair our system with an existing coreference system and show a gain of 0.6 points (CoNLL F1) on the complete coreference resolution task (resolving all anaphors, single-and multi-antecedent).</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We introduce the terminology and problem state- ment for split-antecedent resolution in Section 2. A summary of the data is given in Section 3 and the behaviour of split-antecedent anaphors is an- alyzed in Section 4. Our approach to antecedent prediction is presented in Section 5 and the results and analysis are reported in Section 6. Finally, we review related work in Section 7 and conclude and discuss future work in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Problem</head><p>This section establishes the terminology used throughout the paper and reformulates the anaphor resolution problem to incorporate linking to mul- tiple antecedents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Terminology</head><p>We introduce the term m-anaphor for convenience as a special case of anaphor that has to multiple antecedents. For example, they and kin in Exam- ples (1) and (2), respectively, from the Introduc- tion are m-anaphors. By extension, 1-anaphors are anaphors that have only one antecedent.</p><p>Similarly, we define an m-antecedent as one of multiple antecedents of an m-anaphor and we re- fer to m-antecedents with the same m-anaphor as siblings. In Example (1) from the Introduction, Elizabeth and Mary are sibling m-antecedents of they, and in Example (2), mother and sister-in-law are sibling m-antecedents of kin.</p><p>Finally, we refer to anaphors with two, three, and four m-antecedents as 2-anaphors, 3- anaphors, and 4-anaphors, respectively. We pro- vide two more examples: (3) [Mr. Holmes] 1 stared off into the distance.</p><p>[Watson] 2 simply walked off.</p><p>[Both] 1,2 were troubled by the news. The anaphor in Example (3) is a 2-anaphor and the anaphor in Example (4) is a 3-anaphor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Definition</head><p>We define the NP anaphor resolution problem sim- ilar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wiseman et al. (2015)</ref>, Durrett and Klein Pronoun # m-anaphors they 278 them 165 we 140 you 43 everybody 12 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Counts of the most frequent m-anaphoric pronouns in P&amp;P.</p><p>(2013), and Hirschman (1997): Let M denote the set of all identified mentions in a document and let M (x) ⊆ M denote all mentions preceding a men- tion x ∈ M. The objective of the task is, for each x ∈ M, to find C ⊆ M (x) such that all mentions in C are antecedent to x. If C = ∅, then x is non- anaphoric and if |C| ≥ 1, then x is 1-anaphoric, and if |C| &gt; 1, then x is m-anaphoric. Hence, this formulation generalizes the problem to account for multi-antecedent anaphors.</p><p>To constrain the scope of the study, we perform all our analyses on gold mentions, leaving the effect of imperfect mention detection as a prob- lem for future work (this has been studied for the single-antecedent case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stoyanov et al. (2009)</ref>). Moreover, we only consider mentions of they and them that are known to be m-anaphoric for three reasons. First, non-pronomial m-anaphors, i.e. proper and common nouns, are much more sus- ceptible to long-distance effects and may require external knowledge to resolve. Second, by focus- ing on this case, we circumvent a host of very in- volved aspects of the complete m-anaphor resolu- tion problem, i.e. determining whether a mention is m-anaphoric, 1-anaphoric, or not anaphoric at all. For example, you may refer to one person or multiple, who can be used as an interrogative (non-anaphoric) or reflexive pronoun (anaphoric)), pronouns such as anyone and everyone introduce many scoping difficulties, and pleonastic pronouns must be removed from the inference task entirely. Third, they and them are the most prevalent of all pronouns in our dataset (refer to <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Our dataset comprises of the Pride and Prejudice novel (P&amp;P) (121440 words) and 36 short sto- ries from the Scribner Anthology of Contemporary Short Fiction (Martone et al., 1999) (Scribner) (to- tal of 216901 words), representing an eclectic col- lection of stories from the modern era. For P&amp;P,  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Number of m-anaphoric they and them mentions and % of all they and them mentions that are m-anaphors.</p><p>all mentions of character have been fully resolved to their antecedents, including mentions referenc- ing multiple characters. For Scribner, all mentions of they and them are resolved (m-anaphoric, 1- anaphoric, and singleton), including those of non- person entities. These stories were annotated by three annota- tors according to a slightly modified version of the ACE coreference resolution task formulation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Doddington et al., 2004</ref>) to allow multiple an- tecedents. Annotations were conducted through the brat 1 annotation tool ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Stenetorp et al., 2012)</ref>) and the inter-annotator agreement on the shared texts (3 stories from Scribner + 7 chapters from P&amp;P) was 86.5%.</p><p>Overall, in P&amp;P, 1289 m-anaphors were discov- ered, of which 34 (2.6%) were proper nouns, 536 (41.6%) were common nouns, and 719 (55.8%) were pronouns. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the number of gold m-anaphoric they and them mentions and the per- centage of all they and them mentions that are m- anaphoric.</p><p>Literary works were chosen over other tex- tual modalities, e.g. news articles, because they showed a higher density of m-anaphors (a pre- liminary annotation exercise showed that liter- ary works contained 37% more m-anaphors per word).</p><p>The dataset is partitioned according to a roughly, 60/20/20 split into training, validation, and testing sets, where the split is applied to the text of P&amp;P (e.g. the first 60% of story text is used for training), and the collection of Scribner stories (e.g. 60% of the stories were used for training).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Behaviour of m-anaphors</head><p>m-anaphors present a novel class of anaphor for which very little knowledge exists. To better un- derstand the linguistic behaviour of m-anaphors, we perform the following analyses. First, we examine first and second order statistics of our First Second Avg. distance (# words) 17.08 33.50 Std. distance (# words) 23.80 40.66 Avg. distance (# sent.) 1. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> 2.28 Std. distance (# sent.) 3.18 5.10 Avg. # intermediates 1.44 4.21 Std. # intermediates 2.33 4.44 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Average and standard deviations of the word distance, sentence distance, and number of intermediate mentions between the first and sec- ond most recent mentions to an m-anaphor.</p><p>dataset to gain insight into the distribution of m- anaphors across a number of dimensions. Sec- ond, we fit a maximum entropy model over com- mon coreference features for distinguishing m- anaphoric and anaphoric mentions to evaluate the importance of various features in determining m- anaphoricity versus anaphoricity of mentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">m-anaphor Statistics</head><p>The distribution of m-anaphors according to the number of referenced m−antecedents is as fol- lows: 79.3% are 2-anaphors, 13.2% are 3- anaphors, 3.7% are 4-anaphors, and the remain- ing 3.8% refer to larger numbers of antecedents. Despite the bias towards 2-anaphors, the sim- ple approach to m-anaphor resolution of taking the previous two mentions as m-antecedent sib- lings will fail according to <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The usual presence of intermediate mentions between m- anaphors and their m-antecedents makes the res- olution task non-trivial. Moreover, the large dis- tances between m-anaphors and their antecedents attenuates any signal for coreference, introducing greater noise to the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">m-anaphoricity Features</head><p>The statistics discussed above shed light on the complexity of this problem. Here, we examine whether certain surface-level features of anaphoric phenomena from prior work exhibit any differ- ences for m-anaphoric mentions over anaphoric ones. We construct a maximum entropy model from the training data over the combination of syn- tactic and semantic features in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>: Features for m-anaphoricity versus 1- anaphoricity with coefficients estimated from a maximum entropy model, and associated p-values.</p><p>are positive favor m-anaphoricity and those that are negative favor 1-anaphoricity. Except for the feature testing on the last sen- tence position, none of the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> were able to reach statistical significance, suggesting at a surface level, m-anaphoricity and 1-anaphoricity behave very similarly and operate in similar lin- guistic environments. One possibility is that a deeper set of features is required for distinguish- ing m-anaphors from 1-anaphors. We identify this as an important topic for future work in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">m-anaphor Resolution</head><p>Our approach to m-anaphor resolution draws in- spiration from mention pair models for corefer- ence that make independent binary classification decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ng, 2010)</ref>. In our method, we em- ploy a maximum entropy model that makes binary decisions on mention pairs as well, but the deci- sion corresponds to "group compatibility" of men- tions, i.e. to what degree can a given set of men- tions be the sibling m-antecedents to the same m- anaphor. This model is embedded in an agglomer- ative clustering process, after which a coreference decision is made between clusters and the given m-anaphor. Thus, our model treats the grouping of candidate mentions into sibling sets independently from antecedent-anaphor linking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Architecture</head><p>Given an m-anaphor g in document D, the steps of our approach are as follows:</p><p>1. Mentions preceding g within a k-sentence window are extracted as candidate m- antecedents to g.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Perform an agglomerative clustering of the candidate mentions using similarity metric SIM 1 and average-linkage criteria. Let C represent the clustering.</p><p>3. Each non-singleton cluster C ∈ C is scored according to the probability of coreference of the m-anaphor to the cluster. This is done by appealing to an external corpus compris- ing of sentences containing either they or them. The grouping of sentences in the doc- ument containing all of the mentions in C (and sentences in-between) are compared to each they or them sentence in the external corpus (depending on the identity of g) using similarity metric SIM 2 . The sentence yield- ing the maximum similarity is selected. The probability of coreference is then calculated by replacing the sentence grouping with the extracted sentence and applying an existing coreference system COREF between g and its counterpart (they or them) in the extracted sentence.</p><p>4. The cluster C max producing the highest prob- ability of coreference is predicted as the group of m-antecedents for g.</p><p>Again, inspired by mention-pair models for coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clark and Manning, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Björkelund and Farkas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ng and Cardie, 2002a</ref>), the SIM 1 similarity metric is defined as σ(w x), where w is a weight vector and x is a feature vector defined for a pair of mentions. The parameter vector w is learned using the standard cross-entropy loss function in a maximum entropy model, where the target variable is a decision on whether the mentions pairs are siblings or not. The learning is conducted over the training set with L2- regularization.</p><p>For SIM 2 , which is responsible for selecting replacement sentences, we experiment with two different similarity metrics: (1) longest common subsequence normalized by sentence length (LCS) and (2) a subset tree kernel ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collins and Duffy, 2002</ref>) with a bag-of-words extension as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moschitti (2006)</ref>, which also describes a sim- ple adaptation to forests (for multiple sentences). The named entity (NE) mentions in sentences are replaced by corresponding NE type placehold- ers (PERSON, LOCATION, etc. as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Finkel et al. (2005)</ref>) before comparison.</p><p>In the experiments to follow, we adopt the clas- sification mention-pair model, a component of the statistical coreference resolution system available in the Stanford CoreNLP suite 2 system, described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clark and Manning (2015)</ref>, as COREF for scoring coreference. The external corpus was built from texts comparable to our dataset. 651,108 sen- tences containing one of they or them were mined from a larger corpus of 798 literary texts span- ning the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (in- cluding novels such as To The Lighthouse, by Vir- ginia Woolf). Lastly, the candidate m-antecedents are extracted from a 5-sentence pre-window of the given m-anaphor (k = 5) and the regularization pa- rameter in learning is set to 0.20. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> depicts the features we chose to use in the pairwise similarity metric (SIM 1 ) for agglomer- ative clustering of candidate m-antecedents. All are common to many coreference resolver systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Durrett and Klein, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Recasens et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stoyanov et al., 2010)</ref>. We distinguish between mention features (Columns 1 &amp; 2), which are de- fined for each candidate m-antecedent in a pair, and pairwise features (Columns 3-5), which are defined over a pair of candidate m-antecedents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Clustering Features</head><p>Three features, in particular, deserve further discussion. Under morphosyntax (Column 3), [Type Conjunctions] is a placeholder for a num- ber of conjunctive boolean features derived from the noun type (pronoun/proper/common) of each antecedent in a pairing: e.g., pronoun-pronoun, pronoun-proper, proper-pronoun. Similarly, [De- pendency Conjunctions] is a placeholder for con- junctive boolean features derived from the gram- matical dependency of each antecedent in a pair- ing: e.g., subject-subject, subject-object, object- subject. The <ref type="bibr">[# Dependency Pairings]</ref> is an ordi- nal version of the Dependency Conjunctions fea- ture set -a count of the number of occurrences rather than an indicator variable.</p><p>The 'Governor = except' feature triggers if one of the mentions in the mention pair is governed by except or exclude. It represents a form of negation of group membership (e.g. Everyone except for Mary visited Castlebary).</p><p>Features were extracted using the Stanford CoreNLP system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) and animacy information was specifically obtained through the Stanford deterministic coreference resolution module ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., 2011</ref>).  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Morphosyntax (Mention) Grammatical (Mention) Morphosyntax (Pairwise) Grammatical (Pairwise) Semantic</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>In order to assess the performance of our method, we conduct two experiments. In the first, we as- sess performance of our system on the specific they-them m-anaphor resolution sub-task. Our system, and its variants, are compared against a number of baseline methods based on perfor- mance on the test set.</p><p>In the second experiment, we consider how our system improves the performance of a corefer- ence resolution system when all anaphors (both 1-anaphors and m-anaphors) are considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Evaluation</head><p>Accuracy is measured in terms of the num- ber of mention pairs correctly grouped as m- antecedents for a given m-anaphor -similar to previous works in anaphor resolution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peng et al., 2015)</ref>. We use the standard classifica- tion metrics for precision, recall, and F1-score. If n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n N represent the number of gold m-antecedents for m-anaphors g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g N in a document, and m 1 , m 2 , . . . , m N are predicted, of which k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k N are correct, then pre- cision is defined as i k i / i m i and recall as i k i / i n i , where i ranges from 1 to N . In order to align ourselves with the gold labels, we adjust the predicted mention corresponding to an entity to the closest one preceding the given m-anaphor. Because a given entity may appear multiple times in a candidate mention window, the most recent one, relative to the m-anaphor, is not always the one carrying the strongest sig- nal and hence is not always predicted as an an- tecedent. For the purposes of evaluation, such cases are considered correct. Automatic handling would involve a separate, single-antecedent coref- erence resolver, but given the thesis of this work is the multi-antecedent case, this choice is justified.</p></div>

If no such mentions can be found take the most recent mentions in subject and object positions governed by the same verb. -If the m-anaphor occupies in object po- sition, take the previous mentions in ob- ject or prepositional positions if they are coordinated, otherwise take them from previous, distinct sentences. If no such mentions can be found, take the most re- cent mentions in subject and object po- sitions governed by the same verb. -Otherwise, take the two most recent mentions (usually arrive here if there is an error in the dependency parsing).   <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Performance results of the M-TREE sys- tem on the different classes of m-anaphors.</p><p>• The system described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al. (2011)</ref> (denoted LEE), which performs some light m-anaphor resolution (solely for conjunctive cases).</p><p>• The two variants of the developed method, one using the LCS similarity metric (denoted M-LCS) and the other using the subset tree kernel (M-TREE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Accuracy results on the test set for each of the sys- tems are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>. Both the proposed sys- tems, M-LCS and M-TREE, outperform all other methods by a substantial margin. The Stanford system achieves the highest precision, which is not surprising because it targets conjunctive men- tions, which often serve as m-antecedents. Based on the analysis of Section 4, the poor performance of RECENT-2, RECENT-3, and RECENT-4 is ex- pected.</p><p>The results for the best-performing system, M- TREE, on the different classes of m-anaphors is given in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. M-TREE outperforms all other systems but exhibits a bias towards 2-anaphors, re- cent mentions, and mentions coordinated by con- junction. This is not surprising given such cases are the easiest to resolve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Full Coreference Resolution</head><p>For the complete coreference resolution task, the M-TREE system can be integrated with an exist-   <ref type="formula">(2015)</ref> system, with (CLARK+M- TREE) and without (CLARK) the pairing with M- TREE.</p><p>ing coreference system. For this experiment, we pair the full coreference resolution system of Clark and Manning (2015) with M-TREE, and we raise the prediction threshold of our model to 0.89, at which point precision on the validation set is 78.9. Moreover, we restrict ourselves to the P&amp;P portion of the test set, given the Scribner stories only have gold labels for instances of they and them. The Clark and Manning (2015) system is first run over the test set, producing coreference chains which are then filtered for character entities using the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Vala et al. (2015)</ref>. Our adjusted M-TREE system is then applied over all they and them mentions. Each such mention predicted as m-anaphoric is added to the coreference chains of the entities corresponding to the m-antecedent mentions.</p><p>To evaluate the accuracy against the gold men- tion clusters, each m-anaphoric they and them is added to each cluster containing a gold m- antecedent. The CoNLL metric scores ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bagga and Baldwin, 1998</ref>) of the coreference predictions are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>, with the integrated system out- performing the <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clark and Manning (2015)</ref> sys- tem by 0.6 average score (pairing the <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clark and Manning (2015)</ref> system instead with an oracle m- anaphor resolver yields an average score of 44.8, an increase of 6.7 points).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We introduced a new class of anaphors to the anaphor resolution problem, m-anaphors, and extended the problem formulation to incorpo- rate them. We offered insights into the lin- guistic behaviour of m-anaphors, finding that surface-level syntactic and semantic features do not carry enough discriminative power in distin- guishing them from 1-anaphors. Furthermore, we developed a system combining a mention-pair model, an existing coreference resolver, and cor- pus knowledge to resolve m-anaphors that scores higher than a number of baseline methods. Finally, we paired this system with a coreference resolver to solve the general coreference resolution task, showing that m-anaphor prediction can help boost performance.</p><p>An important component of the m-anaphor res- olution problem that falls outside the scope of this study, but is important for practical application, is the detection of m-anaphoric mentions. Section 4 gives some insight into the problem but a much deeper investigation is necessary to devise a detec- tion method.</p><p>Moreover, for simplicity, this study focused solely on m-anaphoric they and them mentions, but as explained earlier, m-anaphoric mentions can take many forms, each introducing their own particular complexities that warrant special atten- tion.</p><p>Regarding the system developed for m-anaphor resolution, resorting to an external corpus to ob- tain well-formed sentences proved to be very com- putationally expensive. In future work, we look to incorporate methods that incur less cost, pos- sibly tolerating some error in the formation of sentences without significantly degrading perfor- mance. Also, negation of group membership is a complex linguistic phenomenon that was handled in a crude manner in our system. We look to de- vote future work to handling such cases.</p><p>To promote further research into m-anaphors, we make all our data and software freely available at http://www.github.com/ networkdynamics/manaphor-acl2016.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2" validated="false"><head>Table 4 ,</head><label>4</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>inspired by
