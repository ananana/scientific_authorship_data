				<p>We investigate the novel task of online dispute detection and propose a sentiment analysis solution to the problem: we aim to identify the sequence of sentence-level sentiments expressed during a discussion and to use them as features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for the discussion as a whole. We evaluate dispute detection approaches on a newly created corpus of Wikipedia Talk page disputes and find that classifiers that rely on our sentiment tagging features outperform those that do not.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As the web has grown in popularity and scope, so has the promise of collaborative information en- vironments for the joint creation and exchange of knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Jones and Rafaeli, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sack, 2005</ref>). Wikipedia, a wiki-based online encyclopedia, is arguably the best example: its distributed edit- ing environment allows readers to collaborate as content editors and has facilitated the production of over four billion articles <ref type="bibr">1</ref> of surprisingly high quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Giles, 2005</ref>) in English alone since its de- but in 2001.</p><p>Existing studies of collaborative knowledge systems have shown, however, that the quality of the generated content (e.g. an encyclopedia arti- cle) is highly correlated with the effectiveness of the online collaboration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kittur and Kraut, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kraut and Resnick, 2012)</ref>; fruitful collaboration, in turn, inevitably requires dealing with the dis- putes and conflicts that arise ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kittur et al., 2007)</ref>. Unfortunately, human monitoring of the often massive social media and collaboration sites to de- tect, much less mediate, disputes is not feasible. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> http://en. <ref type="bibr">wikipedia.org</ref> In this work, we investigate the heretofore novel task of dispute detection in online discussions. Previous work in this general area has analyzed dispute-laden content to discover features corre- lated with conflicts and disputes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kittur et al., 2007)</ref>. Research focused primarily on cues de- rived from the edit history of the jointly created content (e.g. the number of revisions, their tem- poral density <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kittur et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yasseri et al., 2012)</ref>) and relied on small numbers of manually selected discussions known to involve disputes. In contrast, we investigate methods for the automatic detection, i.e. prediction, of discussions involving disputes. We are also interested in understanding whether, and which, linguistic features of the dis- cussion are important for dispute detection.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from studies of human me- diation of online conflicts (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Billings and Watts (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kittur et al. (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kraut and Resnick (2012)</ref>), we hypothesize that effective methods for dispute detection should take into account the sentiment and opinions expressed by participants in the collaborative endeavor. As a result, we propose a sentiment analysis approach for online dispute detection that identifies the sequence of sentence-level sentiments (i.e. very negative, neg- ative, neutral, positive, very positive) expressed during the discussion and uses them as features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON- DISPUTE label for the discussion as a whole. Con- sider, for example, the snippet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> from the Wikipedia Talk page for the article on Philadel- phia; it discusses the choice of a picture for the article's "infobox". The sequence of almost exclu- sively negative statements provides evidence of a dispute in this portion of the discussion.</p><p>Unfortunately, sentence-level sentiment tagging for this domain is challenging in its own right due to the less formal, often ungrammatical, lan- guage and the dynamic nature of online conver- sations. "Really, grow up" (segment 3) should 1-Emy111: I think everyone is forgetting that my previous image was the lead image for well over a year! ... &gt; Massimo: I'm sorry to say so, but it is grossly over processed... 2-Emy111: i'm glad you paid more money for a camera than I did. con- grats... i appreciate your constructive criticism. thank you. &gt; Massimo: I just want to have the best picture as a lead for the article ... 3-Emy111: Wow, I am really enjoying this photography debate... [so don't make assumptions you know nothing about.] NN [Really, grow up.] N [If you all want to complain about Photoshop editing, lets all go buy medium for- mat film cameras, shoot film, and scan it, so no manipulation is possible.] O [Sound good?] NN &gt; Massimo: ... I do feel it is a pity, that you turned out to be a sore loser... presumably be tagged as a negative sentence as should the sarcastic sentences "Sounds good?" (in the same turn) and "congrats" and "thank you" (in segment 2). We expect that these, and other, examples will be difficult for the sentence-level classifier unless the discourse context of each sen- tence is considered. Previous research on senti- ment prediction for online discussions, however, focuses on turn-level predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hahn et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yin et al., 2012</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As the first work that predicts sentence-level sentiment for online dis- cussions, we investigate isotonic Conditional Ran- dom Fields (CRFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mao and Lebanon, 2007)</ref> for the sentiment-tagging task as they preserve the ad- vantages of the popular CRF-based sequential tag- ging models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) while provid- ing an efficient mechanism for encoding domain knowledge -in our case, a sentiment lexicon - through isotonic constraints on model parameters.</p><p>We evaluate our dispute detection approach us- ing a newly created corpus of discussions from Wikipedia Talk pages (3609 disputes, 3609 non- disputes). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We find that classifiers that employ the learned sentiment features outperform others that do not. The best model achieves a very promis- ing F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80 on the Wikipedia dispute corpus. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first computational approach to automatically identify online disputes on a dataset of scale.</p><p>Additional Related Work. Sentiment analysis has been utilized as a key enabling technique in a number of conversation-based applications. Pre- vious work mainly studies the attitudes in spoken meetings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Galley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hahn et al., 2006</ref>) or broadcast conversations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wang et al., 2011</ref>) using variants of Conditional Random Fields ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) and predicts sentiment at the turn-level, while our predictions are made for each sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data Construction: A Dispute Corpus</head><p>We construct the first dispute detection corpus to date; it consists of dispute and non-dispute discus- sions from Wikipedia Talk pages.</p><p>Step 1: Get Talk Pages of Disputed Articles. Wikipedia articles are edited by different editors. If an article is observed to have disputes on its talk page, editors can assign dispute tags to the article to flag it for attention. In this research, we are interested in talk pages whose corresponding articles are labeled with the following tags:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">DISPUTED, TOTALLYDISPUTED, DISPUTED- SECTION, TOTALLYDISPUTED-SECTION, POV.</formula><p>The tags indicate that an article is disputed, or the neutrality of the article is disputed (POV).</p><p>We use the 2013-03-04 Wikipedia data dump, and extract talk pages for articles that are labeled with dispute tags by checking the revision history. This results in 19,071 talk pages.</p><p>Step 2: Get Discussions with Disputes. Dis- pute tags can also be added to talk pages them- selves. Therefore, in addition to the tags men- tioned above, we also consider the "Request for Comment" (RFC) tag on talk pages. According to Wikipedia 4 , RFC is used to request outside opin- ions concerning the disputes.</p><p>3609 discussions are collected with dispute tags found in the revision history. We further classify dispute discussions into three subcate- gories: CONTROVERSY, REQUEST FOR COM- MENT (RFC), and RESOLVED based on the tags found in discussions (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resolved</head><p>Any tag from above + RESOLVED <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Subcategory for disputes with corresponding tags.</p><p>Note that each discussion in the RESOLVED class has more than one tag.</p><p>Step 3: Get Discussions without Disputes. Like- wise, we collect non-dispute discussions from pages that are never tagged with disputes. We con- sider non-dispute discussions with at least 3 dis- tinct speakers and 10 turns. 3609 discussions are randomly selected with this criterion. The average turn numbers for dispute and non-dispute discus- sions are 45.03 and 22.95, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Sentence-level Sentiment Prediction</head><p>This section describes our sentence-level senti- ment tagger, from which we construct features for dispute detection (Section 4).</p><p>Consider a discussion comprised of sequential turns; each turn consists of a sequence of sen- tences. Our model takes as input the sentences x = {x 1 , · · · , x n } from a single turn, and out- puts the corresponding sequence of sentiment la- bels y = {y 1 , · · · , y n }, where y i ∈ O, O = {NN, N, O, P, PP}. The labels in O represent very negative (NN), negative (N), neutral (O), pos- itive (P), and very positive (PP), respectively.</p><p>Given that traditional Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lafferty et al., 2001</ref>) ignore the or- dinal relations among sentiment labels, we choose isotonic CRFs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mao and Lebanon, 2007</ref>) for sentence-level sentiment analysis as they can en- force monotonicity constraints on the parameters consistent with the ordinal structure and domain knowledge (e.g. word-level sentiment conveyed via a lexicon). Concretely, we take a lexicon M = M p ∪M n , where M p and M n are two sets of fea- tures (usually words) identified as strongly associ- ated with positive and negative sentiment. Assume µ σ,w encodes the weight between label σ and feature w, for each feature w ∈ M p ; then the iso- tonic CRF enforces σ ≤ σ ⇒ µ σ,w ≤ µ σ ,w . For example, when "totally agree" is observed in training, parameter µ PP,totally agree is likely to increase. Similar constraints are defined on M n .</p><p>Our lexicon is built by combining MPQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Wilson et al., 2005</ref>), General Inquirer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Stone et al., 1966)</ref>, and SentiWordNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006</ref>) lexicons. Words with contradictory senti- ments are removed. We use the features in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> for sentiment prediction. Syntactic/Semantic Features. We have two ver- sions of dependency relation features, the origi- nal form and a form that generalizes a word to its POS tag, e.g. "nsubj(wrong, you)" is generalized to "nsubj(ADJ, you)" and "nsubj(wrong, PRP)".

An SVM classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Joachims, 1999</ref>) is trained using features of the sentiment words and minimum/maximum/average of the distances. We also compare with two state-of-the-art methods that are used in sentiment prediction for conversations: (1) an SVM (RBF kernel) that is employed for identifying sentiment-bearing sen- tences ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hassan et al., 2010)</ref>, and (dis)agreement detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yin et al., 2012</ref>) in online debates; (2) a Linear CRF for (dis)agreement identification in broadcast conversations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wang et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>We evaluate the systems using standard F1 on classes of positive, negative, and neutral, where samples predicted as PP and P are positive align- ment, and samples tagged as NN and N are neg- ative alignment. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> describes the main re- sults on the AAWD dataset: our isotonic CRF based system significantly outperforms the alter- natives for positive and negative alignment detec- tion (paired-t test, p &lt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Dispute Detection</head><p>We model dispute detection as a standard bi- nary classification task, and investigate four major types of features as described below. Lexical Features. We first collect unigram and bigram features for each discussion. Topic Features. Articles on specific topics, such as politics or religions, tend to arouse more dis- putes. We thus extract the category informa- tion of the corresponding article for each talk page. We further utilize unigrams and bigrams of the category as topic features. Discussion Features. This type of feature aims to capture the structure of the discussion. Intu- itively, the more turns or the more participants a discussion has, the more likely there is a dispute. Meanwhile, participants tend to produce longer utterances when they make arguments. We choose number of turns, number of participants, average number of words in each turn as features. In addi- tion, the frequency of revisions made during the discussion has been shown to be good indicator for controversial articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Vuong et al., 2008)</ref>, that are presumably prone to have disputes. Therefore, we encode the number of revisions that happened during the discussion as a feature. Sentiment Features. This set of features en- code the sentiment distribution and transition in the discussion. We train our sentiment tagging model on the full AAWD dataset, and run it on the Wikipedia dispute corpus.</p><p>Given that consistent negative senti- ment flow usually indicates an ongoing dispute, we first extract features from sentiment distribution in the form of number/probability of sentiment per type. We also estimate the sentiment transition probability P (S t → S t+1 ) from our predictions, where S t and S t+1 are sentiment labels for the current sentence and the next. We then have features as number/portion of sentiment transitions per type.</p><p>Features described above mostly depict the global sentiment flow in the discussions. We fur- ther construct a local version of them, since sen- timent distribution may change as discussion pro- ceeds. For example, less positive sentiment can be observed as dispute being escalated. We thus split each discussion into three equal length stages, and create sentiment distribution and transition fea- tures for each stage.  The numbers are multiplied by 100. The items in bold are sta- tistically significantly higher than others in the same column (paired-t test, p &lt; 0.05). SVM with the RBF kernel achieves the best performance in precision, F1, and accuracy.</p><p>Results and Error Analysis. We experiment with logistic regression, SVM with linear and RBF ker- nels, which are effective methods in multiple text categorization tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Joachims, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhang and J. Oles, 2001</ref>). We normalize the features by stan- dardization and conduct a 5-fold cross-validation. Two baselines are listed: (1) labels are randomly assigned; (2) all discussions have disputes.</p><p>Main results for different classifiers are dis- played in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4.

Experimental results with various combinations of features sets are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. As it can be seen, senti- ment features obtains the best accuracy among the four types of features. A combination of topic, dis- cussion, and sentiment features achieves the best performance on recall, F1, and accuracy. Specif- ically, the accuracy is significantly higher than all the other systems (paired-t test, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>After a closer look at the results, we find two main reasons for incorrect predictions. Firstly, sentiment prediction errors get propagated into dispute detection. Due to the limitation of ex- isting general-purpose lexicons, some opinionated dialog-specific terms are hard to catch. For exam- ple, "I told you over and over again..." strongly suggests a negative sentiment, but no single word shows negative connotation. Constructing a lexi- con tuned for conversational text may improve the performance. Secondly, some dispute discussions are harder to detect than the others due to differ- ent dialog structures. For instance, the recalls for dispute discussions of "controversy", "RFC", and "resolved" are 0.78, 0.79, and 0.86 respectively. We intend to design models that are able to cap- ture dialog structures in the future work. Sentiment Flow Visualization. We visualize the sentiment flow of two disputed discussions in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 2</ref>. The plots reveal persistent negative sen- timent in unresolved disputes (top). For the re- solved dispute (bottom), participants show grati- tude when the problem is settled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We present a sentiment analysis-based approach to online dispute detection. We create a large- scale dispute corpus from Wikipedia Talk pages to study the problem.

Sentiment Features. We gather connectives from 
the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Rashmi Prasad and 
Webber, 2008) and combine them with any senti-
ment word that precedes or follows it as new fea-
tures. Sentiment dependency relations are the de-
pendency relations that include a sentiment word. 
We replace those words with their polarity equiv-
alents. For example, relation "nsubj(wrong, you)" 
becomes "nsubj(SentiWord neg , you)". 

4 Online Dispute Detection 

4.1 Training A Sentiment Classifier 

Dataset. We train the sentiment classifier using 
the Authority and Alignment in Wikipedia Discus-
sions (AAWD) corpus (Bender et al., 2011) on a 5-
point scale (i.e. NN, N, O, P, PP). AAWD consists 
of 221 English Wikipedia discussions with posi-
tive and negative alignment annotations. Annota-
tors either label each sentence as positive, negative 
or neutral, or label the full turn. For instances that 
have only a turn-level label, we assume all sen-
tences have the same label as the turn. We further 
transform the labels into the five sentiment labels. 
Sentences annotated as being a positive alignment 
by at least two annotators are treated as very posi-
tive (PP). If a sentence is only selected as positive 
by one annotator or obtains the label via turn-level 
annotation, it is positive (P). Very negative (NN) 
and negative (N) are collected in the same way. 
All others are neutral (O). Among all 16,501 sen-
tences in AAWD, 1,930 and 1,102 are labeled as 
NN and N. 532 and 99 of them are PP and P. The 
other 12,648 are considered neutral. 
Evaluation. To evaluate the performance of the 
sentiment tagger, we compare to two baselines. 
(1) Baseline (Polarity): a sentence is predicted as 
positive if it has more positive words than nega-
tive words, or negative if more negative words are 
observed. Otherwise, it is neutral. (2) Baseline 
(Distance) is extended from (Hassan et al., 2010).
