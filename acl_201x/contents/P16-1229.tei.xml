				<p>Linguistic drift is a process that produces slow irreversible changes in the grammar and function of a language&apos;s constructions. Importantly, changes in a part of a language can have trickle down effects, triggering changes elsewhere in that language. Although such causally triggered chains of changes have long been hypothesized by historical linguists, no explicit demonstration of the actual causality has been provided. In this study, we use co-occurrence statistics and machine learning to demonstrate that the functions of morphological cases experience a slow, irreversible drift along history, even in a language as conservative as is Icelandic. Crucially , we then move on to demonstrate-using the notion of Granger-causality-that there are explicit causal connections between the changes in the functions of the different cases, which are consistent with documented processes in the history of Icelandic. Our technique provides a means for the quantitative reconstruction of connected networks of subtle linguistic changes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sapir <ref type="bibr">(1921/2014, p. 123)</ref> noticed that "Language moves down on a current of its own making. It has a drift" (emphasis added). In Sapir's view, the formation of different dialects requires that the small changes constantly being introduced by the speakers are not just plain white noise, but rather random walks in which minute changes accumu- late over time. The very high dimensionality on which languages operate makes cumulative lin- guistic changes irreversible. Once a change has been effected there is very little chance that the language will ever return to its original state be- fore the change, in the same way that a diffu- sion process in a very high dimensional space is never going to return to the exact same point in the space. Drift in language is in this respect reminiscent of random genetic drift from evolu- tionary biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wright, 1955)</ref>. However, Sapir's idea of drift goes further in that he viewed it as a directional process, more similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wright's (1929)</ref> concept of a directional drift related to se- lectional pressures. In Sapir's view, "language has a 'slope"'; the small changes that accumulate in linguistic drift are not fully random, but rather they reflect the speakers' unconscious cognitive ten- dency to increase the consistency within their lan- guages. This idea is currently challenged by some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Croft, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lupyan and Dale, 2015)</ref>, who are of the opinion that purely random drift - of the same type as that found in genetics-, when coupled with adequate selection mechanisms, is sufficient to account for the diachronic changes observed in the world's languages. Sapir moti- vated the need for directional change in what he saw as apparent causal chains in language change, which he illustrated with the progressive loss and functional shift of English oblique case markers, into an absolutive case-free system encoding ani- macy and position relative to the head noun.</p><p>'Chain reactions' along the history of a lan- guage are particularly well-studied in phonology. Chain shifts <ref type="bibr">(Martinet, 1952)</ref> are processes by which the position in perceptual/articulatory space of a phoneme changes in response to the change in position of another phoneme (either moving away from the second phoneme, in a 'push' chain, or moving to occupy the space left void by the other, in a 'pull' chain). A famous example of a chain shift is the Great English Vowel Shift. In a similar fashion, one could think of functional chain shifts in morphology, by which a certain morphological category takes over some of the functions of an- other, triggering a chain of 'push' and/or 'pull' movements in other categories. Such cascaded changes have often been reported in diachronic linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Biberauer and Roberts, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fisiak, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lightfoot, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wittmann, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>Icelandic is a famously conservative language. Compared to most other languages, its grammar has experienced remarkably little change since the high middle ages. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barðdal and Eythórsson (2003)</ref> argue that the changes it has experienced from its old phase (Old West Norse; mid XI century to mid XIV century) to its cur- rent phase are comparable to the slight changes oc- curring from early Modern English (late XV cen- tury into early XVIII century) into Modern En- glish (from early XVIII century). In terms of inflectional morphology, change in Icelandic has been minimal. For instance, one finds that the nominal paradigms of Old West Norse, are mostly the same as those of Modern Icelandic. Notwith- standing the apparent formal stability of Icelandic cases, there is evidence that they are experiencing subtle changes in their functions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barðdal, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barðdal and Eythórsson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Eythórsson, 2000</ref>). In particular, Barðdal argues that an accumulation of small syntatico-semantic shifts has finally re- sulted in a shift in the Icelandic dative's functions (i.e., 'dative sickness'), possibly triggered by ear- lier changes in nominatives and accusatives (e.g., 'nominative sickness').</p><p>In this study, we investigate whether one can re- liably detect a drift in the functions of Icelandic case and -crucially-whether there is evidence for causal chain shifts in these functions. In Sec- tion 2, we describe the processing of a diachronic corpus of Icelandic to obtain co-occurrence repre- sentations of the functions of case types and to- kens. Section 3 uses machine learning on the co- occurrence vectors of tokens to demonstrate that the usage of Icelandic cases has been subject to a constant drift along history, a drift that is dis- tinguishable from the overall changes experienced by the language in this period. We then go on -in Section 4-to demonstrate using Granger-causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Granger, 1969</ref>) that there are causal relations be- tween the changes in the different cases, and it is possible to reconstruct a directed network of chain shifts, which is consistent with the directions of causality hypothesized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barðdal (2011)</ref>. Fi- nally, in Section 5, we discuss the theoretical im- plications of our results for theories of language change, as well as the possibilities offered by the technical innovations presented here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Corpus Processing</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Corpus</head><p>We used the Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wallenberg et al., 2011</ref>), a sample of around one million word tokens of Icelandic texts that have been orthographically standardized, man- ually lemmatized, part-of-speech tagged, and parsed into context-free derivation trees. An ex- ample of the lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging for a sentence is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. The dating of the text samples ranges from 1,150 CE to 2,008 CE, covering most of the history of Ice- landic (from its origins in Old West Norse, to the current official language of Iceland). The corpus is divided into 61 files of similar sizes (around 18,000 words per file), each file corresponding to a single document. The documents were chosen to cover the period in a roughly uniform manner, sampling from similar genres across the periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Preprocessing</head><p>We collapsed into a single file all documents that were dated on the same year. This left us with 44 files containing texts from distinct years. From each of the files, we discarded all tokens that contained anything but valid Icelandic alphabetic characters or the dollar sign (used for marking en- clitic breaks within a word, such as the clitic deter- miner in krossins from the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). All remaining word tokens were lower-cased, and the '$' character was removed from the stem elements of broken stem plus clitic pairs (e.g., kross$ was changed into kross).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">First Order Co-occurrence Vectors</head><p>Ideally, for constructing co-occurrence vectors, it is best to choose as features those words with high- est overall informativity, which in fact tend to be those words with the highest occurrence frequen- cies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bullinaria and Levy, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bullinaria and Levy, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lowe and McDonald, 2000</ref>). In our case, however, using plain token frequencies runs the risk of creating a representational space that is strongly uninformative about particular periods in the history of the language. Instead, we used docu- ment frequencies, as these still provide a measure  <ref type="table">-ins  merkja  ást  við  Guð  og  menn  en  armur  krosur  hinn  merkja  ást  við  guð  og</ref>  of word frequency (and therefore informativity), while at the same time ensuring that those words chosen as features are most representative across the history of the language. We selected as fea- tures all word types that occurred in at least 75% of the 44 by-year files, that is, all 529 distinct (un- lemmatized) word forms that had a document fre- quency in the corpus of at least 33 documents. For each (unlemmatized) word type (w) oc- curring at least three times in the whole corpus (17,741 distinct word types), we computed its co-occurrence frequency with each of the feature words (t). In this way, we obtained a matrix of 17,741 × 529 word by feature co-occurrence fre- quencies (f <ref type="bibr">[w, t]</ref>) within a symmetrical window in- cluding the two preceding and following words. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The plain co-occurrence matrix was converted into a matrix of word-feature pointwise mutual infor- mations M = (m i,j ), such that,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">maður CONJ NS-N N-G D-G VBP N-A P NPR-A CONJ NS-A</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">m i,j = log N · f[w i , t j ] (W 1 − 1) · f[w i ] · f[t j ] ,</formula><p>where N = 899,763 tokens is the total num- ber of tokens in the corpus, W 1 = 5 is the to- tal sliding window size considered, and f[w i ] and f[t j ], are the overall corpus frequencies of words w i and t j , respectively. In this manner, the row M i,· = (m i,1 , . . . , m i,529 ) represents the contexts in which the word type w i is found across the whole corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Second Order Co-occurrence Vectors</head><p>The co-occurrence vectors computed above pro- vide representations for the average contexts in which a given word type is found. In order to rep- resent the specific context of each word token, we used second order co-occurrence vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Schütze and Pedersen, 1997</ref>). These provide important in- formation about the aspects of a context that are relevant for inflectional morphology (Moscoso del Prado Martín, 2007). The second order vectors were computed by passing a symmetrical sliding window including, for each token, the immedi- ately preceding and following word. The vector for each token was computed as the average be- tween the first order vectors (of Subsection 2.3) of the preceding and following words. If no first order vector was available for either the preced- ing or the following word, the second order vec- tor directly corresponded to the plain first order vector of the word for which there was a first or- der vector. We excluded those tokens for which we had first order vectors for neither the previ- ous nor the following word type. We computed such second order vectors for all tokens in the cor- pus that had been tagged for grammatical case (a total of 419,910 vectors, on average 9,453 vec- tors per year, of which 38.14% were nominatives, 10.91% were genitives, 26.38% were accusatives, and 24.56% were datives).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Representation of the Case Prototypes</head><p>In order to represent the prototypical usages each grammatical case (i.e., nominative, genitive, ac- cusative, and dative) in a given year, we used the first order co-occurrence technique. For each of the 44 distinct years -using the same features identified in Subsection 2.3-we computed first order co-occurrence vectors collapsing all word tokens in each grammatical case, and using a reduced window size including just the preced- ing and following words (i.e., W 2 = 3). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For each year (y) we obtained a 4 × 529 element matrix of co-occurrence frequencies (f y [c, t]), in- dicating the number of times that each case (c) was found to co-occur (within the specified win- dow) with feature (t). These matrices were trans- formed into case to feature pointwise mutual in- formations, resulting in a series of 44 matrices</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(M [y] = (m[y] i,j ) such that, m[y] i,j = log N · f y [c i , t j ] (W 2 − 1) · f[c i ] · f[t j ] ,</formula><p>where N is the total number of tokens in the cor- pus, f[c i ] is the number of instances of case c i , and f[t j ] denotes the number of instances of word t j in the corpus. In this way, the rows of the M [y] matrices provided a representation of the contexts in which each grammatical case was used in each year. Fig. 2a plots the spatial organization of the re- sulting vectors (after reducing to a bidimensional projection using Singular Value Decomposition; SVD). Notice that the prototypes for each case very naturally cluster together across the years. The scatter is however asymmetric, hinting at a process of change along the years common for all four cases. If we compute a yearly overall proto- type vector as the average vector for the cases in each year, and we substract it from the correspond- ing case prototypes, we find that the case ide- tities become clearly differentiated in space (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2b</ref>), demonstrating that the case prototype vectors do indeed capture the contextual proper- ties of all four cases, which are highly distinctive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Functional Drift in Icelandic Cases</head><p>As was discussed in the Introduction, the inflec- tional paradigms marking case and number have barely -if at all-changed along the history of Ice- landic. On the basis of this fact alone, one could conclude that the grammatical case system is not actually experiencing any linguistic drift, but has rather remained basically static throughout the last millennium. There is, however, another possibil- ity. Linguistic drift could have been affecting the functions of grammatical cases in Icelandic. If this were the case, one would expect to observe a slow -constant rate-diachronic change in the contexts in which each of the four cases is used.</p><p>To investigate this latter possibility, for each of the 44 years documented in the corpus, we trained a basic logistic classifier in the task of as- signing grammatical case to the second order co- occurrence vectors developed in Subsection 2.4. Once each of the classifiers had been trained, we tested the classifiers' performances on the vectors obtained from each of other 43 years on which they were not trained. On the one hand, if the func- tions of the cases have indeed remained constant along the history of the language, one would ex- pect that the performance of a classifier tested on the data from a given year, should remain approx- imately constant when tested on vectors from all other years. If, on the other hand, the functions of Icelandic grammatical cases have been subject to linguistic drift, the irreversible and cumulative na- ture of the drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Sapir, 1921</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Sapir, /2014</ref> implies that the classifier error should grow -if only so slightly- with each year passed. The reason for this is that the contexts in which one would use each case should be slightly different from year to year. One should then predict that the error of the classifier should depend on the temporal distance between the year of the testing vectors and that of the train- ing ones. Furthermore, the change in error should be of a linear nature, with a very slight slope.</p><p>When tested on the same years in which they had been trained, the classifiers performed rather well in inferring the case to which each of the context vectors belonged (the distribution of errors across the 44 years was well approximated by a normal distribution with a mean error of 26.67%, a standard deviation of 1.99%, and best and worst classification errors of 22.17% and 30.39%, re- spectively). 3</p><note type="other">500 0 500 Temporal Distance (years) 30 35 40 45 Classification Error (%) β + = 0. 002, p + &lt; 0. 001, β − = − 0. 002, p − &lt; 0. 001 Figure 3: Correlation between the classifier er- ror and the temporal distance from the year from which the training vectors were obtained to the year when the testing vectors were obtained. The solid lines plots a linear regressions.</note><p>We then tested the classifiers on the vectors ob- tained from different years. The results are plot- ted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. The scatter plots the difference in years (i.e., the difference values are positive when the classifier was tested on vectors obtained after those used for training, and negative when testing with vectors obtained before the training ones). When testing on data different from the training sets, there is a logical loss in performance (of about 8%) from the baseline of testing on the same training set. We fitted two linear regressions, one to the positive differences and another to the negative differences (plotted by the solid lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). The first thing that stands out is that the performance of the classifier is remarkably good when tested on vectors obtained at considerable temporal distances from the time when the train- ing vectors were obtained. While the error of the classifier is of about 34% when tested on vectors from the year after or before the training vectors, the error remains at 35% for vectors originating from texts that are five centuries apart. Once again, this speaks to the remarkable conservativeness of the Icelandic language. However, these small dif- ferences are in fact reliable: There are significant slopes in both regressions (positive differences: R + = .161, p + &lt; .001; negative differences: R − = −.164, p − &lt; .001). A second remark- able thing is that both regressions are substantially symmetrical, in fact their slopes are basically iden- tical (|β + | = |β − | = .002). This indicates that the degree to which the usages of the cases at different to have a classifier with a decent performance, as our goal was showing that the error is time-dependent. </p><note type="other">β = . 002, z = 5. 009, p &lt; . 001</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0">1020304050607080900</head><p>Distance in Years Classification Error (%) β = . 001, z = 4. 661, p &lt; . 001 time points have diverged depends on the amount of time that has intervened, irrespective of whether it was the training or the testing set that was col- lected before.</p><p>One could argue that the slow drift observed may not be really due to changes in the functions of the grammatical cases themselves, but just to overall changes either in the overall language, or in the very topics that are addressed (e.g., one might guess that talk of swords, slaves, and longships was more frequent in XII century Norse than it is in Modern Icelandic). To investigate this pos- sibility we used an information-theoretical mea- sure of the prototypicality of a set of second order vectors for a particular year (based on that used in Moscoso del <ref type="bibr">Prado Martín, 2007)</ref>. From the vectors of each year, irrespective of their case, we fitted a 529-dimensional Gaussian distribution (by estimating the mean vector for that year, µ y , and the covariance matrix, Σ y ). The average inade- quacy of a given set of vectors {v 1 , . . . , v n } ob- tained in year z to the distribution fitted to the vec- tors obtained in year y is measured by the cross- entropy, a Monte Carlo estimator of which is given by, 4</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H(z, y) ≈ K + 1 2 log |Σ y | + 1 2n n i=1 (v i − µ y ) T Σ −1 y (v i − µ y ),</formula><p>where K is a constant. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In addition, one should also take into account the fact that, for some years, the classifier might generalize better or worse than for others (due to irrelevant idiosyncrasies of one specific text used for training), which could lead to a distortion of the results. To investigate whether, after discounting for the inadequacy of the vectors to the overall distribu- tion of those in which the classifier was trained, there was still evidence for drift in the functions of the cases, while also accounting for the dif- ferent generalization powers of the classifiers, we fitted a linear mixed-effects model to the classi- fier errors, including fixed-effect predictors of the cross-entropy described above, and the absolute value of the difference in years between the train- ing set and testing set dates (as indicated above, the effects were equivalent for positive and neg- ative values in years), and the dating of the test- ing set as a random effect. As expected, we found that the cross-entropies had a significant positive effect (β = .002, z = 5.009, p &lt; .001; left panel if <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4)</ref>, indicating that the performances of the models were indeed worse for less adequate sets of testing vectors, irrespective of any aspect of grammatical case. However -crucially-even af- ter considering the effect of cross-entropy, there remained a significant positive effect of the tempo- ral distance (β = .001, z = 4.661, p &lt; .001; right panel if <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> This result therefore supports the hypothesis that the function of grammatical case has been subject to a slight constant change dur- ing the history of the language: a functional drift.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Functional Chain Shifts in Case</head><p>In the previous section we have demonstrated that the functions of Icelandic cases have been subject to slow linguistic drift. The question now arises of whether this drift is purely random, or rather it has some degree of directionality arising from endoge- nous linguistic factors. It is possible that changes in the functions of some cases caused changes in the functions of others. We investigate this possi- bility using the notion of Granger-causality</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Granger-causality</head><p>Granger-causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Granger, 1969</ref>) is a powerful technique for assessing whether one time series can be said to be the cause of another one. The ba- sic idea is that one time series x is said to Granger- cause another series y if the past of series x pre- dicts the future of series y over and above any <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The estimated covariance matrices were not definite pos- itive for two of the years, which were excluded from the anal- yses. In addition, in 552 out of the remaining 1,849 estimates, the cross-entropy took unusually large values, orders of mag- nitude larger than the rest (likely reflecting inadequacy of the multidimensional Gaussian approximation for these cases), which distorted the effect estimates. The analyses reported exclude these 552 points. However, keeping these outlying values in the regression, both key effects remained signifi- cant, but the slope estimates were less trustworthy. predictive power that can be found on y's own past. This idea has proven of great value to inves- tigate the causal connections between economic variables, sequences of behavioral responses, neu- ral spikes, or electroencephalographic potentials. Often, the technique is used to reconstruct direc- tional networks of variables and processes that have causal connections.</p><p>If x and y are stationary time sequences on time (τ ), in order to test whether x Granger-causes y, one begins by fitting autoregressive models (AR) that predict the values of y from its own n values lagged into the past.

If the second regression is a significant improvement over the first, then it can be said that x Granger-causes y, indicating that past values of x significantly pre- dict future values of y over and above any predic- tive power of y's own past values. This is tested using an F -test, with the null hypothesis being that the second model does not improve on the first one. The selection of the autoregressive order pa- rameters n and m is achieved by model compar- isons using information criteria.</p><p>When one is interested in reconstructing a net- work of causal relations between multiple vari- ables, one can use a mutivariate generalization of the AR model, the vector autoregressive model (VAR). The VAR model consists of mutiple AR equations (one for each variable in the model). If we consider an autoregressive order of one (i.e., m = n = 1), when we are simultaneously consid- ering p variables Y = {y 1 , . . . , y p }, the VAR <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> model to be fitted can be expressed in matrix no-tation as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">   y 1 [τ ]</formula><p>. . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">y p [τ ]    =    a 1 . . . a p    +    A 1,1 . . .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Granger-causality in Case Drift</head><p>To investigate whether the pattern of change in one case triggers (i.e., Granger-cause) the pattern of change in another, we made use of the pro- totype vectors for the cases in each of the years developed in Subsection 2.5. As a measure of the amount of contextual change for a given case in a given year, we computed the city-block dis- tances between the case prototypes from each year to the next available time point, which are plot- ted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a</ref>. Notice that there is an overall pat- tern of change equally affecting all cases, and the changes are therefore strongly correlated. This re- flects the overall pattern of historical changes af- fecting Icelandic as a whole, as well as changes in the topics that would be discussed in the differ- ent time periods, as was documented in Subsec- tion 2.5 and Section 3. Considering the changes in each case as a component in a four-dimensional vector, the modulus of this vector (plotted by the dashed orange line in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a)</ref> gives the overall magnitude of the changes that are unspecific to the cases themselves. To remove this component from the changes, we fitted a linear regression to the sequence of changes in each case, using the overall pattern of change as a predictor. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref> plots the resulting residuals, indicating the amount of change that was specific to each case, over and above the overall pattern. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> A precondition for testing for Granger-causality is that the time series under consideration are sta- tionary. In our case, the series depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5b</ref> are significantly non-stationary; they exhibit, for instance, significant temporal trends. In order to remove the non-stationarities, the series were dif- ferentiated (i.e., we considered the difference be- tween each two consecutive points). The result of <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Negative values in this figure indicate changing less than the average, rather than 'negative change'. this differentiation, plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5c</ref>, removed the non-stationary trends from the original series. We fitted a VAR[n] model to the four dif- ferentiated time-series. The autoregressive order found to maximize Akaike's Information Crite- rion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akaike, 1974)</ref> was n = 1. 8 The F statis- tics and significance values for the coefficients in the resulting VAR <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> model are given in Tab. 1. In order to reconstruct the causality network, we also need to consider that we started out with only very vague predictions on the possible directions of causality. As the model involved twelve sepa- rate p-value tests, the p-value estimates need to be corrected for multiple comparisons. This correc- tion was done using the false discovery rate (FDR) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)</ref>, result- ing in the corrected p-value estimates listed in the last column of Tab. 1.</p><p>The Granger-causality analysis leads us to re- construct the causality network depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. It appears that the drift in the functions of Ice- landic case is not plainly random. Instead, we find evidence that changes in the functions of the ac- cusatives and genitives have had a domino effect, triggering further changes in the functions of nom- inatives. Finally, changes in all other three cases result in changes in the functions of the dative. In summary, the changes observed are consistent with the idea discussed in the Introduction of a functional chain shift affecting the morphological case system of Icelandic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>We have presented evidence for a steady drift -of the precise kind advocated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sapir (1921</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sapir ( /2014</ref>)- even in a language as remarkably conservative as is Icelandic. This supports the claim that hu- man languages are in a state of 'perpetual mo- tion' <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beckner et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dediu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hawkins and Gell-Mann, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hopper, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">(a)</ref>  Larsen- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Freeman and Cameron, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Niyogi and Berwick, 1997)</ref>. Although we have found that functional change in Icelandic case has proceeded at a constant rate, we do not think, as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nettle (1999a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nettle ( , 1999b</ref>, that this rate of change needs to be constant across languages. There are strong arguments suggesting that in other lan- guages such rates might be different <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wichmann, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wichmann and Holman, 2009</ref>). The crucial innovation presented in this paper is the reconstruction of the causality network link- ing the changes in the four cases. Previous ap- plications of the notion of Granger-causality to diachronic language change (Moscoso del Prado Martín, 2014) have focused on the macroscopic relation between sudden changes in syntax and morphology. Here, we have demonstrated that Granger-causality can also be used to reconstruct detailed networks of slow changes within the mor- phological system, at a more microscopic scale. The techniques developed offer a mechanism for investigating subtle changes in the functions of linguistic constructions, and the causal relations between them. Traditionally, historical linguists have focused on 'narrative' accounts of the the chains of change within a language. Although such type of accounts are extremely useful, the often very subtle changes in usage that can occur from one time-point to another cannot always be described with such clearcut patterns. Neverthe- less, we have shown that those very small changes do accumulate in meaningful ways.</p><p>An important question addressed by this study is the presence of endogenous causal chains in language change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lupyan and Dale (2015)</ref> argue that languages are constrained by their 'ecolog- ical niches', the communities in which they are spoken, and the extralinguistic properties of those niches can trigger exogenous change in the mor- phology of the languages. Following on Lupyan and Dale's ecosystem analogy, one should see that, as well as being part of ecosystems, languages are also ecosystems in themselves, in a nesting similar to that found in natural ecosystems (i.e., an animal is part of a particular ecosystem, and its body is an ecosystem in itself). Sounds, words and con- structions have their own ecological niches within the language, and disturbances in the system can trigger cascaded changes, leading to readaptation (evolution) of the constructions. This contrasts with the view of changes in the function of Ice- landic cases expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Eythórsson (2000)</ref>. He showed that verbs whose arguments exhibit 'nom- inative sickness' and 'accusative sickness' tend to be clustered along certain syntactic and seman- tic lines. That it is in these particular niches that accusatives and datives ended up settling is not, however, the cause of the language changes. As we have shown, the case system was subject to a string of cascaded pressures. That the cases ended</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Tagging and lemmatization of the Old West Norse sentence (number 819) from the Íslensk Hómilíubók ("Icelandic Book of Homilies"; late XII century): En armar krossins merkja ást við Guð og menn.
