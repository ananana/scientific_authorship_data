				<p>This paper proposes an approach to capture the pragmatic context needed to infer irony in tweets. We aim to test the validity of two main hypotheses: (1) the presence of negations, as an internal propriety of an utterance, can help to detect the disparity between the literal and the intended meaning of an utterance, (2) a tweet containing an asserted fact of the form N ot(P 1) is ironic if and only if one can assess the absurdity of P 1. Our first results are encouraging and show that deriving a pragmatic contextual model is feasible.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Motivation</head><p>Irony is a complex linguistic phenomenon widely stud- ied in philosophy and linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grice et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sperber and Wilson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Utsumi, 1996)</ref>. Despite the- ories differ on how to define irony, they all commonly agree that it involves an incongruity between the literal meaning of an utterance and what is expected about the speaker and/or the environment. For many researchers, irony overlaps with a variety of other figurative devices such as satire, parody, and sarcasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clark and Gerrig, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gibbs, 2000)</ref>. In this paper, we use irony as an umbrella term that covers these devices focusing for the first time on the automatic detection of irony in French tweets.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grice et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Searle, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Attardo, 2000</ref>), the search for a non-literal meaning starts when the hearer realizes that the speaker's utterance is context-inappropriate, that is an utterance fails to make sense against the context. For example, the tweet: "Congratulation #lesbleus for your great match!" is ironic if the French soccer team has lost the match. An analysis of a corpus of French tweets shows that there are two ways to infer such a context: (a) rely exclu- sively on the lexical clues internal to the utterance, or (b) combine these clues with an additional pragmatic context external to the utterance. In (a), the speaker in- tentionally creates an explicit juxtaposition of incom- patible actions or words that can either have opposite polarities, or can be semantically unrelated, as in "The</p><p>Voice is more important than Fukushima tonight". Ex- plicit opposition can also arise from an explicit posi- tive/negative contrast between a subjective proposition and a situation that describes an undesirable activity or state. For instance, in " I love when my phone turns the volume down automatically" the writer assumes that every one expects its cell phone to ring loud enough to be heard. In (b), irony is due to an implicit opposi- tion between a lexicalized proposition P describing an event or state and a pragmatic context external to the utterance in which P is false or is not likely to happen. In other words, the writer asserts or affirms P while he intends to convey P such that P = N ot(P ) or P = P . The irony occurs because the writer believes that his audience can detect the disparity between P and P on the basis of contextual knowledge or com- mon background shared with the writer. For example, in "#Hollande is really a good diplomat #Algeria.", the writer critics the foreign policy of the French president Hollande in Algeria, whereas in "The #NSA wiretapped a whole country. No worries for #Belgium: it is not a whole country.", the irony occurs because the fact in bold font is not true.</p><p>Irony detection is quite a hot topic in the research community also due to its importance for efficient sentiment analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ghosh et al., 2015)</ref>. Several ap- proaches have been proposed to detect irony casting the problem into a binary classification task relying on a variety of features. Most of them are gleaned from the utterance internal context going from n-grams models, stylistic (punctuation, emoticons, quotations, etc.), to dictionary-based features (sentiment and af- fect dictionaries, slang languages, etc.). These fea- tures have shown to be useful to learn whether a text span is ironic/sarcastic or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burfoot and Baldwin, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">GonzalezIbanez et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Reyes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barbieri and Saggion, 2014</ref>). However, many authors pointed out the necessity of additional pragmatic features: <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Utsumi, 2004</ref>) showed that opposition, rhetorical ques- tions and the politeness level are relevant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burfoot and Baldwin, 2009</ref>) focused on satire detection in newswire articles and introduced the notion of valid- ity which models absurdity by identifying a conjunc-tion of named entities present in a given document and queries the web for the conjunction of those entities. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gonzalez-Ibanez et al., 2011</ref>) exploited the common ground between speaker and hearer by looking if a tweet is a reply to another tweet. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Reyes et al., 2013)</ref> employed opposition in time (adverbs of time such as now and suddenly) and context imbalance to estimate the semantic similarity of concepts in a text to each other. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barbieri and Saggion, 2014</ref>) captured the gap between rare and common words as well as the use of common vs. rare synonyms. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buschmeier et al., 2014</ref>) measured the imbalance between the overall polarity of words in a review and the star-rating. Most of these pragmatic features rely on linguistic aspects of the tweet by using only the text of the tweet. We aim here to go further by proposing a novel computational model able to capture the "outside of the utterance" context needed to infer irony in implicit oppositions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>An analysis of a corpus of French ironic tweets ran- domly chosen from various topics shows that more than 62.75% of tweets contain explicit negation mark- ers such as "ne...pas" (not) or negative polarity items like "jamais" (never) or "personne" (nobody). Nega- tion seems thus to be an important clue in ironic state- ments, at least in French. This rises the following hy- potheses: (H1) the presence of negations, as an internal propriety of an utterance, can help to detect the dis- parity between the literal and the intended meaning of an utterance, and (H2) a tweet containing an asserted fact of the form N ot(P ) is ironic if and only if one can prove P on the basis of some external common knowledge to the utterance shared by the author and the reader.</p><p>To test the validity of the above hypotheses, we pro- pose a novel three-step model involving three succes- sive stages: (1) detect if a tweet is ironic or not relying exclusively on the information internal to the tweet. We use a supervised learning method relying on both state of the art features whose efficiency has been empiri- cally proved and new groups of features. (2) Test this internal context against the "outside of the utterance" context. We design an algorithm that takes the clas- sifier's outputs and corrects the misclassified ironic in- stances of the form N ot(P ) by looking for P in reliable external sources of information on the Web, such as Wikipedia or online newspapers. We experiment when labels are given by gold standard annotations and when they are predicted by the classifier. (3) If the literal meaning fails to make sense, i.e. P is found, then the tweet is likely to convey a non-literal meaning.</p><p>To this end, we collected a corpus of 6,742 French tweets using the Tweeter API focusing on tweets rel- ative to a set of topics discussed in the media during Spring 2014. Our intuition behind choosing such top- ics is that a media-friendly topic is more likely to be found in external sources of information. We chose 184 topics split into 9 categories (politics, sport, etc.). For each topic, we selected a set of keywords with and without hashtag: politics (e.g. Sarkozy, Hollande, UMP), health (e.g. cancer, flu), sport (e.g. #Zlatan, #FIFAworldcup), social media (e.g. #Facebook, Skype, MSN), artists (e.g. Rihanna, Beyoncé), TV shows (e.g. TheVoice, XFactor), countries or cities (e.g. NorthKo- rea, Brasil), the Arab Spring (e.g. Marzouki, Ben Ali) and some other generic topics (e.g. pollution, racism). Then we selected ironic tweets containing the topic keywords, the #ironie or #sarcasme hashtag and a negation word as well as ironic tweets containing only the topic keywords with #ironie or #sarcasme hashtag but no negation word. Finally, we selected non ironic tweets that contained either the topic keywords and a negation word, or only the topic keywords. We re- moved duplicates, retweets and tweets containing pic- tures which would need to be interpreted to understand the ironic content. Irony hashtags (#ironie or #sar- casme) are removed from the tweets for the following experiments. To guarantee that tweets with negation words contain true negations, we automatically identi- fied negation usage of a given word using a French syn- tactic dependency parser 1 . We then designed dedicated rules to correct the parser's decisions if necessary. At the end, we got a total of 4,231 tweets with negation and 2,511 without negation, among them, 30.42% are ironic with negation and 72.36% are non ironic with negation. At the end, we got a total of 4,231 tweets with negation and 2,511 without negation: among them, 30.42% are ironic with negation and 72.36% are non ironic with negation. To capture the effect of nega- tion on our task, we split these tweets in three cor- pora: tweets with negation only (NegOnly), tweets with no negation (NoNeg), and a corpus that gathers all the tweets of the previous 2 corpora (All). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the repartition of tweets in our corpora.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corpus</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Binary classifier</head><p>We experiment with SMO under the Weka toolkit with standard parameters. We also evaluated other learning algorithms (naive bayes, decision trees, logistic regres- sion) but the results were not as good as those obtained with SMO. We have built three classifiers, one for each corpus, namely C N eg , C N oN eg , and C All . Since the number of ironic instances in the first corpus is rela- tively small, we learn C N eg with 10-cross validation on a balanced subset of 940 tweets. For the second and the last classifiers, we used 80% of the corpus for training and 20% for test, with an equal distribution between the ironic (henceforth IR) and non ironic (henceforth NIR) instances 2 . The results presented in this paper have been obtained when training C N oN eg on 1,720 and testing on 430 tweets. C All has been trained on 2,472 tweets (1432 contain negation -404 IR and 1028 NIR) and tested on 618 tweets (360 contain negation - 66 IR and 294 NIR). For each classifier, we represent each tweet with a vector composed of six groups of fea- tures. Most of them are state of the art features, others, in italic font are new. Surface features include tweet length in words ( , the presence or absence of punc- tuation marks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gonzalez-Ibanez et al., 2011</ref>), words in capital letters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Reyes et al., 2013</ref>), interjections ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gonzalez-Ibanez et al., 2011</ref>), emoticons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buschmeier et al., 2014</ref>), quotations ( , slang words <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burfoot and Baldwin, 2009</ref>), opposition words such as "but" and "although" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Utsumi, 2004</ref>), a sequence of ex- clamation or a sequence of question marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carvalho et al., 2009</ref>), a combination of both exclamation and ques- tion marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buschmeier et al., 2014</ref>) and finally, the presence of discourse connectives that do not convey opposition such as "hence, therefore, as a result" since we assume that non ironic tweets are likely to be more verbose. To implement these features, we rely on man- ually built French lexicons to deal with interjections, emoticons, slang language, and discourse connectives ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Roze et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Sentiment features consist of features that check for the presence of positive/negative opinion words (Reyes and Rosso, 2012) and the number of positive and neg- ative opinion words ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barbieri and Saggion, 2014</ref>). We add three new features: the presence of words that ex- press surprise or astonishment, and the presence and the number of neutral opinions. To get these features we use two lexicons: CASOAR, a French opinion lexi- con ( <ref type="bibr">Benamara et al., 2014)</ref> </p><note type="other">and EMOTAIX, a publicly available French emotion and affect lexicon. Sentiment shifter features group checks if a given tweet contains an opinion word which is in the scope of an intensifier adverb or a modality. Shifter features tests if a tweet contains an intensi- fier (Liebrecht et al., 2013), a negation word (Reyes et al., 2013), or reporting speech verbs.</note><p>Opposition features are new and check for the pres- ence of specific lexico-syntactic patterns that verify whether a tweet contains a sentiment opposition or an explicit positive/negative contrast between a subjective proposition and an objective one. These features have been partly inspired from ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Riloff et al., 2013</ref>) who proposed a bootstrapping algorithm to detect sarcas- tic tweets of the form [P + ]. <ref type="bibr">[P obj</ref> ] which corresponds to a contrast between positive sentiment and an ob- jective negative situation. We extended this pattern to capture additional types of explicit oppositions. Some of our patterns include:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[N eg(P + )].[P + ], [P − ].[P + ], [N eg(P + )].[P obj ], [P obj ].[P − ].</formula><p>We consider that an opinion expression is under the scope of a negation if it is separated by a maximum of two tokens.</p><p>Finally, internal contextual deals with the pres- ence/absence of personal pronouns, topic keywords and named entities, as predicted by the parser's outputs.</p><p>For each classifier, we investigated how each group of features contributes to the learning process. We applied to each training set a feature selection algo- rithm (Chi2 and GainRatio), then trained the classifiers over all relevant features of each group <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . In all experi- ments, we used all surface features as baseline. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> presents the result in terms of precision (P), recall (R), macro-averaged F-score (MAF) and accuracy (A). We can see that C All achieves better results. An analysis of the best features combination for each classifier sug- gests four main conclusions: (1) surface features are primordial for irony detection. This is more salient for NoNeg. (2) Negation is an important feature for our task. However, having it alone is not enough to find ironic instances. Indeed, among the 76 misclassified in- stances in C All , 60% contain negation clues (37 IR and 9 NIR). (3) When negation is concerned, opposition features are among the most productive. (4) Explicit opinion words (i.e sentiment and sentiment shifter) are likely to be used in tweets with no negation. More im- portantly, these results empirically validate hypothesis (H1), i.e. negation is a good clue to detect irony.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Results for the best features combination.</p><p>Error analysis shows that misclassification of ironic instances is mainly due to four factors: presence of sim- iles (ironic comparison) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , absence of context within the utterance (most frequent case), humor and satire 5 , and wrong #ironie or #sarcasme tags. The absence of con- text can manifest itself in several ways: (1) there is no pointer that helps to identify the main topic of the tweet, as in "I've been missing her, damn!". Even if the topic is present, it is often lexicalized in several col- lapsed words or funny hashtags (#baddays, #aprilfoll),</p><p>which are hard to automatically analyze. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> The irony is about specific situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Shelley, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> False assertions about hot topics, like in "Don't worry. Sene- gal is the world champion soccer". (4) Oppositions that involve a contradiction between two words that are se- mantically unrelated, a named entity and a given event (e.g. "Tchad and "democratic election"), etc. Case <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> is more frequent in the NoNeg corpus.</p><p>Knowing that tweets with negation represent 62.75% of our corpus, and given that irony can focus on the negation of a word or a proposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Haverkate, 1990)</ref>, we propose to improve the classification of these tweets by identifying the absurdity of their content, follow- ing Attardo's relevant inappropriateness model of irony <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Attardo, 2000</ref>) in which a violation of contextual ap- propriateness signals ironical intent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Deriving the pragmatic context</head><p>The proposed model included two parts: binary classi- fiers trained with tweet features, and an algorithm that corrects the outputs of the classifiers which are likely to be misclassified. These two phases can be applied successively or together. In this latter case, the algo- rithm outputs are integrated into the classifiers and the corrected instances are used in the training process of the binary classifier. In this paper, we only present re- sults of the two phases applied successively because it achieved better results.</p><p>Our approach is to query Google via its API to check the veracity of tweets with negation that have been classified as non ironic by the binary classifier in or- der to correct the misclassified tweets (if a tweet say- ing N ot(P ) has been classified as non-ironic but P is found online, then we assume that the opposite content is checked so the tweet class is changed into ironic). Let W ordsT be the set of words excluding stop words that belong to a tweet t, and let kw be the topic key- word used to collect t. Let N ⊂ W ordsT be the set of negation words of t. The algorithm is as follows: 1. Segment t into a set of sentences S. 2. For each s ∈ S such that ∃neg ∈ N and neg ∈ s:</p><p>2.1 Remove # and @ symbols, emoticons, and neg, then extract the set of tokens P ⊂ s that are on the scope of neg (in a distance of 2 tokens).</p><p>2.2 Generate a query Q 1 = P ∪ kw and submit it to Google which will return 20 results (title+snippet) or less.</p><p>2.3 Among the returned results, keep only the reliable ones (Wikipedia, online newspapers, web sites that do not contain "blog" or "twitter" in their URL). Then, for each result, if the query keywords are found in the title or in the snippet, then t is considered as ironic. STOP. 3. Generate a second query Q 2 = (W ordsT −N )∪kw and submit it again to Google and follow the procedure in 2.3. If Q 2 is found, then t is considered as ironic. Otherwise, the class predicted by the classifier does not change.</p><p>Let us illustrate our algorithm with the topic Valls and the tweet: #Valls has learnt that Sarkozy was wiretapped in newspapers. Fortunately he is not the interior minister. The first step leads to two sentences s 1 (#Valls has learnt that Sarkozy was wiretapped in newspapers.) and s 2 (Fortunately he is not the interior minister). From s 2 , we re- move the negation word "not", isolate the negation scope P = {interior, minister} and generate the query Q 1 = {V alls interior minister}. The step 2.3 allows to retrieve the result: &lt;Title&gt;Manuel Valls -Wikipedia, the free encyclope- dia&lt;/Title&gt; &lt;Snippet&gt;... French politician. For the Spanish com- poser, see Manuel Valls (composer). .... Valls was ap- pointed Minister of the Interior in the Ayrault Cabinet in May 2012.&lt;/Snippet&gt;.</p><p>All query keywords were found in this snippet (in bold font), we can then conclude that the tweet is ironic.</p><p>We made several experiments to evaluate how the query-based method improves tweet classification. For this purpose, we have applied the method on both cor- pora All and Neg: x A first experiment evaluates the method on tweets with negation classified as NIR but which are ironic according to gold annotations. This experiment represents an ideal case which we try to achieve or improve through other ones. y: A sec- ond experiment consists in applying the method on all tweets with negation that have been classified as NIR by the classifier, no matter if the predicted class is cor- rect or not. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the results for both experi- ments.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Results for the query-based method.</p><p>All scores for the query-based method are statis- tically significant compared to the classifier's scores (p value &lt; 0, 0001 when calculated with the McNe- mar's test.). An error analysis shows that 65% of tweets that are still misclassified with this method are tweets for which finding their content online is almost impos- sible because they are personal tweets or lack internal context. A conclusion that can be drawn is that this method should not be applied on this type of tweets. For this purpose, we made the same experiments only on tweets with different combinations of relevant fea- tures. The best results are obtained when the method is applied only on NIR tweets with negation selected via the internal context features, more precisely on tweets which do not contain a personal pronoun and which contain named entities: these results are coherent with the fact that tweets containing personal pronouns and no named entity are likely to relate personal content im- possible to validate on the Web (e.g. I've been missing her, damn! #ironie). <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the results for these experiments. All scores for the query-based method are also statistically significant compared to the classifier's scores.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Results when applied on "non-personal" tweets.</p><p>For experiment x, on All, the method is not applied because all misclassified tweets contain a personal pro- noun and no named entity. The query-based method outperforms the classifier in all cases, except on All where results on Google were found for only 42.5% of queries whereas more than 50% of queries found results in all other experiments (maximum is 66.6% in NegOnly). Tweets for which no result is found are tweets with named entities but which do not relate an event or a statement (e.g. AHAHAHAHAHA! NO RE- SPECT #Legorafi, where "Legorafi" is a satirical news- paper). To evaluate the task difficulty, two annotators were also asked to label as ironic or not the 50 tweets (40+18) for which the method is applied. The inter- annotator score (Cohen's Kappa) between both anno- tators is only κ = 0.41. Among the 12 reclassifica- tions into IR, both annotators disagree with each other for 5 of them. Even if this experiment is not strong enough to lead to a formal conclusion because of the small number of tweets, this tends to show that human beings would not do it better.</p><p>It is interesting to note that even if internal context features were not relevant for automatic tweet classifi- cation, our results show that they are useful for classifi- cation improvement. As shown by x, the query-based method is more effective when applied on misclassi- fied tweets. We can then consider that using internal contextual features (presence of personal pronouns and named entities) can be a way to automatically detect tweets that are likely to be misclassified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>This paper proposed a model to identify irony in im- plicit oppositions in French. As far as we know, this is the first work on irony detection in French on Twit- ter data. Comparing to other languages, our results are very encouraging. For example, sarcasm detection achieved 30% precision in Dutch tweets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liebrecht et al., 2013</ref>) while irony detection in English data resulted in 79% precision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Reyes et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>We treat French irony as an overall term that covers other figurative language devices such as sarcasm, hu- mor, etc. This is a first step before moving to a more fine-grained automatic identification of figurative lan- guage in French. For interesting discussions on the dis- tinction/similarity between irony and sarcasm hastags, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Wang, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>One of the main contribution of this study is that the proposed model does not rely only on the lexical clues of a tweet, but also on its pragmatic context. Our in- tuition is that a tweet containing an asserted fact of the form N ot(P 1 ) is ironic if and only if one can prove P 1 on the basis of some external information. This form of tweets is quite frequent in French (more than 62.75% of our data contain explicit negation words), which sug- gests two hypotheses: (H1) negation can be a good in- dicator to detect irony, and (H2) external context can help to detect the absurdity of ironic content.</p><p>To validate if negation helps, we built binary clas- sifiers using both state of the art features and new features (explicit and implicit opposition, sentiment shifter, discourse connectives). Overall accuracies were good when the data contain both tweets with negation and no negation but lower when tweets con- tain only negation or no negation at all. Error anal- ysis show that major errors come from the presence of implicit oppositions, particularly in C N eg and C All . These results empirically validate hypothesis (H1). Negation has been shown to be very helpful in many NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wiegand et al., 2010)</ref>. It has also been used as a feature to detect irony ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Reyes et al., 2013)</ref>. However, no one has empirically measured how irony classification behaves in the pres- ence or absence of negation in the data.</p><p>To test (H2), we proposed a query-based method that corrects the classifier's outputs in order to retrieve false assertions. Our experiments show that the classification after applying Google searches in reliable web sites sig- nificantly improves the classifier accuracy when tested on C N eg . In addition, we show that internal context features are useful to improve classification. These re- sults empirically validate (H2). However, even though the algorithm improves the classifier performance, the number of queries is small which suggests that a much larger dataset is needed. As for negation, querying ex- ternal source of information has been shown to give an improvement over the basic features for many NLP tasks (for example, in question-answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Moldovan et al., 2002)</ref>). However, as far as we know, this ap- proach has not been used for irony classification.</p><p>This study is a first step towards improving irony de- tection relying on external context. We plan to study other ways to retrieve such a context like the conversa- tion thread.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" validated="false"><head>Table 1 : Tweet repartition.</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table></table></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> We have used Malt as a syntactic parser.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> For CNoNeg and C All , we also tested 10-cross validation with a balanced distribution between the ironic and nonironic instances but results were not conclusive.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Results with all features are lower. 4 e.g. &quot;Benzema in the French team is like Sunday. He is of no use.. :D&quot; 5 e.g. &quot;I propose that we send Hollande instead of the space probes on the next comet, it will save time and money ;) #HUMOUR&quot;</note>
