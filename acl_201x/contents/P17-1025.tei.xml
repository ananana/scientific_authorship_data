				<p>Learning commonsense knowledge from natural language text is nontrivial due to reporting bias: people rarely state the obvious , e.g., &quot;My house is bigger than me.&quot; However, while rarely stated explicitly, this trivial everyday knowledge does influence the way people talk about the world, which provides indirect clues to reason about the world. For example, a statement like, &quot;Tyler entered his house&quot; implies that his house is bigger than Tyler. In this paper, we present an approach to infer relative physical knowledge of actions and objects along five dimensions (e.g., size, weight, and strength) from un-structured natural language text. We frame knowledge acquisition as joint inference over two closely related problems: learning (1) relative physical knowledge of object pairs and (2) physical implications of actions when applied to those object pairs. Empirical results demonstrate that it is possible to extract knowledge of actions and objects from language and that joint inference over different types of knowledge improves performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Reading and reasoning about natural language text often requires trivial knowledge about everyday physical actions and objects. For example, given a sentence "Shanice could fit the trophy into the suitcase," we can trivially infer that the trophy must be smaller than the suitcase even though it is not stated explicitly. This reasoning requires knowledge about the action "fit"-in particular, typical preconditions that need to be satisfied in order to perform the action. In addition, reasoning about the applicability of various physical actions in a given situation often requires background knowledge about objects in the world, for exam- ple, that people are usually smaller than houses, that cars generally move faster than humans walk, or that a brick probably is heavier than a feather.</p><p>In fact, the potential use of such knowledge about everyday actions and objects can go beyond language understanding and reasoning. Many open challenges in computer vision and robotics may also benefit from such knowledge, as shown in recent work that requires visual reasoning and entailment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Izadinia et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhu et al., 2014</ref>). Ideally, an AI system should acquire such knowl- edge through direct physical interactions with the world. However, such a physically interactive sys- tem does not seem feasible in the foreseeable fu- ture.</p><p>In this paper, we present an approach to ac- quire trivial physical knowledge from unstructured natural language text as an alternative knowledge source. In particular, we focus on acquiring rel- ative physical knowledge of actions and objects organized along five dimensions: size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates example knowledge of (1) relative physical rela- tions of object pairs and (2) physical implications of actions when applied to those object pairs.</p><p>While natural language text is a rich source to obtain broad knowledge about the world, compil- ing trivial commonsense knowledge from unstruc- tured text is a nontrivial feat. The central challenge lies in reporting bias: people rarely states the obvi- ous <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gordon and Van Durme, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sorower et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Misra et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>, since it goes against Grice's conversational maxim on the quantity of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Grice, 1975)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we demonstrate that it is possi- ble to overcome reporting bias and still extract the unspoken knowledge from language. The key in- sight is this: there is consistency in the way people describe how they interact with the world, which provides vital clues to reverse engineer the com- mon knowledge shared among people. More con- cretely, we frame knowledge acquisition as joint inference over two closely related puzzles: in- ferring relative physical knowledge about object pairs while simultaneously reasoning about physi- cal implications of actions.</p><p>Importantly, four of five dimensions of knowl- edge in our study-weight, strength, rigidness, and speed-are either not visual or not easily rec- ognizable by image recognition using currently available computer vision techniques. Thus, our work provides unique value to complement re- cent attempts to acquire commonsense knowledge from web images ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Izadinia et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bagherinezhad et al., 2016;</ref>.</p><p>In sum, our contributions are threefold:</p><p>• We introduce a new task in the domain of commonsense knowledge extraction from language, focusing on the physical implica- tions of actions and the relative physical re- lations among objects, organized along five dimensions.</p><p>• We propose a model that can infer relations over grounded object pairs together with first order relations implied by physical verbs.</p><p>• We develop a new dataset VERBPHYSICS that compiles crowdsourced knowledge of actions and objects. 1</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first provide the formal definition of knowledge we aim to learn in Section 2. We then describe our data collection in Section 3 and present our in- ference model in Section 4. Empirical results are given in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6. We review related work in Section 7 and conclude in Section 8.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Knowledge Dimensions</head><p>We consider five dimensions of relative physical knowledge in this work: size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed. "Strength" in our work refers to the physical durability of an object (e.g., "diamond" is stronger than "glass"), while "rigid- ness" refers to the physical flexibility of an object (e.g., "glass" is more rigid than a "wire"). When considered in verb implications, size, weight, strength, and rigidness concern individual-level semantics; the relative properties implied by verbs in these dimensions are true in general. On the other hand, speed concerns stage-level semantics; its implied relations hold only during a window surrounding the verb. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Relative physical knowledge</head><p>Let us first consider the problem of representing relative physical knowledge between two objects. We can write a single piece of knowledge like "A person is larger than a basketball" as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">person &gt; size basketball</formula><p>Any propositional statement can have exceptions and counterexamples. Moreover, we need to cope with uncertainties involved in knowledge acquisi- tion. Therefore, we assume each piece of knowl- edge is associated with a probability distribution. More formally, given objects x and y, we define a random variable O a x,y whose range is {&gt;, &lt;, } with respect to a knowledge dimension a ∈ {SIZE,WEIGHT,STRENGTH,RIGIDNESS,SPEED} so that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(O a</formula><p>x,y = r), r ∈ {&gt;, &lt;, }. This immediately provides two simple properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P(O x,y = &gt;) = P(O y,x = &lt;) P(O x,x = ) = 1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Physical Implications of Verbs</head><p>Next we consider representing relative physical implications of actions applied over two objects. For example, consider an action frame "x threw y." In general, following implications are likely to be true: "x threw y" =⇒ x &gt; size y "x threw y" =⇒ x &gt; weight y "x threw y" =⇒ x &lt; speed y Again, in order to cope with exceptions and uncer- tainties, we assume a probability distribution asso- ciated with each implication. More formally, we define a random variable F a v to denote the impli- cation of the action verb v when applied over its arguments x and y with respect to a knowledge di- mension a so that: P(F size threw = &gt;) := P("x threw y" ⇒ x &gt; size y) P(F wgt threw = &gt;) := P("x threw y" ⇒ x &gt; wgt y) where the range of F size threw is {&gt;, &lt;, }. Intu- itively, F size threw represents the likely first order re- lation implied by "throw" over ungrounded (i.e., variable) object pairs.</p><p>The above definition assumes that there is only a single implication relation for any given verb with respect to a specific knowledge dimension. This is generally not true, since a verb, especially a common action verb, can often invoke a number of different frames according to frame semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fillmore, 1976)</ref>. Thus, given a number of differ- ent frame relations v 1 ...v T associated with a verb v, we define random variables F with respect to a specific frame relation v t , i.e., F a vt . We use this notation going forward.</p><p>Frame Perspective on Verb Implications: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig- ure 2</ref> illustrates the frame-centric view of physical implication knowledge we aim to learn. Impor- tantly, the key insight of our work is inspired by Fillmore's original manuscript on frame seman- tics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fillmore, 1976)</ref>. Fillmore has argued that "frames"-the contexts in which utterances are situated-should be considered as a third primi- tive of describing a language, along with a gram- mar and lexicon. While existing frame annotations such as FrameNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baker et al., 1998</ref>), <ref type="bibr">PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005</ref>), and VerbNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kipper et al., 2000</ref>) provide rich frame knowledge associated with a predicate, none of them provide the exact kind of physical implications we consider in our paper. Thus, our work can potentially contribute to these resources by investigating new approaches to automatically recover richer frame knowledge from language. In addition, our work is motivated by the formal semantics of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dowty (1991)</ref>, as the task of learning verb implications is essentially that of extracting lexical entailments for verbs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data and Crowdsourced Knowledge</head><p>Action Verbs: We pick 50 classes of Levin verbs from both "alternation classes" and "verb classes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Levin, 1993)</ref>, which corresponds to about 1100 unique verbs. We sort this list by fre- quency of occurrence in our frame patterns in the Google Syntax Ngrams corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goldberg and Orwant, 2013</ref>) and pick the top 100 verbs.</p><p>Action Frames: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates examples of action frame relations. Because we consider implications over pairwise argument relations for each frame, there are sometimes multiple frame relations we consider for a single frame. To enu- merate action frame relations for each verb, we use syntactic patterns based on dependency parse by extracting the core components (subject, verb, di- rect object, prepositional object) of an action, then map the subject to an agent, the direct object to a theme, and the prepositional object to a goal. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> For those frames that involve an argument in a prepo- sitional phrase, we create a separate frame for each preposition based on the statistics observed in the Google Syntax Ngram corpus.</p><p>Because the syntax ngram corpus provides only tree snippets without context, this way of enu- merating potential frame patterns tend to over- generate. Thus we refine our prepositions for each frame by taking either the intersection or union with the top 5 Google Surface Ngrams ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Michel et al., 2011</ref>), depending on whether the frame was under-or over-generating. We also add an ad- ditional crowdsourcing step where we ask crowd workers to judge whether a frame pattern with a particular verb and preposition could plausibly be found in a sentence. <ref type="bibr">This</ref>   Frames are partitioned by verb. Counts are shown for usable data, which includes only ≥ 2/3 agree- ment and removes all with "no relation." Each pre- diction task (frames or object pairs) is given 5% of that domain's data as seed. We compare models using either 5% or 20% of the other domain's data as seed.</p><p>Object Pairs: To provide a source of ground truth relations between objects, we select the ob- ject pairs that occur in the 813 frame templates with positive pointwise mutual information (PMI) across the Google Syntax Ngram corpus. After replacing a small set of "human" nouns with a generic HUMAN object, filtering out nouns labeled as abstract by WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Miller, 1995)</ref>, and distill- ing all surface forms to their lemmas (also with WordNet), the result is 3656 object pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Crowdsourcing Knowledge</head><p>We collect human judgements of the frame knowl- edge implications to use as a small set of seed knowledge (5%), a development set (45%), and a test set (50%). Crowd workers are given with a frame template such as "x threw y," and then asked to list a few plausible objects (including people and animals) for the missing slots (e.g., x and y). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We then ask them to rate the general relationship that the arguments of the frame exhibit with re- spect to all knowledge dimensions (size, weight, etc.). For each knowledge dimension, or attribute, a, workers select an answer from (1) x &gt; a y, (2) x &lt; a y, (3) x a y, or (4) no general relation. We conduct a similar crowdsourcing step for the set of object pairs. We ask crowd workers to compare each of the 3656 object pairs along the five knowledge dimensions we consider, se- lecting an answer from the same options above as with frames. We reserve 50% of the data as a test set, and split the remainder up either 5% / 45% or 20% / 30% (seed / development) to investigate the effects of different seed knowledge sizes on the model. Statistics for the dataset are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. About 90% of the frames as well as object pairs had 2/3 agreement between workers. After remov- ing frame/attribute combinations and object pairs that received less than 2/3 agreement, or were se- lected by at least 2/3 workers to have no relation, we end up with roughly 400-600 usable frames and 2100-2500 usable object pairs per attribute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Model</head><p>We model knowledge acquisition as probabilistic inference over a factor graph of knowledge. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the graph consists of multiple substrates (page-wide boxes) corresponding to dif- ferent knowledge dimensions (shown only three of them -strength, size, weight-for brevity). Each substrate consists of two types of sub-graphs: verb subgraphs and object subgraphs, which are con- nected through factors that quantify action-object compatibilities. Connecting across substrates are factors that model inter-dependencies across dif- ferent knowledge dimensions. In what follows, we describe each graph component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Nodes</head><p>The factor graph contains two types of nodes in or- der to capture two classes of knowledge. The first type of nodes are object pair nodes. Each object pair node is a random variable O a x,y which cap- tures the relative strength of an attribute a between objects x and y.</p><p>The second type of nodes are frame nodes. Each frame node is a random variable F a vt . This corre- sponds to the verb v used in a particular type of frame t, and captures the implied knowledge the frame v t holds along an attribute a.</p><p>All random variables take on the values {&gt;, &lt;, }. For an object pair node O a x,y , the value represents the belief about the relation be- tween x and y along the attribute a. For a frame node F a vt , the value represents the belief about the relation along the attribute a between any two ob- jects that might be used in the frame v t .</p><p>We denote the sets of all object pair and frame random variables O and F, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Action-Object Compatibility</head><p>The key aspect of our work is to reason about two types of knowledge simultaneously: relative knowledge of grounded object pairs, and implica- tions of actions related to those objects. Thus we connect the verb subgraphs and object subgraphs through selectional preference factors ψ s between two such nodes O a x,y and F a vt if we find evidence from text that suggests objects x and y are used in the frame v t . These factors encourage both ran- dom variables to agree on the same value.</p><p>As an example, consider a node O size p,b which represents the relative size of a person and a bas- ketball, and a node F size threw dobj which represents the relative size implied by an "x threw y" frame. If we find significant evidence in text that " <ref type="bibr">[person]</ref> threw <ref type="bibr">[basketball]</ref>" occurs, we would add a se- lectional preference factor to connect O size p,b with F size threw dobj and encourage them towards the same value. This means that if it is discovered that peo- ple are larger than basketballs (the value &gt;), then we would expect the frame "x threw y" to entail x &gt; size y (also the value &gt;).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Semantic Similarities</head><p>Some frames have relatively sparse text evidences to support their corresponding knowledge acqui- sition. Thus, we include several types of factors based on semantic similarities as described below.</p><p>Cross-Verb Frame Similarity: We add a group of factors ψ v between two verbs v and u (to con- nect a specific frame of v with a corresponding frame of u) based on the verb-level similarities.</p><p>Within-Verb Frame Similarity: Within each verb v, which consists of a set of frame relations v 1 , ...v T , we also include frame-level similarity factors ψ f between v i and v j . This gives us more evidence over a broader range of frames when tex- tual evidence might be sparse.  Object Similarity: As with verbs, we add fac- tors ψ o that encourage similar pairs of objects to take the same value. Given that each node rep- resents a pair of objects, finding that x and y are similar yields two main cases in how to add fac- tors (aside from the trivial case where the variable O a x,y is given a unary factor to encourage the value ).</p><p>1. If nodes O x,z and O y,z exist, we expect ob- jects x and y to both have a similar relation to z. We add a factor that encourages O x,z and O y,z to take the same value. The same is true if nodes O z,x and O z,y exist.</p><p>2. On the other hand, if nodes O x,z and O z,y ex- ist, we expect these two nodes to reach the opposite decision. In this case, we add a fac- tor that encourages one node to take the value &gt; if the other prefers the value &lt;, and vice versa. (For the case of , if one prefers that value, then both should.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Cross-Knowledge Correlation</head><p>Some knowledge dimensions, such as size and weight, have a significant correlation in their im- plied relations. For two such attributes a and b, if the same frame F a v i and F b v i exists in both graphs, we add a factor ψ a between them to push them to- wards taking the same value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Seed Knowledge</head><p>In order to kick off learning, we provide a small set of seed knowledge among the random variables in {O, F} with seed factors ψ seed . These unary seed factors push the belief for its associated random variable strongly towards the seed label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Potential Functions</head><p>Unary Factors: For all frame and object pair random variables in the training set, we train a maximum entropy classifier to predict the value of the variable. We then use the probabilities of the classifier as potentials for seed factors given to all random variables in their class (frame or ob- ject pair). Each log-linear classifier is trained sep- arately per attribute on a featurized vector of the variable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P(r|X a ) ∝ e wa·f (X a )</formula><p>The feature function is defined differently accord- ing to the node type:  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Accuracy of baselines and our model on both tasks. Top: frame prediction task; bottom: object pair prediction task. In both tasks 5% of in-domain data (frames or object pairs, respectively) are available as seed data. We compare providing the other type of data (object pairs or frames, respectively) as seed knowledge, trying 5% (OUR MODEL (A)) and 20% (OUR MODEL (B)).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f (O a p,q ) := g(p), g(q) f (F a vt ) := h(t), g(v), g(t)</formula><p>Here g(x) is the GloVe word embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) for the word x (t is the frame relation's preposition, and g(t) is simply set to the zero vector if there is no preposition) and h(t) is a one-hot vector of the frame relation type. We use GloVe vectors of 100 dimensions for verbs and 50 dimensions for objects and prepositions (the di- mensions picked based on development set).</p><p>Binary Factors: In the case of all other factors, we use a "soft 1" agreement matrix with strong signal down the diagonals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">  &gt; &lt; &gt; 0.7 0.1 0.2 0.15 0.7 0.15 &lt; 0.2 0.1 0.7  </formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Inference</head><p>After our full graph is constructed, we use belief propagation to infer the assignments of frames and object pairs not in our training data. Each mes- sage µ is a vector where each element is the prob- ability that a random variable takes on each value x ∈ {&gt;, &lt;, }. A message passed from a ran- dom variable v to a neighboring factor f about the value x is the product of the messages from its other neighboring factors about x:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">µ v→f (x) ∝ f ∈N (v)\{f } µ f →v (x)</formula><p>A message passed from a factor f with potential ψ to a random variable v about its value x is a marginalized belief about v taking value x from the other neighboring random variables combined with its potential:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">µ f →v (x) ∝ x:x[v]=x ψ(x) v ∈N (f )\{v} µ v →f (x[v ])</formula><p>After stopping belief propagation, the marginals for a node can be computed and used as a deci- sion for that random variable. The marginal for v taking value x is the product of its surrounding factors' messages:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">v(x) ∝ f ∈N (v) µ f →v (x)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Results</head><p>Factor Graph Construction: We first need to pick a set of frames and objects to determine our set of random variables. The frames are simply the subset of the frames that were crowdsourced in the given configuration (e.g., seed + dev), with "soft 1" unary seed factors (the gold label indexed row of the binary factor matrix) given only to those in the seed set. The same selection criteria and seed factors are applied to the crowdsourced ob- ject pairs.</p><p>For lexical similarity factors (ψ v , ψ o ), we pick connections based on the cosine similarity scores of GloVe vectors thresholded above a value chosen based on development set performance. Attribute similarity factors (ψ a ) are chosen based on sets of frames that reach largely the same decisions on the seed data (95%). Frame similarity factors (ψ f ) are added to pairs of frames with linguistically sim- ilar constructions. Finally, selectional preference    <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Example model predictions on dev set frames. The model's confidence is shown by the bars on the right. The correct relation is high- lighted in orange (6-10 are failure cases for the model). If there are two blanks, the relation is be- tween them. If there is only one blank, the relation is between PERSON and the blank. Note that receives miniscule weight because it is never the correct value for frames in the seed set. factors (ψ s ) are picked by using a threshold (also tuned on the development set) of pointwise mu- tual information (PMI) between the frames and the object pairs' occurrences in the Google Syn- tax Ngram corpus.</p><p>For each task, we consider the set of factors to include in each model a hyperparameter, which is also tuned on the development set.</p><p>Baselines: Baselines include making a RAN- DOM choice, picking between &gt;, &lt;, and ), pick- ing the MAJORITY label, and a maximum entropy classifier based on the embedding representations (EMB-MAXENT) defined in Section 4.6.</p><p>Inferring Knowledge of Actions: Our first ex- periment is to predict knowledge implied by new frames. In this task, 5% of the frames are avail- able as seed knowledge.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Metaphorical Language: While our frame pat- terns are intended to capture action verbs, our tem- plates also match senses of those verbs that can be used with abstract or metaphorical arguments, rather than directly physical ones. One exam- ple from the development set is "x contained y." While x and y can be real objects, more abstract senses of "contained" could involve y as a "for- est fire" or even a "revolution." In these instances, x &gt; size y is plausible as an abstract notion: if some entity can contain a revolution, we might think that entity as "larger" or "stronger" than the revolution.</p><p>Error analysis: Examples 6-10 in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> highlight failure cases for the model. Example 6 shows a case where the comparison is non- sensical because "for" would naturally be fol- lowed by a purpose ("He drove the car for work.") or a duration ("She drove the car for hours.") rather than a concrete object whose size is mea- surable. Example 7 highlights an underspecified frame. One crowd worker provided the example, "PERSON stopped the fly with {the jar / a swat- ter}," where fly &lt; weight {jar, swatter}. How- ever, two crowd workers provided examples like "PERSON stopped their car with the brake," where clearly car &gt; weight brake. This example il- lustrates complex underlying physics we do not model: a brake-the pedal itself-is used to stop a car, but it does so by applying significant force through a separate system. The next two examples are cases where the model nearly predicts correctly (8, e.g., "She lived at the office.") and is just clearly wrong (9, e.g., "He snipped off a locket of hair"). Example 10 demonstrates a case of polysemy where the model picks the wrong side. In the phrase, "She caught the runner in first,", it is correct that she &gt; speed runner. However, the sense chosen by the crowd workers is that of, "She caught the baseball," where indeed she &lt; speed baseball.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related work</head><p>Several works straddle the gap between IE, knowl- edge base completion, and learning commonsense knowledge from text. Earlier works in these areas use large amounts of text to try to extract general statements like "A THING CAN BE READABLE" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gordon et al., 2010</ref>) and frequencies of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gordon and Schubert, 2012)</ref>. Our work focuses on specific domains of knowledge rather than gen- eral statements or occurrence statistics, and devel- ops a frame-centric approach to circumvent report- ing bias. Other work uses a knowledge base and scores unseen tuples based on similarity to exist- ing ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angeli and Manning, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2016)</ref>. Relatedly, previous work uses natural lan- guage inference to infer new facts from a dataset of commonsense facts that can be extracted from unstructured text <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angeli and Manning, 2014</ref>). In contrast, we focus on a small number of specific types of knowledge without access to an existing database of knowledge.</p><p>A number of recent works combine multi- modal input to learn visual attributes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bruni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Silberer et al., 2013)</ref>, extract commonsense knowledge from web images ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tandon et al., 2016)</ref>, and overcome reporting bias ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Misra et al., 2016)</ref>. In contrast, we focus on natural language evidence to reason about attributes that are both in (size) and out (weight, rigidness, etc.) of the scope of computer vision. Yet other works mine numerical attributes of objects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Narisawa et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Takamura and Tsujii, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Davidov and Rappoport, 2010)</ref> and comparative knowledge from the web ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tandon et al., 2014</ref>). Our work uniquely learns verb-centric lexical entailment knowledge.</p><p>A handful of works have attempted to learn the types of knowledge we address in this work. One recent work tried to directly predict several binary attributes (such "is large" and "is yellow") from on off-the-shelf word embeddings, noting that accu- racy was very low ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rubinstein et al., 2015</ref>). An- other line of work addressed grounding verbs in the context of robotic tasks. One paper in this line acquires verb meanings by observing state changes in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(She and Chai, 2016)</ref>. Another work in this line does a deep investigation of eleven verbs, modeling their physical effect via annotated images along eighteen attributes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gao et al., 2016</ref>). These works are encouraging inves- tigations into multimodal groundings of a small set of verbs. Our work instead grounds into a fixed set of attributes but leverages language on a broader scale to learn about more verbs in more diverse set of frames.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a novel take on verb-centric frame semantics to learn implied physical knowledge la- tent in verbs. Empirical results confirm that by modeling changes in physical attributes entailed by verbs together with objects that exhibit these properties, we are able to better infer new knowl- edge in both domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: An overview of our approach.
